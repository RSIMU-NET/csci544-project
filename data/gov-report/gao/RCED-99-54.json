The U.S. government is concerned that unemployed former Soviet Union weapons scientists pose a significant risk to nonproliferation goals because they may provide their weapons-related expertise to countries that are trying to develop weapons of mass destruction (known as countries of proliferation concern), criminal elements, or terrorist groups. It has been estimated that about 1 million scientists and engineers were employed in Russia\u2019s 4,000 scientific institutes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Public Law 103-87, \u201cThe Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1994\u201d made funds available for a cooperative program between scientific and engineering institutes in the former Soviet Union and the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) national laboratories and other qualified institutions in the United States. In response to the act, DOE undertook a program to curb the potential for proliferation posed by weapons scientists in the Newly Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union through the Industrial Partnering Program. The name of this program was changed to the Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention (IPP) in 1996. The purpose of the program is to stabilize the technology base in these countries as they attempt to convert defense industries to civilian applications. Immediate near-term attention was to be focused on institutes and supporting activities that would engage NIS weapons scientists and engineers in productive nonmilitary work. The program was expected to be commercially beneficial to the United States and the NIS. IPP was also expected to promote long-term nonproliferation goals through the commercialization of NIS technologies. While commercial benefit is a major emphasis of the program, the nonproliferation goals of the IPP program are the foundation for all program activities.", "In 1998, DOE initiated another program that has complementary goals and focuses on creating jobs in 10 cities (commonly referred to as the nuclear cities) that formed Russia\u2019s nuclear weapons complex. This program, known as the Nuclear Cities Initiative, is discussed in more detail in chapter 4. It has been estimated that Russia\u2019s 10 closed nuclear cities contain about 1 million inhabitants. This total includes the families of the closed cities\u2019 weapons scientists and support personnel, such as teachers and technicians. The cities are called \u201cclosed\u201d because access to them is restricted and they are geographically isolated. These cities have performed the most sensitive aspects of nuclear weapons production. Two of the cities, Arzamas-16 (now Sarov) and Chelyabinsk-70 (now Snezhinsk), are primarily research institutes, responsible for weapons design. The remaining eight were originally production facilities and are now involved in dismantling weapons and in securing and disposing of nuclear materials.", "The director of DOE\u2019s Office of Nonproliferation and National Security stated that the IPP program\u2019s main objectives are to (1) identify and develop nonmilitary applications for NIS defense technologies and (2) create long-term jobs for NIS weapons scientists and engineers in the high-technology commercial marketplace. DOE defines a weapons of mass destruction scientist or engineer as an individual with direct experience in designing, developing, producing, or testing weapons of mass destruction or the missile systems used to deliver these weapons. While not all workers on a project are required to satisfy the weapons of mass destruction requirement, the majority of the scientific personnel should have experience related to such weapons. The national laboratories, which supervise IPP projects are responsible for ensuring that NIS facilities and personnel were directly linked to weapons of mass destruction. The program focuses on preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons but also addresses certain aspects of NIS chemical and biological warfare systems. The program aims to use about 70 percent of its funding for nuclear-related projects and 30 percent for chemical and biological projects.", "An underlying principle of IPP is that the program is expected to have an \u201cexit strategy\u201d to limit U.S. government involvement. By serving as a catalyst to forge industrial partnerships between U.S. industry and NIS institutes, the program anticipated \u201chanding off\u201d commercial activities to the marketplace as they evolved and matured. In this sense, IPP was expected to provide the seed money that would lead to self-sustaining business ventures and help create a climate that would foster long-term nonproliferation benefits.", "The IPP program is one of a number of U.S. nuclear nonproliferation programs focusing on the NIS. According to DOE officials, the program is limited in scope and is not designed to address the total problem posed by unemployed weapons scientists. Table 1.1 provides information on the various U.S. nonproliferation programs focusing on the NIS.", "According to DOE officials, IPP complements these other programs. Department of State officials, who oversee the U.S. portion of the International Science and Technology Center (ISTC) program, which also provides funds to NIS weapons scientists, said the two programs share similar objectives and can have a mutually beneficial effect. The programs do have some important differences. For example, ISTC is a multilateral program, funded by several countries and organizations, while IPP is a bilateral program, funded solely by the United States.

Each laboratory also has an IPP program manager who monitors the laboratory\u2019s IPP projects. An interlaboratory board was established in 1994 to coordinate, review, and facilitate the activities of the national laboratories and provide recommendations to DOE headquarters on the execution of the IPP program.

IPP\u2019s former program director told us the program\u2019s first priority was to initiate immediate projects at key NIS institutes to stabilize personnel who were facing the threat of economic dislocation. The idea was to get as many projects as possible under way in as short a time as possible. He noted that a key element in selecting early projects was to learn as much about the facilities and personnel as possible to promote and increase transparency at the NIS weapons institutes.

Furthermore, the former program director noted that DOE management did not provide adequate support services, failed to recognize the program\u2019s successes, and was unwilling to support budget levels consistent with DOE\u2019s original commitments. He also noted that DOE management failed to address a series of problems with the State Department until irreparable damage had been done. These alleged problems ranged from broader policy-level issues to administrative matters, such as lack of support in processing country clearances for DOE visits to the NIS. The Department of State\u2019s Senior Coordinator for Nonproliferation Science Programs told us that constructive engagement between the two agencies ceased and employees of both became embroiled in personality conflicts.

Even if all of the funds destined for the Newly Independent States are not allotted for salaries, DOE officials said the funds are being used mostly to achieve the goal of stabilizing the institutes.", "At several of the 15 institutes we visited in Russia, we attempted to determine how much IPP funding each institute received and how the funding was allocated at each institute. Although we were not usually provided with documentation to review, in general, Russian officials told us that the funds received by the institutes went for taxes, administrative and overhead costs, and salaries. An analysis of the information provided to us indicated that the amount of IPP funding reaching weapons scientists and technicians at the institutes varied. For example, we were told at one institute that none of the IPP funds went for salaries; instead, the funds were used for overhead, travel, computers, and Internet access. (See app. IV for additional information on how funding was allocated at Russian scientific institutes).", "We also met with the director of a Russian institute who was visiting the United States and participated in the IPP program. He told us that he did not receive the amount of funding that DOE\u2019s information showed going to his institute. Our review of the project found that (1) DOE\u2019s information was inaccurate, (2) laboratory officials responsible for the project did not know how much went to the institute, and (3) half of the funds allocated to the Russian institute went to a U.S. company instead. We discussed this project with DOE officials. They told us that they investigated the case, with the assistance of their General Counsel, because of the concerns we raised. DOE found that a number of actions occurred during the course of the project that were contrary to IPP policies and practices and said that they will not be allowed to recur. A discussion of this IPP project follows: DOE\u2019s IPP database showed that the N.N. Andreyev Acoustics Institute, in Moscow, received $68,200 of the $99,700 spent for the demonstration of an acoustic nozzle developed at the institute. However, the director of the institute told us that the institute actually received $27,000. According to the director, about 40 percent of the $27,000 was allocated for the salaries of scientists and others participating in the project. For example, the Russian inventor of the nozzle received $5,000 (equal to about 50 months\u2019 salary), or about 5 percent of all IPP funds spent on the project. The remainder of the $27,000 went for taxes in Russia and the institute\u2019s overhead.", "Records supplied by Argonne National Laboratory show that it paid out $60,000 rather than $68,200 in February 1998. The IPP program director at Argonne said that the IPP database showed $68,200 was spent for the NIS institute, but $8,200 of that amount was part of a $39,700 payment to Argonne, not to the Russian institute. According to the DOE laboratory\u2019s records, about $60,000 went to a bank account designated by the Russian institute. However, the manager of Argonne\u2019s IPP program said he suspected that the Russians received less than half of the $60,000. This is because Argonne transferred the $60,000 to a U.S. company that represented the Russian institute. Argonne officials, including the internal audit manager who reviewed the laboratory\u2019s records on our behalf, told us it was unclear how much of the $60,000 went to the Russian institute or its personnel.", "The U.S. company became the institute\u2019s exclusive agent for acoustic activities in North America the same week in February that the agreement with the DOE lab was finalized. The company provided us with documents stating that the Russian institute would receive $30,000 and the U.S. company would receive the remaining $30,000. According to a letter the company sent the Russian institute on April 20, 1998, the Russian share included (1) $4,368 for equipment and travel costs for two institute officials visiting the United States, (2) $2,500 for the institute\u2019s share of program and demonstration set-up costs, and (3) $23,131 for the Russian institute\u2019s costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some IPP Funds Are Used for Russian Taxes", "paragraphs": ["In general, representatives of the Russian institutes we visited said it was typical for a portion of the IPP funds to be used for taxes. The March 1998 DOE report to the Congress on Russian taxation of the IPP program described the tax situation for IPP as a problem, but not as debilitating.According to the report, there was no comprehensive mechanism that guaranteed tax exemption for U.S. nonproliferation programs, but a temporary agreement between the United States and Russia, known as the Panskov-Pickering Agreement, provided for deferring taxes. In many instances, however, Russians involved with the IPP program were not aware of the temporary agreement on income tax deferment and therefore did not contact the U.S. embassy to obtain it. In other cases, local authorities ignored the agreement, according to the DOE report. By July 1998, according to a DOE official, the Russian State Tax Service said that the agreement was no longer valid and all postponed taxes were due; however, the agreement was reinstituted in November 1998. A DOE official said that if the Russian Duma ratifies and the Russian President approves a bilateral agreement, signed by the United States and Russia in 1992 and providing exemptions from some Russian taxes for U.S. aid, then the tax deferments under the Panskov-Pickering Agreement may become permanent.", "Unlike the IPP program, some aid programs to Russia, such as the ISTC program, provide assistance that is exempt from Russian taxes because of an intergovernmental agreement.

In part, their views depend on the program\u2019s receiving adequate funding and accomplishing its mission. The former director of the program told us he believed the program could have ended after 5 years if it had received adequate funding. Originally, he anticipated that it would receive $50 million per year and become self-sustaining after 5 years.", "The current director of the program also told us in February 1998 that the program could end by 2006 if it was adequately funded at about $50 million per year. However, in June 1998 he said that funding the program and then terminating it after 5 years was artificial. He said the program should be continued as long as it is useful and meets a need.", "The director of DOE\u2019s Office of National Security and Nonproliferation said that she would like to see the IPP budget increased to $50 million per year. She believes that amount would be sufficient for DOE to make a significant impact on nonproliferation and commercialization and to end the program. She believes that adequate funding could lead to a phaseout by 2007. She noted that as DOE closes in on the 2000 time frame, it will be time to take a hard look at IPP, just as DOE will take a look at its other nonproliferation programs.", "The successful completion of the program depends on identifying the goals of the program and determining when they have been achieved. The director of the program is developing program goals and a strategic plan. In February 1998, the director said the program was changing how it planned to measure performance. He noted that the program has to be results oriented if it is to succeed. In the past, the most commonly used measures of the program\u2019s success included the number of projects, the amount of funds a project provided to the NIS, and the number of institutes engaged. These measures would continue to have some use, according to the director, but IPP must employ more meaningful measures that show results. Consequently, he was looking at measures such as the number of patents issued for projects or the number of companies created. The director said the strategic plan will include about a dozen ways to measure performance. As of January 1999, the IPP program had developed a draft strategic plan, which includes some performance measures. Possible program measures include, among other things, (1) the amount of funds spent, (2) the number of NIS employees engaged in the IPP program, and (3) the number of job opportunities created.

He indicated that there were too many ongoing Thrust 1 projects with little or no commercial potential. He said, however, that the limited commercial success of the IPP projects is not surprising in view of the difficulties involved in commercialization.According to the director, commercializing science and engineering projects is very difficult in the United States and much more difficult in Russia. He noted that commercializing a new specialty chemical or polymer can take from 6 to 8 years in the United States. IPP projects do not have to start at the Thrust 1 phase.

Reviewers from some agencies told us that many of the proposals they review contain limited information, making adequate evaluation difficult. The official from the U.S. Army\u2019s Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, who is responsible for reviewing biological projects, said his review is informal and superficial.

The Command began reviewing IPP proposals in late 1997 and focuses on whether a project is based on good science. The official also said (1) it is uncertain whether the Command is seeing all of the projects, since it evaluates only project proposals forwarded by DOE, and (2) there is no well established mechanism to find out which projects are approved or rejected. The Command expected, however, that DOE would reject any proposals to which serious objections were raised. Officials from DOD\u2019s Office of Cooperative Threat Reduction told us that the IPP review process is ad hoc and it is unclear how DOD\u2019s review fits in with other U.S. government reviews.

For example, the Soldiers and Biological Chemical Command raised concerns about two projects, one of which focused on the destruction of toxic material by means of ballistic missile rocket engines. DOD also objected to this project. Ultimately, the project was not approved, primarily because it lacked technical merit and commercial potential. National security considerations also entered into the disapproval. Additionally, the Command raised concerns about another project that dealt with cholesterol esterase activators. According to the Command\u2019s evaluation, the proposed work could be approved, but there were concerns because it had the potential to provide information that could be applied to enhance the effects of nerve agents on the nervous system. According to an IPP program official, the project was further scrutinized and found to have only peaceful applications. The Command researcher who raised objections to the project was never informed of its final disposition.", "IPP program officials told us that despite what the documentation in the project files showed, project proposals were routinely being sent to the relevant federal agencies for review. IPP officials responsible for coordinating the reviews of the chemical and biological projects said they give reviewers a chance to provide input before decisions are made, but all agencies are not involved on a consistent basis. For example, IPP program officials were uncertain about the process for distributing project proposals and obtaining comments from DOD\u2019s Office of Cooperative Threat Reduction.

Second, the IPP program will continue at other locations throughout the NIS, as well as the nuclear cities.

With the devaluation of the ruble in August 1998 and the partial government default, developing a U.S. program to assist in commercializing the nuclear cities will require adjustment. U.S. officials said that the outlook for foreign investment, whether from Western companies or international financial institutions, is not favorable in the short and medium term.", "According to embassy officials, the initial concept of the initiative was to increase investment opportunities and promote technological commercialization in the nuclear cities. Three major components of the initiative are (1) training, (2) refocusing the existing IPP program, and (3) facilitating access for multilateral lending institutions and private capital markets. The officials said the strategy was on target in mid-1998, but with the changes in the economic and political landscape, \u201cthe reality is that a program based primarily on promoting investment in Russia\u2019s closed cities has very poor short-term prospects and needs a bridging strategy until the situation improves.\u201d", "According to these officials, one important element in planning the initiative has been the assumption that Russian banks would support projects by providing small to medium-sized loans. However, the entire Russian banking system has collapsed, and there is no indication the situation will return to normal in the short term. The ability of Russian banks to support job creation in the nuclear cities by creating lending opportunities and investing has thus been severely curtailed. A number of banks are in financial difficulty and will likely not survive without a government bailout. U.S. officials have cautioned that \u201ccare should be taken in transferring funds to any project in Russia lest the money be swallowed up in a bankrupt financial institution.\u201d U.S. officials also referred to problems with the Russian tax structure. \u201cTax and customs problems have been especially detrimental to U.S. assistance programs and  could be another casualty of Russia\u2019s dysfunctional tax structure\u201d if the Russian government does not make improvements. Another concern is limited access to the nuclear cities. Without sufficient access, accountability, and transparency, there is a danger that the assistance will never go to the targeted areas. Access problems may continue because Russia\u2019s Federal Security Bureau may view this program as an intelligence-gathering effort. Officials from Sarov\u2019s All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics told us that the Nuclear Cities Initiative can help, but it will be difficult to attract commercial partners to a city located behind a fence. The city has been isolated for over 40 years and it is not practical to think that conditions can be changed overnight; transition must occur on a step-by-step basis.", "Still another challenge to implementing the initiative is the limit on intellectual property rights accorded to Russian researchers, according to DOE officials. As the IPP program is structured, the United States has worldwide intellectual property rights except in the NIS; however, the Russian collaborators may find their intellectual property rights to be of dubious value in a country that does not have the entrepreneurial capital to commercialize their ideas. Therefore, if the Russian intellectual property rights under the Nuclear Cities Initiative are also limited to the NIS, they may not be considered very valuable.", "According to U.S. embassy officials, the banking issues, the poor prospects for foreign investment, the taxes on U.S. assistance, the potential restrictions on access to the nuclear cities, and concerns about intellectual property rights are some of the reasons that the program should be redirected in the short term from promoting investment to establishing the building blocks to attract financial resources when the Russian economy stabilizes.

The program appears to be at a crossroads, requiring DOE to determine whether it will simply provide short-term financial assistance or will serve the longer-term nonproliferation goal of directing former weapons scientists into sustainable commercial activities. The program\u2019s long-term goal presents a much more difficult challenge than providing short-term assistance. Furthermore, given the economic situation in Russia, this goal may never be realized for the majority of IPP projects. As we noted earlier, over 80 percent of IPP projects are still in the Thrust 1 stage.", "While the program has needed\u2014and benefited from\u2014the support provided by DOE\u2019s national laboratories, we believe that it is time to reassess the laboratories\u2019 future role, particularly if the focus of the program is to commercialize projects and thereby provide for the long-term employment of NIS weapons scientists. While the national laboratories possess technical skills and have made great strides in helping to \u201copen up\u201d NIS institutes, they have, by their own admission, limited expertise in commercial market activities. In addition, the high proportion of funding\u2014about 63 percent\u2014going to the U.S. national laboratories and to support U.S. industry\u2019s participation in the program\u2014does not seem consistent with the program\u2019s goal of supplementing the salaries of NIS former weapons scientists.", "The IPP program has established hundreds of projects at many institutes throughout the NIS. It is uncertain, however, to what extent IPP funds have focused on the most critical scientific institutes and targeted the most important weapons scientists. Our review showed that the national laboratory officials who monitor the projects were frequently uncertain about the number of weapons scientists employed and their background. In fact, some of the institutes we visited did not work on weapons of mass destruction or have any clear defense orientation. We believe that program officials could conduct a more thorough review of these institutes to better ensure that program funds are being focused on the most important facilities and personnel. In addition, more careful monitoring of funds disbursed to Russian and other NIS institutes would ensure greater accountability for these funds. Furthermore, IPP\u2019s program guidance is unclear as to whether assistance should focus on previously employed weapons scientists and/or scientists currently working on weapons programs. As a result, U.S. funds are supplementing the salaries of scientists working on Russia\u2019s weapons of mass destruction programs.", "Ensuring that IPP projects are consistent with U.S. national security interests is essential to safeguarding sensitive technologies. Some of the projects related to weapons, particularly the chemical and biological projects, could have dual-use implications. Although the projects were reviewed by U.S. government officials, the emphasis of their reviews appeared to be to ensure that they were \u201cgood science.\u201d Furthermore, some IPP chemical and biological projects were apparently given cursory reviews by some key reviewing officials. More rigorous and systematic reviews of all IPP projects would provide greater assurance that U.S. national security concerns are being carefully considered.", "The IPP program has not demonstrated significant progress toward its longer-term nonproliferation goal of directing NIS weapons scientists from defense work to self-sustaining commercial employment. This goal would be difficult to achieve under any circumstances but is made more difficult by the deteriorating economic conditions in Russia. The program has evolved into a longer-term effort than was initially envisioned, and it is unclear when the program is scheduled to end. While DOE has claimed from the outset that the program has an exit strategy, or end point, it is unclear how that strategy is being implemented. DOE officials provided differing time frames for phasing out the program, and measures of the program\u2019s success are lacking. Given the unique nature of the program, a strategic plan is needed that, to the extent possible, links its goals, costs, performance measures, and time frames. Program officials told us that they are finalizing such a plan.", "Successfully implementing the Nuclear Cities Initiative, a major economic development effort, is a daunting challenge considering the dire economic conditions in Russia, including the all but complete collapse of its banking system. The 10 nuclear cities are in remote locations and access to them is restricted. Attracting investors to these locations and finding customers to purchase whatever products or services are produced will prove to be major challenges. Given these problems and the limited commercial success evidenced in the IPP program, we believe that the Nuclear Cities Initiative is likely to be a subsidy program for many years, rather than a stimulus for economic development. In addition, we question whether DOE possesses the expertise needed to develop market-based economies in a formerly closed society. At a minimum, DOE will have to work in partnership with other federal and international economic development agencies and private industry.
