AOC\u2019s acquisition approach to the building\u2019s renewal  involves its contracting with an architect, construction manager, and  construction contractor, each of whom produced separate estimates.  These estimates have a limited degree of independence because they  were conducted for the same program office and focus only on the  proposed contractor cost.

During the course of our review, AOC conducted a risk  and uncertainty analysis in accordance with a key leading practice for this  characteristic.

Contract documents provide indications of  ground rules and assumptions affecting the project. For example, contract  specifications and drawings for the recently-awarded phase II work  describe assumptions pertaining to availability of funding for contract  options and accessibility of the site during the workday. However, we  could not determine if these represented a comprehensive assessment of  all ground rules and assumptions. According to the Cost Guide, because  ground rules and assumptions can significantly affect cost and introduce  risk, it is important that they are clearly documented in the estimate to  enable areas of potential risk to be identified and resolved.", "For the well documented characteristic, we determined the estimate as  having substantially met leading practices. We found, for example that  cost elements from the estimate can be compared to information in the  drawings and specifications that define the contract for the phase II  restoration.

While AOC  officials told us that its project staff and management communicate  routinely as part of their normal business functions, documenting  management briefings is important because some key personnel have  changed over the life of the Capitol Dome restoration project, which  originated more than 15 years ago.

We found, for example, that the estimating  software and database used to construct the estimate included standard  information, such as costs for labor, materials, and equipment. However,  AOC did not consider the actual cost of previously completed restoration  phases in updates to its estimate for the phase II work. While AOC used  information on the price it paid for certain items in the phase I restoration  work that are also part of the phase II project, it did not determine the  contractor\u2019s actual cost to perform the work. AOC officials said that  having information on actual contractor costs for items may be of limited  usefulness because market conditions and other factors determine what  contractors bid and AOC ultimately pays.

We found, in contrast to the approach it  took in developing the Cannon Building renewal estimate, that AOC did  not conduct a risk and uncertainty analysis of the Capitol Dome  restoration estimate. While AOC officials told us they have not conducted  a quantitative-risk and uncertainty analysis of the estimate, they said they  have taken steps to qualitatively assess and mitigate project risks. For  example, AOC structured the phase II contract solicitation to have  contractors include a base bid (phase IIA) and pre-priced options for later  stages (phases IIB and IIC) of the work. According to AOC officials, by  structuring the contract this way, AOC is protected from price escalations  affecting the future phases. In addition, AOC established unit prices and  quantity allowances for some restoration tasks that are of indefinite  quantity, such as repairing cracks. According to AOC officials, this will  help to control project costs because, while their quantity estimates may  be imprecise, knowing the unit prices associated with the work should  mitigate some cost risk. While these actions are encouraging, they are  not documented within the context of a quantitative-risk and uncertainty  analysis. As a result, we do not know how these actions relate to other  risk mitigation efforts that may have been considered and why AOC  chose these actions over other efforts.

The Cost Guide identifies 12 leading practices that represent  work across the federal government and are the basis for a high-quality,  reliable cost estimate. An estimate created using the leading practices  exhibits four broad characteristics: it is accurate, well documented,  credible, and comprehensive. That is, each characteristic is associated  with a specific set of leading practices. In turn, each leading practice is  made up of a number of specific tasks.

It should also completely define the program, reflect the current schedule, and be technically reasonable.  Comprehensive cost estimates should be structured in sufficient detail to ensure that cost elements are neither  omitted nor double counted. Specifically, the cost estimate should be based on a product-oriented work breakdown  structure (WBS) that allows a program to track cost and schedule by defined deliverables, such as hardware or  software components. Finally, where information is limited and judgments must be made, the cost estimate should  document all cost-influencing ground rules and assumptions.", "The Cannon Building cost estimate did not include all life cycle costs as AOC guidance did not require these life  cycle costs to be identified.

Therefore, the documentation should capture in writing such things as the source data used, the calculations  performed and their results, and the estimating methodology used to derive each WBS element\u2019s cost. Moreover, this  information should be captured in such a way that the data used to derive the estimate can be traced back to, and  verified against, their sources so that the estimate can be easily replicated and updated.

It did provide a reasonable  explanation for how the cost estimates were prepared, what type of data were used, and the basic estimating  methodologies indicating some step by step processes. The documentation provided consisted of tables of unit  values, quantities, and extended values. While extended costs were identified, it was difficult to follow the roll-up of  these costs. Without a copy of or access to the cost model, we were unable to verify the accuracy of escalation  calculations and we could not trace all of the logic from the source data to the resulting estimate. The calculations  and changes to the baseline were not well documented but subsequent data and explanations highlighted the  process for the changes. Additionally, soft costs and contingencies, comprising a substantial portion of total program  costs, were only superficially addressed. There was evidence of management approval of the estimate.", "The Capitol Dome cost estimate captures all source documents used. The cost estimate relies on a WBS and shows  how the calculations were performed. A cost analyst unfamiliar with the program could develop the cost estimate,  although in places it is not clear.

Costs are  presented in constant-year and then-year dollars.", "Estimating leading practice characteristic and rationale for assessment   Accurate  The cost estimate should provide for results that are unbiased, and it should not be overly conservative or optimistic.  An estimate is accurate when it is based on an assessment of most likely costs, adjusted properly for inflation, and  contains few, if any, minor mistakes. In addition, a cost estimate should be updated regularly to reflect significant  changes in the program\u2014such as when schedules or other assumptions change\u2014and actual costs, so that it is  always reflecting current status. During the update process, variances between planned and actual costs should be  documented, explained, and reviewed. Among other things, the estimate should be grounded in a historical record of  cost estimating and actual experiences on other comparable programs.", "The Cannon Building cost estimate included an uncertainty analysis indicating what confidence level the budget fell  within, which was greater than 90 percent. Additionally, in the absence of having the cost model used to prepare the  estimate, we were only able to validate the accuracy of a very small sample of WBS elements. Furthermore, while  the estimate documentation identified inflation adjustments, because of missing calculation and conversion factors,  we were unable to determine if the estimate has been adjusted properly for inflation. However, the documentation did  provide a discussion of what and how the inflation adjustments were applied.", "The Capitol Dome cost estimate did not include a risk and uncertainty analysis indicating what confidence level for  the estimate the budget was set at. The estimate is shown in constant-year and then-year dollars using indices for  inflation. The indices used to adjust for inflation appear to be out-of-date. The estimate has few errors. AOC updated  its cost estimate prior to beginning the project, but once the project began, AOC did not update the estimate. AOC  did not document variances between planned and actual costs. AOC relied on historical records and on an industry  database to support its estimate. The estimate uses an engineering build-up throughout, which appears appropriate  for this project.  Credible  The cost estimate should discuss any limitations of the analysis because of uncertainty or biases surrounding data or  assumptions. Major assumptions should be varied, and other outcomes recomputed to determine how sensitive they  are to changes in the assumptions. Risk and uncertainty analysis should be performed to determine the level of risk  associated with the estimate. Further, the estimate\u2019s cost drivers should be crosschecked, and an independent cost  estimate conducted by a group outside the acquiring organization should be developed to determine whether other  estimating methods produce similar results.", "The Cannon Building cost estimate includes analyses of sensitivity, risk, and uncertainty.

AOC has received multiple estimates from  different sources (architect, construction manager, pre-construction contractor) as a cross-check for reasonableness.  While these estimates are not necessarily outside the AOC program office\u2019s influence, they do appear to represent  independent estimates based on each company\u2019s interpretation of the project\u2019s requirements and helped to validate  the reliability of the estimates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Architect of the Capitol", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  We continue to believe that a quantitative risk and uncertainty  analysis enables more effective oversight than can be obtained by  taking a qualitative approach. A quantitative risk and uncertainty  analysis conveys the confidence level in achieving the most likely cost  and provides actionable information about cost, schedule, and  technical risks that cannot be obtained qualitatively.  2.  While AOC\u2019s contractors act independently, AOC\u2019s Project  Management Division is responsible for the estimates prepared via  contract, and AOC\u2019s Cost Estimating Group is responsible for  reviewing them. Because AOC\u2019s Project Management Division and  Cost Estimating Group staff are part of the same Planning and Project  Management organization, the Cost Estimating Group staff could be  biased because of organizational influences and unable to provide a  fully objective review of costs to the Project Management Division.   3.  While our leading practices do not specify target confidence levels,  experts we consulted with in developing our leading practices agreed  that program cost estimates should be budgeted to at least the 55  percent confidence level and potentially as high as 80 percent. While  AOC has good reasons for its interest in maintaining the project\u2019s  budget at a high confidence level, we believe that the confidence level  for the project\u2019s budget\u2014exceeding 90 percent\u2014may be excessive.    4.  AOC identified 60 risks to the project and modeled them in aggregate,  as opposed to individually, in conducting its quantitative risk and  uncertainty analysis. Modeling the aggregated risks precludes AOC  from identifying relationships among risk elements and determining  which risks have the greatest influence on project costs. We continue  to believe that modeling the risks in aggregate likely contributes to the  overly narrow range of estimated costs over the confidence levels,  and can overstate the effect of the risks.  5.  Our leading practices indicate that an estimate\u2019s documentation  should be detailed enough so that the derivation of each cost element  can be traced to all sources allowing the estimate to be easily  replicated and updated. Because some information was not readily  available in documents maintained by AOC, we were unable to  determine if the estimate has been adjusted properly for inflation.   6.  AOC has taken positive steps in conducting a life-cycle cost analysis  that considered fixed costs and ongoing maintenance costs to inform  the AOC\u2019s selection of mechanical systems for heating and cooling  the Cannon Building. However, AOC did not conduct life-cycle  analyses for other components of the project, such as the building\u2019s  roof and alarm system. This precludes AOC from capturing the total  cost of the project and evaluating design alternatives on a total-cost  basis.   7.  AOC takes positive steps to qualitatively identify risks and uncertainty  and assess sensitivity. While this analysis is useful in setting  contingencies and managing risks during construction, a quantitative  risk and uncertainty analysis enables more effective oversight  because it conveys the confidence level in achieving the most likely  cost and provides actionable information about cost, schedule, and  technical risks that cannot be obtained qualitatively.   8.  While AOC has used some information from completed phases of the  Capitol Dome\u2019s restoration project to inform development of the  estimate for later phases, not having information on actual costs  makes it difficult for AOC to assess the difference between the price it  paid and its contractors\u2019 costs to determine the estimate\u2019s  reasonableness.  9.
