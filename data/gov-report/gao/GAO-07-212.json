Enacted in 1970, BSA is the centerpiece of the nation's efforts to detect and deter criminal financial activities. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) play key roles in BSA compliance, enforcement, and data management. GAO was asked to describe FinCEN's and IRS's roles and assess their effectiveness at ensuring BSA compliance and efforts to reengineer BSA data management."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FinCEN and IRS have distinct roles, but share some responsibilities in implementing BSA. FinCEN's role is to oversee the administration of BSA by numerous agencies including IRS. IRS's role is to (1) examine nonbank financial institutions (NBFI), such as money transmitters and check cashers, for compliance with BSA; (2) investigate potential criminal BSA violations; and (3) collect and store BSA reported data by all financial institutions. IRS continues to face challenges in identifying NBFIs subject to BSA and then using its limited resources to ensure compliance. First, IRS has identified approximately 107,000 potential NBFIs, yet FinCEN, IRS, and others agree there is a portion of the NBFI population IRS has not identified. Identifying NBFIs is inherently challenging and made even more difficult because FinCEN regulations about who is covered are confusing, especially for smaller businesses. Second, IRS currently lacks, but is working to develop, a statistically valid risk-based approach for selecting NBFIs for compliance examinations. IRS only examines a small fraction of NBFIs, less than 3.5 percent in 2005, highlighting the need for building risk into the selection process. IRS is statistically validating a risk-based approach for targeting compliance examinations on certain NBFIs suspected of noncompliance. IRS's validation study is a step in the right direction, but IRS's approach will continue to have limitations because the study was not designed to be representative of all potential NBFIs. And lastly, IRS established a new office accountable for BSA compliance, and is working to improve examination guidance. However, IRS's management of BSA compliance has limitations, such as a lack of a compliance rate measure and a comprehensive manual that NBFIs can use to develop anti-money laundering programs compliant with BSA. Addressing program challenges, such as identifying NBFIs and examining those of greatest risk of noncompliance will take time and require prioritizing actions and identifying resource needs. However, FinCEN and IRS lack a documented and coordinated strategy with time frames, priorities, and resource needs for improving NBFI compliance with BSA requirements. FinCEN has undertaken a broad and long-term effort to reengineer, and transition from the IRS, all BSA data management activities. FinCEN, however, missed opportunities to effectively plan this effort and to coordinate its implementation with IRS. For example, FinCEN began making significant investments in information technology projects before a comprehensive plan to guide the reengineering effort was in place. When a key project--BSA Direct Retrieval and Sharing--failed, it jeopardized the future of the broader reengineering effort. After investing over $14 million (nearly $6 million over the original budget) in a failed project, FinCEN is now reassessing BSA Direct but does not yet have a plan for moving forward with the broader effort to reengineer BSA data management activities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Criminals frequently use the financial system in attempts to conceal illegal  or untaxed proceeds from a variety of activities, including narcotics  trafficking, arms trafficking, extortion, and public corruption.

For example, they may use third-party nominees,  currency, wire transfers, multiple bank accounts, or international \u201ctax  havens\u201d to avoid detection. Attempts to convert criminal income into  legitimate assets or conceal the use of legitimate assets in criminal activity  jeopardize not only the security of our financial system but also our  national security.", "The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) establishes the framework used to combat  these activities and prevent the exploitation of our financial system.

Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks,  Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act, which, among other things,  amended BSA and expanded the number of industries subject to BSA  regulation. Title III of the act expanded BSA powers to combat terrorist  financing and required financial institutions to establish proactive anti- money laundering programs. In addition, the act expanded reporting  requirements and allowed the records and reports collected under BSA to  be used in the conduct of intelligence or counterintelligence activities and  to protect against international terrorism.", "The BSA framework focuses on financial institutions\u2019 record keeping and  reporting requirements to create a paper trail of financial transactions that  federal agencies can trace to deter illegal activity and apprehend criminals.  Under the BSA framework, primary responsibility rests with the financial  institutions themselves in gathering information and passing it to federal  officials. \u201cFinancial institutions\u201d include both banking institutions and  NBFIs. Banking institutions include commercial banks and trusts, savings  and thrifts, branches of foreign chartered banks doing business in the  United States, and credit unions. NBFIs include MSBs, casinos, and some  credit unions. MSBs include businesses that transmit money, cash checks,  and engage in certain financial transactions. MSBs are the largest and most  diverse group of entities that qualify as NBFIs. Table 1 describes the  different types of entities that qualify as NBFIs not otherwise regulated by  a federal functional regulator.", "All financial institutions subject to BSA requirements must implement  internal controls, policies, and procedures; maintain records of  transactions; and file reports of cash transactions over the $10,000 dollar  threshold and suspicious activities. The USA PATRIOT Act required all  financial institutions to develop written anti-money laundering compliance  programs that detail internal policies, procedures and internal controls.  Each program must designate a compliance officer, provide ongoing  employee training of pertinent personnel, and provide for independent  reviews whose scope and frequency is commensurate with the risk of the  financial services provided.", "Registration, record keeping, and reporting are the core elements of anti- money laundering requirements for MSBs. Certain MSBs are required to  register with the Secretary of the Treasury and renew those registrations  every 2 years. In addition, MSBs that sell money orders, travelers\u2019 checks,  or other instruments for cash must verify the identity of each customer  and create and maintain a record of each purchase when the purchase is  cash from $3,000 to $10,000. Also, financial institutions and certain types  of businesses are required to submit reports on cash transactions over the  $10,000 threshold and transactions of a suspicious nature. Millions of these  reports are filed each year. For example, in 2005 over 16 million BSA  reports were filed by financial institutions. Certain civil and criminal  penalties can be levied against financial institutions for violating BSA  reporting requirements, with fines ranging from $500 for negligence to  $500,000, 10 years in jail, or both for certain willful violations. , Appendix  III discusses the compliance reporting responsibilities in more detail."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FinCEN and IRS Have Distinct Roles in Implementing BSA, but Share Some Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["FinCEN\u2019s role is to oversee administration of BSA government wide.

However, IRS and other knowledgeable  observers agree that IRS has only identified a portion of the population.  No recent studies have been conducted that estimate the total population  of NBFIs; however, a number of efforts have been made to estimate the  number of MSBs, the largest group of NBFIs subject to BSA requirements.  A 1997 study conducted by a FinCEN consultant estimated the existence  of approximately 158,000 MSBs. One IRS official within the Office of  Fraud/BSA estimates there may be approximately 160,000 MSBs. In 2005,  another FinCEN study estimated the population to be as high as 200,000.  Officials from FinCEN, IRS, Treasury, TIGTA, and Treasury\u2019s OIG agree  that IRS has only identified part of the NBFI population.", "Several factors contribute to IRS\u2019s difficulty in identifying NBFIs. NBFIs,  especially MSBs, are inherently difficult to identify because of the wide  range of sizes, structures, and financial activities they conduct. Unlike  traditional financial institutions, such as federally insured banks, many  MSBs are small, independently owned businesses in which financial  services are offered as a secondary business activity. For example, many  grocery stores, convenience stores, gas stations, and liquor stores would  be considered MSBs because they offer check cashing, money order, or  wire transfer services, even though the primary activity of these  businesses is the sale of consumer goods. In a 2005 report, the OIG cited  language barriers and the limited financial proficiency of some business  owners as reasons many MSBs are not registered,  and therefore have not  been identified.", "The OIG also found that regulations and guidance for MSBs can be  confusing and easily misinterpreted, thus contributing to the challenge of  identifying MSBs. The report states that the distinction FinCEN makes  between a MSB principal and an agent of that principal is not always  understood by the MSB population and is difficult to verify other than  through an on-site examination. Some BSA rules, such as the registration  requirement, are applicable to principals\u2014the entities issuing financial  instruments\u2014and some are applicable to agents\u2014businesses authorized  to sell the issuers\u2019 financial instruments. Another confusing aspect of the  MSB requirements is that businesses whose daily money services  transactions are less than $1,000 per day per person are generally not  considered MSBs. As with the agent exemption, the dollar threshold is  difficult to verify other than through an on-site examination. The OIG  found that FinCEN had plans to assess whether agents of MSBs should be  required to register; however, FinCEN has not taken action to implement  these plans. IRS officials in the Office of Fraud/BSA support a change that  requires all MSBs to register, regardless of whether they are principals or  agents, because it would make identification easier. FinCEN officials,  however, said that their first priority is to ensure that the current list of  MSB registrations is accurate. Therefore, FinCEN does not have a time- frame for revising MSB regulations and guidance, including registration  requirements.", "Identifying NBFIs, and particularly MSBs, is challenging and resource  intensive\u2014both FinCEN and IRS have responsibility in this area. IRS uses  CBRS, public and commercial databases, Internet searches, and the yellow  pages to identify potential MSBs. FinCEN searches past BSA reports and  gets referrals from other law enforcement officials about potential NBFIs  and MSBs. However, not all businesses identified from these sources as  potential NBFIs are actually subject to BSA requirements. IRS has  identified 107,000 potential NBFIs, but has not been able to determine how  many of these businesses are subject to BSA. Whenever IRS identifies a  new business it believes may be an NBFI, it sends the business a letter.  This letter explains that IRS believes the business is engaged in an activity  that qualifies it as an NBFI subject to BSA requirements. IRS officials said  they are uncertain about the effectiveness of this letter and that some  businesses do not reply. Further, these officials said often the only way to  confirm whether a business is subject to BSA requirements is to conduct  an on-site examination, a labor-intensive and time-consuming process.", "IRS officials in the Office of Fraud/BSA told us that accessing IRS\u2019s tax  return databases might help identify additional potential NBFIs. The Office  of Fraud/BSA is currently unable to use tax return information to identify  businesses that may be subject to BSA requirements because IRS is  prohibited by law from using tax return information for nontax purposes,  with only a few exceptions. The confidentiality of tax information is  considered crucial for promoting voluntary compliance by taxpayers, and  legislative proposals for exceptions have been strictly scrutinized by  Treasury before submission to Congress. IRS currently lacks empirical  evidence that would support making a case to grant an exception (for  example, evidence on the number of potential NBFIs that could be  identified from tax data but not from other sources), and IRS has not  decided whether it should pursue obtaining access in an effort to develop  this evidence. Appendix IV provides more detail on taxpayer disclosures  and the criteria the executive branch considers before submitting a  proposal to Congress for granting exceptions.", "In another effort to identify potential NBFIs, FinCEN and IRS have  recently agreed to a number of MOUs with state financial regulators to  improve coordination and information sharing. Almost all MOUs are less  than 2 years old, and according to IRS, FinCEN, and officials representing  the states that have signed MOUs, it is still too early to tell how effectively  they will be carried out. Successfully implementing these MOUs and  sustaining the partnerships they establish will be an ongoing challenge for  IRS, FinCEN, and the states involved. For example, states have differing  definitions and licensing requirements for MSBs, which can make it  difficult to ensure consistency in the reporting of information.  Additionally, IRS officials said that meeting the information-sharing  requirements in the MOUs is time intensive because it requires manually  gathering large amounts of information from different parts of the  organization. The benefits to IRS and the states, thus far, have not been  determined. IRS, FinCEN, and the states have only recently begun to  implement the agreements in the MOUs. Therefore, little has been done to  evaluate the usefulness of the information that is being shared.

A risk-based approach is  important for selecting NBFIs for compliance examinations because IRS  only has resources to examine a small fraction of NBFIs each year. For  example, in 2005, IRS completed 3,712 examinations\u2014 3.5 percent of the  107,246 potential NBFIs in its database.", "A risk-based approach uses statistically valid risk factors to select NBFIs  for compliance examinations. Statistically valid risk factors can be used to  better target examinations on those businesses that pose the greatest risk  for noncompliance with BSA requirements. As a result, IRS would devote  fewer of its scarce resources to examining compliant NBFIs. One  approach to statistically validating the risk factors involves testing them  on a sample of NBFIs representative of the population and determining the  extent to which the results correlate with businesses\u2019 actual  noncompliance with BSA requirements. IRS already uses a risk-based  approach when selecting individual tax returns for audit. Its approach  involved statistically validating a set of risk factors using a relatively small  but representative sample of individual tax returns. IRS now uses those  risk factors to select individual tax returns for audit from the entire  population.", "We, as well as OMB and TIGTA, have recognized the value of risk-based  approaches. Earlier this year, we reported that risk management, including  risk assessment, is a widely endorsed strategy for helping managers and  policymakers make decisions about allocating finite resources and taking  actions under conditions of uncertainty. OMB also recommends making  decisions based on risk assessments. As far back as 1986, we concluded  that BSA regulators would use their resources better by targeting  examinations on entities with a high potential for problems. In 2004,  TIGTA reported that a risk-based, data-driven process to select the  potentially most noncompliant MSBs for compliance checks could be a  more effective selection method than IRS\u2019s existing process.", "IRS\u2019s approach for selecting NBFIs for examination is based mainly on the  judgment and experience of IRS managers and examiners. Based on that  judgment and experience, IRS\u2019s Office of Fraud/BSA has developed a set  of risk factors that assist in prioritizing and selecting NBFIs for  examination. However, the judgment and experience of managers and  examiners is based on past compliance cases that are not a representative  sample of NBFIs. Further, IRS studied the risk factors to help develop  rules for case selection and used experienced examiners to score these  factors based on their potential for producing cases involving  noncompliant businesses. IRS has not conducted a test to statistically  validate these risk factors.", "IRS recognizes that its risk factors have not been tested and validated. It  has a research project under way to test whether the current risk factors  are more effective than chance at identifying noncompliant MSBs. IRS  selected a random sample of potential MSBs from CBRS. Then each MSB  in the sample was scored for risk of noncompliance using the risk factors.  Beginning in January 2007, IRS will examine each MSB in the sample to  determine whether actual noncompliance exists. The examination results  will be compared to the risk scores to determine the effectiveness of the  risk factors at predicting noncompliance. The results could also be used to  make improvements to the factors. The research project is slated for  completion in December 2007. If the project is completed on time, IRS  officials expect any changes made to the risk factors would go into effect  in time to guide the selection of cases for examination in calendar year  2008.", "IRS\u2019s research project is a step in the right direction. For MSBs in CBRS, it  will provide empirical validation for IRS\u2019s current risk factors or a basis  for improving them. However, this risk-based approach will continue to  have limitations, including the following.", "IRS\u2019s research study was not designed to be representative of all the  potential MSBs identified by IRS. IRS is testing the validity of the risk- based selection process by sampling from a subpopulation of potential  MSBs, not the entire population. The study samples from a list of 59,701  potential MSBs entered into CBRS in 2004 or 2005 because they either  filed BSA-required reports, such as MSB registrations, CTRs, and SARs, or  were named in such reports by third parties. However, the population of  potential MSBs that IRS has identified is larger. IRS has approximately  105,710 potential MSBs in the Title 31 database and is responsible for  determining whether all of them are complying with BSA. According to  IRS officials, IRS did not draw from the Title 31 database to conduct this  study because inconsistency in the quality and completeness of the  information it contains on NBFIs limited its usefulness as a reliable  source. IRS\u2019s decision to use CBRS as the source of the study is a valid  one. However, because the research study does not address the entire  known population, IRS will not know how useful the risk factors are for  producing cases within the segment of the population it did not study. IRS  does not have plans for validating the risk factors for the entire known  population of MSBs.", "IRS\u2019s risk-based approach to selecting MSBs for compliance  examinations necessarily ignores the unknown part of the population.  As discussed previously, there is widespread agreement that despite its  efforts to date, IRS has not identified all MSBs. As IRS uses new  information sources and methods to identify additional MSBs, the risk  factors may not take into account the characteristics of these previously  unidentified MSBs. The only way to ensure IRS is adapting its risk-based  selection process to reflect changes in the identified population of MSBs is  to continue updating its risk assessments.

In addition, as more types  of NBFIs are required to comply with BSA requirements, IRS will be  required to incorporate those businesses into its compliance examination  efforts.

Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code,  which prohibits IRS from disclosing returns or return information unless a  statutory exception applies, does not currently specifically allow  disclosure for Title 31 examinations.

According to Treasury, the burden of supporting an exception to the  section 6103 prohibition should be on the requesting agency, in this case  IRS, to make the case for disclosure and provide assurances that the  information will be safeguarded appropriately.

The principle vehicle for developing  these relationships has been the MOUs. These MOUs provide formalized  procedures for coordinating BSA activities and sharing information.

The IRS/State MOUs involve the coordination of examination activities  and the sharing of examination procedures, schedules, and lists of MSBs.  These MOUs are different from the MOUs between FinCEN and the states  because FinCEN\u2019s agreement involves FinCEN sharing analytical  information gathered from various regulators. By collaborating with the  states, IRS hopes to improve the quality and coverage of compliance  examinations and make better use of examination resources.
