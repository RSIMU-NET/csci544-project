To help states maintain their Medicaid programs and provide states with general fiscal relief, the Recovery Act temporarily increased the federal share of Medicaid funding for states. The federal funding states receive for Medicaid is determined by a statutory formula--the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP). The Recovery Act also required GAO to study options for providing a temporary increased FMAP in response to future recessions. GAO reviewed how past recessions affected states' ability to fund Medicaid, examined the responsiveness of past increased FMAP assistance to state needs, and identified options for adjusting the increased FMAP formula for use during future recessions. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed its previous reports on recessions and the increased FMAP and similar work from other organizations. GAO analyzed federal Medicaid data and enrollment data provided by state Medicaid directors. GAO also analyzed labor market data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, state revenue data from the Census Bureau, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's Coincident Indexes to assess states' ability to fund Medicaid during economic downturns. GAO identifies options for Congress to consider but does not make recommendations in this report."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Past recessions hampered states' ability to fund increased Medicaid enrollment and maintain existing services. Both the 2001 and 2007 recessions resulted in increased Medicaid enrollment and decreased revenues, though states' experiences varied. During the 2007 recession, total state tax revenues declined by 10.2 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2009, with individual state experiences varying. For example, North Dakota had a revenue increase of 6.9 percent while Arizona had a decline of 23.1 percent. In addition, the effect of increased Medicaid enrollment and decreased revenues persisted after the recessions ended, causing states to further adjust their Medicaid programs. The increased FMAP funds provided by the Recovery Act were more responsive to state Medicaid needs than were funds provided after the 2001 recession. Overall, the Recovery Act funds were timed for state Medicaid funding needs. Assistance began during the recession while nearly all states were experiencing Medicaid enrollment increases as indicated by rising unemployment and revenue decreases as indicated by declining wages and salaries. The FMAP funds were targeted for Medicaid enrollment growth, but did not distinguish among states with varying degrees of reduced revenue in the allocation of assistance. The increased FMAP following the 2001 recession was provided well after the recession ended and was not targeted for state Medicaid needs. Past recessions offer options for improving the responsiveness of temporary FMAP increases to state Medicaid program needs. More responsive assistance can aid states in addressing increased Medicaid enrollment resulting from a national recession, as well as addressing decreases in states' revenues. GAO has revised a prototype formula for temporary FMAP increases it developed in 2006. The revised formula would address the timing and targeting of funds, and further improve the responsiveness of the increased FMAP funding. In particular, these revisions (1) use an automatic trigger to start the assistance program closer to the onset of a national recession, (2) add several quarters of transitional assistance before ending the increased FMAP assistance, and (3) target assistance by calculating the increased funding needed on the basis of the economic conditions of each state. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) agreed with the analysis and goals of the report while emphasizing that changes to the FMAP formula must be authorized by statute. HHS also stated that it is critical to align changes in the FMAP formula to individual state circumstances in order to avoid unintended consequences for beneficiaries as well as provide budget planning stability for states. GAO agrees that statutory changes would be necessary to implement any adjustments to the FMAP, but does not make recommendations regarding particular actions in this report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["From December 2007 through June 2009, the nation experienced the most  serious economic crisis since the Great Depression. This recession saw  overall economic activity in the United States decrease by 4.1 percent with  a loss of 8.3 million jobs. Although the National Bureau of Economic  Research (NBER) determined that the recession ended in June 2009, the  effects of the economic crisis remained for many states. As of December  2010, 25 states continued to experience unemployment rates above   9 percent, and more than 14.5 million people were considered  unemployed\u2014over one-third of whom had been jobless for 6 months or  longer. As in past recessions, as unemployment increased so did  enrollment in Medicaid, a joint federal-state health care program for  certain low-income individuals. The 2007 recession also resulted in state  tax revenue decreases, limiting states\u2019 capacity to maintain funding for  many programs, including Medicaid.", "The amount of federal funds states receive for their Medicaid programs is  determined by the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP)  formula. The FMAP is the percentage of expenditures for most Medicaid  services that the federal government pays; the remainder is referred to as  the state share. In response to the 2007 recession, and the recession in  2001, Congress temporarily increased the regular FMAP to provide states  with additional funding for their Medicaid programs. Following the 2001  recession, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003  provided states $10 billion in assistance through an increased FMAP. In  response to the 2007 recession, to provide states with fiscal relief and  protect state Medicaid programs, Congress provided states with increased  FMAP funding through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of  2009 (Recovery Act) which totaled an estimated $89 billion through  December 2010. Subsequently, Congress extended this source of funding  through June 30, 2011, subject to certain modifications, which will result  in states receiving an estimated $16.1 billion in increased FMAP  assistance.", "In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA),  as amended, was enacted. PPACA expands Medicaid eligibility to include  most individuals with incomes at or below 133 percent of the federal  poverty level (FPL) beginning in January 2014. As this provision of  PPACA is implemented, states will expand coverage under the Medicaid  program to an estimated 18 million additional people, which could  further affect states\u2019 ability to fund Medicaid during future economic  downturns.", "In a 2006 report, we provided options for Congress to consider when  assisting states in their efforts to meet increased Medicaid expenditures  resulting from recessions. We noted that among states, economic  downturns have varied widely in their onset, depth, and duration, and they  did not coincide exactly with national recessions. Likewise, increases in  Medicaid enrollment and expenditures were specific to individual states  because of differences in states\u2019 economic conditions, Medicaid program  designs, and health care costs. To address these differences, we noted that  calculating the increased FMAP using changes in states\u2019 unemployment  rates was a key variable because it reflected the potential for increased  Medicaid enrollment resulting from a state\u2019s economic downturn.", "The Recovery Act mandated that we conduct an analysis of past national  economic downturns, including the effects of the increased FMAP during  these periods, and that we provide recommendations, as appropriate, for  further modifications of the increased FMAP formula to make it more  responsive to state Medicaid program needs during such periods in the  future. GAO is issuing two reports to address this mandate. This report,  (1) describes the effect past recessions, in 2001 and 2007, had on the  ability of states to fund their Medicaid programs; (2) examines the  responsiveness of past increased FMAPs to state Medicaid program needs  resulting from the 2001 and 2007 recessions; and (3) identifies options for  adjusting the FMAP to make it more responsive to state Medicaid program  needs during future recessions.", "To describe the effects of past recessions on state Medicaid programs, we  reviewed prior GAO reports that examined the effect of past recessions on  Medicaid enrollment and expenditures, as well as the responsiveness of  increased FMAPs to state Medicaid funding needs. We reviewed similar  research by The Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, the  Urban Institute, and other organizations on the relationship between  recessions, increased unemployment, and increased Medicaid enrollment.  We analyzed Medicaid enrollment data from the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014the agency that oversees states\u2019 Medicaid  programs\u2014and used Medicaid enrollment data that we collected from a  survey of state Medicaid directors or their designated contacts in August  2009 and March 2010. We did not independently verify these data;  however, we reviewed all federal Medicaid data and survey responses for  internal consistency, validity, and reliability. On the basis of these  activities, we determined these data were sufficiently reliable for the  purpose of our report. We also analyzed state-level economic indicators,  including data on unemployment from the Bureau of Labor Statistics  (BLS), and quarterly state tax revenue data from the Bureau of the Census.  To compare the economic conditions across states, we analyzed and  compared the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\u2019s Coincident Indexes,  which summarize the economic conditions of each of the 50 states. We  obtained additional state-specific data from the National Association of  State Budget Officers (NASBO), the National Conference of State  Legislatures, and the National Governors Association. Staff from the  American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, the Center for  Studying Health System Change, and Federal Funds Information for States  provided additional information on the effect of past recessions on state  economies and Medicaid programs.", "To examine the responsiveness of past increased FMAPs to state Medicaid  program needs, we reviewed the relationship between the increased  FMAP and specific state circumstances by analyzing the Federal Reserve  Bank of Philadelphia\u2019s Coincident Indexes, BLS data on changes in  unemployment, and data on wages and salaries from the Bureau of  Economic Analysis (BEA). We assessed the reliability of the data we used  for this review and determined that they were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. We defined responsiveness in terms of two criteria: timing and  targeting. Timing refers to whether funds were provided when states most  needed them. Targeting refers to whether the distribution of funds  reflected different state needs for funding the cost of new Medicaid  enrollees attributable to the recession and maintaining their existing  Medicaid programs as states\u2019 revenues declined as a result of the  recession.", "To identify options for adjusting the FMAP formula during recessions, we  analyzed data from BLS, BEA, and the Census Bureau to assess the  revenue capacities of states to meet Medicaid program needs during  recessions. In addition, we reviewed our previous work on increasing the  FMAP in response to recessions, and investigated alternatives that would  make it more responsive to specific state needs. This report presents a  framework and discussion of key design decisions for a modified  increased FMAP formula. A subsequent GAO report will present additional  detail on a modified formula and simulations of its effects on the  allocation of assistance to states.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2010 to March 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The causes of national recessions, their depths, and durations vary  considerably. For example, the 2001 recession lasted only 8 months, while  the 2007 recession was 18 months long. The nation also experienced  different declines in economic activity, as measured by gross domestic  product (GDP), due to these recessions. For example, during the 2007  recession GDP decreased 4.1 percent whereas GDP decreased by   0.3 percent during the 2001 recession.", "Recent economic research suggests that while economic downturns  within states generally occur around the same time as national recessions,  their timing and duration can vary. States have different industry mixes  and resources, and they may enter a downturn before the national  recession begins or well after the recession has set in. The timing of a  state\u2019s economic downturn is determined by its individual economic  condition and revenue structure, which can also affect a state\u2019s capacity to  fund its Medicaid program. (See fig. 1 for differences in the timing, depth,  and duration of state downturns compared to the national recessions of  2001 and 2007.)", "Medicaid enrollment, and the state funding needed to support the  program, increase during and after national recessions, when the number  of people with incomes low enough to qualify for Medicaid coverage rises  as economies weaken. Researchers have estimated that for every   1 percent increase in national unemployment, Medicaid enrollment  increases by 1 million. Moreover, as the economy weakens, states have  reduced revenues with which to fund their share of the Medicaid programs  in place prior to the recession.", "Under the regular FMAP, the federal government pays a larger portion of  Medicaid expenditures in states with low per capita income (PCI) relative  to the national average, and a smaller portion for states with higher PCIs.  Use of PCI was, by design, intended to adjust for differences in state  funding ability. PCI also serves as an indicator for the number of people  eligible for Medicaid in a given state. The Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS) calculates and publishes the regular FMAP for  each state for each federal fiscal year based on a statutory formula that  incorporates PCI. The regular FMAP for federal fiscal year 2010 for states  ranged from 50.00 percent to 75.67 percent, and was calculated using the  following formula:  FMAPstate = 1 - ( (PCI state)/( PCI U.S. )", "PCI is a poor proxy for the size and cost of serving  states\u2019 poverty populations, which vary considerably. For example, the  elderly and disabled constitute about 25 percent of the Medicaid  population, but constitute approximately 67 percent of all Medicaid  expenditures. As a result, two states with low PCIs may have very different  proportions of elderly persons potentially eligible for Medicaid, and thus  very different amounts of Medicaid spending. In addition, the regular  FMAP for each state is generally published in the Federal Register a year  in advance of the federal fiscal year in which it will apply. For example,  regular FMAPs for fiscal year 2011 (which began October 1, 2010) were  published November 27, 2009, based on a 3-year average of PCI data from  2006 through 2008. This lag time between the publication and  implementation of the regular FMAP provides states with an opportunity  to adjust to changing levels of federal assistance. However, it also means  that the PCI amounts used to calculate FMAPs for a given fiscal year do  not reflect states\u2019 economic conditions for that year.", "To help states meet additional Medicaid program needs, and to provide  fiscal relief, Congress established temporary FMAP increases for states in  2003, 2009, and 2010. Increased FMAPs help states maintain their  Medicaid programs during downturns. They may also free up funds states  would otherwise have used for Medicaid and make them available to  address other state budget needs. The FMAP is a readily available  mechanism for providing temporary assistance to states because  assistance can be distributed quickly, with states obtaining funds on a  quarterly basis through Medicaid\u2019s existing payment system. In 2003, the  increased FMAP provided states with $10 billion in assistance. When  combined, the increased FMAP formulas in the Recovery Act and the 2010  extension provided states with an estimated $105.1 billion in assistance.  These formulas also incorporated three components for calculating the  increase: a component that protected states against decreases in FMAP,  an across-the-board component, and a component based on a state\u2019s  increase in unemployment. (See table 1 for more information on these  increased FMAPs for the 2001 and 2007 recessions.)", "The enactment of PPACA affects federal and state funding of the Medicaid  program. For example, PPACA establishes an eligibility threshold for state  Medicaid programs by requiring states, beginning on January 1, 2014, to  cover a new eligibility group of nonelderly, nonpregnant individuals at or  below 133 percent of the FPL. Consequently, the number of individuals  who qualify for Medicaid is estimated to increase by 18 million, according  to the CMS actuary. The federal government will pay 100 percent of the  cost of covering newly eligible individuals in fiscal years 2014, 2015, and  2016, with the federal match gradually reduced to 90 percent by 2020.  States will continue to receive the regular FMAP for most individuals who  meet the Medicaid eligibility requirements that each state had in place  prior to the enactment of PPACA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Past Recessions in 2001 and 2007 Hampered States\u2019 Ability to Fund Medicaid", "paragraphs": ["Past recessions hampered states\u2019 ability to fund increased Medicaid  enrollment and maintain existing services.

Revenue decreases due to the 2007 recession prompted 31 states to cut  health care programs by reducing or freezing provider rates or increasing  provider taxes.

According to NASBO, Medicaid is the  largest component of state budgets. Therefore, to balance their budgets,  states implemented a variety of actions to contain costs, such as modifying  eligibility criteria, limiting benefits, and instituting new or higher  copayments.", "Following the 2001 recession, which ended in November of that year, the  national unemployment rate remained above prerecession levels, peaking  at 6.3 percent in June 2003\u201419 months after the recession was declared  over.

As a consequence in 2002, states instituted  additional Medicaid enrollment requirements, such as waiting lists,  increased premiums, and changes in optional eligibility categories. In  some cases, a state\u2019s enrollment increase was due to policy changes.

(In other words, because states can anticipate assistance, the  assistance does not need to be received or \u201cin the pipeline\u201d in order to  produce the desired effect on state fiscal behavior.)", "Our 2006 report suggested a prototype formula for triggering and targeting  an increased FMAP that was based on increases in unemployment.  Although unemployment increases in many states typically lag behind the  onset of a national recession, our prototype formula considered that states  had budget resources and financial management techniques to temporarily  sustain them for a year or two with downturn-driven increases in Medicaid  expenditures. However, the additional objective of responding to state  revenue losses makes a more timely response preferable. Other measures,  such as the decrease in states\u2019 employment-to-population ratio, could  improve the timing and hasten the provision of assistance to states during  a national recession. A trigger based on a change to this ratio could  further mitigate the lag time by including two quarters of retroactive funds,  similar to that provided in the Recovery Act. If targeted assistance was  triggered earlier, the overall amount of increased FMAP assistance would  initially be smaller, as most states show greater funding needs a number of  quarters after the onset of a national recession, when the results of  economic downturns\u2014increases in unemployment and decreases in  revenue\u2014are more widespread."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Determining When to End Assistance Is Complicated by States\u2019 Continuing Medicaid Funding Needs", "paragraphs": ["Determining when to end increased FMAP assistance to states is  complicated by states\u2019 continuing Medicaid funding needs. In our 2006  report, the increased FMAP prototype stopped assistance abruptly once a  threshold of states no longer showed increases in unemployment. This  approach did not allow states time to transition their Medicaid programs  back to their regular federal matching rates. As we noted earlier,  increased Medicaid enrollment and decreased revenue continued after  both the 2001 and 2007 recessions ended. Adding several quarters of  transitional assistance and gradually reducing the percentage of increased  FMAP provided could help mitigate the effects of a slower recovery.  Phaseout assistance such as this could be targeted to states that have  weaker economies and face larger losses. However, any transitional rule  for terminating assistance will be subject to complex considerations,  including assessing the competing demands for federal resources and  states\u2019 ability to cope with their economic conditions without further  federal aid. As a result, any transitional rule is likely to require several  options for proceeding that are based on several factors, including  economic circumstances and congressional decision making."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accounting for Medicaid Enrollment Increases as Well as State Revenue Losses Could Further Improve Targeting", "paragraphs": ["States\u2019 efforts to fund Medicaid during an economic downturn have two  main challenges: (1) financing increased enrollment, and (2) replacing  revenues lost as a result of the recession. In our 2006 report, the prototype  formula accounted for the increases in enrollment, but did not provide for  states\u2019 revenue losses. A more responsive increased FMAP would calculate  the increased funding needed on the basis of the economic conditions of  each state. To consider both increased enrollment and decreased revenue,  quarterly increases in each state\u2019s unemployment and decreases in real  wages and salaries could be calculated and used together as the basis for  targeting funds. Such an approach would target assistance to the states  with the greatest economic declines. States could then receive funding  based on two formula components:    each state\u2019s increase in unemployment, as a proxy for an increase in    each state\u2019s decrease in wages and salaries, as a proxy for the loss of  revenue.", "Improving targeting is essential to meet the goals of providing assistance  to states in an efficient and effective manner. Without specific measures of  states\u2019 needs, federal funds could be distributed inequitably and run  counter to the goals of providing assistance during a recession. A formula  with finely graduated adjustments to assistance can be an efficient   mechanism for providing support to states. States that do not yet show  increases in unemployment and decreases in wages and salaries would not  receive assistance until changes in these measures indicated an economic  downturn. For states with rapidly improving economies that show large  decreases in unemployment and increases in wages and salaries, the  quarterly assistance could be phased out to ease the transition for their  Medicaid programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, the Department of Health and  Human Services stated that it agreed with the analysis and goals of the  report while emphasizing that any changes to the FMAP formula must be  authorized by statute and implemented by the Assistant Secretary for  Planning and Evaluation in HHS.

CHIP is based on  federally funded allotments for each state that are subject to  reauthorization by Congress.
