Nearly 11 million of more than 24 million reported water beneficiaries and nearly 6 million of more than 10 million reported sanitation beneficiaries were in USAID's Middle East and North Africa region. USAID obligations of funds for water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) activities increased by approximately 82 percent from fiscal year 2006 to 2009, with the majority of funding supporting WASH activities in three USAID regions--sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, and Asia and the Pacific. In fiscal years 2008 and 2009, about $337 million and $495 million, respectively, of USAID obligations for water and sanitation activities was attributed to meet annual congressional appropriations directives that no less than $300 million be obligated for those years. In fiscal year 2009, about 80 percent of the attributed funds were obligated in countries that State designated as high priority. State has taken steps to develop a water and sanitation strategy. In 2008, State and USAID issued a joint strategic framework that, according to State, largely comprises the broad current U.S. strategy. State also identified its annual water and sanitation reports to Congress in 2006 through 2009 as containing elements of this strategy. However, the strategic framework and annual reports do not include specific and measurable goals, benchmarks, and timetables, which the Act requires and which are needed to measure progress toward achieving the overall U.S. foreign assistance policy objective. Further, State has not provided an assessment--also required by the Act--of funding needed to achieve such goals, benchmarks, and timetables. In fiscal year 2008, State began to designate countries as high priority for water and sanitation assistance, designating 36 countries in 2008 and 31 countries in 2009. Nearly half of these countries were in sub-Saharan Africa and more than a quarter were in Asia and the Pacific. State said that in making the designations, it considered USAID mission plans for water and sanitation activities. In addition, State's annual reports to Congress identify factors that are reflected in the high-priority designations, including two criteria specified by the Act: need for improved access to water and sanitation and the existence of conditions that would support long-term sustainable results. Additional factors reflected in the designations include consistency with U.S. foreign policy priorities and compliance with statutory directives. However, GAO found that State's high-priority designations excluded several countries where USAID had provided water and sanitation assistance and included one country where USAID had not provided such assistance. Moreover, the designations for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 are not linked to verifiable analysis. As a result, the basis for State's designations of high-priority countries is unclear."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that State (1) ensure that the strategy for U.S. water and sanitation assistance addresses all requirements, including goals and benchmarks, and (2) clearly identify, in its mandated reports, the basis for its designations of high-priority countries.

The Act supports  activities that (1) expand affordable and equitable access to safe water and  sanitation for underserved populations; (2) support the design,  construction, maintenance, upkeep, repair, and operation of water  delivery and sanitation systems; (3) improve the safety and reliability of  water supplies, such as through environmental management; and (4)  improve the capacity of recipient governments and local communities,  such as through capacity-building programs for improved water resource  management.", "In addition, the importance of access to water was recognized in  September 2000 with the ratification of the United Nations (UN)  Millennium Declaration, whereby many countries and leading  development institutions agreed to work toward meeting the needs of the  world\u2019s poorest people. Among the declaration\u2019s eight Millennium  Development Goals is that of halving, by 2015, the proportion of people  lacking sustainable access to safe drinking water from 1990 levels. In 2002,  the UN recognized the importance of sanitation with a declaration that  included the goal of halving, by 2015, the proportion of people without  access to basic sanitation, also from 1990 levels. A recent African  Development Bank study found that, at current rates of progress, these  targets for access to water and sanitation in sub-Saharan Africa will not be  met until 2040 and 2076, respectively.", "U.S. government water- and sanitation-related activities are funded mainly  through USAID and the Millennium Challenge Corporation. USAID  obligates funding for water and sanitation activities primarily in three  water sectors: WASH, water resources management, and water  productivity. While the majority of USAID WASH activities are funded  through accounts such as Development Assistance, Economic Support  Fund, and Global Health and Child Survival, USAID also implements some  water- and sanitation-related activities under the International Disaster  Assistance and Title II Food for Peace accounts. USAID categorizes its  WASH activities into two broad types of interventions:  1.  direct service delivery, such as providing community stand pipes for  household water and building latrines, and 2. institutional, policy, and behavioral interventions, such as improving  operations of drinking-water service utilities and improving household-  and community-level hygiene.", "USAID identifies accomplishments for its water and sanitation activities as  providing either access to an improved source or improved access.", "Access to an improved source of safe water generally refers to first-time  access to a source of uncontaminated water, while access to improved  sanitation generally refers to first-time access to a simple pit latrine, septic  system, or similar type of improved sanitary facility.", "Improved access to safe water generally refers to improvement of existing  access to safe water, resulting in access to an increased amount or better  quality of water. Improved access to sanitation generally refers to  improvement of an existing sanitation facility, such as construction of a  wastewater treatment plant for a public sewer system that had no existing  treatment plant.", "In fiscal years 2008 and 2009, Congress directly linked the annual  appropriations directives to the Act, requiring USAID to obligate at least  $300 million for such activities, with the additional requirement that no  less than $125 million of the $300 million appropriations directives be  obligated in sub-Saharan Africa. USAID interprets the directives as  allowing obligations for most USAID WASH sector activities and for some  water resources management and water productivity sector activities to be  attributed to meet the directives\u2019 requirements.

USAID further  interpreted the fiscal year 2008 directive as allowing partial attribution in  an amount proportional to an activity\u2019s direct linkage to WASH outcomes.  For example, if a USAID mission made obligations to construct a school,  including installing a public water tap and latrines, the mission could  reasonably argue that the funding for the water tap and latrines was  attributable to the appropriations directive even if other aspects of the  school\u2019s construction were not.", "Fiscal year 2009.

In contrast, the missions\u2019 plans in Ecuador and  Egypt, which were not designated as high priority, included a significant  number and range of such activities. For example, the Ecuador mission\u2019s  fiscal year 2009 plans included construction of drinking water supply and  sanitation systems, protection of watersheds, and management of water  resources. Similarly, for fiscal year 2009, the Egypt mission planned to  invest in technology to supply water for Bedouin communities and to  provide technical assistance to increase water use efficiency and  productivity, among other things.", "High-priority designations are not clearly linked to verifiable  analysis. The strategic framework and the annual reports do not include  evidence of systematic or verifiable analysis that State conducted in  examining underlying USAID missions\u2019 plans for water and sanitation  activities. In addition, the framework and reports do not specify the basis  for State\u2019s designations of high-priority countries. Although the strategic  framework and annual reports emphasize that missions may consider a  number of factors in planning and allocating resources for water and  sanitation activities, the documents do not identify USAID missions\u2019  processes for recording and quantifying the specific factors considered or  the relative weights given these factors and do not identify State\u2019s  consideration of the factors. A State official acknowledged that State\u2019s  review of missions\u2019 water and sanitation plans and activities generally are  not based on systematic analysis.", "In addition, we found that average percentages of USAID mission budgets  allocated for WASH activities did not reflect countries\u2019 designations as  high priority and that missions were often unaware of the designations.", "USAID missions\u2019 allocations for WASH activities do not reflect  high-priority designations. Among countries where funding attributable  to the annual appropriations directives was obligated for water and  sanitation assistance in fiscal year 2009, the average percentage of USAID  mission budgets allocated for WASH activities in high-priority countries  did not differ significantly from the average percentage allocated in non- high-priority countries. USAID missions in high-priority countries  allocated an average of about 3.2 percent for WASH activities, while  USAID missions in non-high-priority countries allocated an average of  about 3.1 percent of their budgets for such activities.", "USAID missions are often unaware of high-priority designations. At  missions in 11 of 13 high-priority countries where we conducted  structured interviews, senior USAID officials were unaware of, and had  not been consulted about, the country\u2019s designation.
