Mail volumes have declined over 20 percent since fiscal year 2006 and are expected to continue declining. To help its financial outlook, in March 2010, USPS presented a detailed proposal to the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) to move from a 6-day to a 5-day delivery schedule. USPS projected this would save about $3 billion annually and reduce mail volume by less than l percent. This proposal factors in widespread changes to USPS's workforce and networks. USPS has also asked Congress to not include language in its annual appropriation requiring 6 day-a-week delivery. As requested, GAO assessed (1) USPS's cost and volume estimates and the operational impacts associated with its 5-day delivery proposal and (2) the trade-offs and other implications associated with this proposal. GAO reviewed USPS's proposal (including its assumptions, methodologies, and conclusions) and other information from the PRC's 5-day delivery proceeding, surveyed postal employee and mailer groups, and interviewed USPS officials and postal employee groups. Because GAO previously recommended that Congress consider providing financial relief to USPS, as well as other cost-saving options, this report contains no new recommendations. USPS generally agreed with GAO's findings and provided additional context on its proposed change to end Saturday delivery."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["USPS's proposal to move to 5-day delivery by ending Saturday delivery would likely result in substantial savings; however, the extent to which it would achieve these savings depends on how effectively this proposal is implemented. USPS's $3.1 billion net cost-savings estimate is primarily based on eliminating city- and rural-carrier work hours and costs through attrition, involuntary separations, or other strategies. USPS also estimated that 5-day delivery would result in minimal mail volume decline. However, stakeholders have raised a variety of concerns about USPS's estimates, including, (1) First, USPS's cost-savings estimate assumed that most of the Saturday workload transferred to weekdays would be absorbed through more efficient delivery operations. If certain city-carrier workload would not be absorbed, USPS estimated that up to $500 million in annual savings would not be realized. (2) Second, USPS may have understated the size of the potential mail volume loss due to questions about the methodology USPS used to develop its estimates of how 5-day delivery may affect mail volumes. The extent to which USPS can achieve cost savings and mitigate volume and revenue loss depends on how well and how quickly it can realign its operations, workforce, and networks; maintain service quality; and communicate with stakeholders. USPS has spent considerable time and resources developing plans to facilitate this transition. Nevertheless, risks and uncertainties remain, such as how quickly it can realign its workforce through attrition; how effectively it can modify certain finance systems that cannot be changed until congressional approval for 5-day delivery is granted; and how mailers will respond to this change in service. Further, uncertainties remain as factors other than delivery frequency--e.g., price increases--can also affect mail volumes and revenues. USPS's proposal involves several factors that need to be considered. It would improve USPS's financial condition by reducing costs, increasing efficiency, and better aligning its delivery operations with reduced mail volumes. However, it would also reduce service; put mail volumes and revenues at risk; eliminate jobs; and, by itself, be insufficient to solve USPS's financial challenges. USPS's role in providing universal postal services can affect all American households and businesses, so fundamental changes involve key public policy decisions for Congress. If Congress decides 5-day delivery is necessary, then Congress and USPS could factor the savings into deliberations about what package of actions should be taken to restore USPS's financial viability. Conversely, if Congress maintains the mandate for 6-day delivery, Congress and USPS would need to find other ways to achieve equivalent financial savings, so that the package is sufficient to restore USPS's financial viability. This would likely entail difficult decisions with broad implications for USPS's infrastructure, workforce, and service. As GAO has reported, a package of actions by Congress and USPS is urgently needed to modernize USPS's operations, networks, and workforce."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) has a number of challenging financial  problems, and its financial condition is on our high-risk list. Over the last  4 years, mail volumes have declined by over 20 percent (from 213 billion  pieces at the end of fiscal year 2006 to 171 billion pieces at the end of  2010) because of the economic downturn and the public\u2019s changing use of  mail. USPS\u2019s financial condition has deteriorated, with cumulative losses  of over $20 billion in the past 4 years. In fiscal year 2011, USPS projects a  $6.4 billion loss and expects to reach its $15 billion statutory debt limit.  Additionally, its long-term outlook is poor. USPS projects that mail  volumes will continue to decline further in the coming decade, with  volumes in fiscal year 2020 comparable to those in fiscal year 1986,  particularly for First-Class Mail. These volume shifts are having a profound  impact on USPS revenues. According to USPS, it generated $1.80 in daily  revenue contribution for each delivery point in fiscal year 2000; but by  fiscal year 2009, that number had shrunk to $1.40, and by fiscal year 2020,  it could be around $1.00. These trends raise serious concerns about  USPS\u2019s business model, which has relied on growth in mail volume to help  cover costs.", "We have reported that restructuring USPS is urgently needed to enhance  its current and long-term viability. We reported that action by Congress  and USPS is needed on a number of difficult issues so that USPS can move  toward financial viability by reducing costs, increasing efficiency, and  generating revenues. On March 2, 2010, USPS released its Action Plan that  identified strategies for addressing its financial situation. The plan  included actions that USPS could take under its existing authority, as well  as seven key areas in which it would need legislative changes or support,  one of which was moving to 5-day delivery. Specifically, USPS asked  Congress to not include the language in its annual appropriations  legislation that requires it to deliver mail 6 days a week. Later that month,  it presented a detailed 5-day delivery proposal and projected this change  would save approximately $3 billion annually and would have a minimal  effect on mail volume. On March 30, 2010, USPS sought a nonbinding  advisory opinion on its proposal from the Postal Regulatory Commission  (PRC). PRC issued its nonbinding advisory opinion on March 24, 2011;  however, since our audit work was completed in early March, this opinion  was not included in this report.", "In 2010, Senator Thomas Carper introduced legislation, based on  proposals made by USPS that included a provision that would give USPS  authority to adjust delivery frequency. The recently issued Report of the  National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform also  recommended removing the 6-day delivery requirement. However, 6-day  delivery continues to be required in USPS\u2019s annual appropriations  legislation, and some Members of Congress have raised concerns about  eliminating Saturday delivery. For example, Senator Susan Collins also  introduced legislation in 2010 to improve USPS\u2019s financial situation and  stated that pursuing significant service reductions, including elimination of  Saturday mail delivery, was not a viable long-term solution to the  challenges confronting USPS. To assist the subcommittee in its work, GAO  was asked to review USPS\u2019s 5-day proposal and evaluate its related  analysis. Specifically, our objectives were to assess (1) USPS\u2019s cost and  volume estimates and the operational impacts associated with its 5-day  delivery proposal and (2) the trade-offs and other implications associated  with USPS\u2019s 5-day delivery proposal.", "To assess USPS\u2019s cost and volume estimates and the operational impacts  associated with its 5-day proposal, we reviewed information submitted  during PRC\u2019s proceeding to consider the proposal. This proceeding  included seven public, on-the-record hearings and generated thousands of  public comments, as well as testimony and input on the proposal from  mail users and interested members of the public. We also reviewed several  USPS plans, including its action plan; 5-day delivery proposal; operational  specific implementation and communication plans; and other financial and  operational reports. We interviewed officials from USPS, postal labor  unions, and postal management associations. We analyzed USPS\u2019s  estimates and the operational impacts of 5-day delivery, including  reviewing the assumptions and methodologies that USPS used as the  foundation for its conclusions and estimates for cost savings and mail  volumes. We also reviewed relevant congressional hearings and  testimonies, proposed postal reform legislation, and our past work.", "To gain additional insight into the financial and operational impacts  associated with USPS\u2019s 5-day proposal, we surveyed 65 stakeholder  organizations in the summer of 2010. These organizations included the  seven major postal labor unions and management associations and 58  mailing industry associations that either (1) had formally participated in  the PRC proceeding on 5-day delivery or (2) were members of the Mailers  Technical Advisory Committee (MTAC), a venue for USPS to share  technical information with mailer associations and other organizations  related to the mailing industry and to receive their advice and  recommendations on postal matters. While these groups represent major  segments of the mailing industry and their members generate most mail  volume, they are not statistically representative of all organizations in the  industry, and therefore our survey results cannot be generalized to the  industry as a whole. Finally, to assess the trade-offs and other implications  associated with USPS\u2019s 5-day delivery proposal, we analyzed the evidence  collected for this engagement and our past work on the need to  restructure USPS.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2010 to March 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives.

USPS is also required to  maintain an efficient mail collection system. These and related  requirements are commonly referred to as the \u201cuniversal service  obligation.\u201d The PRC has reported that delivery frequency is a key element  of universal postal service. Further, provisions in annual USPS  appropriations since 1984 mandate 6-day-a-week delivery and rural mail  delivery at certain levels.", "The frequency with which customers receive mail service from USPS has  evolved over time to account for changes in communication, technology,  transportation, and postal finances. As recently as 1950, residential  deliveries were made twice a day. It is useful to note that while most  current customers receive delivery service 6 days a week, some customers  receive 5-day or even 3-day-a-week delivery, including businesses that are  not open 6 days a week; resort or seasonal areas not open year-round; and  areas not easily accessible, some of which require the use of boats,  airplanes, or trucks to deliver the mail.", "Mail delivery accounted for nearly one-third of USPS\u2019s $76 billion in  expenses in fiscal year 2010. That year, USPS recorded compensation and  benefit costs of nearly $23 billion and 586 million work hours for its more  than 310,000 full- and part-time mail carriers. Delivery is labor intensive  and includes carriers manually sorting certain mail into the sequence in  which it will be delivered and delivering mail to, and collecting it from,  nearly 131 million residential and business addresses. Moreover, this  delivery network has grown on average by over 1 million addresses each  year over the last 5 years, resulting in additional personnel, fuel, and  vehicle costs. Declines in volumes, however, challenge USPS\u2019s ability to  make corresponding cost reductions because some activities\u2014such as  providing 6-day delivery\u2014continue regardless of mail volume.", "Former Postmaster General John Potter testified in January 2009 that 6- day delivery was becoming unaffordable and requested that Congress not  include the restriction in annual appropriations legislation so that USPS  could move to a 5-day delivery schedule. USPS had been unable to cover  its costs, many of which were difficult to cut, as mail volumes and  revenues were declining. USPS developed a cross-functional, internal task  force composed of experts across various operational areas to examine a  variety of topics, including the economic value, financial and operational  impacts, and business risk of eliminating a day of delivery. The task force  solicited input from the public, mailing industry, and postal unions and  management associations. Based on this work, the task force prepared  USPS\u2019s March 2010 5-day delivery plan, which was approved by USPS\u2019s  Board of Governors. Table 1 summarizes highlights of this plan. The plan  recognizes that certain customers may be negatively affected by the  proposed reduction in service; however, USPS believes the reduction is  necessary to improve its long-term financial viability. In a March 2, 2011,  testimony, the current Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe reiterated  USPS\u2019s position on 5-day delivery, stated there is no longer enough mail  volume to support a 6-day delivery model, and said that moving to a 5-day  schedule would strengthen USPS\u2019s future.", "USPS estimated that if 5-day delivery had been in effect in fiscal year 2009,  it would have realized $3.1 billion in net savings\u2014including $3.3 billion in  gross savings less $0.2 billion in revenue losses due to a slight volume  decline. Of these savings, $2.7 billion would have resulted from reducing  work performed by city and rural carriers. City carriers employed  specifically to handle delivery on the sixth day, as well as other part- and  full-time city carriers used to replace regular carriers on the sixth day,  would no longer be needed. USPS plans to achieve these work-hour  reductions by attrition, involuntary separations, or other strategies to  reduce work hours. Aside from these city-carrier savings, other savings  would be achieved by eliminating rural-carrier work hours that would no  longer be needed on Saturday, as well as other associated vehicle,  supervisor, and transportation costs.", "USPS\u2019s estimate of gross savings was based on \u201cfull-up savings,\u201d which  assumed that the transition to 5-day delivery, including the associated  operational and workforce changes, had been fully implemented.

Tables 2, 3, and 4 summarize USPS\u2019s gross savings, mail  volume, and net revenue estimates, including the supporting methodology  and assumptions.", "These assumptions, methodologies, and conclusions have generated a  significant amount of debate since USPS requested an advisory opinion  from PRC in March 2010. USPS is required to request a PRC advisory  opinion on a service change when USPS determines that there should be a  change in the nature of postal services that will generally affect service on  a nationwide basis.

During the PRC proceeding, however,  stakeholders raised a variety of criticisms about the assumptions,  methodology, and conclusions USPS used to determine its cost-savings  estimate. Exchanges have occurred between the stakeholders and USPS  about these criticisms. Our analysis of these exchanges and our  independent analysis identified a key area of concern that may have a  considerable impact on USPS\u2019s estimate of net financial savings\u2014how  efficiently USPS can absorb the cost of its workload transferred from  Saturday to weekdays.", "USPS assumed that most of the Saturday workload transferred to  weekdays would be absorbed through more efficient operations.  According to USPS, this assumption was based on operational judgments  that excess capacity in city-delivery operations would be used to  accommodate this shifted mail volume because, among other things, the  time associated with certain carrier activities (i.e., loading mail into  mailboxes) could be performed with greater mail volumes without much  increase in work hours. USPS also assumed that a significant portion of its  delivery operations would not be substantially affected because this work  must be performed regardless of mail volumes (e.g., driving the route).   USPS stated it expects that absorbing shifted mail volumes would raise  city-carrier productivity, and in doing so, would reverse the productivity  declines experienced from shrinking mail volumes. Specifically, USPS has  reported that city-carrier productivity has decreased in recent years as  mail volume has declined. USPS stated that in a 5-day environment, with  Saturday volume transferred to weekdays, higher carrier productivities  would be reached. The National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC),  which represents city carriers, expressed concerns that this higher city- carrier productivity may not be realized. Specifically, it stated that recent  route adjustment efforts have resulted in routes that have little or no  excess capacity to absorb the transferred volumes. If certain Saturday city- carrier delivery work hours were not absorbed under 5-day delivery (when  mail is transferred to other days of the week), USPS estimated the cost  savings would be reduced by up to $500 million. To the extent to which  USPS can absorb this Saturday workload, city-carrier productivity and  cost savings should increase. We believe that USPS could realize some  increase in city carriers\u2019 productivity under 5-day delivery, but the extent  to which such an increase would be realized and workload from Saturday  to weekdays would be absorbed between Monday and Friday would  depend on several factors. These factors would include how effectively  USPS implemented its 5-day delivery plans and managed its city carriers  and their workload based not only on 5-day delivery, but also on other  actions to increase delivery efficiency, such as adjusting delivery routes  and deploying flat-mail sorting equipment.", "In addition, the Greeting Card Association raised concerns during the PRC  proceeding about the compensation rates and attrition levels USPS used in  calculating its initial work-hour savings. USPS acknowledges it will not  achieve its estimated savings from 5-day delivery within the first year of  implementation, in part because some savings are based on realigning  USPS\u2019s workforce over time through attrition and other changes. USPS  can use workforce strategies to support its workforce transition, such as  not filling vacancies before implementing 5-day delivery or offering early- out retirement. USPS also has flexibility to reduce hours for different types  of noncareer part-time employees whose wages vary widely, but are  generally less than the wage levels USPS assumed in its cost-savings  estimates. The timing and amount of savings achieved would be influenced  by how these strategies were employed and when eligible employees  decided to retire."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Five-Day Delivery Will Likely Result in Volume Loss and Concerns Have Been Raised that USPS May Have Understated these Losses", "paragraphs": ["USPS and many others agree that 5-day delivery will produce some volume  loss as mailers and customers see service reduced with the elimination of  Saturday delivery. Concerns have been raised, however, that USPS may  have understated the potential volume losses based on questions about the  methodology USPS used to develop its estimate and the impact of other  factors that can affect mail volumes. During the PRC proceeding, for  example, some stakeholders raised questions about USPS\u2019s methodology  for adjusting mailers\u2019 estimates of how 5-day delivery would affect their  mail volumes. USPS adjusted these estimates in one direction which could  lead to estimates that would underestimate potential volume loss in a 5- day environment. For example    Example using USPS methodology. If a business mailer estimated (1) a  50,000-piece volume loss and (2) it was 50 percent likely to modify its mail  volume under 5-day delivery, USPS adjusted the mailer estimate and  incorporated a 25,000-piece volume loss into its analysis.", "Alternative methodology. If a business mailer estimated (1) a 50,000-piece  volume loss and (2) it was 50 percent likely to modify its mail volume  under 5-day delivery, it may have been more appropriate to adjust the  estimated loss in both directions. Under this methodology, the analysis  could incorporate losses of 25,000 and 75,000 pieces.", "Alternative methodology. Make no adjustments and incorporate the mailer  estimates at face value.", "Although USPS indicated that its method of adjusting mailer estimates was  a standard industry practice, decision makers may find it useful to have an  analysis that reflects adjustments in each direction or just takes the mailer  estimates at face value. In addition, some stakeholders expressed concern  about potential bias in USPS\u2019s mailer surveys supporting its estimate of a  0.71 percent volume loss resulting from a shift to 5-day delivery\u2014some  said that the questionnaire language elicited overstatements of volume  loss, while others said that it elicited understatements of volume loss.  USPS stated that its estimate likely overstated the volume and revenue  losses that would result from its 5-day delivery proposal because  respondents were asked about service cutbacks that USPS subsequently  dropped after conducting the survey. According to NALC, however,  aspects of the questionnaire language encouraged respondents to  understate the degree to which 5-day delivery would affect their future  mail volumes. USPS responded that the questionnaire was designed to  address potential biases and was carried out in a manner that avoided  them.", "In addition to these methodological issues, information collected from our  survey of mailer groups in the summer of 2010 suggests that these groups  are somewhat uncertain about how 5-day delivery would affect future mail  volumes. For example, when asked \u201cdo the members of your  organization expect USPS\u2019s proposal for 5-day delivery to affect the mail  volumes that they or their customers send?\u201d 51 percent of respondents  answered \u201cyes,\u201d 29 percent \u201cno,\u201d and 20 percent \u201cnot sure\u201d (see app. II for  survey results). Five-day service is only one factor among many others,  such as postage prices, the availability of electronic alternatives,  competition, the cost-effectiveness of mail, quality of service, and ease of  use that residential and business customers consider as they plan their  current and future use of mail.

Finally, USPS commented that a  change to 5-day delivery is needed because there is no longer sufficient  volume to sustain 6-day delivery, and that moving to 5-day delivery is one  of the fundamental business model changes needed to help it close the gap  between revenues and costs.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Postmaster General, the Chairman of the Postal  Regulatory Commission, and other interested parties. In addition, the  report will be available at no charge on GAO\u2019s Web site at  http://www.gao.gov.", "If you or your staffs have any questions about this report, please contact  me at (202) 512-2834 or herrp@gao.gov.

Much of this  information was submitted as part of PRC\u2019s review of USPS\u2019s proposal to  move to 5-day delivery. We also reviewed USPS\u2019s action plan entitled  Ensuring a Viable Postal Service for America: An Action Plan for the  Future; a 5-day delivery plan entitled Delivering the Future: A Balanced  Approach, Five-Day Delivery Is Part of the Solution; operational-specific  communication and implementation plans; and other financial and  operational information contained in USPS\u2019s annual reports, integrated  financial plans, and comprehensive statements. We also reviewed reports  from PRC, the USPS Office of Inspector General, the Congressional  Research Service, the Congressional Budget Office, and the National  Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform; relevant congressional  hearings and testimonies; laws requiring 6-day delivery; pending postal  reform legislation; and our past work. We interviewed officials from USPS,  including officials on its 5-day delivery task force, postal labor unions, and  postal management associations.", "In conducting our analysis of the estimates and operational impacts of 5- day delivery, we also reviewed the assumptions and methodologies that  USPS used as the foundation for its conclusions and estimates for cost  reduction and mail-volume impact. We reviewed the multiple exchanges  before PRC about issues or criticisms that stakeholders had raised about  USPS\u2019s assumptions, methodology, operational issues, and conclusions  and USPS\u2019s corresponding responses. In assessing the estimates  themselves and these various exchanges, we considered the following  criteria for conducting these types of reviews: the magnitude of criticism  on the overall estimate; the internal consistency; consistency with social  science best practices; the reasoning or support behind the methodology;  and the presence of agreement and/or disagreement among stakeholders.", "After applying these criteria, we further analyzed two issues that may  significantly affect USPS\u2019s net financial savings estimate\u2014(1) USPS\u2019s  assumption and judgment that most of the Saturday workload transferred  to weekdays would be absorbed through more efficient city delivery  operations and (2) USPS\u2019s methodology for estimating the effect of its 5- day delivery proposal on mail volume, including reducing mailers\u2019  estimates based on their responses to the question asking about the  likelihood that their mail volumes would change if USPS implemented its  proposal.", "We surveyed 65 selected stakeholders in the summer of 2010 about their  views on USPS\u2019s proposal for 5-day delivery, including implementation  issues, concerns, and questions; their views on whether the  implementation of USPS\u2019s 5-day proposal would affect mail volume and  mailers\u2019 financial conditions; and their overall position on USPS\u2019s 5-day  proposal. Stakeholders we identified included all seven major postal labor  unions and management associations and 58 mailing industry associations  that either (1) formally participated in PRC\u2019s proceeding on 5-day delivery  or (2) were members of the Mailers Technical Advisory Committee  (MTAC). MTAC is a venue for USPS to share technical information with  mailers and to receive advice and recommendations from mailers on  matters concerning mail-related products and services. MTAC members  include mailer associations and other associations and organizations  related to the mailing industry. MTAC organizations represent major  segments of the mailing industry and members of MTAC organizations that  generate most mail volume. However, MTAC organizations are not  statistically representative of all organizations in the mailing industry and,  therefore, our survey results cannot be generalized to the industry as a  whole. We received responses from five major postal labor unions and  management associations and 45 mailing industry associations, for a  combined response rate of about 77 percent.", "Our work to assess the trade-offs and other implications associated with  USPS\u2019s 5-day delivery proposal was based on analyzing the evidence  collected for this engagement and our past work on restructuring options  and strategies for USPS.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2010 to March 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Results of GAO\u2019s Survey of Mailer and USPS Employee Groups", "paragraphs": ["Tabulations of the 50 responses to our survey from five major postal labor  unions and management associations and 45 mailing industry associations  follow.
