PPACA prohibits  organizations that were health insurance issuers on July 16, 2009, or  sponsored by a state or local government from participating in the CO-OP  program. PPACA also requires that (1) governance of a CO-OP be  subject to a majority vote of its members;of a CO-OP incorporate ethics and conflict of interest standards  protecting against insurance industry involvement and interference; and  (3) the operation of a CO-OP have a strong consumer focus, including  timeliness, responsiveness, and accountability to its members. In  addition, PPACA directs CMS to prioritize the award of CO-OP loans to   (2) the governing documents  applicants that plan to offer qualified health plans statewide, plan to utilize  integrated models of care, and have significant private support.", "Consistent with PPACA, CMS established two types of loans: start-up  loans and solvency loans.", "Start-up loans cover approved start-up costs including salaries and  wages, fringe benefits, consultant costs, equipment, supplies, staff  travel, and approved indirect costs. After the initial disbursement of  start-up loan funds, subsequent disbursements are to be made  according to a disbursement schedule established in the loan  agreement between CMS and each loan recipient. Subsequent  disbursements are also contingent upon evidence demonstrating the  loan recipient\u2019s successful achievement of milestones also  established as part of the loan agreement between CMS and each  loan recipient. Milestones could include obtaining health insurance  licensure and submitting timely reporting information in the required  format. Loan recipients can coordinate with CMS to adjust the  disbursement schedule and milestones as needed.

Reasons for CO-OPs needing additional  solvency disbursements could include enrollment growth and higher  than anticipated claims from members. CO-OP requests are subject  to CMS review of necessity and sufficiency. Each disbursement of a  solvency loan must be repaid within 15 years of the disbursement  date.", "The CO-OP program is a direct loan program. For a direct loan, the  estimated long-term cost to the government\u2014known as the credit subsidy  cost\u2014is calculated as the net present value of estimated cash flows over  the life of each loan. Credit subsidy costs are estimated when the  present value of estimated payments by the government (such as loan  disbursements) exceeds the present value of estimated payments to the  government (such as principal repayments, fees, interest payments, and  recoveries). Credit subsidy costs are required to be covered by an  appropriation. Therefore, if CMS awards a $10 million solvency loan to a  CO-OP, the $10 million represents the payments by the government. If  CMS calculates the present value for estimated payment to the  government to be $6 million, the loan\u2019s subsidy cost would be the net  difference of $4 million and would need to be covered by the CO-OP  appropriation.", "To ensure that applicants met the conditions for participating in the   CO-OP program, CMS required applications for the CO-OP program  loans to include information about organizational structure and  governance, as well as provide bylaws, a business plan, and a feasibility  study. CMS and a contractor reviewed applications. The contractor was  responsible for evaluating applications and recommending loan amounts  and a disbursement schedule based on information in the application  package and supporting documents. When making the final decisions  regarding the loan awards, CMS officials considered the contractors\u2019  recommendations and other factors, including the size of the loan request  and anticipated results of funding the application. By December 2012, CMS had awarded CO-OP program loans to 24 organizations.", "Several laws had the effect of reducing the $6 billion PPACA originally  appropriated for the CO-OP program by about 65 percent and limiting  program participation. In 2011, two separate appropriations acts  rescinded $2.6 billion of the CO-OP appropriation. Additionally, in  January 2013, the American Tax Payer Relief Act of 2012 rescinded  another $1.3 billion of the unobligated CO-OP program appropriation,  leaving about $1.1 billion of the original $6 billion CO-OP appropriation  available for the credit subsidy costs of CO-OP program loan awards and   The American Tax Payer Relief Act of  CO-OP program administration.2012 also transferred any remaining appropriation to a contingency fund  for providing assistance and oversight to CO-OP loan awardees, which  essentially restricted CO-OP program participation to the 24 organizations  that received CO-OP loan awards prior to January 2013.", "One organization in Vermont was unable to obtain a license as a health insurance issuer  from its state\u2019s insurance commissioner.

For example, while issuers are no longer able to consider gender or  health status in setting premiums, issuers may consider family size, age,  and tobacco use. Also, issuers may vary premiums based on areas of  residence. States have the authority to use counties, Metropolitan  Statistical Areas, zip codes, or any combination of the three in  establishing geographic locations by which premiums may vary, known as  rating areas.a low of 1 to a high of 67.

Each metal level corresponds to a  proportion of allowable charges that a health plan is expected to pay on  average, known as the actuarial value. Health plans within a metal level have the same actuarial value, meaning each plan pays approximately  the same proportion of allowable charges as others. Plans from different  metal levels have different actuarial values and pay a higher or lower  proportion of allowable charges. For example, a gold health plan is more  generous overall than a bronze health plan. Actuarial values for health  plans under PPACA range from 60 to 90 percent by metal level as  follows: bronze (60 percent), silver (70 percent), gold (80 percent), or  platinum (90 percent).", "Issuers may also offer \u201ccatastrophic\u201d health plans to individuals under 30  and individuals exempt from the individual mandate. Catastrophic plans  have actuarial values that are less than what is required to meet any of  the other metal levels.
