Agencies continue to have shortcomings in  assessing risks, developing and implementing security controls, and  monitoring results.

These  control categories are (1) limiting, preventing, and detecting  inappropriate access to computer resources; (2) managing the  configuration of software and hardware; (3) segregating duties to  ensure that a single individual does not have control over all key  aspects of a computer-related operation; (4) planning for continuity of  operations in the event of a disaster or disruption; and (5)  implementing agency-wide security management programs that are  critical to identifying control deficiencies, resolving problems, and  managing risks on an ongoing basis. (See fig. 2.)", "Examples of these weaknesses include: (1) granting users access  permissions that exceed the level required to perform their legitimate  job-related functions; (2) not ensuring that only authorized users can  access an agency\u2019s systems; (3) not using encryption to protect  sensitive data from being intercepted and compromised; (4) not  updating software with the current versions and latest security  patches to protect against known vulnerabilities; and (5) not ensuring  employees were trained commensurate with their responsibilities.  GAO and agency inspectors general have made hundreds of  recommendations to agencies aimed at improving their  implementation of these information security controls.", "Enhancing oversight of contractors providing IT services. In  August 2014, we reported that five of six agencies we reviewed were  inconsistent in overseeing assessments of contractors\u2019  implementation of security controls. This was partly because  agencies had not documented IT security procedures for effectively  overseeing contractor performance. In addition, according to OMB, 16  of 24 agency inspectors general determined that their agency\u2019s  program for managing contractor systems lacked at least one required  element. We recommended that OMB, in conjunction with DHS,  develop and clarify guidance to agencies for annually reporting the  number of contractor-operated systems and that the reviewed  agencies establish and implement IT security oversight procedures for  such systems. OMB did not comment on our report, but the agencies  generally concurred with our recommendations.", "Improving security incident response activities. In April 2014, we  reported that the 24 agencies did not consistently demonstrate that  they had effectively responded to cyber incidents. Specifically, we  estimated that agencies had not completely documented actions  taken in response to detected incidents reported in fiscal year 2012 in  about 65 percent of cases. In addition, the 6 agencies we reviewed  had not fully developed comprehensive policies, plans, and  procedures to guide their incident response activities. We  recommended that OMB address agency incident response practices  government-wide and that the 6 agencies improve the effectiveness of  their cyber incident response programs. The agencies generally  agreed with these recommendations. We also made two  recommendations to DHS concerning government-wide incident  response practices. DHS concurred with the recommendations and, to  date, has implemented one of them.", "Responding to breaches of PII. In December 2013, we reported that  eight federal agencies had inconsistently implemented policies and  procedures for responding to data breaches involving PII. In  addition, OMB requirements for reporting PII-related data breaches  were not always feasible or necessary. Thus, we concluded that  agencies may not be consistently taking actions to limit the risk to  individuals from PII-related data breaches and may be expending  resources to meet OMB reporting requirements that provide little  value. We recommended that OMB revise its guidance to agencies on  responding to a PII-related data breach and that the reviewed  agencies take specific actions to improve their response to PII-related  data breaches. OMB neither agreed nor disagreed with our  recommendation; four of the reviewed agencies agreed, two partially  agreed, and two neither agreed nor disagreed.", "Implementing security programs at small agencies. In June 2014,  we reported that six small agencies (i.e., agencies with 6,000 or fewer  employees) had not implemented or not fully implemented their  information security programs. For example, key elements of their  plans, policies, and procedures were outdated, incomplete, or did not  exist, and two of the agencies had not developed an information  security program with the required elements. We recommended that  OMB include a list of agencies that did not report on the  implementation of their information security programs in its annual  report to Congress on compliance with the requirements of FISMA,  and include information on small agencies\u2019 programs.

We attributed this  mixed progress to a number of obstacles, including logistical problems in  issuing PIV credentials to all agency personnel and agencies not making  this effort a priority. We made several recommendations to the eight  agencies and to OMB to more fully implement PIV card capabilities.
