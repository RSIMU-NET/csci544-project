In addition, MFO civilian personnel, excluding support contractor personnel, were reduced from 63 in fiscal year 1987 to 49 in fiscal 1993, which resulted in further cost reductions.", "The primary reasons for the increased actual cost of U.S. participation in the MFO are increases in both military pay and the offset costs credited by DOD to the MFO for providing food, lodging, and base support to U.S. troops. While the U.S. authorized troop strength at the MFO decreased from 1,045 in fiscal year 1990 to 984 in fiscal year 1993, military pay raises increased the salary cost of these troops from about $31 million in fiscal year 1990 to $36.1 million for fiscal year 1993, and U.S. offset costs almost doubled from $3.6 million to $6.9 million, primarily because of changes in the Army\u2019s procedure for calculating these costs. According to Army officials, this procedure incorrectly included in the offset the costs of certain services not provided to U.S. troops by the MFO. Prompted, in part, by our review of the offset issue, DOD and MFO were able to agree on a methodology to compute offset costs for fiscal year 1994 and future years."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Views on MFO Operational Performance and Lessons Learned", "paragraphs": ["The MFO is widely viewed by United States and international officials as effectively performing its duties in a cost-efficient manner. This view is primarily held because of the sustained peace between Egypt and Israel, which has provided a supportive environment for the mission\u2019s success and for active cost containment measures. According to State, MFO, Egyptian, and Israeli officials, the MFO has helped sustain peace between Egypt and Israel by serving as liaison and monitor of the treaty provisions. According to many officials interviewed, the MFO operational success can be attributed to several factors, including inherited advantageous conditions resulting from the way the MFO was established, the Israeli/Egyptian commitment to peace, significant U.S. military and financial support, and financial co-responsibility placed on the Parties. As a result of the favorable circumstances surrounding the establishment of the MFO, particularly when compared to other peacekeeping operations, some officials believed that the MFO model may not be readily applicable to more challenging peacekeeping scenarios. However, the factors contributing to the MFO operational success may serve as lessons learned for future peacekeeping operations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The MFO Is Viewed as Effectively Performing Its Mission", "paragraphs": ["State, DOD, Israeli, and Egyptian officials all view the MFO as effectively performing its mission of monitoring, liaison, and reporting treaty provisions and violations. State Department officials view the MFO as an instrument of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East that should remain until sustained regional peace is achieved. According to State officials, the MFO is an operationally and cost-effective peacekeeping operation that has helped bridge confidence and communication between Egypt and Israel. U.S. Army officials, while viewing the MFO as operationally effective, have concerns about the level of U.S. participation, the operational impacts to the Army, and the lack of an end date. These officials view the MFO as an indefinite Army commitment.", "According to Egyptian liaison officials, the MFO has helped build confidence between the Israelis and Egyptians by supervising adherence to the treaty. The liaison system promotes mutual dialogue and has assisted in solving some challenges of both parties. These Egyptian officials, although agreeing with their governments support of the MFO, expressed concerns about the open ended term of the MFO and questioned whether the MFO could be reduced to an observer only force. Egyptian officials were pleased with the reductions in costs but would like to see additional cuts.", "According to Israeli officials, the MFO has been successful in supervising the conditions of the treaty and in building the confidence of the Parties. It is their view that the MFO works because it has effectively supplemented Israel\u2019s and Egypt\u2019s strategic interests by securing the provisions of the treaty and providing a large U.S. military role. Officials viewed the United States as essential to the MFO success and emphasized that any significant reductions in U.S. forces could send a signal of lessened U.S. commitment during current and future regional peace initiatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "While Effective, the MFO Model May Not Apply to More Challenging Peacekeeping Scenarios", "paragraphs": ["According to DOD officials, the MFO began under almost optimum conditions and was provided opportunities for success that are not typical of most peacekeeping operations. Consequently, these officials believe that the MFO model would not apply to more challenging and hostile peacekeeping scenarios.", "The MFO was preceded by a panoply of cease fire and withdrawal agreements, negotiations, and U.N. peacekeeping forces between October 1973 and March 1979. These activities effectively transformed the Sinai Peninsula from a violent battlefield to a tranquil state prior to the deployment of the MFO. Thus, the MFO inherited a peaceful operating environment. In addition, the MFO began with (1) a firm commitment to peace between the Parties, as indicated by a formal treaty of peace and a thorough Protocol; (2) an established geographic buffer zone in which to operate; (3) substantial U.S. government military and financial commitments; (4) a barren, scarcely populated operating environment; and (5) a largely U.S. Army managed logistics system.", "According to DOD officials, these conditions created an almost clinical environment for MFO operations. For example, the MFO buffer zone, zone C, is free from the hostilities of many peacekeeping operations. The operating area is large, stretching over 10,000 square miles, but is largely unpopulated. Consequently, according to DOD, any military or terrorist threat to MFO ground forces in the Sinai is minimal. These officials believe that this MFO model may not directly apply to an environment that is urban or densely populated with potentially hostile parties over which a central government would have little control and where urban guerilla warfare is a possibility. In addition, officials emphasized that the MFO always had a U.S. managed and designed logistics system with a direct link to the U.S. Army.", "The MFO compares best with a traditional U.N. Chapter VI peacekeeping operation responsible for observing and reporting as opposed to a peace enforcement Chapter VII operation. This is primarily because the MFO mandate is to supervise the security arrangements of the Treaty of Peace by observing and reporting violations and demanding rectification. The MFO was not intended to serve as a fighting force or to repel national or factional armies. According to DOD officials, the MFO strength lies not in its military capability, but in the commitment of Israel and Egypt to peace, and the political support of the participating states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lessons Learned From MFO Operations", "paragraphs": ["According to U.S. and international officials, while the MFO has been successful, there are several lessons that can be learned from its structure and operation. In terms of U.S. commitment and oversight, the MFO arrangement has an open-ended U.S. participation agreement, without a formal requirement for periodic U.S. reassessments, and has no formal executive board to oversee its operations.", "The positive lessons from the MFO are that it: (1) began with a detailed charter or mandate fully supported by all parties, (2) makes parties of the peace treaty financially accountable, (3) incorporated standardized and interoperable field equipment, and (4) has an active liaison system with the Parties.", "U.S. participation in the MFO does not have an end date or incremental drawdown provision. According to DOD and Army officials, U.S. arrangements in any similar future peacekeeping operation should include provisions for drawdown and eventual termination. Other participating developed nations have periodic renewal provisions in their participation agreements. Consequently, these nations formally renegotiate their participation with the MFO at specified intervals. In contrast, the United States does not have any renewal provision in its participation agreement, thus periodic reassessment is not formally accomplished. According to U.S. Army officials, there should be formal periodic reassessments of the level of U.S. military participation in the MFO, particularly in light of other global demands. According to these officials, over a decade of Israeli-Egyptian peace warrants such reassessment, particularly in light of growing military requirements elsewhere, and reduced budgets and resources.", "In addition, the MFO does not have any formal executive oversight such as a board of directors or an independent audit entity as discussed in  chapter 5 of this report. While the broad management discretion granted to the Director General by the Protocol has benefits such as cost cutting flexibility, a more formal oversight mechanism could strengthen financial accountability and deter misuse of expenditures. Thus, we believe that any future operation should include a formal mechanism for adequate oversight of the U.S. contribution.", "On the other hand, a positive lesson can be learned from the way the MFO charter is constructed. The MFO charter, unlike many peacekeeping operations, provides details regarding the responsibilities, organization, operations, military command structure, financing, and administration of the MFO. According to MFO officials, there are few aspects of the MFO peacekeeping tasks that require further expansion or interpretation by the military staff of the MFO. According to DOD and State officials, few peacekeeping missions have ever deployed with such a complete working document as the MFO charter. In contrast, DOD officials note U.N. mandates are often ambiguous and ill-defined, thereby complicating peacekeeping operations. These officials cite favorable political circumstances and the existence of an agreement between the Parties as largely determining the specificity and realism of the mandate and ultimately the success or failure of the operation. These officials also stated that where the United Nations has been given similar favorable circumstances for mandates and terms of reference deriving from a disengagement agreement between motivated adversaries, results have been favorable.", "Another potential lesson learned is MFO financing method. According to MFO officials, unlike other peacekeeping operations, the Parties to the MFO share in direct funding, thus each has a vested interest in cost containment. The financial arrangements also make the MFO directly accountable to the fund\u2019s contributors, resulting in a contractor-client relationship. According to MFO, State, and DOD officials, this arrangement is advantageous because it actively engages former adversaries in the financial planning of the peacekeeping operation.", "As for the contributions of the participating states, arrangements for external funding sources should be maximized while international interest is high. This could work to reduce the financial burden of the one-third assessment on the United States. According to MFO officials, the MFO waited several years before trying to recruit external donors, with only modest results.", "In addition, since its inception, the MFO has used a system of commercial procurement, contracting, and equipment standardization. MFO procurement emphasizes the use of local markets to increase competition and reduce costs. The MFO derives additional revenue from sales of used vehicle and excess scrap.", "Equipment standardization is also emphasized. According to MFO officials, the principle underlying MFO logistics was that to promote fairness and efficiency, each military unit, regardless of its resources, would receive the same type of equipment. In contrast, many U.N. peacekeeping operations maintain a variety of equipment and maintenance standards in different contingents. The sophisticated equipment in the observation posts, the vehicles, and the communications and mission-related equipment are all standardized and are the property of the MFO. According to MFO, this has been accomplished by procuring certain models of equipment from specific manufacturers, such as General Motors for commercial vehicles and Motorola for radio communication equipment. Standardization presents several logistical advantages: (1) maintenance is easier, (2) incoming battalions do not have to bring their own sophisticated equipment and vehicles with them and all their diverse maintenance problems, and (3) it reinforces the integrated appearance of the force. In addition, interoperability of communication and electronics systems is achieved.", "The MFO liaison system also serves as a model for developing peaceful relations and cooperation.

For example, until we began our inquiry, State was unaware of many details relating to the Director General\u2019s salary and benefits or other MFO expenditures made on his behalf. We also noted that MFO policies and procedures for designating dependents of MFO officials were changed by the MFO two times in 1992 and 1994. They were changed in 1992 to broaden the definition of dependent to include persons other than spouses, unmarried children, or dependent parents as dependents. In 1994, following the conclusion of our fieldwork, the policies and procedures were revised by the MFO to expand the definition of an authorized dependent. Specifically, the new regulation states that a person is an authorized dependent if he/she has been so designated by the MFO staff member and so approved by the Director General. While other members of the MFO may benefit from these changes, the MFO general counsel told us and congressional staff in February 1995 that the changes were made to accommodate the personal circumstances of the Director General, who was already receiving dependent benefits for individuals who were not his spouse or unmarried dependent children. In an August 10, 1994, letter to State, the Director General explained that housing used by the former Director General, who was a bachelor, was not suitable for his household and went on to explain the security and furnishing upgrades and improvements to his MFO-provided residence that were necessary to accommodate his household. He also stated that the MFO pays his dependents\u2019 elementary and high school fees and annual dependent education travel, a benefit that is available to all members of the MFO international staff.", "In response to our inquiry, State Department officials said that they were aware that the Director General had a nontraditional family and that some accommodation would be necessary in order for him to accept the initial appointment in 1988. However, they stated that they were not aware of the specific changes made to MFO policies to satisfy this accommodation, which had an affect on benefits and privileges. In view of the fact that the Director General has such broad latitude to modify regulations and procedures without external approval, we believe it is important for State to be aware of all policy changes that may affect costs.", "The Protocol to the treaty establishing the MFO does not provide for a governing body for executive oversight of the MFO, or an independent audit entity. It gives the MFO Director General broad management authority, with a requirement to report developments relating to the functioning of the MFO to the Parties.

In addition, annual budgets are submitted to financial contributors for approval. According to MFO officials, the U.S. government, as a participant, is on the \u201cboard of directors\u201d of the MFO. State officials agree that the statements at the Trilateral meeting, informal discussions, and site visits throughout the year constitute adequate oversight.", "However, we believe that the Director General\u2019s statements at the Trilateral meeting and informal discussions throughout the year do not constitute a sufficient oversight mechanism to prevent the potential misuse of U.S. contributions. In contrast, other international organizations have an independent governing body above the chief executive to oversee and approve operations and finances. For example, both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development have councils to perform oversight of their operations and serve as the highest decision-making bodies.", "The MFO also does not have an independent audit entity between the Director General and the external auditor to oversee the audit and report to management on its performance and results and the disposition of any recommendations resulting from the audit. The MFO Director General selects, directs, and receives the report of the external auditor, Price Waterhouse. In contrast, other international organizations we examined such as NATO, the Organization of American States, and the European Union, all have independent external audit committees that perform or oversee external audits and are independent of the governing body or chief executive.", "The lack of a fully engaged \u201cboard of directors\u201d or audit committee results in the Director General essentially having carte blanche authority to run the organization.

The FX is a self-sustaining consumer goods store that serves the MFO military and civilian personnel stationed in the Sinai. The MFO external auditor performs a separate audit on the FX account annually; however, State had not requested, obtained, or reviewed the reports resulting from these audits.", "Several weeks after our inquiry, an MFO official told us that the outstanding loan amount shown on the MFO financial statements did not agree with the outstanding amount shown on the FX financial statements. He stated that the FX financial statements showed that the FX owes a loan balance of $1.53 million to the MFO, while the MFO financial statements showed the loan owed to them was $1 million\u2014or $530,000 less. The official noted that the reason for the differences was that the MFO had written off $530,000 of the FX loan on the books several years ago because they had determined this amount to be uncollectible, which is in accord with generally accepted accounting principles. State was unaware of this transaction, although the MFO had reported the loan write-off in its financial statements for fiscal year 1985, the year that it occurred. Prompted by our inquiry and the improved financial condition of the FX since the loan write-offs, the MFO reinstated the loan write-off on its fiscal year 1994 financial statements, and the resulting $530,000 of income will be credited to the three contributing countries, reducing the U.S. assessment for fiscal year 1995 by $177,000.", "State officials noted that in the past they did not believe it was necessary to request the audit reports of the FX account because it is a separate, self-sustaining account, funded from sales to the MFO soldiers. However, we believe that the United States has an interest in this account because the FX was established through loans from the MFO operating funds, one-third of which is paid by the United States. Also, U.S. military personnel make up about half of the soldiers who use the FX, which has total annual sales of about $5 million and annual income of about $553,000. MFO officials stated that the FX profits are used to fund morale support activities for the MFO military personnel. If State had been receiving and examining the audited financial statement of both the FX and the MFO, it could have noted the improved financial condition of the FX account and could have taken appropriate action so that the United States could have realized the reduction earlier.
