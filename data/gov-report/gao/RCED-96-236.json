Within the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the agency\u2019s senior leadership has stated that peer review is an important mechanism for enhancing the quality, credibility, and acceptability of products that may ultimately form the basis of regulations and other key decisions by the agency. Properly implemented, peer review can also conserve resources by steering product development along the most efficient, effective course, thereby avoiding costly and time-consuming delays. EPA\u2019s current policy, issued in June 1994, expands on the agency\u2019s prior policy and practices. The new policy continues to emphasize that major scientific and technical work products should normally be peer reviewed. In light of the key role that peer review plays in developing regulations, you asked us to assess EPA\u2019s (1) progress in implementing its peer review policy and (2) efforts to improve the peer review process."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In accordance with scientific custom and/or statutory mandates, several offices within EPA have used peer review for many years to enhance the quality of science within the agency. In May 1991, the EPA Administrator established a panel of outside academicians to, among other things, enhance the stature of science at EPA and determine how the agency can best ensure that sound science is the foundation for the agency\u2019s regulatory and decision-making processes. In March 1992, the expert panelrecommended that, among other things, EPA establish a uniform peer review process for all scientific and technical products used to support EPA\u2019s guidance and regulations. In response, EPA issued a policy statement in January 1993 calling for peer review of the major scientific and technical work products used to support the agency\u2019s rulemaking and other decisions. However, the Congress, GAO, and others subsequently raised concerns that the policy was not being consistently implemented throughout EPA. The congressional concern resulted in several proposed pieces of legislation that included prescriptive requirements for peer reviews.", "Subsequently, in June 1994 the EPA Administrator reaffirmed the central role of peer review in the agency\u2019s efforts to ensure that its decisions rest on sound science and credible data by directing that the agency\u2019s 1993 peer review policy be revised. The new policy retained the essence of the prior policy and was intended to expand and improve the use of peer review throughout EPA. Although the policy continued to emphasize that major scientific and technical products should normally be peer reviewed, it also recognized that statutory and court-ordered deadlines, resource constraints, and other constraints may limit or preclude the use of peer review. According to the Executive Director of the Science Policy Council, one of the most significant new features of the 1994 action was the Administrator\u2019s directive to the agency\u2019s Science Policy Council to organize and guide an agencywide program for implementing the policy.", "The policy and procedures emphasize that peer review is not the same thing as other mechanisms that EPA often uses to obtain the views of interested and affected parties and/or to build consensus among the regulated community. More specifically, EPA\u2019s policy and procedures state that peer review is not peer input, which is advice or assistance from experts during the development of a product; stakeholders\u2019 involvement, which is comments from those people or organizations (stakeholders) that have significant financial, political, or other interests in the outcome of a rulemaking or other decision by EPA; or public comment, which is comments obtained from the general public on a proposed rulemaking and may or may not include the comments of independent experts.", "While each of these activities serves a useful purpose, the policy and procedures point out that they are not a substitute for peer review. For example, as noted in EPA\u2019s Standard Operating Procedures, public comments on a rulemaking do not necessarily solicit the same unbiased, expert views as are obtained through peer review.", "In order to accommodate the differences in EPA\u2019s program and regional offices, the policy assigned responsibility to each program and regional office to develop standard operating procedures and to ensure their use. To help facilitate agencywide implementation, EPA\u2019s Science Policy Council was assigned the responsibility of assisting the offices and regions in developing their procedures and identifying products that should be considered for peer review. The Council was also given the responsibility for overseeing the agencywide implementation of the policy by promoting consistent interpretation, assessing agencywide progress, and developing revisions to the policy, if warranted. However, EPA\u2019s policy specifies that the Assistant and Regional Administrators for each office are ultimately responsible for implementing the policy, including developing operating procedures, identifying work products subject to peer review, determining the type and timing of such reviews, and documenting the process and outcome of each peer review conducted.", "Our objectives, scope, and methodology are fully described in appendix I."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation Remains Uneven", "paragraphs": ["Two years after EPA established its peer review policy, implementation is still uneven. EPA acknowledges this problem and provided us with a number of examples to illustrate the uneven implementation. At our request, the Science Policy Council obtained information from EPA program and regional offices and provided us with examples in which, in their opinion, peer review was properly conducted; cases in which it was conducted but not fully in accordance with the policy; and cases in which peer review was not conducted at all. The following table briefly summarizes the cases they selected; additional information on these nine cases is provided in appendix II.", "According to the Executive Director of the Science Policy Council, this unevenness can be attributed to several factors. First, some offices within EPA have historically used peer review, while others\u2019 experience is limited to the 2 years since the policy was issued. For example, in accordance with scientific custom, the Office of Research and Development (ORD) has used peer review for obtaining critical evaluations of certain work products for more than 20 years. Additionally, statutes require that certain work products developed by EPA be peer reviewed by legislatively established bodies. For example, criteria documents developed by ORD for the National Ambient Air Quality Standards must receive peer review from EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Board (SAB), and pesticide documents must receive peer review from the Scientific Advisory Panel. In contrast, some EPA regional offices and areas within some EPA program offices have had little prior experience with peer review. In addition to these offices\u2019 varying levels of experience with peer review, the Science Policy Council\u2019s Executive Director and other EPA officials said that statutory and court-ordered deadlines, budget constraints, and difficulties associated with finding and obtaining the services of qualified, independent peer reviewers have also contributed to peer review not being consistently practiced agencywide. A report by the National Academy of Public Administration confirmed that EPA frequently faces court-ordered deadlines. According to the Academy, since 1993 the courts have issued an additional 131 deadlines that EPA must comply with or face judicial sanctions. Also, as explained to us by officials from EPA\u2019s Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), just about everything EPA does in some program areas, such as Clean Air Act implementation, is to address either legislative or court-ordered mandates.", "Others have attributed EPA\u2019s problems with implementing peer review in the decision-making process to other factors. For example, in its March 1995 interim report on EPA\u2019s research and peer review program within the Office of Research and Development, the National Academy of Sciences\u2019 National Research Council noted that, even in EPA\u2019s research community, knowledge about peer review could be improved. The Council\u2019s interim report pointed out that \u201calthough peer review is widely used and highly regarded, it is poorly understood by many, and it has come under serious study only in recent years.\u201d Although we agree that the issues EPA and others have raised may warrant further consideration, we believe that EPA\u2019s uneven implementation is primarily due to (1) confusion among agency staff and management about what peer review is, what its significance and benefits are, and when and how it should be conducted and (2) ineffective accountability and oversight mechanisms to ensure that all products are properly peer reviewed by program and regional offices."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Peer Review Policy and Procedures Not Well Understood", "paragraphs": ["Although the policy and procedures provide substantial information about what peer review entails, we found that some EPA staff and managers had misperceptions about what peer review is, what its significance and benefits are, and when and how it should be conducted. For example, officials from EPA\u2019s Office of Mobile Sources (OMS) told the House Commerce Committee in August 1995 that they had not had any version of the mobile model peer reviewed. Subsequently, in April 1996, OMS officials told us they recognize that external peer review is needed and that EPA plans to have the next iteration of the model peer reviewed. However, when asked how the peer review would be conducted, OMS officials said they plan to use the public comments on the revised model they receive as the peer review. As EPA\u2019s policy makes clear, public comments are not the same as nor are they a substitute for peer review.", "We found a similar misunderstanding about what peer review entails in a regional office we visited. The region prepared a product that assesses the impacts of tributyl tin\u2014a compound used since the 1960s in antifouling paints for boats and large ships. Although regional staff told us that this contractor-prepared product had been peer reviewed, we found that the reviews were not in accordance with EPA\u2019s peer review policy. The draft product received some internal review by EPA staff and external review by contributing authors, stakeholders, and the public; however, it was not reviewed by experts previously uninvolved with the product\u2019s development nor by those unaffected by its potential regulatory ramifications. When we pointed out that\u2014according to EPA\u2019s policy and the region\u2019s own peer review procedures\u2014these reviews are not a substitute for peer review, the project director said that she was not aware of these requirements.", "In two other cases we reviewed, there was misunderstanding about the components of a product that should be peer reviewed. For example, in the Great Waters study\u2014an assessment of the impact of atmospheric pollutants in significant water bodies\u2014the scientific data were subjected to external peer review, but the study\u2019s conclusions that were based on these data were not. Similarly, in the reassessment of dioxin\u2014a reexamination of the health risks posed by dioxin\u2014the final chapter summarizing and characterizing dioxin\u2019s risks was not as thoroughly peer reviewed. More than any other, this chapter indicated EPA\u2019s conclusions based on its reassessment of the dioxin issue. In both cases, the project officers did not have these chapters peer reviewed because they believed that the development of conclusions is an inherently governmental function that should be performed exclusively by EPA staff. However, some EPA officials with expertise in conducting peer reviews disagreed, maintaining that it is important to have peer reviewers comment on whether or not EPA has properly interpreted the results of the underlying scientific and technical data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inadequate Mechanisms to Ensure Consistent Implementation", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the uncertainty surrounding the peer review policy, we also noted problems with EPA\u2019s accountability and oversight mechanisms. EPA\u2019s current oversight mechanism primarily consists of a two-part reporting scheme: Each office and region annually lists (1) the candidate products nominated for peer review during the upcoming year and (2) the status of products previously nominated. If a candidate product is no longer scheduled for peer review, the list must note this and explain why peer review is no longer planned. Agency officials said this was the most extensive level of oversight to which all program and regional offices could agree when the peer review procedures were developed.", "Although this is an adequate oversight mechanism for tracking the status of previously nominated products, it does not provide upper-level managers with sufficient information to ensure that all products warranting peer review have been identified. This, when taken together with the misperceptions about what peer review is and with the deadlines and budget constraints that project officers often operate under, has meant that the peer review program to date has largely been one of self-identification, allowing some important work products to go unlisted. According to the Science Policy Council\u2019s Executive Director, reviewing officials would be much better positioned to determine if the peer review policy and procedures are being properly and consistently implemented if, instead, EPA\u2019s list contained all major products along with what peer review is planned and, if none, the reasons why not.", "The need for more comprehensive accountability and oversight mechanisms is especially important given the policy\u2019s wide latitude in allowing peer review to be forgone in cases facing time and/or resource constraints. As explained by EPA\u2019s Science Policy Council\u2019s Executive Director, because so much of the work that EPA performs is in response to either statutory or court-ordered mandates and the agency frequently faces budget uncertainties or limitations, an office under pressure might argue for nearly any given product that peer review is a luxury the office cannot afford in the circumstances.", "However, as the Executive Director of EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Board told us, not conducting peer review can sometimes be more costly to the agency in terms of time and resources. He told us of a recent rulemaking by the Office of Solid Waste concerning a new methodology for delisting hazardous wastes in which the program office\u2019s failure to have the methodology appropriately peer reviewed resulted in important omissions, errors, and flawed approaches in the methodology, which will now take from 1 to 2 years to correct. The SAB also noted that further peer review of individual elements of the proposed methodology is essential before the scientific basis for this rulemaking can be established."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "EPA\u2019s Actions to Improve the Peer Review Process", "paragraphs": ["EPA has recently taken a number of steps to improve the peer review process.

The self-assessment will include information on each peer review completed during the prior year as well as feedback on the effectiveness of the overall process. The verification will consist of the signature of headquarters, laboratory, or regional directors to certify that the peer reviews were conducted in accordance with the agency\u2019s policy and procedures. If the peer review did not fully conform to the policy, the division director or the line manager will explain significant variances and actions needed to limit future significant departures from the policy. The self-assessments and verifications will be submitted and reviewed by the Peer Review Advisory Group to aid in its oversight responsibilities. According to the Deputy Administrator, this expanded assessment and verification process will help build accountability and demonstrate EPA\u2019s commitment to the independent review of the scientific analyses underlying the agency\u2019s decisions to protect public health and the environment. These new accountability and oversight processes should take full effect in October 1996.", "ORD\u2019s National Center for Environmental Research and Quality Assurance has also agreed to play an expanded assistance and oversight role in the peer review process. Although the details had not been completed, the Center\u2019s Director told us that his staff will be available to assist others in conducting peer reviews and will try to anticipate and flag the problems that they observe. In addition, the Center recently developed an automated Peer Review Panelist Information System\u2014a registry with information on identifying and contacting potential reviewers according to their areas of expertise. Although the system was designed to identify potential reviewers of applications for EPA grants, cooperative agreements, and fellowships, the Center\u2019s Director stated that the registry (or similarly designed ones) could also be used to identify potential peer reviewers for EPA\u2019s technical and scientific work products."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Office-Specific Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing that confusion remains about what peer review entails, the Office of Water recently drafted additional guidance that further clarifies the need for, use of, and ways to conduct peer review.

The Federation has identified the following areas of concern, among others, where the program should be improved: (1) the types of, levels of, and methodologies for peer review; (2) the sources and selection of reviewers; (3) the funding/resources for peer review; and (4) the follow-up to, and accountability for, peer review. Similarly, OAR\u2019s Office of Mobile Sources proposed a Peer Review/Scientific Presence Team in March 1996 to help OMS personnel better understand the principles and definitions involved in the peer review process.

The team was charged with strengthening the program office\u2019s implementation of peer review by identifying ways to facilitate good peer review and addressing barriers to its successful use. In May 1996, the team developed an implementation plan with a series of recommendations that fall into the following broad categories: (1) strengthening early peer review planning; (2) improving the ability of the Assistant Administrator to manage peer review activities; (3) providing guidance and examples to support the staff\u2019s implementation of peer review; and (4) developing mechanisms to facilitate the conduct of peer reviews.", "EPA\u2019s Region 10 formed a Peer Review Group with the responsibility for overseeing the region\u2019s reviews.

Agreement was also reached to have each of the region\u2019s offices appoint a peer review contact who will receive training from the Peer Review Group and be responsible for managing some peer reviews and for coordinating other major peer review projects.", "The above agencywide and office-specific efforts should help address the confusion about peer review and the accountability and oversight problems we identified. However, the efforts aimed at better informing staff about the benefits and use of peer review are not being done fully in all offices and would be more effective if done consistently throughout the agency.

The annual listing of only those products that have been selected for peer review has not enabled upper-level managers to see what products have not been nominated for peer review nor the reasons for their exclusion.", "A more useful tool would be to have the list contain all planned major products with detailed information about the managers\u2019 decisions about peer review.

The reviewers then met to discuss the report and provide EPA with their views.", "EPA expended a great deal of effort to ensure that the science in the report was peer reviewed; however, the program coordinator said the agency did not have the conclusions and recommendations chapter peer reviewed. The decision not to peer review this chapter was based on the belief by those directing the program that these were the agency\u2019s opinions based on the information presented and thus an inherently governmental function not subject to peer review.

In accordance with the principle that the polluter pays, unit pricing provides a financial incentive for reducing municipal waste generation and enhancing recycling. EPA\u2019s Office of Policy, Planning and Evaluation (OPPE) used a cooperative agreement to have an assessment prepared of the most significant literature on unit pricing programs to determine the degree to which unit pricing programs meet their stated goals. The paper, which was completed in March 1996, highlights those areas where analysts generally agree on the outcomes associated with unit pricing, as well as those areas where substantial controversy remains. Unit pricing is still voluntary in the United States, according to the project officer; however, he said EPA believes that the more information that municipalities have readily available as they make long-term solid waste landfill decisions, the more likely these local governments are to employ some form of unit pricing as a disincentive to the continued unrestrained filling of landfills.", "The OPPE project director had the report internally peer reviewed by three EPA staff knowledgeable about unit pricing. The report was not externally peer reviewed, he said, because it is designed to be used only as a reference guide by communities that are considering implementing some type of unit pricing program to reduce waste, and because EPA does not intend to use the report to support any regulatory actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technical Analysis of AJ Mine\u2019s Tailing Impoundment", "paragraphs": ["The Alaska Juneau (AJ) Gold Mine project was a proposal by the Echo Bay, Alaska, company to reopen the former mine near Juneau. The proposal entailed mining approximately 22,500 tons of ore per day and, after crushing and grinding the ore, recovering gold through the froth flotation and carbon-in-leach (also called cyanide leach) processes. After the destruction of residual cyanide, the mine tailings would be discharged in a slurry form to an impoundment that would be created in Sheep Creek Valley, four miles south of downtown Juneau.", "An environmental impact statement was prepared on the proposal in 1992. Because the project would require permits for fill materials and discharging wastewater into surface waters, EPA\u2019s regional staff developed a model to predict the environmental ramifications of the proposal. According to regional staff, a careful analysis of the proposal was important because the issues in this proposal could potentially set a precedent for similar future proposals.", "EPA went through three iterations of the model. The first model was presented in a report entitled A Simple Model for Metals in the Proposed AJ Mine Tailings Pond. The report was reviewed by an engineer in EPA\u2019s Environmental Research Laboratory and a firm that worked for the City and Borough of Juneau. The second model was a customized version of one developed by EPA\u2019s Research Laboratory. After receiving comments from the firm representing Echo Bay, ORD laboratories, the Corps of Engineers, and others, EPA decided to also use another model to evaluate the proposal\u2019s potential environmental effects. In 1994, EPA prepared a technical analysis report on the proposal. The report received peer review by several of the same individuals who commented on the models, as well as others. Although the reviewers had expertise in the subject matter, several were not independent of the product\u2019s development or its regulatory and/or financial ramifications.", "Based partially on the model\u2019s predictions, it became evident that EPA would withhold permit approval for the project. Accordingly, Echo Bay developed an alternative design for its project. In May 1995, EPA hired a contractor to prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement that will assess the revised project\u2019s ecological effects.

As such, EPA\u2019s Office of Solid Waste (OSW) developed a new methodology for establishing the conditions under which wastes listed as hazardous may be delisted. This methodology was presented in an OSW report, Development of Human Health Based and Ecologically Based Exit Criteria for the Hazardous Waste Identification Project (March 3, 1995), which was intended to support the Hazardous Waste Identification Rule. The intent of this rule is to establish human health-based and ecologically based waste constituent concentrations\u2014known as exit criteria\u2014for constituents in wastes below which listed hazardous wastes would be reclassified and become delisted as a hazardous waste. Such wastes could then be handled as a nonhazardous solid waste under other provisions of RCRA. OSW\u2019s support document describes a proposed methodology for calculating the exit concentrations of 192 chemicals for humans and about 50 chemicals of ecological concern for five types of hazardous waste sources; numerous release, transport, and exposure pathways; and for biological effects information. \u201cThe Subcommittee is seriously concerned about the level of scientific input and the degree of professional judgment that, to date, have been incorporated into the methodology development. It was clear to the Subcommittee that there has been inadequate attention given to the state-of-the-science for human and ecological risk assessment that exists within EPA, let alone in the broader scientific community, in the development of the overall methodology, the identification of individual equations and associated parameters, the selection of models and their applicability, and the continual need for sound scientific judgment.\u201d", "The SAB also noted that further peer review of individual elements of the proposed methodology is essential before the scientific basis can be established. The SAB concluded that the methodology at present lacks the scientific defensibility for its intended regulatory use.", "According to SAB\u2019s Executive Director, this is a case where the program office\u2019s decision to not conduct a peer review of the key supporting elements of a larger project resulted in extra cost and time to the agency, as well as missed deadlines.

Since that time, major updates and improvements to the mobile model have resulted in the addition of emissions estimates for evaporative (nontailpipe exhaust) emissions and for uncorrected in-use deterioration due to tampering or poor maintenance, according to the OMS Emission Inventory Group Manager. Also, other categories of vehicles, such as light-duty trucks and motorcycles, have been added over the years, she said.", "The development of the next generation model, Mobile 6, is currently under way. As with other models, the mobile model exists because precise information about the emissions behavior of the approximately 200 million vehicles in use in the United States is not known, according to the Group Manager. The primary use of the mobile model is in calculating the estimated emissions reductions benefits of various actions when applied to the mobile sources in an area. For example, the mobile model can estimate the impact of participating in a reformulated gasoline program, or of using oxygenated fuels in an area, or of requiring periodic inspection and maintenance of selected vehicle categories. In essence, the mobile model is one of the primary tools that EPA, states, and localities use to measure the estimated emissions reduction effectiveness of the pollution control activities called for in State Implementation Plans.", "None of the previous mobile models has been peer reviewed. However, EPA has obtained external views on the model through stakeholders\u2019 workshops and experts\u2019 meetings; one of the largest of these meetings involved over 200 stakeholders, according to OMS officials. The agency recognizes that these workshops and meetings are not a substitute for peer review and, in a reversal of the agency\u2019s views of 10 months ago, EPA now plans to have Mobile 6 peer reviewed, they said.
