This stovepiped and duplicative systems environment evolved over time as DOD components--each with its own system funding--developed narrowly focused, parochial solutions to their business problems. As a result of this uncontrolled spending, DOD reported over 200 inventory systems and 450 personnel systems. DOD's fundamentally flawed business systems affect mission effectiveness and can contribute to the fraud, waste, and abuse that GAO continues to identify. Further, the number of business systems is likely understated in part because DOD does not have a central systems repository or a standard business system definition. DOD does not have an effective management structure for controlling business systems investments and the business domains' roles and responsibilities have not been defined. Further, DOD does not have reasonable assurance that it is in compliance with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003, which requires the DOD Comptroller to determine that system improvements exceeding $1 million meet the criteria specified in the act. Based on limited information provided by DOD, system improvements with at least $479 million of obligations over $1 million were not reviewed by the DOD Comptroller. GAO's two case studies are examples of DOD spending hundreds of millions on business systems that will not result in corporate solutions to its longstanding inventory and related financial management problems. While these efforts should provide some improvement to the Defense Logistics Agency's and the Army's business operations, implementation problems have resulted in schedule slippages, cost increases, and critical capabilities not being delivered. These issues can be attributed, in part, to the lack of disciplined processes in the areas of requirements management and testing. If not corrected, the problems will result in two more costly, nonintegrated systems that only marginally improve DOD business operations and further impede DOD's transformation as envisioned by the Secretary of Defense."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) spends billions of dollars annually to  operate, maintain, and modernize its business systems.

Additionally, we met with DOD officials and  reviewed available documentation to determine the effectiveness of the  department\u2019s efforts to control and account for its business systems  investments.  Further, we reviewed documentation provided by DOD to  determine if all systems improvements with obligations exceeding   $1 million were reviewed by the DOD Comptroller in accordance with the fiscal year 2003 defense authorization act.

Execution of these operations spans a  wide range of defense organizations, including the military services and  their respective major commands and functional activities, numerous large  defense agencies and field activities, and various combatant and joint  operational commands that are responsible for military operations for  specific geographic regions or theaters of operations.", "To execute these military operations, the department performs an  assortment of interrelated and interdependent business functions,  including logistics management, procurement, health care management,  and financial management.  To support its business functions, DOD  reported in April 2003 that it relied on about 2,274 business systems,  including accounting, acquisition, logistics, and personnel systems.  To  support its existing systems environment, DOD requests billions of dollars  annually.

These system deficiencies have hindered  DOD\u2019s ability to (1) support its reported inventory balances; (2) provide  inventory visibility; and (3) provide accurate financial and management  information related to its property, plant, and equipment.  For example:  DOD incurred substantial logistical support problems as a result of  weak distribution and accountability processes and controls over  supplies and equipment shipments in support of Operation Iraqi  Freedom activities, similar to those encountered during the prior Gulf  War. These weaknesses resulted in (1) supply shortages, (2) backlogs of  materials delivered in theater but not delivered to the requesting  activity, (3) a discrepancy of $1.2 billion between the amount of materiel  shipped and that acknowledged by the activity as received,   (4) cannibalization of vehicles, and (5) duplicate supply requisitions.", "Inadequate asset visibility and accountability resulted in DOD selling  new Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology\u2014the current  chemical and biological protective garment used by our military  forces\u2014on the Internet for $3 each (coat and trousers) while at the  same time buying them for over $200 each.

This reconciliation is necessary because the three  databases are not integrated.  The IT Registry is a database of mission- critical and mission-essential IT systems maintained by the DOD CIO.  As reported by the DOD Inspector General (IG), each DOD component  could determine whether a system should be reported as mission critical or  mission essential in the IT Registry. Since the definitions were subject to  interpretation, the DOD IG concluded that the IT Registry would not  necessarily capture the universe of DOD business systems.

The ITMA includes initiatives and  programs, such as the department\u2019s BEA effort, that are not IT systems.", "Although DOD recognizes that it needs an integrated repository of systems  information in order to control and prioritize its IT investments, the  difficulty of developing a single source is compounded by the fact that DOD  has not developed a universal definition of what should be classified as a  business system.

Each DOD component  continues to make its own investment decisions, following different  approaches and criteria. The lack of an institutionalized investment  strategy has contributed to the department\u2019s current complex, error-prone,  nonintegrated systems environment and precluded the development of  corporate system solutions to long-standing business problems. In  particular, DOD has not clearly defined the roles and responsibilities of the  domains, established common investment criteria, and conducted a  comprehensive review of its ongoing IT investments to ensure that they are  consistent with the BEA.", "As we have previously reported, best practices recommend that  investment review boards be established to control an entity\u2019s systems  investments and that the boards use a standard set of investment review  and decision-making criteria to ensure compliance and consistency with  the architecture.  We have also recommended that the department establish  investment review boards to better control investments and that each  board be composed of representatives from across the department.", "DOD has decided that in lieu of the investment review boards, the domains  will be responsible for investment management.  In March 2004, the Deputy  Secretary of Defense signed an IT portfolio investment management policy  and assigned overall responsibility to the domains.  However, the specific  roles and responsibilities of the domains had not been formalized and  standard criteria for performing systems reviews have not been finalized.   According to DOD officials, the related detailed directive and instructions  will outline the specific roles and responsibilities of the domains and how  they are to be involved in the overall business systems investment  management process.  The department is drafting a memorandum that will  require the domains to develop a plan for implementing the investment  management policy.", "Further, the department has developed draft system review and  certification process guidance that outlines the criteria that are to be used  by the domains and program managers to assess system compliance with  the BEA.  The systems covered in the review process consist of new system  initiatives, ongoing system developmental projects, and systems in  sustainment.  According to DOD, once a system is placed in sustainment,  modernization funding cannot exceed $1 million.  The system review and  certification process guidance has been integrated with the department\u2019s  existing acquisition guidance\u2014commonly referred to as the DOD 5000  series.  The acquisition guidance requires that certain documentation be  prepared at different stages\u2014known as milestones\u2014within the system\u2019s  life-cycle process.  This documentation is intended to provide relevant  information for management oversight and for decision making on whether  the investment of resources is cost beneficial and technically feasible.   DOD officials noted that the system review process would be further  enhanced because the DOD Comptroller will have to certify that the  proposed investment is consistent and aligned with the BEA at each  milestone decision.  According to DOD, the certification process will help  ensure that the obligation of funds of over $1 million for the modernization  of a system are in accordance with the criteria set forth in the fiscal year  2003 defense authorization act.", "While these actions are aimed at improving the control and accountability  over business systems investments, we have previously reported that the  department did not adhere to the milestone decision-making and oversight  processes it established to ensure the economical and technical risks  associated with systems modernizations have been mitigated.  For  example, our March 2003 report noted that DOD had not effectively  managed and overseen its planned investment of over $1 billion in four  DFAS system modernization efforts. One project\u2019s estimated cost had  increased by as much as $274 million, while the schedule slipped by almost  4 years. For each of these projects, DOD oversight entities\u2014DFAS, the  DOD Comptroller, and the DOD CIO\u2014could not provide documentation  that indicated they had questioned the impact of the cost increases and  schedule delays, and allowed the projects to proceed in the absence of the  requisite analytical justification.  Such analyses provide the requisite  justification for decision makers to use in determining whether to invest  additional resources in anticipation of receiving commensurate benefits  and mission value.  Two of the four projects\u2014DPPS and DSDS\u2014were  terminated in December 2002 and December 2003, respectively, after an  investment of approximately $179 million that did not improve the  department\u2019s business operations.", "While DOD is continuing to work toward establishing the structure and  processes to manage its business systems investments, it has not yet  conducted a comprehensive system review of its ongoing IT investments to  ensure that they are consistent with its BEA efforts.  The domains have  raised concerns that they did not have sufficient staff to perform the  system reviews.  To assist the domains with their system reviews, in  December 2003, the Deputy Secretary of Defense allotted the domains 54  additional staff.  Despite concerns over the sufficiency of staff resources  and the lack of organizational structure and processes for controlling  system investments, the department has acted to curtail the funding for  some systems.  For example, effective October 2003, the DOD Comptroller  directed that the Defense Joint Accounting System (DJAS) be put into  sustainment.  That is, funding would be provided to operate and maintain  the system, but not to upgrade or modernize the system.  In June 2000, the  DOD Inspector General (IG) reported that DFAS was developing DJAS at  an estimated life-cycle cost of about $700 million without demonstrating  that the program was the most cost-effective alternative for providing a  portion of DOD\u2019s general fund accounting.  DJAS is only being operated at  two locations\u2014Fort Benning, Georgia, and the Missile Defense Agency\u2014 and there are no longer any plans to implement the system at other  locations.", "Another system that DOD has placed into sustainment is the Joint  Computer Aided Acquisition and Logistics Support (JCALS) system.   JCALS was initiated in June 1992 to enable the services to streamline  DOD\u2019s logistical and acquisition functions through business process  reengineering and eliminating existing systems.  In May 2003, Gartner, Inc.,  reviewed the cost, efficiency, and effectiveness of JCALS and reported that  the program is costly to operate and maintain.  The study recommended  freezing all software and technology spending.  According to DOD\u2019s fiscal  year 2004 IT budget, over $1 billion had been invested in JCALS since the  inception of the program.", "Placing DJAS and JCALS in sustainment is a step in the right direction.   However, execution of a comprehensive review of all modernization efforts  by DOD before substantial money has been invested will reduce the risk of  continuing the department\u2019s track record of business systems  modernization efforts that cost more than anticipated, take longer than  expected, and fail to deliver intended capabilities.", "Further, in developing the fiscal year 2005 budget request, the DOD  Comptroller denied DFAS\u2019s request for approximately $32 million for the  development of an accounting and budget execution system.  The DOD  Comptroller appropriately noted that there should not be investments in a  new system before the domains define the requirements and the system is  justified through the appropriate DOD approval process.  The DOD  Comptroller also denied DFAS\u2019s request for funding of the Disbursing  Transformation Program, which was a proposed $41 million initiative  through fiscal year 2009.  According to DFAS, the program was to be  funded from resources that were budgeted for DSDS, which, as previously  mentioned, was terminated in December 2003. The DOD Comptroller noted  that the department should not pay for salaries, software development, and  systems modernization for a disbursing system before disbursing  functionality is defined according to the BEA. It was further stated that it is  premature for DFAS to create a new disbursing system when it cannot  explain any of the program\u2019s requirements in broad or detailed terms and  numerous disbursing systems already exist.", "It is encouraging to see the DOD Comptroller acting to eliminate budget  requests by DFAS for systems that are not justified.  However, DFAS, which  is under the auspices of the DOD Comptroller, represents a very small  percentage\u2014slightly over 2 percent ($103 million of $4.8 billion)\u2014of the  total modernization funding.  Given that the department lacks a  comprehensive inventory of its business systems, it is unknown how many  other modernization projects should be questioned.  However, since the  roles and responsibilities of the domain owners have not been clarified,  they have not been empowered to make investment decisions similar to  those of the DOD Comptroller.  As we have previously recommended, the  department needs to assess its current systems and limit current  investments to  deployment of systems that have already been fully tested and involve  no additional development or acquisition cost;  stay-in-business maintenance needed to keep existing systems   management controls needed to effectively invest in modernized   new systems or existing system changes that are congressionally  directed or are relatively small, cost-effective, and low risk and can be  delivered in a relatively short time frame.", "As noted in our September 2003 report, DOD had not yet defined and  implemented an effective approach for selecting and controlling business  system investments.

DOD was unable to provide us comprehensive information on all systems  improvements with obligations greater than $1 million since passage of the  act.  However, based upon limited information provided by the military  services for fiscal years 2003 and 2004, we found that modernizations with  obligations totaling at least $479 million were not submitted to the DOD  Comptroller for any factual determination.", "The act states that as a condition of making any obligation in excess of   $1 million for system improvements, the obligation be reviewed by the  DOD Comptroller who must make a determination whether the request is  in accordance with criteria specified in the act. To comply with the  legislative requirement, the DOD Comptroller issued a memorandum on  March 7, 2003, to DOD\u2019s component organizations stating that the BMSI  office\u2014which is responsible for overseeing the development and  implementation of the BEA\u2014must review all system improvements with  obligations in excess of $1 million.  In addition, the memorandum directs  the DOD components, as an integral part of the review and approval  process, to present information to DOD Comptroller officials and relevant  domain owners that demonstrates that each investment (1) complies with  the BEA and (2) is economically justified.

While we recognize that this is budgetary data, rather than  the obligational data referred to in the act, this information could provide a  starting point for the domains identifying potential projects that should be  submitted to the DOD Comptroller.  For example, we analyzed the DOD IT  budget request for fiscal years 2003 through 2005 and identified over 200  systems in each year\u2019s budget, totaling over $4 billion per year that could  involve obligations of funds that exceed the $1 million threshold.

As of February  2004, we received responses from the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force,  but did not receive responses from any of the defense agencies such as  DFAS and DLA.  To ascertain if the DOD Comptroller had made the  determination required in the act, we compared a list of system approvals  provided by the BMSI office with the obligational data (by system)  provided by the military services.  Based upon a comparison of the limited  information available, we identified $479 million in reported obligations  over $1 million by the military services for system improvements that were  not submitted to the DOD Comptroller for review and determination as  required by the act.

For example, the Air Force did not categorize its Global Combat  Support System as a business system, while the Army and the Navy  consider their respective Global Combat Support Systems business  systems.  Additionally, the Navy categorized the Defense Message System  as a business system, but the Army and the Air Force did not.  This  inconsistency further reiterates the need for a standard database and  uniform definition of a business system that properly categorizes DOD\u2019s  numerous systems.", "For those systems that were submitted for review, we found that most had  the supporting documentation called for in the DOD Comptroller\u2019s March 7,  2003, memorandum.  For example, the return on investment was identified.   However, the one common element lacking was the assertion that the  system projects were compliant with the BEA or otherwise met the criteria  set out in the act.  As noted earlier, BMMP has developed a draft BEA  system compliance assessment certification for program managers to use;  however, the process has not been finalized.  The inability to assert  compliance with the BEA is consistent with our September 2003 report,  which noted that the BEA lacked the details needed to provide DOD with a  common vision and constrain or control investments.  We also identified  instances in which the justification for the approval was questionable.   These investments were made without DOD knowing whether these  systems are aligned or consistent with part of DOD\u2019s long-term system  modernization strategies.  For example:   In October 2003, the DOD Comptroller approved obligations of   $8 million for the Standard Procurement System (SPS) even though the  supporting documentation noted that there was insufficient  documentation to validate all requirements and some were found to be  noncompliant with the BEA.  We and the DOD IG have previously  reported concerns with the overall management and implementation of  SPS and the ability to deliver its intended capability.  Initiated almost 10  years ago in November 1994, the system was to provide DOD with a  single automated system to perform all functions related to contract  management within DOD\u2019s procurement process for all DOD  organizations and activities.  The system was also intended to replace  the contract administration functions currently performed by MOCAS, a  system implemented in 1968 and still operating today. Further, as will be  discussed later in this report, difficulty with the implementation of SPS  is one of the factors that contributed to the slippage in DLA\u2019s BSM  implementation schedule.", "In May 2003, the DOD Comptroller approved funding of about $4 million  for the Army\u2019s Integrated Facilities System (IFS).  Initially, the Director  of the BMSI office denied the funding request in part because it was  noted that the system would be replaced by an enterprise solution.  In  response, the installations and environment domain noted that a final  system solution had not been determined and stated that if IFS was  found to be compliant with the \u201cyet to be determined revised business  process,\u201d it could be designated the enterprisewide solution.  The  response also noted that IFS \u201cmight prove to have the best functionality  and technical capabilities for a DOD real property inventory solution.\u201d   However, until the department\u2019s BEA becomes more robust, it remains  unclear if this system will be part of the ultimate system solution.  Until  that decision is made, it is unknown what benefit will be derived from  further investment in this system.", "We also identified some instances in which the DOD Comptroller\u2019s  approval depended on specific actions being taken by a given date.   However, prior to December 2003, the BMSI office did not have a process in  place to track and follow up on required actions and did not have  reasonable assurance that the required actions were taken.  For example:  In April 2003, the DOD Comptroller approved the expenditure of about  $53 million for the convergence of four separate Navy enterprise  resources planning solutions into one initiative.  This approval was  subsequent to an approval in February 2003 of about $21 million for the  continuance of two of the four Navy efforts.  The approval  memorandum outlined three specific actions that needed to be taken  and established time frames for the completion of each action.  As of  February 2004, BMSI officials were not able to attest to whether these  actions had been completed.  However, the Navy continues to move  forward with this effort.", "The DOD Comptroller approved a pilot project for the National Security  Agency on March 7, 2003, for $13.4 million.  The approval depended on  the completion of an overall planning document that outlined the  various areas that were to be addressed.  This document was to be  completed by March 16, 2003.

The official stated that the JSLIST suits would be  included in BSM at the earliest practicable date, which was estimated to be  December 2003. BSM, however, is not designed to provide the corporate  total asset visibility necessary to locate and track the suits throughout  DOD\u2019s supply chain.  While the suits are expected to be included in a future  deployment of BSM, program officials have not yet specified a date when  they will be included. Even when the suits are included, BSM is designed to  provide visibility over the suits only within the DLA environment\u2014 something DLA has stated already exists within its current legacy system  environment.", "As we have previously reported, the lack of integrated systems hinders  DOD\u2019s ability to know how many JSLIST it has on hand and where they are  located once they leave the DLA warehouse.  For example, we found that  military units that receive JSLIST from DLA warehouses maintained  inventory data in nonstandard, stovepiped systems that did not share data  with DLA or other DOD systems. The methods used to control and  maintain visibility over JSLIST at the units we visited ranged from stand- alone automated systems, to spreadsheet applications, to pen and paper.  One military unit we visited did not have any inventory system for tracking  JSLIST.  BSM does not address asset visibility outside of DLA\u2019s supply chain  for the JSLIST, and thus cannot provide total asset visibility for this critical  inventory item.", "Having the ability to readily locate sensitive items, such as JSLIST, is  critical, particularly if a defect is found and the items must be recalled.  A  case in point is the JSLIST predecessor, the Battle Dress Overgarment  (BDO).  Over 700,000 of these suits were found to be defective and were  recalled.  Since DOD\u2019s systems did not provide the capability to identify the  exact location of each suit, a series of data calls were conducted, which  proved to be ineffective. We reported in September 2001 that DOD was  unable to locate approximately 250,000 of the defective suits and therefore  was uncertain if the suits were still in the possession of the military forces,  or whether they had been destroyed or sold.  Subsequently, we found that  DOD had sold many of these defective suits to the public as excess,  including 379 that we purchased in an undercover operation.  In addition,  DOD may have issued over 4,700 of the defective BDO suits to local law  enforcement agencies.  This is particularly significant because local law  enforcement agencies are most likely to be the first responders to a  terrorist attack, yet DOD failed to inform these agencies that using these  suits could result in death or serious injury. BSM will not provide DOD with  the capability to readily locate JSLIST for any reason, including the need to  recall defective suits.", "Similar to BSM, LMP will not provide the Army with total asset visibility  until a suite of other systems has been developed and implemented.  Specifically, Army officials have stated that LMP will require integration  with other Army systems that are under development in order to achieve  total asset visibility within the Army. These additional systems are the  Product Lifecycle Management Plus (PLM+) and Global Combat Support  System\u2014Army (GCSS\u2013A). According to the Army, PLM+ is to integrate  LMP and GCSS\u2013A to create a seamless end-to-end solution for Army  logistics.

DLA estimated that this software would cost  approximately $30 million, which contributed to the increased BSM  program costs.", "Similar to BSM, LMP has also experienced schedule slippages and cost  increases since the project was approved in February 1998.

In October 1999, we reported that the Army\u2019s  estimated cost of LMP over the 10-year period of the contract was  approximately $421 million.  However, as discussed in that report, the   $421 million estimate did not include an additional $30.5 million per  contract year that would be needed for data processing. The amount  allowed for data processing in the original estimate was based directly on  the percentage of data processing performed by the contractor, with the  Defense Information Systems Agency performing the residual processing.  Further, the original estimate was based on a 10-year contract and the  current estimate is based on a 12-year contract, and each additional  contract year can be as much as $65 million.  Considering these two  factors, a more accurate cost estimate in 1999 would have been  approximately $856 million.", "In our discussions with LMP program officials, additional factors were  identified that have caused the cost of LMP to increase to over $1 billion.   For example, since the initiation of LMP, the Army has directed that the  program be (1) integrated with the Army Single Stock Fund effort and   (2) extended to the Army depot maintenance operations.  These additional  capabilities were not part of the standard LMP software package and were  not envisioned to be part of LMP when the original cost estimate was  developed.  Therefore, additional development and implementation costs  were incurred and increased the overall cost of the program by over   $91 million.  Further, the LMP program manager acknowledged that the  1999 estimate did not include adequate DOD program management costs.   The additional program management costs are estimated to be about   $104 million and include such items as personnel and travel.", "Additionally, as shown in figure 5, the original FOC date was scheduled for  fiscal year 2004.

We identified numerous instances in which  each documented requirement used to design and test the system did not  build upon the next in moving through the hierarchy.  Specifically, the  requirements (1) lacked the specific information necessary to understand  the required functionality that was to be provided and (2) did not describe  how to determine quantitatively, through testing or other analysis, whether  the systems would meet DLA\u2019s and Army\u2019s respective needs.  One reason  that users have not been provided with the intended systems capabilities is  because of the breakdown in the requirements management process.  As a  consequence, DLA and the Army have been forced to implement error- prone, time-consuming manual workarounds as a means to minimize  disruption to critical operations.  DLA and Army officials acknowledged  that improvements in their requirements management processes are  needed and have stated that they are working to develop more specific  requirements that better describe required system functionality and  support more effective system testing.", "DLA\u2019s basic hierarchical approach to developing BSM requirements was to  (1) define high-level requirements, commonly referred to as operational  requirements; (2) define more specific blueprint requirements; (3) develop  functional scenarios; (4) define functional designs; (5) define technical  designs; (6) create test cases; and (7) define test conditions. Similarly, the  Army\u2019s basic approach to developing LMP system requirements was to   (1) develop a blueprint of its business processes following the Integration  Definition for Function modeling standards established by the National  Institute of Standards and Technology and IEEE, (2) define high-level  requirements, (3) develop process scenarios, (4) develop test cases, and   (5) use subject matter experts to determine whether the application met  the business processes envisioned by the users and as developed by a  contractor to provide the functionality currently provided by the Army\u2019s  existing systems.  If effectively implemented, either methodology can be  used to develop and implement a system.  The key is that each step of the  process builds upon the previous one.  Accordingly, unidentified defects in  one step migrate to the subsequent steps where they are more costly to fix  and increase the risk that the project will experience adverse impacts on its  schedule, cost, and performance objectives.

It also stated that the inventory control point must  request that the depot perform a physical count once inventory  differences have met certain criteria, such as dollar value or large  quantities.  However, the various requirement documents did not   (1) define what is meant by \u201clarge\u201d or (2) specify how the notification of  the requirement to conduct the inventory was to be accomplished, for  example, by e-mail.

Traceability allows the user to follow the life of the  requirement both forward and backward through these documents and  from origin through implementation. Traceability is also critical to  understanding the parentage, interconnections, and dependencies among  the individual requirements. This information, in turn, is critical to  understanding the impact when a requirement is changed or deleted.   Without an effective traceability approach, it is very difficult to perform  actions such as (1) accurately determining the impact of changes and  making value-based decisions when considering requirement changes,   (2) maintaining the system once it goes into production, (3) tracking the  project's progress, and (4) understanding the impact of a defect discovered  during testing. For almost all of the requirements we analyzed, we found  that traceability was not maintained.  For example:  An operational requirement stated that BSM maintain the effective date  for pricing information.  The subsequent requirements document stated  that all amendments/modifications to the award instrument\u2014purchase  orders and requisitions\u2014should be documented on the prescribed  General Services Administration form.  In our analysis, we were only  able to trace portions of the requirements through BSM\u2019s hierarchical  process.

Not  carrying out this recognized best practice materially increases the risk that  defects would not be detected until the systems were placed into  production and that costly rework will be needed to satisfy end-user  requirements, including materiel readiness in support of military  operations.  Testing is the process of executing a program with the intent of  finding errors.  Furthermore, if a requirement has not been adequately  defined, it is unlikely that a test will discover a defect.  System testing is a  critical process utilized by disciplined organizations and improves an  entity\u2019s confidence that the system will satisfy the requirements of the end  user and will operate as intended.  Since requirements provide the  foundation for system testing, requirement defects discussed earlier, such  as the lack of specificity, significantly impaired and will continue to impair  the ability of DLA and the Army to detect defects during system testing.  As  a result of requirement defects and ineffective testing, DLA and the Army  testing activities did not achieve the important goal of reducing the risk  that BSM and LMP would not operate as intended.

JFMIP  testing should not be considered a substitute for individual system testing  of the actual data that will be used by the entity.  Further, JFMIP\u2019s tests of  the software do not address entity-specific integrated tests of end-to-end  transactions or system interfaces.

Additionally, we reviewed DOD\u2019s business systems  inventory, as reported by the department in April 2003, to ascertain if the  systems were identified in the budget request.  To obtain an overview of  how an IT budget request is developed, we also met with officials in the  offices of the DOD Comptroller and DOD Chief Information Officer (CIO),  as well as CIO and financial management officials from the military  services.", "To determine the effectiveness of DOD\u2019s control and accountability over its  business systems investments, we met with DOD officials to obtain an  update on the status of our prior recommendations. We also met with  appropriate officials in the DOD Comptroller and DOD CIO offices to  discuss the status of various draft policies and guidance that are aimed at  improving the department\u2019s control and accountability over business  system investments. We also reviewed and analyzed the DOD budget  requests for fiscal years 2003 through 2005 to identify the business systems  investments that could be subject to the requirements of the Bob Stump  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003, which requires  the DOD Comptroller to review all system improvements with obligations  exceeding $1 million and make a determination whether the improvement  is in accordance with criteria specified in the act.  To assess DOD\u2019s  compliance with the act, we also obtained and reviewed departmental  guidance, memorandums, DOD Comptroller review decisions, and other  documentation provided by the Business Management Systems Integration  (BMSI) office. Additionally, we requested that DOD provide us obligational  data in excess of $1 million for business systems for fiscal years 2003 and  2004, as of December 2003. We received obligational data from the military  services, but did not receive any information from the defense agencies. We  then compared the obligation data provided by the military services with  the information from the BMSI office to determine if the modernizations  were reviewed as stipulated by the act. To augment our document reviews  and analyses, we interviewed officials from various DOD organizations,  including the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller);  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Network and Information  Integration)/Chief Information Officer; Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics); and CIO and financial  management officials from the military services.", "To determine if selected DOD business system projects are being  effectively managed and will help resolve some of DOD\u2019s long-standing  business operation problems, we selected the logistics domain from which  we chose individual case studies for detailed review.  We selected the  logistics domain because it represents $770 million, or 16 percent, of  modernization funding requested in fiscal year 2004 for the department\u2019s  business systems.  The logistics domain was also selected because of its  significance to DOD operations and its long-standing and inherent  inventory and related financial management weaknesses, such as the  inability to support its inventory balances and provide total asset visibility.   We selected the Defense Logistics Agency\u2019s (DLA) Business Systems  Modernization (BSM) and the Army\u2019s Logistics Modernization Program  (LMP) for detailed review. For these two business systems, we focused on  two key processes, requirements management and testing.", "To assess whether DLA and the Army had established and implemented  disciplined processes related to requirements management and testing, we  reviewed DLA\u2019s and the Army\u2019s procedures for defining requirements  management frameworks and compared these procedures to their  current practices;  reviewed guidance published by the Institute of Electrical and  Electronics Engineers and the Software Engineering Institute and  publications by experts to determine the attributes that should be used  for developing good requirements;  reviewed BSM\u2019s system requirement documents related to finance,  order fulfillment, planning, and procurement and LMP\u2019s system  requirement documents related to planning and budget development,  asset management, inventory management, and maintenance analysis  and planning; and  selected 13 of BSM\u2019s 202 system requirements and 12 of LMP\u2019s 293  system requirements and performed an in-depth review and analysis to  determine whether they had the attributes normally associated with  good requirements and whether these requirements traced between the  various process documents.", "To augment these document reviews and analyses, we interviewed DLA  and Army program officials and Defense Finance and Accounting Service  (DFAS) officials. To identify the costs associated with BSM and LMP, we  reviewed data provided by DLA and Army program officials. We also  reviewed prior GAO, DOD Inspector General, and service auditors\u2019 reports,  as well as DOD\u2019s agencywide financial statements to obtain further  information on inventory costs.", "We conducted our work at the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller); the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics); the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense  (Network and Information Integration)/Chief Information Officer; DLA; the  Army Materiel Command; and the CIO and financial management offices  for the military services. We also visited two locations\u2014the Defense Supply  Center in Richmond, Virginia, and the Army\u2019s contractor site (Computer  Sciences Corporation) in Moorestown, New Jersey\u2014to gain an  understanding of user involvement in the development and operation of  BSM and LMP, as well as the business processes associated with each  system.", "We conducted our work from August 2003 through March 2004 in  accordance with U.S. generally accepted government auditing standards.   We did not verify the accuracy and completeness of the cost information  provided by DOD for the two projects we reviewed.", "We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Secretary of  Defense or his designee.
