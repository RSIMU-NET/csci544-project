INS estimates that about half of the illegal resident aliens in the United States during recent years have been overstays. The other half are principally persons who crossed U.S. borders illegally.", "Reliable and valid estimates of the number of overstays are important to public policy-making. Higher numbers of overstays might suggest, for example, the need for stricter policies or laws for issuing temporary U.S. visas to citizens of those countries whose travelers tend to overstay their visas in significant numbers. Higher numbers of illegal border crossers might suggest a greater need for actions such as further improving border security. Overstay data are also needed to monitor travel from countries whose citizens are not required to obtain a U.S. tourist visa."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The task of estimating overstays presents a difficult challenge.

The INS data system works as follows: Airline personnel distribute arrival/departure forms (I-94s) to foreign visitors. An INS inspector collects the arrival portion of the form as each visitor enters the United States; at that time, the inspector staples the departure form in the visitor\u2019s passport. The airlines are responsible for collecting the departure forms when visitors leave and for sending those forms to INS. But for some visitors who may have actually left the United States, INS apparently has no record of the departures. It is thus not clear, in any particular instance, whether an \u201cunrecorded departure form\u201d represents a person who overstayed or whose actual departure went uncounted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our objectives were to examine the basis of INS overstay estimates and, as appropriate, to suggest improved estimation procedures. In reviewing the agency\u2019s methodology, we examined published documents that describe INS procedures and interviewed staff about their methods of overstay estimation, the kinds of data that are available, and the potential for devising improved overstay estimates. We focused primarily on tourist air arrivals since they represent the majority of the foreign visitors in the INS data system. We developed new estimation procedures and applied them to tourist visitors arriving by air in the United States from nine countries from October 1990 to March 1991. We also talked with officials from the Department of State about their use of INS estimates and asked a number of experts to review a draft of this report.", "We conducted our review in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Analysis", "paragraphs": ["INS considers the pool of unrecorded departure forms to represent two groups of persons\u2014true overstays and uncounted departures. For true overstays, no departure forms were ever turned in because these visitors never left the United States. For uncounted departures, there was a paperwork error of some sort; that is, these visitors did leave but their departures were not counted by INS (either because the airline did not collect their departure forms or for some other reason). INS has termed the unrecorded departure forms in this latter group \u201csystem error.\u201d Earlier we noted that one could not simply assume that all unrecorded departure forms represent overstays. Here we see that some unrecorded departure forms represent system error. In short, true overstays equal unrecorded departure forms minus the number attributable to system error.", "In order to estimate true overstays, INS thus needs to estimate system error. INS does this using 11 \u201cindex countries\u201d that it believes have so few true overstays that all unrecorded departure forms can be considered uncounted departures (system error). If INS finds, for example, that 10 percent of airline travelers arriving from these index countries were not counted as departures, the agency then assumes that the percentage of uncounted airline departures is about 10 percent in all countries. That is, INS uses one estimate of the percentage of uncounted departures for all countries of the world.", "INS\u2019 specific method of estimating overstays from each country is to subtract an estimate of uncounted departures from the total number of unrecorded departure forms for each country, based on a global estimate of the proportion of departure forms that are missing because of system error. INS then totals the individual countries\u2019 overstay estimates to produce an estimate of the number of true overstays from all countries.", "While this method is creative, it makes a sweeping assumption. INS itself had characterized its procedures as more likely to overestimate than underestimate the number of overstays. Officials from the Department of State also questioned the accuracy of INS\u2019 estimates of overstays for certain countries.", "In a detailed review, we found that estimates based on INS\u2019 global approach are necessarily marked by considerable uncertainty because of the assumption that rates of system error are the same for index countries and all other countries. Although INS\u2019 procedures assume it is safe to ignore the potential for differences in system error between index countries and other countries, airline-specific data for the index countries showed evidence to the contrary: First, INS\u2019 airline-specific data confirmed that citizens of different countries tend to fly to the United States on different airlines. Second, INS\u2019 airline-specific data for index countries showed that there is substantial variation in system error across airlines.", "We also found an algebraic error in INS\u2019 computation formula.

For example, we used the rate of unrecorded departure forms for index country passengers on United Airlines to estimate system error for all United Airlines flights. We repeated this procedure, estimating system error separately for Delta Air Lines, Air Micronesia, and so forth, on the basis of index countries\u2019 data for each airline.", "Then, we estimated overstays for nonindex countries\u2014proceeding separately, country by country and airline by airline.

Essentially, we assumed that system error on United Airlines flights between the Philippines and the United States was about the same as for United Airlines flights between index countries and the United States. We made the same assumption for Air Micronesia flights, and so forth.", "For some airlines, this approach was not possible because they do not regularly fly between any index country and the United States.

That is, the known quantity for each sending country and airline is the number\u2014or percentage\u2014of unrecorded departure forms. If the percentage of unrecorded departure forms is higher for passengers on \u201cnonqualifying\u201d airlines than for passengers on \u201cqualifying\u201d airlines (as is the case for Mexico, for example), this difference is likely attributable either (1) to the fact that system error is higher for nonqualifying airlines (whereas equal overstay rates apply for passengers on both groups of airlines) or (2) to the fact that the overstay rate is higher for the nonqualifying airlines (whereas the same rate of system error applies) or (3) to some combination of higher system error and higher overstay rates for the nonqualifying airlines.

However, it is important to realize that even the range for airline-by-airline estimates described above does not take account of all sources of uncertainty. There is variation in system error across index countries\u2014even for passengers on a particular airline.

In its written comments, INS compared estimates obtained with its old and new estimation procedures.  INS concluded that (1) the two methods produced differing estimates for certain countries, and (2) the worldwide estimate of overstays obtained with its new procedures (104,000 for the visitor category and time period in question) essentially matched the number estimated with its old procedures (107,000).

Assuming that the planted travelers were instructed to be passive rather than proactive in turning in the forms, the results could be used to estimate a maximum rate of system error for the airlines or countries in question. Depending on the number of planted travelers and the design of the study, system error estimates could be obtained for selected countries, for the system as a whole, or both.", "Another type of empirical study would be a \u201cfollow-up\u201d study based on a random sample of perhaps 400 unrecorded departure forms from a specific country, airline, or other defined group. These unrecorded departure forms could be followed up in a number of ways, depending on the country in question. The initial follow-up in all cases could consist of additional checks of INS records. Then, for countries that maintain records of reentering citizens or residents, it might be possible to determine that, in some instances, the country of origin\u2019s files contained a record of the traveler\u2019s return. It also might be feasible to attempt to contact individual travelers either in their home country (after their return home) or in the United States (if they overstayed). Contacted persons might be asked a few brief questions about trips in the past 2 years (airline used, route flown, month of trip) as well as personal data (date of birth). The answers to the questions could be used to establish that the correct person had, in fact, been contacted.

This would reveal the number of departure forms that were not collected by airline personnel. Or, a complete listing of departing visitors could be made and subsequently compared to records in INS\u2019 data system. Still other types of empirical studies might be developed.

Then, if it is possible to identify an age group with virtually no overstays (one possible candidate would be persons over 50), persons from that age group could be used as the index for their own country and airline of arrival. And still assuming that system error does not vary across age groups, even if there were no particular age group for which it could be assumed that overstays were virtually nonexistent, a similar approach could nonetheless be used if additional relevant data could be obtained. That is, if an empirical estimate of system error could be obtained for at least one age group (for example, persons over 50) in a small-scale empirical study, this estimate could be applied to other age groups. (Refer back to the discussion of empirical studies above.) Of course the variable, age, is used here for illustrative purposes.", "Other analytic approaches were also suggested. For example, when frequent travelers reenter the United States, it is sometimes evident that their previous departure forms were not collected.

Estimates could be obtained separately for different countries, airlines, or other subsets of visitors.", "Sensitivity analyses were also suggested as a way of examining a variety of analytic options. For example, as one expert emphasized, negative estimates for specific airlines or countries occur when the rate of unrecorded departure forms is lower than the estimated rate of system error. Both we and INS have reported these negative estimates as zero overstays. However, one reviewer suggested that because a random component may influence these estimates, the overall estimates should be calculated without converting negative numbers to zero\u2014thus reducing the number of overstays estimated when airlines and countries are combined.

System error is much higher for land entries than for air arrivals because INS does not have facilities for collecting the I-94 forms when visitors exit by land. Nevertheless, some I-94 forms are collected for persons who arrived by land because (1) some visitors mail the forms in after returning home or turn the forms in to a U.S. embassy; (2) other visitors reenter the United States, and the INS inspector collects the old departure form at that time; and (3) still other visitors who arrived by land depart by air.", "Estimates of overstays who arrived by land, like the air arrival estimates, rely on estimates of system error based on unrecorded departure forms for visitors from index countries.

These include (1) INS\u2019 definition of a qualifying airline and (2) the way that INS derives estimates for those airlines that do not meet that definition.", "INS\u2019 definition of a qualifying airline is considerably more liberal than the definition we used. Unlike our definition, INS\u2019 includes \u201chome-country\u201d airlines that do not fly between the United States and any continent where an index country is located. We agree that expanding the number of qualifying airlines is an appropriate goal. However, stretching the airline-by-airline method (to cover such airlines as A L Argentina, Lan Chile, Avianca, Mexicana de Aviacion, and Aero Mexico) means relying on estimates that are driven by two categories of index countries\u2019 travelers that we believe may be atypical.", "The first category consists of European and Japanese members of the international business community who reside in Latin America and visit the United States as tourists. Our concern is that this category may consist mainly of experienced international travelers who might be proactive in turning in departure forms. And if they visit the United States frequently (especially, if they reenter this country within 9 months of the expiration of their initial visa), then any uncollected departure forms\u2014which should still be stapled in their passports\u2014would be collected by INS inspectors and transferred to the INS database. Relying heavily on this category of index countries\u2019 travelers might, therefore, result in an underestimate of system error for the home-country airlines in question and a consequent overestimation of overstays.", "The second category consists mainly of European and Japanese tourists on multilegged trips. Our concern is that relying heavily on this category of index countries\u2019 passengers might result in estimates of system error for the wrong airlines. The reason is that the airline-by-airline approach necessarily assumes that the airline of arrival is the same as the airline of departure. But, when compared to passengers with a simple round-trip itinerary, \u201cworld travelers\u201d on trips that cover three continents (for example, Europe, the United States, and South America) seem more likely to depart the United States on a different airline from the one on which they arrived. In fact, according to one expert, few airlines are licensed for routes both (1) between Europe or Japan and the United States and (2) between Latin American countries and the United States. This raises the possibility that INS\u2019 estimates of system error for airlines like Avianca may, in fact, reflect rates for other airlines (Lufthansa, Japan Air Lines, and so forth).", "Turning to INS\u2019 estimation of overstays among passengers arriving on airlines it classifies as nonqualifying, we are concerned that, whereas we used two alternative assumptions, INS used only one (our assumption 2, as described in table 1 on p. 8). Overall, of course, only 5 percent of tourist air arrivals use airlines that do not qualify under INS\u2019 liberal definition.But that 5 percent may include citizens of countries marked by high overstay rates, such as Poland. Use of assumption 1 versus assumption 2 could make a difference of roughly 2,000 overstays for Poland. We believe a range of estimates based on two alternative assumptions might be more meaningful. The need for such a range would be most apparent for sensitivity analyses that omit certain large index countries (such as Japan) or that use a stricter definition of qualifying airlines."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Improvements May Be Possible", "paragraphs": ["The third issue is that some uncertainties are common to our estimates and INS\u2019\u2014and that improvements aimed at reducing these uncertainties may be possible. For example, passengers from seemingly typical index countries may not, in general, represent the true level of system error for passengers from nonindex countries\u2014even when traveling on the same airline. Another example is that both we and INS converted negative overstay estimates, which occur for several countries and airlines, to zero overstay estimates. However, because a random component may influence these estimates, it might be preferable to calculate combined-airline and combined-countries estimates without converting the negative numbers to zero. (See p. 41.) The effect of this change would be to reduce the number of estimated overstays.", "The special analyses, empirical studies, and more complex models suggested by experts who reviewed this report could shed light on these issues. (See pp. 38-42.)

That is, one set of our estimates is based on the assumption that the same overstay rate characterizes (1) passengers on airlines for which a separate estimate of system error is possible (our qualifying airlines) and (2) passengers from the same country who used other airlines. In its written comments, INS indicated it has empirical evidence that our assumption 1 is incorrect, but did not present that evidence.", "We know of no direct way to check the assumption of equal overstay rates for qualifying and nonqualifying airlines. Thus, we presented a second alternative set of estimates for the same countries, based on a very different assumption (assumption 2 in table 1). INS also questioned assumption 2. However, when assumptions 1 and 2 are used as the basis for alternative estimates, there is a specific logic that we believe justifies the use of these assumptions.
