Second, USAID and State categorized projects in their respective QRF databases by thematic goal. Third, the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and its Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) conducted outreach to inform potential beneficiaries of the availability of assistance through the QRF program. Fourth, PRTs or the QRF implementing partner conducted final site visits and prepared project close-out reports. Fifth, both USAID and State conducted third-party assessments at the close of their respective components of the QRF program.

Some communities may be an ethnic majority but a  religious minority (such as Arab Christians), while other communities may  be an ethnic minority but a religious majority (such as Shi\u2019a Shabaks). For  the purpose of this report, we refer to the following religious and ethnic  communities as minority groups: Anglican, Armenian, Assyrian, Baptist,  Chaldean, Coptic, Greek Orthodox, Latin Catholic, Presbyterians, Sabean  Mandaean, Shabak, Syriac, Turkoman, and Yazidi.", "Since 2003, Iraq\u2019s minority groups have experienced religiously and  ethnically motivated intimidation, arbitrary detention, killings, abductions,  and forced displacements, as well as attacks on holy sites and religious  leaders.

According to  nongovernmental organizations, religious minorities make up a significant  portion of those migrating from locations in southern Iraq to locations in  northern Iraq, such as the Ninewa plain region. The International  Organization for Migration reports that, in 2010, in the provinces of  Dahuk, Erbil, and Ninewa, 49 percent, 24 percent, and 35 percent,  respectively, of the internally displaced population were Christian.  According to nongovernmental organizations, religious minority groups  face increased marginalization and are less able to access public  services or employment because of ethnic or religious prejudices. The  United Nations reports that, between 2003 and 2005, 36 percent of the  Iraqis seeking refugee status in Syria were Christian. In 2007, Iraq\u2019s  Ministry of Displacement and Migration estimated that nearly half of the  minority communities had left the country. According to the U.S.  Commission on International Religious Freedom, at least half of the  Christians in Iraq have left the country since 2003.
