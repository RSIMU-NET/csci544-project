Although bus crashes are relatively rare, they are particularly deadly since many individuals may be involved. FMCSA tries to identify unsafe motor coach carriers and take them off the road. GAO was asked to determine (1) to the extent possible, the number of motor coach carriers registered with FMCSA as new entrants in fiscal years 2007 and 2008 that are substantially related to or in essence the same carriers the agency previously ordered out of service, and (2) what tools FMCSA uses to identify reincarnated carriers. To identify new entrants that were substantially related to carriers placed out of service, we analyzed FMCSA data to find matches on key fields (e.g., ownership, phone numbers, etc.). Our analysis understates the actual number of reincarnated carriers because, among other things, the matching scheme used cannot detect minor spelling changes or other deception efforts. We interviewed FMCSA officials on how the agency identifies reincarnated carriers. GAO is not making any recommendations.

This represents about 9 percent of the approximately 220 motor coach carriers that FMCSA placed out of service during these two fiscal years. The number of likely reincarnated motor carriers is understated, in part, because our analysis was based on exact matches and also could not identify owners who purposely provided FMCSA deceptive information on the application (e.g., ownership) to hide the reincarnation from the agency. Although the number of reincarnated motor coach carriers that we could identify was small, these companies pose a safety threat to the motoring public. According to FMCSA officials, under registration and enforcement policies up to summer 2008, reincarnation was relatively simple to do and hard to detect. As a result, motor coach carriers known to be safety risks were continuing to operate. According to FMCSA data, five of the twenty bus companies were still in operation as of May 2009. We referred these cases to FMCSA for further investigation. The twenty cases that we identified as likely reincarnations were registered with FMCSA at the time that FMCSA did not have any dedicated controls in place to prevent motor coach carriers from reincarnating. In 2008, FMCSA instituted a process to identify violators by checking applicant information against those of poor-performing carriers. For example, if FMCSA finds a new entrant with a shared owner name or company address for an out-of-service company, the agency will make inquiries to determine if the new applicant is related to the out-of-service carrier. If such a determination is made, FMCSA still faces legal hurdles, such as proving corporate successorship, to deny the company operating authority."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["On August 8, 2008, a bus carrying a group of people on a religious  pilgrimage crashed in Sherman, Texas, killing 17 people and injuring 15  others.

The driver lost control of the bus, struck a curb, and crashed  through the guardrail of a bridge. The bus fell about 8 feet, landed on its  right side and slid about 24 feet. Twelve passengers died at the scene,  while five others died after being taken to nearby hospitals. The carrier  that operated the bus was the reincarnation of a motor coach company  that had been deemed unsafe and ordered out of service by the Federal  Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) 2 months prior to the  accident. The new company registered with FMCSA using the same  physical and mailing addresses as the carrier ordered out of service. At the  time of the crash, the carrier did not have proper operating authority from  FMCSA, because it had not yet designated a process agent or provided  proof of insurance to FMCSA. Thus, specifying a process agent and  providing proof of insurance were the only steps standing in the way of the  new company obtaining operating authority from FMCSA.", "According to FMCSA, in 2008 about 300 fatalities occurred nationwide  associated with motor coach carriers. In an attempt to reduce the number  and severity of crashes involving buses, FMCSA seeks to identify unsafe  motor coach carriers and take them off the road.

It carries out this mission in the following ways: issuing,  administering, and enforcing federal motor carrier safety and hazardous  materials regulations; and gathering and analyzing data on motor carriers,  drivers, and vehicles, among other things. FMCSA also takes enforcement  actions and funds and oversees enforcement activities at the state level  through Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program grants.", "For-hire motor carriers are required to register with FMCSA and obtain  federal operating authority before operating in interstate commerce.  Applicants for passenger carrier operating authority must submit certain  information to FMCSA, including contact information and U.S.  Department of Transportation (DOT) number, and must certify that they  have in place mandated safety procedures. After publication of the  applicant\u2019s information in the FMCSA Register, a 10-calendar-day period  begins in which anyone can challenge the application. Within 90 days of  the publication, the carrier\u2019s insurance company must file proof of the  carrier\u2019s insurance with FMCSA. Applicants must also designate a process  agent, a representative upon whom court orders may be served in any  legal proceeding. After FMCSA has approved the application, insurance,  and process agent filings, and the protest period has ended without any  protests, applicants are issued operating authority.", "FMCSA ensures that carriers, including motor coach carriers, comply with  safety regulations primarily through compliance reviews of carriers  already in the industry and safety audits of carriers that have recently  started operations. Compliance reviews and safety audits help FMCSA  determine whether carriers are complying with its safety regulations and,  if not, to take enforcement action against them, including placing carriers  out of service. FMCSA makes its compliance determination based on  performance in six areas: one area is the carrier\u2019s crash rate, and the other  five areas involve the carrier\u2019s compliance with regulations, such as  insurance coverage, driver qualifications, and vehicle maintenance and  inspections.", "Carriers are assigned one of three Carrier Safety Ratings based on their  compliance with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSR).  These ratings include \u201csatisfactory,\u201d for a motor carrier that has in place  and functioning adequate safety management controls to meet federal  safety fitness standards; \u201cconditional,\u201d for a motor carrier that does not  have adequate safety management controls in place to ensure compliance  with the safety fitness standard, that could result in a violation of federal  safety regulations; or \u201cunsatisfactory,\u201d for a motor carrier that does not  have adequate safety management controls in place to ensure compliance  with the safety fitness standard, which has resulted in a violation of  federal safety regulations.", "Carriers receiving an unsatisfactory rating have either 45 days (for carriers  transporting hazardous materials in quantities that require placarding or  transporting passengers) or 60 days (for all other carriers) to address the  safety concerns. If a carrier fails to demonstrate it has taken corrective  action acceptable to FMCSA, FMCSA will revoke its new entrant  registration and issue an out-of-service order, which prohibits the carrier  from operating until the violations are corrected. Further fines are  assessed if it is discovered that it is operating despite the out-of-service  order.", "Federal law requires new carriers to undergo a new-entrant safety audit  within 18 months of when the company begins to operate. Carriers are  then monitored on an ongoing basis using various controls that include but  are not limited to annual vehicle inspections and driver qualification  regulations. However, FMCSA may suspend a company or vehicle\u2019s  operation at any time by ordering it out of service if it determines that an  imminent safety hazard exists. (An imminent hazard means any condition  of vehicle, employee, or commercial motor vehicle operations which  substantially increases the likelihood of serious injury or death if not  discontinued immediately.) In addition, FMCSA orders carriers out of  service for failure to pay civil penalties levied by FMCSA, failing to take  required corrective actions related to prior compliance reviews, or failing  to schedule a safety audit. Out-of-service carriers are supposed to cease  operations and not resume operations until FMCSA determines that they  have corrected the conditions that rendered them out of service. If a  carrier fails to comply with or disregards an out-of-service order, FMCSA  may assess a civil monetary penalty each time a vehicle is operated in  violation of the order.", "FMCSA and state law enforcement agencies use several methods to ensure  that carriers ordered out of service, including motor coach companies, do  not continue to operate. For example, FMCSA and its state partners  monitor data on roadside inspections, moving violations, and crashes to  identify carriers that may be violating an out-of-service order. FMCSA will  visit some suspect carriers that it identifies by monitoring crash and  inspection data to determine whether those carriers violated their orders.  Also, recently, the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance began to require  checking for carriers operating under an out-of-service order during  roadside inspections and to take enforcement action against any that are.  However, given the large size of the industry, the nation\u2019s extensive road  network, and the relatively small size of federal and state enforcement  staffs, it is difficult to catch motor coach carriers that are violating out-of- service orders. In addition, some carriers change their identities by  changing their names and obtaining new DOT numbers\u2014these carriers  are generally referred to as reincarnating carriers\u2014to avoid being caught."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reincarnated Motor Carriers Exist", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of FMCSA data for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 identified 20  motor coach companies that likely reincarnated from \u201cout-of-service\u201d  carriers. This represents about 9 percent of the approximately 220 motor  coach carriers that FMCSA ordered out of service for those fiscal years.  The analysis was based on two or more exact matches of data for the new  entrant with the data for the out-of-service carriers on the following  categories: company name, owner/officer name, address, phone number,  cell phone number, fax number, vehicle identification number, and driver  names. These 20 motor coach companies registered with FMCSA before  FMCSA developed processes specifically for detecting reincarnated bus  companies that were established subsequent to the Sherman, Texas, crash  (see next section). The number of potential reincarnated motor coach  carriers is understated because (1) our analysis was based on exact  matches, so it could not find links if abbreviations were used or typos  occurred in the data, (2) FMCSA only provided us data on vehicles and  drivers when an accident or inspection took place, and thus the provided  FMCSA data does not include the entire population of vehicles or drivers  for either new entrants or out-of-service carriers, and (3) our analysis  could not identify owners who purposely provided FMCSA bogus or  otherwise deceptive information on the application (e.g., ownership) to  hide the reincarnation from the agency.

Our investigation found one of them had not received a safety  evaluation and two carriers had been given a conditional rating after the  agency determined its safety management controls were inadequate. The  remaining two motor coach carriers were deemed satisfactory in a FMCSA  compliance review because FMCSA inspectors were likely not aware of  the potential reincarnations. We referred all five companies to FMCSA for  further investigation. Based on our review of FMCSA data, we found that  the agency already identified six of the 20 reincarnated motor coach  carriers and ordered them out of service. The agency discovered them  while performing a crash investigation (as in the case of the bus accident  in Sherman, Texas), compliance reviews, or other processes. In addition,  new carriers are subject to a safety audit within 18 months.", "Several of the reincarnated carriers we identified were small businesses  located in states neighboring Mexico and making trips across the border.  Our investigation also determined that all of the reincarnated motor coach  carriers we identified were directly related to companies that received  fines for safety problems shortly before being ordered out of service.  Based on our analysis of the FMCSA data, we believe they reincarnated to  avoid paying these fines and continue their livelihood. For example, we  found instances where carriers continued to operate despite being ordered  out of service for failure to pay their fines. In fact, one carrier was  operating for several months after being placed out of service. We believe  that these carriers reincarnated into new companies to evade fines and  avoid performing the necessary corrective actions.", "We attempted to contact the owners to ask why they reincarnated but  were unable to reach many of them. For the six owners that we did  interview none said that they had shut down their old companies and  opened new ones to evade the out-of-service orders.", "Table 1 summarizes information on 10 of the 20 cases that we investigated.  Appendix II provides details on 10 others we examined. Appendix III  provides a summary of the key data elements that matched on the new  entrants that were substantially related to out-of-service carriers.", "The following narratives provide detailed information on three of the more  egregious cases we examined.", "Case 1: The owner of a Houston motor coach company registered a new  carrier with the same phone number, fax number, and cell phone number  as the old one. The new company started in March 2007, 8 months before  FMCSA ordered the old company out of service. The two companies  appear to have operated simultaneously for a period of time. Six days after  the new company was formed, a motor coach carrying 16 passengers  operated by the old company was stopped and inspected on the United  States\u2013Mexico border at Laredo, Texas. The old company was charged  with five violations, including \u201cOperating without required operating  authority.\u201d The old company owes $2,000 in fines. Our investigators  contacted one of the owner\u2019s daughters. She stated that her mother was  arrested for possessing drugs when she crossed the border from Mexico  into the United States, and that her mother subsequently opened another  bus company using another daughter\u2019s name. The daughter said she was  not involved with the bus company. In 2008, the new carrier\u2019s new entrant  registration was revoked and the owner was convicted of cocaine  possession.", "Case 2: The owner of a New York motor coach company located at a  church registered a new carrier using the same fax number, driver, and  vehicle as the old one. FMCSA conducted a compliance review for the old  company on May 30, 2007. Five safety violations were identified, including  one \u201cAcute\u201d violation for \u201cFailure to implement an alcohol and/or  controlled substances testing program.\u201d The old company, which was  ordered out of service in October 2007 for failing to pay a fine, still has  $2,000 in outstanding fines as of May 2009. On August 9, 2007,  approximately 2 months prior to FMCSA ordering the old company out of  service, a new carrier was established with the same company officer  name and fax number as the old carrier. The location of the old carrier  was a school, which was associated with (and located next door to) the  church. The owner of the new company claimed that the old company  belonged to his father, not him, and that it was a \u201ccompletely different  business from his own.\u201d FMCSA records clearly show that this is not the  case. The new owner is listed as \u201cVice President\u201d of the old company, and  \u201cPresident\u201d of the new company. The owner of the new company is also  cited as being present during the Compliance Review conducted on May  30, 2007. The new company registered with FMCSA in August 2007 and  FMCSA has not conducted a new-entrant safety audit of the new carrier as  of July 2009, exceeding FMCSA\u2019s internal goal of 9 months.", "Case 3: The owner of a Los Angeles motor coach company registered a  new carrier using the same social security number, business name, phone  number, fax number, and company officer as the old one. FMCSA  conducted a compliance review on the old company in December 2006,  resulting in an \u201cUnsatisfactory\u201d safety rating. The review cited 11 safety  violations, including one \u201cAcute\u201d violation for \u201cFailure to implement an  alcohol and/or controlled substances testing program\u201d and four \u201cCritical\u201d  violations for failure to maintain driver and vehicle records. Since the old  company did not take the necessary steps to fix the violations within 45  days, it was ordered out of service in February 2007. A month later a motor  coach operated by the old company was inspected in Douglas, Arizona.  The company was charged with operating a commercial motor vehicle  after the effective date of an \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d rating and fined $5,620.", "The same owner started the new company in June 2008. FMCSA  conducted a compliance review on the new carrier and gave it a  \u201csatisfactory\u201d safety rating in October 2008. FMCSA officials stated that  they were not aware of any affiliation with the previous company. Our  investigators visited the place of business of the new carrier, which was  being run out of a retail store. Although the old carrier was out of service,  several brochures and business cards for the old carrier were displayed on  the store\u2019s counter, showing the same phone number as the new company.  We attempted to contact the owner, but the business representative stated  that the owner was currently in Mexico as the driver on a bus tour and  could not be contacted.

In the application,  the owner could include the same business name, address, phone  number(s), and company officer(s) that already existed under the out-of- service DOT carrier. FMCSA did not have a process to identify these  situations, and, thus, FMCSA would have granted the new entrant  operating authority upon submission of the appropriate registration data.", "Subsequent to the Sherman crash, FMCSA established the Passenger  Carrier Vetting Process (PCVP), which requires the review of each new  application for the potential of being a reincarnation. Under this process,  FMCSA executes a computer matching process to compare information  contained in the motor coach carrier\u2019s application to data of poor- performing motor coach carriers dating back to 2003. Specifically, it  performs an exact match on the application with fields in nine categories  across various FMCSA databases. This produces a list of suspect carriers  and the number of matches in each category, which serve as indicators for  further investigation. FMCSA officials stated that they have begun to  enhance the computer-matching portion of the PCVP process. Specifically,  the system will also be able to match fields that are close, but not  necessarily exact matches of each other. For instance, \u201cJohn P. Smith Jr.\u201d  would match \u201cJohn Smith,\u201d and \u201cMaple Ln.\u201d would match \u201cMaple Lane.\u201d  This enhancement should improve its ability to detect those carriers  attempting to disguise their prior registration.", "In addition to the computer matching, FMCSA Headquarters personnel  receive and review each new carrier application for completeness and  accuracy. It reviews the application for any red flags or evidence the  company is a potentially unsafe reincarnated motor coach carrier. For  example, the FMCSA staff check secretaries of state databases for the  articles of incorporation to identify undisclosed owners. If the computer- matching process or FMCSA Division Office review identifies any  suspected motor coach carriers attempting to reincarnate, FMCSA sends a  Verification Inquiry letter to the applicant requesting clarification. If the  carrier does not respond to the Verification Inquiry Letter within 20 days,  the application will be dismissed. If the response to the letter shows the  applicant is attempting to reincarnate, FMCSA issues a Show Cause Order  stating that the application for authority will be denied unless the carrier  can present evidence to the contrary. If the application is not completed,  FMCSA dismisses the application and thus no authority is given.", "After the carrier is approved to operate, FMCSA requires all new carriers,  including motor coach carriers, to undergo a safety audit within 18 months  of approval. During this review, FMCSA should identify whether the new  motor coach company is a reincarnation of a prior carrier. Although we  did not specifically evaluate the effectiveness of the new-entrant audit  process, we found two cases where FMCSA did not identify new motor  coach carriers as reincarnations of companies it had ordered out of  service and after the PCVP went into effect.

Another limitation to  PRISM\u2019s effectiveness is that it only includes vehicles that register under a  protocol known as the International Registration Plan (IRP)\u2014which  pertains only to carriers involved in interstate commerce.
