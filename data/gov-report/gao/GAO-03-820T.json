Most of this assistance has been delivered and is being used for counternarcotics operations. In recent years, the Colombian National Police aerial eradication program has had mixed results. Since 1995, coca cultivation rose in every year until 2002 and opium poppy cultivation remained relatively steady until 2001. But, for 2002, the U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy reported that net coca cultivation in Colombia decreased 15 percent and net opium poppy cultivation decreased 25 percent--the second yearly decline in a row. U.S. officials attributed this success primarily to the Colombian government's willingness to eradicate coca and poppy plants without restriction. Although the U.S.-supported counternarcotics program in Colombia has recently begun to achieve some of the results envisioned in Plan Colombia, Colombia and the United States must continue to deal with financial and management challenges. Neither the Colombian Army nor the Colombian National Police can sustain ongoing counternarcotics programs without continued U.S. funding and contractor support for the foreseeable future. According to U.S. embassy officials, these programs alone may cost up to $230 million per year, and future costs for some other programs have not been determined. Because of overall poor economic conditions, the government of Colombia's ability to contribute more is limited, but the continuing violence from Colombia's long-standing insurgency limits the government's ability to institute economic, social, and political improvements. Moreover, Colombia faces continuing challenges associated with the need to ensure it complies with human rights standards and other requirements in order for U.S. assistance to continue. As GAO noted in 2000, the total costs of the counternarcotics programs in Colombia were unknown. Nearly 3 years later, the Departments of State and Defense have still not developed estimates of future program costs, defined their future roles in Colombia, identified a proposed end state, or determined how they plan to achieve it."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here to discuss GAO\u2019s work on U.S. counternarcotics  assistance to Colombia.

According to State,  Colombia provides 90 percent of the cocaine and about 40 percent of the  heroin entering the United States. The Drug Enforcement Administration  reports that several billion dollars flow into Colombia each year from the  cocaine trade alone, and this vast amount of drug money has helped the  country\u2019s two largest insurgency groups\uf8e7the Revolutionary Armed Forces  of Colombia and the National Liberation Army\uf8e7gain unprecedented  economic, political, and social power and influence. The insurgents  exercise some degree of control over 40 percent of Colombia\u2019s territory  east and south of the Andes where much of the coca is grown.", "In an effort to address the influx of cocaine and heroin from Colombia, the  United States has funded a counternarcotics strategy in Colombia that  includes programs for interdiction, eradication, and alternative  development, which must be carefully coordinated to achieve mutually  reinforcing results. Besides assistance for the Colombian Army  counternarcotics brigade and the Colombian National Police aerial  eradication program, the United States has supported Colombian efforts to  interdict illicit-drug trafficking along rivers and in the air as well as  alternative development, judicial sector reform, and internally displaced  persons programs. The Departments of Defense and State have provided  most of the funding and State, through its Bureau for International  Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs and Narcotics Affairs Section in  the U.S. Embassy Bogot\u00e1, oversees the program.

The United States provided the  counternarcotics brigade with about $45 million in training and  equipment\u2014from weapons and ammunition to rations, uniforms, and  canteens. The brigade\u2019s primary mission was to plan and conduct  interdiction operations against drug-trafficking activities, including  destroying illicit drug-producing facilities, and, when called upon, to  provide security in insurgent-controlled areas where aerial eradication  operations were planned. According to U.S. and Colombian officials, the  brigade was highly effective in 2001\uf8e7for example, it destroyed 25 cocaine  hydrochloride laboratories\uf8e7but was less successful in 2002, when it  destroyed only 4 such labs. U.S. embassy officials stated that the brigade  became less effective because the insurgents moved their drug-producing  activities, such as the laboratories, beyond the brigade\u2019s reach. In addition,  according to these officials, the brigade became more involved in  protecting infrastructure, such as bridges and power stations, and  performing base security. Moreover, the aerial eradication program did not  call on the brigade to provide ground security on very many occasions,  essentially planning spray missions in the less threatening areas.", "In August 2002, U.S. embassy and Colombian military officials agreed to  restructure the brigade to make it a rapid reaction force capable of making  quick, tactical strikes on a few days\u2019 notice. As part of this restructuring,  the Colombian Army designated the brigade a national asset capable of  operating anywhere in Colombia rather than just in its prior area of  responsibility in southern Colombia. The newly restructured brigade  consists of three combat battalions and a support battalion with a total of  about 1,900 soldiers, all of whom are professional. Two of the combat  battalions have been retrained. The third combat battalion should be  retrained by mid-June 2003. This change, according to U.S. embassy and  Colombian Army officials, will improve the brigade\u2019s ability to conduct  operations against high-value, drug-trafficking targets, such as laboratories  containing cocaine and the leadership of insurgent groups involved in  drug-trafficking activities.

However, not all the funding could be  released until the Secretary of State certified, in two separate reports to  appropriate congressional committees, that the Colombian military was  making progress meeting certain human rights conditions. Because State  was late in providing these reports, the U.S. embassy could not use this  funding for operations and training on two occasions for a total of about  5 months during 2002.

They also noted that  the number of spray aircraft had increased from 10 in July 2001 to 17 in  January 2003; recently acquired spray aircraft can carry up to twice the herbicide as the  older aircraft; and   as of January 2003, aircraft were flying spray missions from three forward  operating locations\u2014a first for the program.", "The ability to keep an increased number of spray aircraft operating out of  three bases was made possible, at least in part, because the U.S. embassy  hired a contractor to work with the Colombian National Police to, among  other things, help maintain their aircraft. As a result, the availability of  police aircraft for the spray program increased. Moreover, in August 2002,  the Colombian government allowed the police to return to a higher  strength herbicide mixture that, according to embassy officials, improved  the spray\u2019s effectiveness. These officials project that the aerial eradication  program can reduce the amount of coca and poppy cultivation to 30,000  hectares and 5,000 hectares, respectively, by 2005 or 2006, assuming the  police continue the current pace and can spray in all areas of Colombia."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Colombian National Police Have Not Assumed Control over Aerial Eradication Operations", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in 2000, beginning in 1998, U.S. embassy officials became  concerned with the rising U.S. presence in Colombia and the associated  costs of the aerial eradication program.
