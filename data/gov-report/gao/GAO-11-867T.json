One type of proposed consumption tax is a value-added tax (VAT), widely used around the world. A VAT is levied on the difference between a business's sales and its purchases of goods and services. Typically, a business calculates the tax due on its sales, subtracts a credit for taxes paid on its purchases, and remits the difference to the government. While the economic and distributional effects of a U.S. VAT type tax have been studied, GAO issued a report in 2008 that looked at lessons learned from VAT administration in Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. These countries provided a range of VAT designs from relatively simple to more complex. This statement, which is based on the 2008 report, focuses on (1) the effect VAT design choices, such as exemptions and enforcement mechanisms, have on compliance, administrative costs, and compliance burden; (2) Canada's experience with administering a VAT in conjunction with several different subnational consumption tax arrangements; and (3) the experience that some countries had transitioning to a VAT."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["VATs have grown in popularity over the past five decades with recent estimates showing more than 130 countries worldwide using a VAT. Nonetheless, like other tax systems, even a simple VAT--one that exempts no goods or services--has compliance risks and, largely as a consequence, generates administrative costs and compliance burden. For example, all of the study countries reported devoting significant enforcement resources to compliance issues. Like an income tax, VATs can be vulnerable to compliance schemes that either result in undercollection of taxes due or overclaiming of credits for taxes paid. Also, as with other taxes, adding tax preferences--such as exempting certain goods or services from tax--generally decreases revenue, increases complexity, and increases compliance risks. Increased complexity also increases the record-keeping burden on businesses and government resources needed for enforcement. Canada's experience administering a national VAT along with a variety of provincial VATs and sales taxes demonstrates that multiple arrangements in a federal system are feasible, but increase administrative costs and compliance challenges for both governments and businesses. Businesses, particularly retailers, in provinces with a sales tax face greater compliance burdens than those in other provinces because they are subject to dual reporting, filing, and remittance requirements. When implementing their VAT, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand all devoted considerable resources to educate and assist businesses subject to the new tax. Both Australia and Canada provided direct monetary assistance to qualifying small businesses to help meet new bookkeeping and reporting requirements. Both had trouble getting businesses to register for the VAT by the implementation date."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here to discuss our prior work on the lessons the  United States can learn from other countries\u2019 experiences with a value- added tax, or VAT.VATs have grown in popularity over the past five  decades with recent estimates showing more than 130 countries  worldwide using a VAT.

Part of  this debate has involved switching to a consumption tax or combining a  consumption tax with an income tax. One type of consumption tax that  some have proposed is a VAT. A VAT is applied to the difference  between a business\u2019s sales of goods and services and its purchases of  goods and services (excluding wages). Thus, businesses pay tax only on  the value they add to the goods or services they sell. Unlike retail sales  taxes, VATs are collected at all stages of production and distribution  process. All types of businesses, not just retail businesses, are subject to  the tax, and sales to both consumers and other businesses are taxable.", "My testimony today will discuss five countries\u2019 experiences with their  VATs. These study countries are Australia, Canada, France, New  Zealand, and the United Kingdom. They represent a range of VAT design  options from relatively simple to more complex and include some with  federal systems and some that recently implemented a VAT. Specifically,  I will cover (1) the effect that VAT design choices, such as the number of  tax rates and tax exemptions, have on compliance, administrative costs,  and compliance burden; (2) Canada\u2019s experiences with administering a  national VAT in conjunction with several different subnational  consumption tax arrangements; (3) the experiences that countries had  transitioning to a VAT; and (4) our concluding observations on the  lessons the United States can learn from these countries\u2019 experiences.", "This testimony is based on our report issued in 2008. Although some time  has passed since our report was released, the challenges that our study  countries encountered in implementing and administering VAT systems  remain insightful to the United States should it consider a national  consumption tax. For that report we selected our study countries based  on several criteria, including the complexity of VAT design, the age of the  VAT system, and whether the country had a federal system. For each  country, we performed in-depth literature reviews and conducted  extensive interviews of government officials and VAT experts. We also  collected and analyzed documents and data on the countries and their  VAT systems. Additional information on our scope and methodology is  available in our published report.", "We conducted the performance audit work that supports this statement in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

VAT liability is typically  calculated in industrialized countries using what is known as the credit- invoice method. Under this method, businesses apply the VAT rate to  their sales but claim a credit for VAT paid on purchases of inputs from  other businesses (shown on purchase invoices). The difference between  the VAT collected on sales and the credit for VAT paid on input  purchases is remitted to the government.", "Figure 1 illustrates a VAT with a 10 percent rate. A lumber company cuts  and mills trees and has sales of $50 to a furniture maker. Assuming no  input purchases from other businesses, to keep the illustration simple, the  company adds the tax to the price of the goods sold and remits $5 in tax  to the government. The purchase invoice received by the furniture maker  would list $50 in purchases plus $5 in VAT paid.", "If the furniture maker has sales of $120 to a retail store, $12 of VAT would  be added to the sales price but the furniture maker could subtract a credit  for the $5 VAT paid on purchases and remit $7 to the government. The  retailer would receive an invoice showing purchases of $120 and $12 of  VAT. Similarly, if the retailer then has sales of $150, $15 of VAT would be  added but the retailer could subtract a credit for the $12 paid on  purchases and remit $3 to the government.", "In total, the government would receive VAT equal to 10 percent of the  final sales price to consumers. Thus, a 10 percent VAT is equivalent to a  10 percent retail sales tax in terms of revenue. Under both taxes, the final  consumer ultimately bears the economic burden of the tax ($15), except  in a VAT, the tax is collected in stages, not just in the final sale."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Like Other Taxes, VATs Have Compliance Risks, Administrative Costs, and Compliance Burden That Increase with the Complexity of the Design", "paragraphs": ["Our study countries\u2019 experiences with noncompliance suggest that even a  conceptually simple VAT\u2014one that applies a single tax rate to all goods  and services\u2014would have compliance risks and would generate  significant administrative costs and compliance burden.

All of our study  countries were concerned about illegitimate businesses or fraudsters  submitting fraudulent refund claims that result in the theft of funds from  the government. In the case of a missing trader, a business is set up for  the sole purpose of collecting VAT on sales and then disappearing with  the proceeds.", "Because of compliance risks, even simple VATs require enforcement  activities, such as audits and record keeping by businesses, that create  administrative costs for the government and compliance burden for  businesses.

The drivers of administrative costs in many tax systems  include the number of taxpayers (businesses, individuals, or both) subject  to the tax, how often they file returns, and the percentage of taxpayers  audited. In the case of a VAT, administration requires the government to  process tax returns and provide certain services to businesses. Even a  simple VAT warrants education and assistance services, in part to  address compliance risks. Tax administrators also need to spend  significant resources on audit and enforcement activities.", "Some available data from our study countries indicate a VAT may be less  expensive and easier to administer than an income tax. In 2006, the tax  administration agency in the United Kingdom measured administrative  costs for the VAT to be approximately half a percent of revenue collected  compared to over one and a quarter percent for the income tax. Officials  at the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department also told us that  administering their VAT was easier than administering some of their other  taxes.

Tax preferences\u2014 also called tax expenditures\u2014result in foregone tax revenue due to  preferential provisions that generally shrink the tax base. Tax preferences  can also exist in other tax systems, such as income taxes or retail sales  taxes. In our study countries, some economic sectors, such as certain  consumer essentials like food and health care and public-sector  organizations are often provided VAT preferences because of social or  political considerations.

However, some  preferences, such as thresholds for businesses, may not increase  administrative costs and compliance burden because they reduce the  number of entities subject to VAT requirements. Additionally, in most  study countries, certain financial-services and real-estate transactions are  exempt for administrative purposes, which could result in reduced  compliance burden.", "VAT preferences used in our study countries included exemptions,  exclusions, and thresholds. An exempt good or service is not taxed when  sold, and businesses that sell exempt goods or services cannot claim  input tax credits for inputs used in producing the exempt output. While no  VAT is collected with the final sale, the government still collects tax  revenue throughout the stages of production. Tax is paid and collected on  inputs. In contrast, excluding a good or service, more commonly referred  to as zero rating, removes it entirely from the tax base resulting in an  effective tax rate of zero. For goods and services that are zero-rated, VAT  that was paid in the production of the good or service can be fully  recovered through input tax credits. As a consequence, no net VAT  revenue is actually collected by the government from the sale of zero- rated goods and services.", "A threshold is a type of exemption that excludes businesses below a  certain size from collecting and remitting VAT and from being able to  claim input tax credits.

Tax preferences\u2014in the  form of exemptions, zero rates, or reduced rates\u2014often reduce revenue,  add complexity, and increase compliance risks. To mitigate the increased  risk, countries have imposed additional record-keeping and reporting  requirements on businesses, delayed refunds, and done more auditing of  businesses.
