Federal  cultural resource laws include the Native American Graves Protection and  Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), the Archaeological Resources Protection Act  of 1979 (ARPA), and section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act  (NHPA). These acts and their implementing regulations cover different  cultural resources, including Native American cultural resources, but all  require federal agencies to consult with federally recognized Indian tribes  in certain circumstances. According to the National Congress of American  Indians, federal consultation with tribes can help to minimize potential  negative impacts of federal infrastructure projects on tribes\u2019 natural  resources and cultural resources, which may include cultural items  protected by NAGPRA and archaeological resources subject to ARPA.  Federal agencies are to consult with tribes on many infrastructure  projects and other federal activities. For example, infrastructure projects,  such as constructing pipelines, may involve various federal activities that  trigger statutory and regulatory tribal consultation requirements.", "As Congress found in the Indian Trust Asset Reform Act, \u201cthrough  treaties, statutes, and historical relations with Indian tribes, the United  States has undertaken a unique trust responsibility to protect and support  Indian tribes and Indians.\u201d The act also notes that the historic federal- tribal relations and understandings have benefited the people of the  United States for centuries and established \u201cenduring and enforceable  ederal obligations to which the national honor has been committed.\u201d  We have previously reported that agencies can improve the efficiency of  federal programs that serve tribes and can take additional actions to  improve tribal consultation for infrastructure projects. Such  improvements would be consistent with the expressed view of Congress  in the act as to the federal government\u2019s trust responsibilities and would  strengthen the performance and accountability of the federal government.", "In January 2017, the President issued Executive Order 13767, which  directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to immediately plan, design,  and construct a wall or other physical barriers along the southwest  border. In response, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) initiated  the Border Wall System Program to plan and deploy new barriers and  other assets. Section 102 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and  Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, as amended, authorizes the  Secretary of Homeland Security to waive all legal requirements as  determined to be necessary, in the Secretary\u2019s sole discretion, to ensure  expeditious construction of barriers and roads under section 102. The  Secretary of Homeland Security has used this statutory authority to waive  the three cultural resource laws identified above and their implementing  regulations as well as certain other legal requirements. We have  previously reported on the progress the Department of Homeland  Security has made and challenges it has faced implementing its border  security efforts.", "My statement today will focus on examples of (1) federal laws and  regulations that apply to Native American cultural resources and (2)  factors that impact the effectiveness of federal agencies\u2019 tribal  consultation efforts. My statement is based on work we issued from July  2018 through November 2019 related to federal laws that apply to Native  American cultural resources, tribal consultation for infrastructure projects,  and border security. It also includes additional information about the  consultation requirements in these laws and regulations. To conduct our  previously issued work, we reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations,  and policies; reviewed agency documentation; reviewed oral and written  comments submitted by tribes to several federal agencies; and  interviewed tribal, federal, and industry officials. To identify examples of  factors that impact the effectiveness of federal agencies\u2019 consultation  efforts for this testimony, we considered those factors that more than 60  percent of 100 tribes identified as hindering effective tribal consultation for  tribes in our March 2019 report; we also considered those factors that  more than 60 percent of 21 federal agencies identified as concerns in our  March 2019 report.

One or  more tribes located near or far from the proposed project site may have  treaty rights within lands ceded in treaties or interests in lands with  cultural or religious significance outside of lands ceded in treaties.", "Additionally, the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council\u2014 which was created to make the process for federal approval for certain  (large) infrastructure projects more efficient\u2014has issued two annual  reports that identified best practices for, among other things, consulting  with tribes. These best practices include: training staff on trust and  treaty rights; providing clear information on proposals in a consistent and  timely manner; holding consultations on lands convenient to tribes when  possible; compensating tribes for consultant-like advice; and working to  build strong, ongoing dialogue between tribal authorities and agency  decision makers, among others.

In August 2018, we reported on federal laws that address  the export, theft, and trafficking of Native American cultural items and any  challenges in proving violations of these laws. That report included a  discussion of ARPA and NAGPRA.", "In addition, we reported in August 2018 that ARPA and NAGPRA contain  provisions prohibiting the removal of archaeological resources and Native  American cultural items from certain lands unless certain conditions are  met, including consultation with Indian tribes. Specifically, ARPA  prohibits, among other things, the excavation or removal of  archaeological resources from public or Indian lands without a permit  from the federal agency with management authority over the land. If the  federal agency determines that issuance of such a permit may result in  harm to, or destruction of, any religious or cultural site, the agency must  notify any Indian tribe which may consider the site as having religious or  cultural importance and meet, upon request, with tribal officials to discuss  their interests.", "NAGPRA prohibits the intentional removal from, or excavation of, Native  American cultural items from federal or tribal lands unless an ARPA  permit has been issued and other requirements are met. Specifically,  regulations implementing NAGPRA require federal agency officials to  take reasonable steps to determine whether a planned activity on federal  lands may result in the excavation of human remains or other cultural  items. Officials are also required to consult with certain tribes, including  any tribe on whose aboriginal lands the planned activity will occur, about  the planned activity. After consultation, the federal agency official must  complete and follow a written plan of action that includes, among other  things, the planned treatment, care, and disposition of human remains  and other cultural items recovered.", "NAGPRA and its implementing regulations also include provisions  regarding inadvertent discovery of Native American cultural items on  federal and tribal lands. Specifically, the person making the discovery  must notify the responsible federal agency or tribal official, stop any  activity occurring in the area of the discovery, and make a reasonable  effort to protect the human remains or other cultural item discovered.

For  the purposes of this testimony, we are highlighting those factors that more  than 60 percent of the 100 tribes identified as concerns. For example:", "Agencies\u2019 timing of consultation. Sixty-seven percent of tribes that  provided comments to federal agencies in 2016 identified concerns  with agencies initiating consultation late in project development  stages; according to one tribal official we interviewed, late initiation of  consultation limits opportunities for tribes to identify tribal resources  near proposed project sites and influence project design.", "Agency consideration of tribal input. Agencies often do not  adequately consider the tribal input they collect during tribal  consultation when making decisions about proposed infrastructure  projects, according to 62 percent of tribes that provided comments to  federal agencies in 2016. Tribes\u2019 comments included perceptions that  agencies consult to \u201ccheck a box\u201d for procedural requirements rather  than to inform agency decisions.", "Agency respect for tribal sovereignty or the government-to- government relationship. Other concerns were related to agencies\u2019  level of respect for (1) tribal sovereignty or (2) the government-to- government relationship between the United States and federally  recognized tribes, according to 73 percent of tribes that provided  comments to federal agencies in 2016. Comments included concerns  that some agency practices are inconsistent with this relationship. For  example, tribes cited agencies limiting consultation to tribal  participation in general public meetings and sending staff without  decision-making authority to represent the U.S. government in  consultation meetings.", "Agency accountability. Sixty-one percent of tribes that provided  comments to federal agencies in 2016 raised concerns related to the  extent of agencies\u2019 accountability for tribal consultation, stating that  some agencies or officials are not held accountable for consulting  ineffectively or for not consulting with relevant tribes. For example,  comments included concerns that tribes may not have appeal options  short of litigation when they believe that federal officials did not  adhere to consultation requirements.", "In addition, officials from 21 federal agencies included in our March 2019  report identified factors that they had experienced that limit effective  consultation for infrastructure projects. For the purposes of this  testimony, we are highlighting those factors that more than 60 percent of  the 21 agencies identified as concerns. For example:", "Maintaining tribal contact information. Officials from 14 of 21  agencies (67 percent) cited difficulties obtaining and maintaining  accurate contact information for tribes, which is needed to notify tribes  of consultation opportunities. For example, ongoing changes or  turnover in tribal leadership make it difficult to maintain updated tribal  information, according to some agency officials we interviewed.", "Agency resources to support consultation. Officials from 13 of 21  agencies (62 percent) cited constraints on agency staff, financial  resources, or both to support consultation. Officials from these  agencies said that they have limited funding to support consultation  activities, such as funding for their staff to travel to in-person  consultation meetings for infrastructure projects.", "Agency workload. Officials from 13 of 21 agencies (62 percent)  identified a demanding workload for consultation as a constraint,  because of large numbers of tribes involved in consultation for a  single project, high volumes of consultations, or lengthy consultations,  among other reasons. Officials from some of these agencies said that  it may be difficult to stay on project schedules when there are multiple  tribes to consult with or multiple agencies involved.", "In March 2019, we also found that the 21 agencies in our review had  taken some steps to facilitate tribal consultation, but the extent to which  these steps had been taken varied by agency. For example:", "Developing information systems to help contact affected tribes.", "Eighteen agencies developed systems to help notify tribes of  consultation opportunities, which generally include contact information  for tribal leaders or other tribal officials. Three of these agencies also  included information on tribes\u2019 geographic areas of interest. For  example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development  developed a system that aims to identify over 500 tribes\u2019 geographic  areas of interest and includes their contact information. The Federal  Permitting Improvement Steering Council identified developing a  central federal database for tribal points of contact as a best  practice. We recommended that the council should develop a plan  to implement such a database and consider how it will involve tribes  to help maintain the information, among other actions.", "Developing policies to communicate how they considered tribal  input. Five agencies\u2019 tribal consultation policies specify that agencies  are to communicate with tribes on how tribal input was considered.  For example, the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s policy directs the  most senior agency official involved in a consultation to send a formal,  written communication to the tribe to explain how the agency  considered tribal input in its final decision. However, 16 agencies did  not call for such communications in their policies. We recommended  that these agencies update their tribal consultation policies to better  communicate how tribal input was considered in agency decision- making.", "Addressing capacity gaps through training. Most of the 21  selected federal agencies have taken steps to facilitate tribal  consultation for infrastructure projects by providing a range of training  opportunities for staff involved in tribal consultation to help build  agency officials\u2019 knowledge of tribal consultation topics. For example,  the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers coordinates an immersive, 4-day  training, hosted by a tribe on the tribe\u2019s land or reservation for agency  staff and other participating agency officials, which focuses on cultural  competency important for tribal consultation.", "Utilizing various approaches to address resource constraints.  Some of the selected federal agencies used various approaches to  help address resource constraints agencies and tribes may face when  consulting on infrastructure projects, according to agency officials. For  example, the Bureau of Land Management\u2019s policies state that the  agency may use its appropriated funds and designated accounts to  reimburse tribal members\u2019 travel expenses to attend meetings in  connection with some consultations. The Nuclear Regulatory  Commission collects fees from project applicants to cover agency  costs related to consultation.", "In conclusion, effective consultation is a key tenet of the government-to- government relationship the United States has with Indian tribes, which is  based on tribal sovereignty. Failure to consult, or to consult effectively,  sows mistrust; risks exposing the United States to costly litigation; and  may result in irrevocable damage to Native American cultural resources.  In our March 2019 report, we made recommendations to 17 agencies to  take steps to improve their tribal consultation practices, which agencies  generally agreed with and in one case, have implemented. However,  sustained congressional attention to these issues and the relevant factors  impacting the effectiveness of agencies\u2019 consultation efforts may help to  minimize the negative impacts on tribes\u2019 cultural resources, when relevant  federal laws and regulations apply.", "Chairman Gallego, Ranking Member Cook, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
