IOCs are designed to, among other things, share maritime information with the Coast Guard\u0092s port partners (other agencies and organizations it coordinates with). To facilitate IOCs, the Coast Guard is implementing an information-management and sharing system called WatchKeeper. GAO was asked to assess IOC and WatchKeeper implementation. This report addresses the extent to which (1) DHS and the Coast Guard have implemented IOCs, (2) port partners use WatchKeeper and the Coast Guard has facilitated its use to enhance IOC capabilities, and (3) the Coast Guard has adhered to established guidance in defining WatchKeeper requirements and its associated cost and schedule. GAO analyzed laws and documents, such as implementation plans, and interviewed Coast Guard and port-partner officials at the first four sectors (field locations) where WatchKeeper was implemented. The results of the four sector visits are not generalizable, but provide insights."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DHS's and the Coast Guard did not meet the SAFE Port Act's requirement that IOCs be established at high-priority ports by October 2009, in part because the Coast Guard was not appropriated funds to establish the IOCs until 14 months after enactment of the law, and the definition of an IOC was evolving during this period. However, the Coast Guard plans to establish IOCs at all 35 of its sectors. According to the Coast Guard's analysis of sector status reports, none of its sectors have achieved IOCs with full operating capability. According to the Coast Guard\u0092s Chief of IOC Implementation, as well as its Information Sharing Executive Agent, continued support is needed from DHS to increase port-partner participation and the success of the IOC initiative. DHS has recently begun to support efforts to increase port-partner participation and further IOC implementation, such as facilitating the review of an IOC management directive. It is too early to determine, though, if and when IOCs will achieve their intended goal of sharing information and coordinating operations with port partners.", "The Coast Guard has granted WatchKeeper access to port partners at 11 of the 12 sectors where it has been installed, but more than 80 percent of those port partners did not log on from July through September 2011. As of October 2011, the Coast Guard no longer collects data on port partners\u0092 access and use of WatchKeeper. Without such data, it will be difficult for the Coast Guard to determine whether WatchKeeper is facilitating the IOC program in meeting its goals of improving information sharing and coordination of joint operations. GAO interviewed 22 port partners who were not using WatchKeeper. Of those 22, the most frequently cited reason (by 7 port partners) is that it does not help them perform their missions. The Coast Guard primarily consulted with Customs and Border Protection when developing WatchKeeper, but did not solicit input from all port partners. Without developing, documenting, and implementing a process on how it will incorporate port partners\u0092 feedback into future WatchKeeper requirements, the Coast Guard does not have reasonable assurance that WatchKeeper will satisfy the needs of port partners and facilitate IOC goals.", "The Coast Guard has not defined WatchKeeper requirements, cost, and schedule in accordance with established guidance. For example, the Coast Guard designed and developed the initial WatchKeeper segment without first defining the specific functions that the system is to perform. Further, the Coast Guard has not developed a reliable cost estimate to guide and inform the WatchKeeper investment. For example, the estimate does not include all government costs, such as related program-management costs. Also, WatchKeeper development and deployment has not been guided by a reliable schedule of the work needed to be performed and the key activities that need to occur. In particular, the schedule does not link all activities so that the project office can determine how a slip in a particular task may affect other related tasks, or the overall schedule. Project officials attributed these limitations to an aggressive IOC development schedule, limited resources, and competing priorities. As a result, these limitations increase the risk that WatchKeeper capabilities will not meet mission needs and will not be delivered on time and within budget."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Coast Guard collect data on port partners\u0092 access and use of WatchKeeper; develop, document, and implement a process on how to incorporate port-partner input; implement requirements-development practices; and revise the cost estimate and the integrated master schedule.

As a result, this report addresses the following  questions:", "To what extent have DHS and the Coast Guard implemented IOCs?", "To what extent are port partners using WatchKeeper and to what  extent has the Coast Guard facilitated its use to enhance IOC  capabilities?", "To what extent has the Coast Guard adhered to established guidance  in defining WatchKeeper requirements and its associated cost and  schedule?", "To address the first objective, we analyzed pertinent provisions of the  SAFE Port Act, as amended. We analyzed status reports provided by  each of the 35 Coast Guard sectors and compared the Coast Guard\u2019s  analysis of those status reports with the IOC requirements as defined in  an internal Coast Guard message from the Assistant Commandant for  Capability, and a draft annex to the U.S. Coast Guard Sector   On the basis of our review of the sectors\u2019 status  Organization Manual.reports and interviews with the Coast Guard official who developed the  criteria for the IOC requirements and analyzed the status reports, we  determined the Coast Guard\u2019s analysis was reasonable to use for the  purposes of our review. We interviewed Coast Guard officials in the Office  of Shore Forces responsible for IOC requirements, as well as Coast  Guard officials responsible for IOC implementation at their respective  sector locations. We also conducted site visits to the five sectors where  WatchKeeper was first implemented\u2014Charleston, South Carolina;  Hampton Roads, Virginia; Jacksonville, Florida; Detroit, Michigan; and  San Diego, California. While the results of our site visits to these sectors  cannot be generalized across all 35 Coast Guard sectors, we chose these  locations to allow us to observe firsthand the status of IOC  implementation efforts. To evaluate the support DHS has provided to the  Coast Guard for IOC implementation, we interviewed the Coast Guard\u2019s  Chief of IOC Implementation and the Coast Guard\u2019s Information Sharing  Executive Agent. We also interviewed officials from DHS\u2019s Information  Sharing & Safeguarding Governance Board, the board providing support  for IOC implementation. Further, we assessed DHS\u2019s involvement against  criteria in the Department of Homeland Security Information Sharing  Strategy, which states that DHS should promote information sharing with  federal partners.", "To address the second objective, we used the Coast Guard\u2019s monthly  log-on data to determine the number of port partners to whom the sectors  provided WatchKeeper access and the extent to which these port  partners accessed WatchKeeper. On the basis of our interviews with the  Coast Guard officials responsible for the log-on data and review of  responses provided by the Coast Guard\u2019s Research and Development  Center on how the data are collected and maintained, we determined that  the data from January 2011 through May 2011 were not reliable to  determine the number of times port partners logged on to WatchKeeper  since more log-ons were counted than should have been. However, we  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to use for interview  selection of port partners who had or had not logged on. In contrast, we  determined that the data from June 2011 through September 2011 were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of presenting the number of  WatchKeeper users and respective number of WatchKeeper log-ons per  month since the Coast Guard resolved the miscounting issue beginning  with the June 2011 data.", "Also, to address the second objective, we interviewed Coast Guard sector  officials about the actions they took to increase their local port partners\u2019  use of WatchKeeper. We also interviewed 39 port partners at the first four  sectors where WatchKeeper was implemented\u2014Charleston, South  Carolina; Hampton Roads, Virginia; Jacksonville, Florida; and Detroit,  Michigan. We selected port partners to interview based on the Coast  Guard\u2019s WatchKeeper log-on data from January 1, 2011\u2014when the data  were first collected\u2014through March 31, 2011\u2014the most recent data  available at the time of the selection. At the four sectors, we requested  individual interviews with all port partners who had logged on to  WatchKeeper to determine their perspectives on benefits derived from  WatchKeeper, areas for improvement, if any, and the extent to which the  Coast Guard has facilitated its use. In addition, we conducted focus  groups and interviews with port partners who had been granted access  to\u2014but had not accessed\u2014WatchKeeper to gather information on the  reasons why they had not accessed WatchKeeper. To ensure the focus  group participants represented each agency that had officials with access  to WatchKeeper, we randomly selected participants within the four  sectors, based on their agencies. While the results from our interviews  and focus groups are not generalizable to all of the Coast Guard\u2019s port  partners, they provided us accounts of how they perceived  WatchKeeper\u2019s capabilities and potential benefits.", "To determine the extent to which the Coast Guard solicited input from  port partners during initial development of WatchKeeper, we analyzed  documentation, including the Interagency Operations Process Report:  Mapping Process to Requirements for Interagency Operations Centers  and Interagency Operations Centers Concept of Operations, and  meeting minutes of sessions the Coast Guard held at select sectors, and  discussed port partners\u2019 involvement with officials in the Office of Shore  Forces responsible for IOC implementation. We assessed the Coast  Guard\u2019s involvement of port partners against criteria in the Department of  Homeland Security Information Sharing Strategy and Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government. See appendix I for a list of  port partners included in our individual interviews and focus groups at the  sectors we visited.", "To address the third objective, we analyzed relevant documentation, such  as the IOC project Operational Requirements Document, the Functional  Requirements Document, the Systems Requirements Document, the  Capability Development Plan, and compared them to selected criteria  from the Software Engineering Institute\u2019s (SEI) Capability Maturity Model\u00ae  Integration for Acquisition, to determine whether the Coast Guard fully  defined requirements prior to designing, developing, testing, and  deploying WatchKeeper; sufficiently prioritized WatchKeeper  requirements; effectively managed requirements; and maintained  traceability between operational requirements and system requirements.  To determine the extent to which the Coast Guard had developed a  reliable cost estimate for the IOC project, we evaluated the June 2010  life-cycle cost estimate relative to the four characteristics of a reliable  estimate, as defined in GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide.  These four characteristics call for estimates to be comprehensive, well- documented, accurate, and credible, and the practices address, for  example, the assumptions and source data used. We then characterized  the extent to which each of the four characteristics was met as either Not  Met, Partially Met, or Met. To determine the extent to which the Coast  Guard had developed a reliable schedule for the IOC project, we  analyzed the IOC project integrated master schedule as of May 2011  because it was the most current schedule available at the time of our  review, and we characterized our schedule findings into three categories:  (1) comprehensive, (2) controlled, and (3) current.

That center, known as  Project SeaHawk, brought together agencies, including the Coast Guard,  CBP, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Navy, and state and  local law enforcement agencies, to improve transportation security.  Shortly thereafter, the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of  2004implementation and use of joint operational centers for security at certain  United States ports.   required the Commandant of the Coast Guard to report on the  The Coast Guard and the Navy also recognized the need to work  together to ensure port security and developed local joint harbor  operations centers (JHOC), which were to share information, improve  awareness of port activities, and coordinate operations. These were  originally created by local Coast Guard and Navy units, before the SAFE  Port Act IOC requirement was enacted, to increase the security of naval  vessels at their home ports. Later, in August 2005, the Coast Guard and  Navy signed a memorandum of agreement that officially established  JHOCs to build upon the resources available to each service to produce  better awareness of conditions and activities in ports with a large Navy  presence. Eventually, JHOCs were established in Hampton Roads,  Virginia; Jacksonville, Florida; San Diego, California; and Seattle,  Washington. While these JHOCs were originally established as a means  to improve information sharing and operational effectiveness between the  Coast Guard and the Navy, other federal, state, and local port partners  also began to operate within these centers. For example, CBP and the  San Diego Harbor Patrol were also located in the San Diego JHOC.", "In addition, the Bush administration expressed the need for port security  stakeholders to work together. In particular, the National Strategy for  Maritime Security, issued in September 2005, stated that agencies  working to ensure maritime security should colocate in multiagency  centers to facilitate direct interaction and efficient use of limited  resources. Additionally, the strategy directed the agencies to develop  well-defined coordination protocols and communication mechanisms for  operating jointly.", "Meanwhile, the Coast Guard began an initiative to help facilitate meeting  its needs related to IOCs. In September 2005, the Coast Guard sent a  request to DHS to authorize the initial phase of an acquisition project  called Command 2010. Command 2010 was to improve the Coast  Guard\u2019s capabilities for surveillance, decision and mission support, and  multiagency collaboration. To improve the Coast Guard\u2019s surveillance  capabilities in critical ports and coastal regions, Command 2010 was to  provide a network of radar, cameras, and other sensors. To improve its  decision and mission support capabilities, the Coast Guard planned to  develop an information system\u2014called WatchKeeper\u2014that would provide  situational awareness to Coast Guard personnel through displays of  information gathered from sensors, as well as Coast Guard and port  partner information sources. To improve collaboration, Command 2010  was also to include a web-based portal to allow port partners to access  the same data displayed for the Coast Guard on WatchKeeper and allow  joint access to Coast Guard and port partner operations schedules. The  portal was to include collaboration functions, such as document  management and message boards. Given these capabilities, Command  2010 was to support both IOCs where in-person coordination is possible  and the virtual operations center concept as envisioned by the joint  operations center working group. Virtual operations centers are in place  when information sharing and operational coordination with port partners  at separate locations occurs through the use of tools\u2014in the case of  Command 2010, and as it evolved later to Command 21 and the IOC, on  an Internet web portal.", "Then, in 2006, the SAFE Port Act was enacted, which mandated that  IOCs for port security be implemented at all high-priority ports within 3  years. Under the SAFE Port Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security  was to utilize, as appropriate, the characteristics of existing centers and  provide for the participation, along with the Coast Guard, of other federal,  state, local, and private-sector port security stakeholders, among other  things. Amendments to the IOC provisions in the Coast Guard  Authorization Act of 2010 included adding that such centers should  provide for the physical colocation of the Coast Guard and other  stakeholders, where practicable. Among other things, the 2010 act also  required that the IOCs include information-management systems and  sensor-management systems.", "In June 2007, shortly after passage of the SAFE Port Act, the Coast  Guard began a broader initiative to coordinate port-security efforts.  Specifically, CBP and the Coast Guard formed a joint operations center  working group that was to improve near- and long-term efficiency and  effectiveness of joint field operations. The working group visited select  Coast Guard and CBP field units to gather firsthand knowledge of Coast  Guard and CBP working relationships. According to the working group,  the site visits revealed interagency coordination was already occurring in  ways deemed most appropriate by local field commanders. Also, the  working group conducted a survey of Coast Guard and CBP field  commanders that highlighted, among other things, that in-person  collaboration is desirable for more-effective Coast Guard and CBP  relations, but that virtual operations centers should be considered when  in-person coordination was not feasible.", "The Coast Guard received $60 million of funding that Congress directed  to the IOC project in annual fiscal year 2008 appropriations to begin the  process of establishing IOCs.

According to the Coast  Guard, unexpected and unreliable funding sources created the challenge  in scheduling and meeting planned milestones as each change required  cost and schedule adjustments. However, funding was provided nearly 2  years before the required deadline, and in our analysis of the Coast  Guard\u2019s actions leading up to the deadline, development of the IOCs was  not prioritized until the deadline passed. The Coast Guard made several  changes to its efforts to develop IOCs from 2007 through 2009. For  example, in its July 2007 letter to Congress on the budget and cost- sharing analysis of implementing the IOC requirements of the SAFE Port  Act, DHS reported changing the name of the project\u2014from Command  2010 to Command 21. In this letter, the DHS Assistant Secretary for  Legislative Affairs stated that Command 21 was the Coast Guard  acquisition project that was to provide the IOC capability required by the  SAFE Port Act. This acquisition project was to provide information- management tools to improve interagency coordination, enhance  awareness, and automate anomaly detection. Command 21 was to  accomplish these tasks by facilitating interagency cooperation,  information sharing, and joint, port-level operations through the use of  WatchKeeper; as well as providing a sensor network and facility upgrades  to facilitate multiagency operations and provide space for port partners.  Figure 1 depicts the type of information that WatchKeeper provides to the  Coast Guard and port partners.", "In March 2008, the Coast Guard reported that physical colocation with  port partners was preferred, but interagency coordination and cooperation  would also occur virtually. These virtual interactions would be facilitated  by sharing information through WatchKeeper. However, 36 of 39 port  partners we spoke with expressed views on physical and virtual  colocation, and 31 of those 36 port partners expressed benefits to being  colocated with the Coast Guard. For example, one port partner working at  the IOC in Charleston, South Carolina, stated that sharing space with the  Coast Guard allows for easier communication with Coast Guard officials  because they are just down the hall. He also said that the Coast Guard's  policy of rotating officials every 3 years could hinder the success of virtual  IOCs because relationships with the local Coast Guard representatives  will not have been established. Another port partner we spoke with said  that the virtual IOC in Hampton Roads, Virginia, has been effective  because there are weekly in-person meetings that allow trust to be built,  which facilitates the virtual meetings conducted using WatchKeeper.  While there are clearly disadvantages to not being colocated, Coast  Guard officials stated that funding levels prevented it from pursuing  physical IOCs beyond locations in San Francisco, California; New  Orleans, Louisiana; and Wilmington, North Carolina.", "The Coast Guard communicated changes to Command 21 in a 2008  letter to congressional appropriations committees. In the letter, the Coast  Guard Commandant further refined the implementation of Coast Guard  efforts to meet its IOC mandate. In particular, he stated that the Coast  Guard planned to install the WatchKeeper information-management tools,  the sensor network, and facility upgrades at the 24 Coast Guard sectors  that encompassed the nation\u2019s high-priority ports. All 35 sectors would, at  a minimum, receive WatchKeeper. Additionally, user feedback based on  the initial installations would be used as a guide to finalize requirements.  Also in 2008, the IOC plans changed from having a separate  collaboration portal to share information on WatchKeeper with port  partners to building that communications mechanism as a part of  WatchKeeper.", "In August 2009, the Coast Guard established four implementation  segments for what it was now calling the IOC/Command 21 project.that time, the segments were:", "Segment 1: Provide a standardized information-management solution  (WatchKeeper) focused on integrated vessel targeting, operations  planning, and operations monitoring and interoperability.", "Segment 2: Provide integrated sensor management with linkages to  existing sensors.", "Segment 3: Provide expanded sensors to fill gaps in situational  awareness.", "Segment 4: Upgrade existing facilities to support interagency  planning and operations, including space allocation for key port  partners.", "While these actions represented the initial planning steps of developing  the IOCs, the Coast Guard did not provide sector commanding officers  with guidance on the required elements for an IOC until March 2010, 5  months after the deadline to establish the IOCs. Coast Guard officials  stated that this was because the initial focus was on the acquisition of  WatchKeeper and not the IOC initiative as a whole. In March 2010, the  Assistant Commandant of Capability sent a message to the sectors  outlining the five elements an IOC needs to function optimally. Described  below, these five elements constitute the Coast Guard\u2019s definition of a  fully operational IOC.   1.  Clearly defined governance and membership, including documented  agreements regarding which agencies will participate, in which ways,  where, and when.  2.

The Coast Guard plans to  reevaluate the sectors\u2019 progress in 2012. The Coast Guard analyzed the  sectors\u2019 October 2010 status reports using criteria it developed for each  of the five required IOC elements previously discussed. Specifically, each  sector was assigned points on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of the progress  it has made toward meeting the criteria associated with the first four IOC  elements (all except WatchKeeper), with 100 being the highest. Each  sector was then placed in one of the following categories based on the  average number of points it received for the first four IOC elements:   initial operating capability: sectors that have met 30 to less than 55  percent of the criteria;  initial-advanced operating capability: sectors that have met 55 to  less than 80 percent of the criteria; or  final operating capability: sectors that have met 80 percent or more  of the criteria.", "According to the Coast Guard\u2019s analysis of the 35 sectors, as of October  2010, 3 have not achieved initial operating capability for their IOCs, 22  had achieved IOC initial operating capability, 10 had achieved IOC initial- advanced operating capability, and none had achieved IOC full operating  capability. Of the 10 Coast Guard sectors that have achieved IOC initial- advanced operating capability, 5 were recognized by the Coast Guard in  2008 as sectors with a high degree of collaboration with port partners. In  particular, these sectors had established a means to coordinate with their  port partners prior to the Coast Guard developing the five IOC elements,  and in some cases prior to the October 2006 enactment of the SAFE Port  Act IOC requirements. For example, during our site visit to Coast Guard  Sector San Diego\u2014the sector that had made the greatest progress in  meeting the IOC requirements\u2014we observed port partners coordinating  joint operations during one of the Maritime Unified Command\u2019s (MUC)  weekly meetings. The MUC is an alliance of federal, state, and local law  enforcement agencies that addresses threats in San Diego\u2019s maritime  domain, such as drug and alien smuggling.

The sectors have made the least  progress in clearly defining IOC governance (element 1), with sectors, on  average, achieving 29 percent of this criteria. Figure 3 depicts the  progress the sectors have made, by element, based on the average of  the individual sector percentages.", "The fifth IOC element involves sectors utilizing and providing their port  partners access to WatchKeeper. The extent of capabilities that  WatchKeeper provides the sectors is not part of the Coast Guard\u2019s  measure of IOC implementation. Since sectors are unable to control  when WatchKeeper will be implemented at their respective locations, the  Coast Guard is analyzing the sectors\u2019 progress in meeting this element  separately from the other four IOC elements.", "In September 2009, the Coast Guard released initial WatchKeeper  capabilities to Sector Charleston, South Carolina. However, in March  2010, an operational test and evaluation revealed limitations in the  maturity of the technology. As a result, the Coast Guard halted further  deployment of WatchKeeper to additional IOC locations. In May 2010,  DHS authorized the IOC project to release WatchKeeper as a technology  demonstrator to all 35 IOC locations.stated that Segment 1 of the IOC project\u2014made up of the WatchKeeper  Technology Demonstrator\u2014would initially be released to 17 sectors, and  then to the remaining 18 if there was a positive cost-benefit to doing so.  As of September 2011, the WatchKeeper Technology Demonstrator has  been implemented at 12 sectors (see fig. 2 above). The Coast Guard  anticipates that it will implement the WatchKeeper Technology  Demonstrator at five more sectors by April 2012. According to the Coast  Guard\u2019s Acquisition Program Baseline, implementing WatchKeeper at the  remaining 18 sectors is to be complete by March 2017.

Subsequent steps involve obtaining support from non-DHS  federal agencies, as well as state and local agencies. The experience to  date with non-DHS agency involvement at current IOCs has been mixed.  For example, the Navy, which was a partner at the JHOCs, has  withdrawn its watchstanders from these locations. In at least one JHOC  location (Jacksonville, Florida), the Coast Guard also lost the use of the  facility that was used as the JHOC, as well as access to the Navy\u2019s  sensor network.

First, the Coast Guard did  not fully define requirements prior to designing, developing, testing, and  deploying WatchKeeper. Recognized guidance calls for first defining  business requirements that describe how users will interact with the  system, and user needs in terms of what the system is to do and how it is  to do it, to ensure that the developed system satisfies user needs.  Although the Coast Guard developed draft high-level business  requirements for WatchKeeper, it did not define the specific functions that  the system is to perform, and as noted above, it did not elicit input from all  port partners in developing the high-level requirements. Coast Guard  officials acknowledged that they should have developed requirements  before designing and developing WatchKeeper, but stated that there was  not enough time between receiving project funding in fiscal year 2008 and  the SAFE Port Act\u2019s deadline to establish the IOCs (and its information- management and sharing system\u2014WatchKeeper) in 2009. The lack of  well-defined business requirements describing how WatchKeeper was to  operate and how users were to interact with WatchKeeper prior to its  design and development contributed to its failed operational testing and  subsequent deployment of the initial IOC project segment as the  Technology Demonstrator, and ultimately, to deploying a system that  does not fully meet user needs.", "Second, the Coast Guard did not sufficiently prioritize requirements to  ensure that requirements most critical to stakeholders and users are  addressed early and overall user needs are satisfied. According to project  officials, they grouped WatchKeeper requirements into 17 categories that  reflect similar functionality and placed each of the 17 categories into one  of four \u201cbuckets\u201d\u2014Bucket 1 (\u201cmust have\u201d requirements), Bucket 2  (\u201cimportant\u201d requirements), Bucket 3 (no description), and Bucket 4  (\u201cunfunded\u201d or \u201cunexecutable\u201d requirements). However, while the project  office has prioritized the 17 categories of requirements, the priority of  individual requirements is unclear. For example, of the remaining 256  requirements, 67 (about 26 percent) have been classified as Bucket 1  and 51 (about 20 percent) as Bucket 2. However, 108 (about 42 percent) have been classified as both Bucket 1 and Bucket 2, which  diminishes the benefit of prioritization. By assigning each requirement a  single priority (that is, Bucket 1, 2, 3, or 4), the project office would be  better able to determine the order in which business requirements should  be implemented to ensure that the most critical requirements are  addressed, especially given project officials stated concern about future  project funding.", "Third, the Coast Guard has not demonstrated adequate traceability  between its business requirements (e.g., operational and functional  requirements) and system requirements. Traceability of requirements is  tracking the requirements from the inception of the project and agreement  on a specific set of business requirements to development of the lower- level system requirements, detailed design, and test cases necessary for  validating the requirements. Tracing a requirement throughout the  development life cycle provides evidence that the requirements are met in  the developed system and ensures that the product or system will work  as intended. Requirements must be traceable forward and backward  through the life cycle. The Coast Guard\u2019s Requirements Generation and  Management Process recognizes the importance of traceability, stating  that requirements are to be traceable throughout design, development,  and test to ensure that users receive the desired capabilities. According  to project officials, traceability is maintained in the project\u2019s Functional  Requirements Document and the System Requirements Document.", "According to this documentation, 244 of the 355 functional requirements  (about 69 percent) were traceable backward to a higher-level operational  requirement and 242 of 355 functional requirements (about 68 percent)  were traceable forward to lower-level system requirements. However,  only 181 of the 355 functional requirements (about 51 percent) were  traceable backward to both a higher-level operational requirement and  forward to a lower-level system requirement. Moreover, an additional 61  functional requirements were traceable to a system requirement, but were  not traceable to an operational requirement. This raises questions about  the genesis of these 61 functional requirements, given that functional  requirements should be derived from higher-level operational  requirements. Without ensuring that requirements are fully traceable,  including ensuring that all lower-level requirements are traceable to a  higher-level business or user requirement and all higher-level business  requirements are traceable to lower-level system requirements, the  program office does not have a sufficient basis for knowing whether the  scope of the system will satisfy user needs.", "According to project officials, these requirements management limitations  are due to the aggressive schedule and limited resources for developing  and deploying IOCs. However, without well-defined and managed  requirements, the Coast Guard runs the risk of encountering cost  overruns and schedule delays, and deploying a system with limited  functionality and that does not meet user mission needs, as was the case  with WatchKeeper.", "According to relevant guidance, a reliable cost estimate is critical to  successfully delivering major information technology systems as well as  major system increments such as IOC Segments 1 and 2.

It should  also reflect all cost-influencing ground rules and assumptions and  provide sufficient detail to ensure that cost elements are neither  omitted nor double counted.", "The IOC project does not have a comprehensive project WBS that  defines all the detailed work activities needed to accomplish the  project\u2019s objectives. In addition, project officials provided  documentation that shows the use of at least four different WBSs,  each of which is inconsistent with one another. Moreover, the Coast  Guard does not have any documentation that outlines the activities  that need to be completed by its development organization. Without  this documentation, it will be difficult for the project office to determine  if the development organization is able to deliver the desired product  or if that product will meet the Coast Guard\u2019s needs. This raises  questions about whether all necessary activities to accomplish the  IOC\u2019s objectives have been captured, and are reflected in the cost  estimate. Additionally, the cost estimate identifies costs associated  with the acquisition, construction, and maintenance of the IOC project  as well as contractor-related costs, but it does not include all  government costs, such as those related to systems engineering and  program management. Project officials said that they should have  included these costs in the estimate and said that they will include  them in any life-cycle cost updates. In addition, the estimate includes  many, but not all, of the general assumptions that were used in the  development of the cost estimate. For example, it does not discuss  any potential cost limitations associated with the IOC project,  participating agency support, and government-furnished equipment.  Moreover, there are critical differences in the assumptions presented  in the cost estimate and those presented in the independent cost  estimate (as discussed later in this section).

Further, the estimate should be adjusted properly for  inflation.", "The IOC project cost estimate has not been updated to reflect  material project changes since the estimate was developed and  approved.

In December 2010 and again in January  2011, DHS management directed the project office to revise the cost  estimate to reflect the reduced set of requirements and to support the  costs included in the Acquisition Program Baseline. As noted below,  project officials stated that the estimate has not been revised due to  the lack of project resources. Further, the quality of key data is limited.  Instead of relying on historical costs from similar projects, the estimate  was based, in part, on the knowledge of subject-matter experts. In  addition, the estimate specifies the inflation table used in developing  the estimate, but it does not include the actual inflation numbers.", "The estimate is not credible.  To be credible, the cost estimate  should discuss any limitations in the analysis due to uncertainty or  biases surrounding the data and assumptions. Major assumptions  should be varied and other outcomes computed by conducting a  sensitivity analysis to determine how sensitive the estimate is to  changes in the assumptions. Risk and uncertainty inherent in the  estimate should be assessed and disclosed including ensuring the  estimate has been risk-adjusted. An independent cost estimate should  also be developed to determine if other estimating methods produce  similar results.", "The IOC project cost estimate was not informed by the results of a  sensitivity analysis of the key cost drivers. According to the estimate,  a risk and uncertainty analysis was completed. On the basis of this  analysis, the current life-cycle cost estimate has approximately a 40  percent chance of being met. However, the estimate does not include  the associated confidence level for a risk-adjusted cost estimate and  related contingency funds. An independent cost estimate was  completed for the IOC project, which was about $200 million more  than the cost estimate. However, project officials were unable to  explain how the differences in the two cost estimates were reconciled.", "In September 2010, the project office developed an Acquisition Program  Baseline for the IOC project, which focuses on a reduced set of  requirements and includes a revised cost figure to acquire, develop, and  deploy WatchKeeper Segments 1 and 2. According to the baseline, the  acquisition costs for Segment 2 were derived using a \u201cdesign to cost\u201d  strategy due to out-year budget constraints, and changes were made to  the cost estimate assumptions that resulted in reduced sustainment costs  for both segments. Project officials stated that the Acquisition Program  Baseline costs are grounded in the information presented in the life-cycle  cost estimate. However, the baseline does not identify the specific  assumptions that were changed, and project officials could not provide  any documentation of the assumptions used to develop the estimate.  Therefore, given the weaknesses in the IOC cost estimate identified  above and the absence of documented assumptions for the Acquisition  Program Baseline, the reliability of the baseline cost estimate is  undetermined. Project officials said that the IOC project cost estimate is  not accurate and needs to be updated, and that those updates would also  be made to the baseline; however project officials did not have any time  frame for updating the estimate.

But we believe it is too early to tell if such recent efforts will be  successful in making sure that the IOCs serve as more than Coast  Guard\u2013centric command and control centers.", "The second factor is that most port partners are not logging on to  WatchKeeper\u2014the information-sharing tool designed to assist  coordination between the Coast Guard and its port partners. While we  have seen some recent efforts by the Coast Guard to learn more  about its port partners\u2019 needs, most occurred after the initial rollout of  the WatchKeeper system. Yet recently, the Coast Guard has ended  its effort to learn the extent of WatchKeeper usage by port partners  and has not determined whether it wants to collect such information in  the future. Without the knowledge of how successful it is in promoting  port-partner usage of WatchKeeper, the Coast Guard will not be able  to determine whether WatchKeeper is facilitating the IOC program in  meetings its goals. Additionally, without a documented process that  describes how the Coast Guard will obtain and incorporate port- partner feedback into the development of future WatchKeeper  requirements in place and implemented, the Coast Guard risks  deploying a system that lacks needed capabilities and, thus, limits  port partners\u2019 ability to share information and coordinate in the  maritime environment.", "The third factor is weak management of the IOC acquisition project,  which increases the program\u2019s exposure to risk. In particular,  fundamental requirements-development and management practices  have not been employed; costs are unclear; and the project\u2019s  schedule, which is to guide program execution and promote  accountability, has not been reliably derived. By implementing key  requirements-development and management practices, revising the  life-cycle cost estimate for delivering WatchKeeper capabilities, and  developing an integrated master schedule that addresses the key  schedule-estimating practices, the Coast Guard could reduce the risk  that WatchKeeper will cost more to develop and deploy than  necessary. Moreover, the Coast Guard could reduce the risk that it  will have a system that does not meet Coast Guard and port-partner  user needs and expectations.", "Without improvements in the involvement of other federal, state and local  agencies, the use of WatchKeeper by port partners, and the management  of the acquisition, the Coast Guard may not achieve its goals of  interagency maritime integration and cooperation, and the IOCs and  WatchKeeper might only serve the Coast Guard as opposed to the  interagency concept intended by Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure effective implementation of WatchKeeper and maximize  its use among port partners, we recommend that the Commandant of the  Coast Guard direct the IOC Project Manager to take the following two  actions:   collect data to determine the extent to which (1) sectors are providing  port partners WatchKeeper access and (2) port partners are using  WatchKeeper; and develop, document, and implement a process to obtain and  incorporate port-partner input into the development of future  WatchKeeper requirements.", "To address the risks facing the Coast Guard in its acquisition and  deployment of WatchKeeper, we recommend that the Commandant of the  Coast Guard direct the IOC Project Manager to take the following three  actions:  implement key requirements-development and management practices  to include   (1) defining and documenting requirements, including eliciting user  needs from all relevant port partners, before initiating key design  activities, (2) prioritizing remaining requirements to ensure critical  port-partner needs are addressed, and (3) tracing bi-directionally  between higher-level operational requirements and lower-level system  requirements;  revise the IOC project life-cycle cost estimate for delivering  WatchKeeper capabilities to reflect the four characteristics of a  reliable estimate discussed in this report; and develop an integrated master schedule for delivering WatchKeeper  that addresses, at a minimum, the key schedule-estimating practices  discussed in this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided draft copies of this report to the Secretaries of Homeland  Security, Defense, and the Attorney General for review and comments.

In response to our first  recommendation DHS concurred and stated that the Coast Guard office  responsible for IOC requirements will provide reporting parameters for the  WatchKeeper system administrator to collect and report. In response to  our second recommendation DHS concurred and stated that the Coast  Guard is conducting surveys of all users four months after WatchKeeper  delivery in a port, and IOCs will also identify additional requirements to be  forwarded to the IOC project manager. Regarding our third, fourth and  fifth recommendations to improve the management of the IOC acquisition,  DHS concurred with all three. The department noted that their  concurrence was subject to the availability of funds in the President's  Fiscal Year 2013 Budget. Specifically, the department noted that the  Coast Guard's Capital Investment Plan of acquisition priorities was  subject to change due to a number of factors.
