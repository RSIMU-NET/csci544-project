Consular officers must balance this security responsibility  against the need to facilitate legitimate travel. Since its establishment, the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has had authority to issue  regulations with respect to the issuance and refusal of visas. Other  federal entities, such as the Office of the Director of National  Intelligence\u2019s (ODNI) National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) and the  Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), also  contribute to the NIV screening and vetting process by providing  intelligence and information against which applicants are screened,  among other activities.", "In light of continued concerns about the security of the visa process, you  asked us to review the NIV screening and vetting process. This report is a  public version of a sensitive report that we issued in June 2018. Our  June 2018 report addressed three objectives, including one describing  NIV screening and vetting processes. DHS, ODNI, and State deemed  some of the information in that report to be Sensitive But Unclassified,  Law Enforcement Sensitive, or For Official Use Only, which must be  protected from public disclosure. Although such sensitive information  appeared throughout the report, the objective on NIV screening and  vetting processes was predominately based on sensitive information.  Consequently, this version only includes information on objectives (1)  outcomes and characteristics of adjudicated NIV applications from fiscal  years 2012 through 2017, and (2) key changes to the NIV screening and  vetting process in response to executive actions taken in calendar year  2017 and related guidance.", "To identify outcomes and characteristics of adjudicated NIV applications  from fiscal years 2012 through 2017, we analyzed State NIV data for  fiscal years 2012 through 2017\u2014the most recently available full year  data. The data fields we analyzed included month and year of  adjudication; type of NIV; location of application; applicant nationality;  outcome of application (e.g., issuance and refusal); and, if applicable,  reason for refusal. To assess the reliability of these data, we interviewed  State officials who use and maintain the data and checked the data for  missing information, outliers, and obvious errors, among other actions.  On the basis of these steps, we determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives, including providing  summary statistics on NIV adjudications, issuances, and refusal reasons.", "To assist in our analysis of NIV data, we placed the majority of NIVs into  one of seven groups (e.g., tourists and business visitors). We developed  the seven groups of related NIVs based on the purpose of the NIV and its  eligibility criteria as defined in statute and as described by State and DHS  documentation, among other factors. Similarly, to assist in our analysis  of the grounds upon which NIVs were refused, we grouped the grounds  for refusal into one of seven categories (e.g., immigration-related  ineligibility). We developed the seven categories based on the reason  for refusal as described in statute and in State documentation. We shared  our NIV groups and refusal categories with State officials, who stated that  our categories were generally appropriate for the analysis we conducted.", "To identify key changes to the NIV screening and vetting process in  response to executive actions taken in calendar year 2017 and related  guidance, we reviewed executive actions taken in calendar year 2017  relevant to NIV screening and vetting, including Executive Order 13769,  Executive Order 13780, and Presidential Proclamation 9645. We also  reviewed State and DHS guidance, the Immigration and Nationality Act  (INA), standard operating procedures, and documentation related to  implementing requirements in the executive actions, and we interviewed  State and DHS headquarters officials on their efforts to implement these  requirements. We conducted site visits to seven consular posts to  observe NIV screening and vetting operations and interview State, DHS,  and DOJ officials implementing the new requirements from March through  May 2017. We selected these posts on the basis of their relatively high  visa workloads; State and DHS data on the percentage of NIV applicants  that potentially matched to derogatory information in fiscal year 2016; and  geographic distribution to help account for variations in visa applicant  populations and potential threats that consular officials encounter in  different locations. Further, we visited posts that also had DHS\u2019s Visa  Security Program, which provides an additional level of NIV screening  and vetting by deploying agents to certain posts overseas to work with  consular officers and review NIV applications. Our observations from  these site visits are illustrative and provide insights about NIV operations,  but are not generalizable to all posts.

This screening and vetting process for determining who will be  issued or refused a visa contains several steps, as shown in figure 1:", "Petitions. Prior to State\u2019s adjudication process, some NIVs require  applicants to first obtain an approved petition from U.S. Citizenship  and Immigration Services (USCIS), as shown in table 3. For  example, applicants seeking an employment-based NIV or a U.S.  citizen\u2019s foreign national fianc\u00e9(e) seeking U.S. entry to conclude a  valid marriage, must obtain an approved petition from USCIS prior to  applying for their NIV.

As part of the adjudication process for  visas requiring a USCIS-approved petition before the NIV application  is submitted to State, USCIS conducts background checks on U.S.- based petitioners and foreign beneficiaries. For example, petitioner  and beneficiary information is screened against TECS\u2014DHS\u2019s  principal law enforcement and antiterrorism database that includes  enforcement, inspection, and operational records. Further, for U.S.  citizens petitioning for a K-1 visa on behalf of their fianc\u00e9(e), an FBI  fingerprint check may also be required of the U.S. citizen petitioner.  If the background checks identify a potential match to derogatory  information, the background check unit at the USCIS service center  that received the petition is to conduct further research to confirm the  match, such as running checks against other government systems  and collaborating with other government agencies. If all background  check hits have been resolved and documented, and there is no  reason not to proceed, USCIS will adjudicate the petition. In fiscal  year 2017, USCIS reported that it received about 640,000 petitions for  NIVs, and approved over 550,000.", "NIV Application. After having obtained USCIS approval of the NIV  petition, as applicable, the foreign national begins the consular  process by completing an online NIV application, known as a DS-160.

II, ch. 2, \u00a7  212(a), 66 Stat. 163, 182-87 (1952)  (classified, as amended, at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7  1182(a)), such as foreign nationals who have  engaged in terrorist or criminal activities or  previously violated U.S. immigration law. If a  visa applicant is found inadmissible, and has  not obtained a waiver from the Department of  Homeland Security, the applicant would be  statutorily ineligible for a visa.  Ineligible: An individual is ineligible for a visa if  it appears to the Department of State consular  officer, based on the application or supporting  documentation, that the applicant is not  qualified to receive a visa under any provision  of law. If the consular officer decides that an  applicant is ineligible for visa issuance, the  refusal may be based on statutory grounds of  inadmissibility under INA \u00a7 212(a), or may be  due to the individual\u2019s failure to otherwise  satisfy the applicable eligibility requirements  for the particular visa, as defined in the INA.  For example, a consular officer may refuse a  J-1 exchange visitor visa to an applicant  coming to the United States to perform  services as a member of the medical  profession if the applicant does not either  demonstrate competency in oral and written  English or hold a degree from an accredited  school of medicine, as required of such visa  applicants under INA \u00a7 212(j). eligibility concerns related to visa applicants. Prior to adjudicating  the visa application, consular officers must review all such security  check results. Some applicants are not subjected to all of the  security checks depending on certain characteristics, such as age and  visa category. For example, State does not generally require that  fingerprints be collected for applicants who are either under 14 years  old or over 79 years old, or for foreign government officials seeking  certain visas.", "As needed, some applicants undergo an interagency review process  called a security advisory opinion (SAO), which is a multi-agency,  U.S-based review process for certain NIV applicants. For example,  SAOs are mandatory in cases of certain security check hits, a foreign  national\u2019s background, or a foreign national\u2019s intention while in the  United States. In addition, consular officers have the discretion to  request an SAO for any visa applicant. Through the SAO process,  consular officers send additional information on applicants to U.S.- based agencies, who review that information against their holdings.  Department of State data indicate that consular officers made over  180,000 requests for SAOs for NIV applicants in fiscal year 2017.", "Adjudication. If the consular officer determines that the applicant is  eligible for the visa on the basis of the application, supporting  documentation, and other relevant information such as statements  made in an interview, he or she will take the applicant\u2019s passport for  final processing, but the visa cannot be printed until all security  checks have been returned and reviewed.

In March 2010, shortly after the December 2009  attempted bombing by a foreign national traveling to the United States  on a valid visa, CBP began vetting individuals with NIVs on a  recurrent basis.

In addition, CBP analysts may take other  actions as needed after identifying new derogatory information, such  as recommending that the airline deny boarding to the traveler  because the traveler is likely to be deemed inadmissible upon arrival  in the United States (known as a no-board recommendation) or  making a referral to ICE, which may seek to remove the individual if  already within the United States.

Specifically, from fiscal  years 2012 through 2016, the number of NIV adjudications typically  peaked in the summer months.

However, in fiscal year 2017, the summer  months did not experience a similar increase from previous months,  departing from the trend over the previous five fiscal years, according to  State data. Instead, NIV adjudications peaked in December of fiscal year  2017.

Although there was an increase in  adjudications across all types of temporary worker visas, the largest  percentage increase was for H-2A visas, which are for foreign workers  seeking to perform agricultural services of a temporary or seasonal  nature. Specifically, adjudications of H-2A visas increased by 140  percent from fiscal years 2012 to 2017 (from about 71,000 to  170,000). State officials noted that H-2A visas are not numerically  limited by statute. Further, State officials stated that they believe  U.S. employers are increasingly less likely to hire workers without  lawful status and are petitioning for lawfully admitted workers, which in  part led to an increase in H-2A visa demand.", "Tourist and Business Visitors. State officials partly attributed the  overall changes to tourist and business visitor visas to the extension  of the validity period of such visas for Chinese nationals, which  represented the largest single country of nationality for tourist and  business visitor visas in fiscal year 2017 (17.7 percent). In  November 2014, the United States and the People\u2019s Republic of  China reciprocally increased the validity periods of multiple-entry  tourist and business visitor visas issued to each other\u2019s citizens for up  to 10 years. The change in policy was intended to support improved  trade, investment, and business by facilitating travel between the two  countries. According to State officials, extending validity periods can  create an initial increase in demand for such visas, followed by a  period of stabilization or even decline as NIV holders would be  required to apply for renewal less frequently. According to State  officials, in early fiscal year 2015, the increase in the validity period to  10 years for such visas created a spike in Chinese demand in fiscal  year 2015, and by fiscal year 2016, the initial demand for these visas  had been met and Chinese economic growth was simultaneously  slowing, resulting in fewer adjudications for such visas in fiscal year  2017. State data for this time period indicate that the number of  adjudications for tourist and business visitor visas for Chinese  nationals increased from 1.58 million in fiscal year 2014 to 2.54 million  in fiscal year 2015, followed by a decline to 2.34 million in fiscal year  2016 and 1.76 million in fiscal year 2017.", "Student and Exchange Visitors. Similar to tourist and business  visitors, State officials partly attributed the overall changes in student  and exchange visitor visa adjudications to the extension of the validity  period of such visas for Chinese nationals, which represented the  largest single country of nationality for student and exchange visitor  visas in fiscal year 2017 (19 percent). In November 2014, the United  States extended the validity period of the F visa for academic students  from 1 year to 5 years. State officials noted that similar to tourist and  business visitor visas, there was an initial surge in Chinese F-visa  applicants due to the new 5-year F-visa validity period that began in  fiscal year 2015, but the number dropped subsequently because  Chinese students with such 5-year visas no longer needed to apply as  frequently for F visas. State data for this time period indicate that the  number of visa adjudications for F visas for Chinese nationals  increased from about 267,000 in fiscal year 2014 to 301,000 in fiscal  year 2015, followed by a decline of 172,000 in fiscal year 2016 and  134,000 in fiscal year 2017.", "Applicant\u2019s Country of Nationality.

State officials also noted that when a country  joins the Visa Waiver Program or a visa for certain nationalities increase  from 1-year to 10-year visa validity periods, these individuals no longer  apply for visas and affect the overall refusal rate. Further, State officials  noted that changes in political and economic conditions in individual  countries can affect visa eligibility, which in turn affects the overall refusal  rate. State officials noted that the degree to which an applicant might  seek to travel to the United States unlawfully is directly related to political,  economic, and social conditions in their countries. For example, if global  or regional economic conditions deteriorate, more applicants may have  an incentive to come to the United States illegally by, for example,  obtaining a NIV with the intent to unlawfully stay for a particular time  period or purpose other than as permitted by their visa, which then would  increase the number of NIV applications that consular officers are  refusing.", "From fiscal years 2012 through 2017, the refusal rate varied by visa  group. The highest refusal rate was for tourists and business visitors,  which rose from about 15 percent in fiscal year 2012 to over 25 percent in  fiscal year 2017, as shown in figure 9. Other visa categories, such as  foreign officials and employees, transit and crewmembers, and fianc\u00e9(e)s  and spouses, had refusal rates below 5 percent during this time period.

For  example, an applicant applying for a student visa could be refused as an  ineligible nonimmigrant for failure to demonstrate possession of sufficient  funds to cover his or her educational expenses as required. Similarly, an  applicant could be refused as an ineligible nonimmigrant for indicating to  the consular officer an intention to obtain a student visa to engage in  unsanctioned activities while in the United States, such as full-time  employment instead of pursuing an approved course of study.", "According to State data, the second most common reason for refusal  during this time period was inadequate documentation, which accounted  for approximately 5 percent of refusals each year.

Initially, the President issued Executive Order 13769,  Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States  (EO-1), in January 2017. In March 2017, the President revoked and  replaced EO-1 with the issuance of Executive Order 13780 (EO-2), which  had the same title as EO-1. Among other things, EO-2 suspended entry  of certain foreign nationals for a 90 day period, subject to exceptions and  waivers. It further directed federal agencies\u2014including DHS, State, DOJ  and ODNI\u2014to review information needs from foreign governments for  visa adjudication and develop uniform screening and vetting standards for  U.S. entities to follow when adjudicating immigration benefits, including  NIVs. In September 2017, as a result of the reviews undertaken pursuant  to EO-2, the President issued Presidential Proclamation 9645, Enhancing  Vetting Capabilities and Processes for Detecting Attempted Entry into the  United States by Terrorists or Other Public-Safety Threats (Proclamation),  which imposes certain conditional restrictions and limitations on the entry  of nationals of eight countries\u2014Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia,  Syria, Venezuela and Yemen\u2014into the United States for an indefinite  period.

If the applicant was ineligible for the  visa on grounds unrelated to the executive action, such as having prior  immigration violations, the applicant was to be refused on those grounds.

In accordance  with EO-2, DHS conducted a worldwide review, in consultation with State  and ODNI, to identify additional information needed from foreign countries  to determine that an individual is not a security or public-safety threat  when adjudicating an application for a visa, admission, or other  immigration benefit. According to State officials, an interagency working  group composed of State, DHS, ODNI, and National Security Council  staff was formed to conduct the review. To conduct this review, DHS  developed a set of criteria for information sharing in support of  immigration screening and vetting, as shown by table 6. According to  DHS officials, to develop these criteria, DHS, in coordination with other  agencies, identified current standards and best practices for information  collection and sharing under various categories of visas to create a core  list of information needed from foreign governments in the visa  adjudication process. For example, State sent an information request to  all U.S. posts overseas requesting information on host nations\u2019  information sharing practices, according to State officials.", "To assess the extent to which countries were meeting the newly  established criteria, DHS officials stated that they used various  information sources to preliminarily develop a list of countries that were or  were not meeting the standards for adequate information sharing. For  example, DHS officials stated that they reviewed information from  INTERPOL on a country\u2019s frequency of reporting lost and stolen passport  information, consulted with ODNI for information on which countries are  terrorist safe havens, and worked with State to obtain information that  State officials at post may have on host nations\u2019 information sharing  practices. According to the Proclamation, based on DHS assessments of  each country, DHS reported to the President on July 9, 2017, that 47  countries were \u201cinadequate\u201d or \u201cat risk\u201d of not meeting the standards.  DHS officials identified several reasons that a country may have been  assessed as \u201cinadequate\u201d with regard to the criteria. For example, some  countries may have been willing to provide information, but lacked the  capacity to do so. Or, some countries may not have been willing to  provide certain information, or simply did not currently have diplomatic  relations with the U.S. government.", "As was required by EO-2, State engaged with foreign governments on  their respective performance based on these criteria for a 50-day  period. In July 2017, State directed its posts to inform their respective  host governments of the new information sharing criteria and request that  host governments provide the required information or develop a plan to  do so. Posts were directed to then engage more intensively with countries  DHS\u2019s report preliminarily deemed \u201cinadequate\u201d or \u201cat risk\u201d. Each post  was to submit an assessment of mitigating factors or specific interests  that should be considered in the deliberations regarding any travel  restrictions for nationals of those countries. DHS officials stated that they  reviewed the additional information host nations provided to State and  then reevaluated the initial classifications to determine if any countries  remained \u201cinadequate.\u201d", "On September 15, 2017, in accordance with EO-2, DHS submitted to the  President a list of countries recommended for inclusion in a presidential  proclamation that would prohibit certain categories of foreign nationals of  such countries from entering the United States. The countries listed  were Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen\u2014 which were assessed as \u201cinadequate,\u201d and Somalia, which was identified  as a terrorist safe haven. The Presidential Proclamation indefinitely  suspended entry into the United States of certain nonimmigrants from the  listed countries (see table 7) and directed DHS, in consultation with State,  to devise a process to assess whether the entry restrictions should be  continued, modified or terminated.", "In September 2017, State issued additional guidance to posts on  implementation of the Presidential Proclamation. As of July 2018, State  continues to accept and process the NIV applications of foreign nationals  from the eight countries covered by the Proclamation. Such applicants  are to be interviewed, according to State guidance, and consular officers  are to determine if the applicant is otherwise eligible for the visa, meets  any of the proclamation\u2019s exceptions, or qualifies for a waiver.", "Development of uniform screening standards for U.S. immigration  benefit programs. Consistent with EO-2, State, DHS, DOJ, and ODNI  developed a uniform baseline for screening and vetting standards and  procedures by the U.S. government. According to State officials, an  interagency working group comprised of State, DHS, DOJ, and ODNI  staff is implementing these requirements. Based on its review of existing  screening and vetting processes, DHS officials stated that the working  group established uniform standards for (1) applications, (2) interviews,  and (3) security system checks (i.e., biographic and biometric).", "Regarding applications, DHS officials stated that the group identified  data elements against which applicants are to be screened and  vetted. In February 2018, DHS Office of Policy officials stated that  they had taken steps to create more consistency across U.S.  government forms that collect information used for screening and  vetting purposes, such as State\u2019s DS-160 NIV application as well as  12 DHS forms. For example, officials stated that they anticipate  issuing Federal Register notices announcing the intended changes to  such forms.", "Regarding interviews, DHS officials stated that the working group  established a requirement for all applicants seeking an immigration  benefit, including NIV applicants, to undergo a baseline uniform  national security and public safety interview. DHS officials stated that  the working group modeled its interview baseline on elements of the  refugee screening interview. To help implement this standard, DHS  officials stated that the department is offering more training courses in  enhanced communications (i.e. detecting deception and eliciting  responses) and making such courses accessible to other U.S.  government entities and U.S. officials overseas.", "Regarding security checks, the working group identified certain  checks that should be conducted for all applicants seeking an  immigration benefit, including NIV applicants. For example, DHS  officials stated that the working group concluded that all applicants for  U.S. immigration benefits should be screened against DHS\u2019s TECS,  among other federal databases. In February 2018, DHS Office of  Policy officials stated that they were also exploring the extent to which  current screening and vetting technologies can be expanded. For  example, technology that is being used to screen applicants for  counterterrorism concerns can potentially be modified to screen  applicants for other concerns such as public safety or participation in  transnational organized crime. However, these officials noted such  changes to technology can take a long time.", "DHS officials stated that each department and agency is responsible for  implementing the uniform standards for their relevant immigration  programs. For example, with regard to maintaining information  electronically, State officials stated that for nonimmigrant and immigrant  visas, as of May 2018, they collected most, but not all, of the application  data elements.", "In addition to executive actions taken in calendar year 2017, the  President issued National Security Presidential Memorandum 9 on  February 6, 2018, which directed DHS, in coordination with State, DOJ,  and ODNI, to establish a National Vetting Center to optimize the use of  federal government information in support of the national vetting  enterprise. This memorandum stated that the U.S. government must  develop an integrated approach to the use of intelligence and other data,  across national security components, in order to improve how  departments and agencies coordinate and use information to identify  individuals presenting a threat to national security, border security,  homeland security, or public safety. The center is to be overseen and  guided by a National Vetting Governance Board, consisting of six senior  executives designated by DHS, DOJ, ODNI, State, the Central  Intelligence Agency, and the Department of Defense. Further, within 180  days of the issuance of the memorandum, these six departments and  agencies, in coordination with the Office of Management and Budget, are  to jointly submit to the President for approval an implementation plan for  the center, addressing, among other things, the initial scope of the  center\u2019s vetting activities; the roles and responsibilities of agencies  participating in the center; a resourcing strategy for the center; and a  projected schedule to reach both initial and full operational capability. On  February 14, 2018, the Secretary of Homeland Security selected an  official to serve as the Director of the National Vetting Center and  delegated the center\u2019s authorities to CBP.", "DHS Office of Policy officials stated in February 2018 that the center is  intended to serve as the focal point of the larger screening and vetting  enterprise, and will coordinate policy and set priorities. The center will use  the uniform baselines for screening and vetting standards and procedures  established per EO-2 to set short- and long-term priorities to improve  screening and vetting across the U.S. government. Further, these officials  stated screening and vetting activities will continue to be implemented by  the entities that are currently implementing such efforts, but roles and  responsibilities for screening and vetting for immigration benefits may be  modified in the future based on the work of the center. According to DHS  Office of Policy officials, efforts to implement National Security  Presidential Memorandum 9, such as the development of an  implementation plan, are ongoing as of June 2018.", "Implementation of new visa screening and vetting protocols and  procedures. In response to the EOs and a March 2017 presidential  memorandum issued the same day as EO-2, State has taken several  actions to implement new visa screening and vetting protocols and  procedures. For example, State sought and received emergency  approval from the Office of Management and Budget in May 2017 to  develop a new form, the DS-5535. The form collects additional  information from a subset of visa applicants to more rigorously evaluate  applicants for visa ineligibilities, including those related to national  security and terrorism. The new information requested includes the  applicant\u2019s travel history over the prior 15 years, all phone numbers used  over the prior 15 years, and all email addresses and social media handles  used in the last 5 years.

To temporarily  reduce investigative burdens during the review period, the EO suspended  U.S. entry for nationals of seven countries of particular concern\u2014Iran,  Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. In addition, EO 13769 put  USRAP on hold for 120 days and indefinitely barred admission of Syrian  refugees.
