Over $6 billion was available for the response, led by the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Homeland Security (DHS), with coordination provided by the Homeland Security Council (HSC) through its National Security Staff (NSS). In particular, HHS's CDC worked with states and localities to communicate with the public and to distribute H1N1 vaccine and supplies. GAO was asked (1) how HHS used the funding, (2) the key issues raised by the federal response, and (3) the actions taken to identify and incorporate lessons learned. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from five states about their interaction with the federal government. GAO also reviewed documents and interviewed officials from HHS, DHS, the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), NSS, and others, such as associations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As of December 2010, HHS had spent about two-thirds of the $6.15 billion that it had available for the H1N1 pandemic response. HHS spent the majority of the funds on developing and purchasing H1N1 vaccine and providing grants to all the states and selected local jurisdictions. State and local health officials reported that the grant funding was critical to their response efforts but also noted challenges presented by the grants' administrative requirements. HHS's spending plans for the remaining $1.98 billion include longer-term pandemic preparation efforts, such as activities to reduce the length of time required to produce a vaccine. Several key issues were raised by the federal government's response to the H1N1 pandemic. (1) Prior pandemic planning efforts and federal funding paid off, although specific aspects of prior planning were not relied on because of the nature of the H1N1 pandemic. For example, interagency meetings and exercises built relationships that were valuable during the response. Prior funding built capacity in several areas, including vaccine production. (2) The credibility of all levels of government was diminished when the amount of vaccine available to the public in October 2009 did not meet expectations set by federal officials. However, state and local jurisdictions valued the flexibility that they had in deciding their distribution methods. Additionally, while the use of a central distributor for the vaccines was generally cited as an effective practice, the 100- dose minimum order was viewed to be problematic. (3) Public surveys generally found CDC's communication efforts to be successful in reaching a range of audiences; however, these messages fell short in meeting the needs of some non-English-speaking populations. (4) Deployment of the Strategic National Stockpile--a supply of medicines and medical supplies to be used for a national emergency--met the established goal. However, CDC and state officials identified gaps in planning, including disparities between the materials expected and those delivered, as well as the need for long-term storage plans for stockpile materials. The NSS asked federal agencies--including HHS and DHS--to complete after-action reports based on their involvement in the pandemic response. The NSS has not determined if these reports--and the associated lessons learned--will be shared with key stakeholders. Nevertheless, a DHS official commented that sharing lessons from the reports with key stakeholders would foster a spirit of government transparency and might help build stakeholder trust."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the HSC direct the NSS, in concert with HHS and DHS, to incorporate lessons from the H1N1 pandemic into future planning and share these lessons with key stakeholders.

Prior to  this declaration, H1N1 influenza had spread across the United States after  first being detected in California in April 2009. The Department of Health  and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) estimated that there were as many as 89 million U.S. cases of H1N1  influenza from April 2009 to April 2010. CDC estimated that these cases  led to as many as 403,000 hospitalizations and 18,300 deaths during that  period, with a disproportionate number of children affected as compared  to typical influenza seasons. WHO declared that the 2009 H1N1 influenza  pandemic ended on August 10, 2010.", "Prior to the H1N1 pandemic, federal, state, and local governments were  involved in national pandemic planning and preparedness activities. At the  federal level these activities\u2014which were largely coordinated by the  Homeland Security Council (HSC)\u2014included releasing a national  pandemic strategy and a national pandemic implementation plan in 2005  and 2006, respectively, and holding regular interagency meetings.  Additionally, as part of pandemic planning, HHS funded the development  of medical countermeasures, such as vaccines and antiviral drugs. The  national pandemic strategy and the national pandemic implementation  plan designated HHS and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as  the two agencies that would lead a federal response to an influenza  pandemic. However, because these planning and preparedness activities  were geared toward responding to an avian influenza pandemic that  originated overseas and had a higher fatality rate, some adjustments  during the H1N1 pandemic response were necessary. Accordingly, the  National Security Staff (NSS), which supports the HSC, developed an  additional document, the National Framework for 2009-H1N1 Influenza  Preparedness and Response.", "To aid in the response to the H1N1 pandemic, the federal government took  a variety of measures. The Congress appropriated funds to HHS  specifically to prepare for and respond to an influenza pandemic as part of  a supplemental appropriation in June 2009. The federal government\u2014and  particularly CDC\u2014collaborated with state and local jurisdictions,  professional associations, and private health care providers, among others,  to take a variety of measures to mitigate the spread of disease, such as  communicating with the public, distributing vaccines, conducting  surveillance, and distributing items from the Strategic National Stockpile  (SNS).", "Because of the possibility of another influenza pandemic and our prior  work on pandemic preparedness, you asked us to examine the lessons  learned from the federal response to the H1N1 pandemic and identify how  the federal government is incorporating these lessons into future  pandemic planning. As agreed, this report examines (1) how HHS used  2009 supplemental funding to respond to the H1N1 pandemic, (2) the key  issues raised by the federal government\u2019s response to the H1N1 pandemic,  and (3) the actions that federal agencies are taking to identify and  incorporate lessons learned from the issues that arose from the H1N1  pandemic into planning.", "To examine how HHS used the 2009 supplemental funding to respond to  the H1N1 pandemic, we reviewed the Supplemental Appropriations Act,  2009; HHS\u2019s reports to the Congress detailing the ways that HHS spent  funds; and HHS\u2019s amended spending plans that were also submitted to the  Congress. To determine the reliability of the data in these reports, we  reviewed the reports for internal consistency and resolved questions with  appropriate HHS officials; we did not independently verify the information  provided in these reports. We believe that the data are sufficiently reliable  for our purposes. While HHS used funds from other appropriations in the  H1N1 pandemic response effort, we focused our review on the   $6.15 billion available to HHS that was provided through the 2009  supplemental appropriation. Because this appropriation required that a  portion of the supplemental funds be directed toward upgrading state and  local public health capacity, we reviewed requirements of the grants that  were awarded to state and local jurisdictions for this purpose. To examine  how state and local jurisdictions used the grant funds, we reviewed  documents and interviewed officials from CDC\u2019s Division of State and  Local Readiness, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials  (ASTHO), and the National Association of County and City Health Officials  (NACCHO). We also interviewed officials involved in the H1N1 pandemic  response in a sample of five states\u2014Georgia, Nebraska, Texas, Vermont,  and Washington\u2014to learn about how their jurisdictions used the response  funds. We chose these states to provide insight into the experiences of a  range of states; however, their experiences are not generalizable to all 50  states. We selected states that reflected a range of key characteristics,  including when the state first reported experiencing widespread H1N1  influenza activity, interim state-specific H1N1 vaccination rates among the  initial target groups for the H1N1 vaccine, population in 2008, census  region, total grant amount awarded to the state for the H1N1 pandemic  response, and the state\u2019s public health structure. Appendix I includes  information on the five selected states. In general, within each state, we  spoke with officials from the governor\u2019s office, the state health agency, the  state emergency management agency, and the state education agency. In  addition, to provide an example of how the territories and insular areas  used pandemic grant funds, we contacted officials from the U.S. Virgin  Islands based on the same criteria that we used to select the states in our  sample.", "To examine the key issues raised by the federal government\u2019s response to  the H1N1 pandemic, we focused on the actions of HHS and DHS because  they share federal leadership responsibilities for pandemic influenza  response. Within HHS, we reviewed documents and interviewed officials  from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response  (ASPR), ASPR\u2019s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development  Authority (BARDA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and CDC.  Within DHS, we reviewed documents and interviewed officials from the  Office of Health Affairs, Directorate for Management, Office of Operations  Coordination, and Federal Emergency Management Agency. Because of  their respective roles in the H1N1 pandemic response, we also reviewed  documents and interviewed officials from the Department of Education\u2019s  (Education) Office of Safe and Drug Free Schools regarding school  closure policies and the Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and  Health Administration (OSHA) regarding guidance on the use of personal  protective equipment and the protection of workers\u2019 safety and health.  To learn about the federal government\u2019s interaction with state and local  jurisdictions, we interviewed officials from the same judgmental sample of  five states.

This strategy and plan  established that the Secretary of Health and Human Services is to lead the  federal public health and medical response to a pandemic and the  Secretary of Homeland Security is to lead the overall domestic incident  management and federal coordination.", "Additionally, prior to the H1N1 pandemic, the Congress appropriated  funds to support the federal government\u2019s influenza pandemic  preparedness and improve related state and local public health  capabilities. In fiscal year 2006, the Congress appropriated about   $5.60 billion to HHS through supplemental appropriations to support  pandemic preparedness and response efforts, such as vaccine and antiviral  drug development and stockpiling, state and local preparedness, and  international collaboration. HHS reported spending more than half of the  funds (about $3.10 billion) on activities related to vaccine development,  stockpiling, and infrastructure improvement. For example, the department  awarded contracts to two domestic influenza vaccine manufacturers to  retrofit their facilities\u2014that is, to upgrade existing facilities to optimize  and enhance their ability to produce influenza vaccines. HHS spent nearly  a quarter of the funds (about $1.30 billion) on activities related to  developing and stockpiling antiviral drugs. For example, the department  completed the purchase of 50 million courses of antiviral drugs for the  SNS and provided funding to states to increase state stockpiles as part of  its goal of ensuring the availability of antiviral drug treatment courses for  25 percent of the U.S. population in case of an influenza pandemic.

At the same time, an outbreak of H1N1  influenza was occurring in Mexico. In response, the NSS developed the  National Framework for 2009-H1N1 Influenza Preparedness and  Response as a tool to guide the federal response efforts.

The H1N1 vaccines were  manufactured using the same methods that these manufacturers used for  seasonal influenza vaccine production.", "In anticipation of the availability of the H1N1 vaccine and the possibility  that initial supply might not meet demand for the vaccine, in July 2009,  CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued  recommendations for the target groups for the H1N1 vaccine. These five  target groups, comprising about 159 million persons, were recommended  to be first to receive the H1N1 vaccine. ACIP also identified a subset of  the initial target groups, comprising about 42 million persons, to whom  providers should give priority if H1N1 vaccine availability was too limited  to initiate vaccination for all people in the five initial target groups.  However, at the time it made the recommendations, ACIP did not predict  that there would be a need to limit vaccine to the subset of the target  groups in most areas of the country.", "Unlike seasonal influenza vaccine, which is largely purchased by the  private sector, the federal government purchased all of the H1N1 vaccine  licensed for use in the United States.

The PHER grant  funds were distributed in four phases beginning in August 2009, with each  phase of funding targeting specific focus areas, such as vaccination or  communication efforts with high-risk populations. A report by ASTHO  concluded that state and local jurisdictions could not have responded as  effectively to the H1N1 pandemic without the PHER grant funds,  particularly given the ongoing budgetary constraints of states.

Additionally, the different limitations on the use of funds in each phase  made it difficult for states to plan and manage their response  activities.", "Some of the local officials we interviewed reported that the specific  spending requirements of the PHER funding were heavily weighted  toward vaccination activities and that funds were neither flexible nor  sufficient enough to address epidemiology and laboratory expenses.  Officials from Washington\u2019s Department of Health, for example,  echoed this concern and told us that some local health jurisdictions in  the state did not have enough funding for surveillance and laboratory  expenses, but had more than enough designated for vaccination  activities. Almost half of states applied for the last phase of funding\u2014 and 15 states received the funds\u2014which were available in early 2010  for targeting special, hard-to-reach populations for vaccination.

To reduce the time that it takes for funding  to reach the states, CDC officials identified ways to save time for various  procedures, such as preparing draft grant guidance in advance of public  health emergencies. Additionally, CDC officials told us that they are  working with ASTHO to help states be better prepared to quickly use  federal funding that might become available in an emergency situation.  For example, CDC officials noted that states with independent local health  jurisdictions could establish draft contracts with these local health  jurisdictions so that funding could flow more quickly down to the local  level. In addition to these measures, CDC officials are working with their  General Counsel\u2019s office to look at any authorities that they may have to  move funds through existing cooperative agreements in an emergency.  CDC officials also agreed that the phases of the PHER grants were heavily  weighted toward vaccination, but noted that they made that decision  because of the anticipation that the vaccination campaign would be the  largest component of the public health response. In August 2010, the state  and local jurisdictions received a no-cost extension that allows them to  spend the PHER grant funds through July 2011.

The national  pandemic strategy and national pandemic implementation plan were  based on a scenario of a severe 1918-like pandemic, as well as the existing  threat that an avian influenza strain, originating overseas, would cause the  next pandemic. During the early months of the H1N1 outbreak, officials  from DHS and other departments reported that the action items in the  national pandemic implementation plan for which their respective  departments had responsibility\u2014such as border and trade measures\u2014 were not relevant for the H1N1 outbreak, and therefore were not  activated. Federal officials noted, however, that while these actions were  not taken in the H1N1 pandemic response, they could be important in a  future pandemic with different characteristics, such as if there is a severe  pandemic that affects critical infrastructure.", "Another aspect of the national pandemic strategy and national pandemic  implementation plan that was not fully tested was the shared leadership  roles and responsibilities for both HHS and DHS in responding to an  influenza pandemic. We previously reported that it was unclear how this  shared leadership would work in practice. Under the national pandemic  strategy and national pandemic implementation plan, both departments  share leadership responsibilities\u2014HHS to manage the federal public  health and medical response and DHS to lead domestic incident  management and federal coordination. As a result, we recommended that  HHS and DHS work together to develop and conduct rigorous testing,  training, and exercising for pandemic influenza to ensure that the federal  leadership roles are clearly defined and understood and that leaders are  able to effectively execute shared responsibilities. HHS officials told us  that they are planning to exercise these roles with DHS.", "The shared leadership roles between HHS and DHS were not fully  implemented during this pandemic. Officials from both HHS and DHS told  us that once it became clear that the H1N1 pandemic required primarily a  public health response, HHS was responsible for most of the key  activities. Nevertheless, some state officials cited concerns about the  shared federal leadership roles in the early days of the pandemic response.  Specifically, officials we interviewed in four of the five states said that  during that period, HHS and DHS did not effectively coordinate their  release of information to their state contacts.

For example, representatives from the Georgia Emergency  Management Agency told us that at one point DHS officials were telling  states that confirmation of H1N1 influenza cases needed to be completed  by a laboratory, which was the initial CDC guidance, while HHS officials  were telling states they could confirm H1N1 cases by laboratories or an  analysis of symptoms that the patient was experiencing, which was the  revised CDC guidance at the end of August 2009. Officials in Vermont,  Washington, and Georgia told us that over time it appeared to them that  HHS\u2014and primarily HHS\u2019s CDC\u2014took the lead in communicating about  H1N1 and, accordingly, the number of calls and information sources  decreased."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prior Federal Funding and Planning Built Capacity and Interagency Relationships, Which Facilitated the Federal Response", "paragraphs": ["Federal funding and planning for pandemic preparedness prior to the  onset of the H1N1 pandemic paid off by building capacity in several areas,  including (1) vaccine production, (2) influenza diagnosis, and (3) antiviral  drug development and stockpiling.

These  two manufacturers told us that the expanded capacity enabled them to  start production of the H1N1 vaccine while they finished their production  of seasonal influenza vaccine. Second, one of the influenza diagnostic tests  that HHS\u2019s pandemic planning efforts helped fund detected the first case  of H1N1 influenza as part of a clinical trial at the Naval Health Research  Laboratory in San Diego, California. Third, the antiviral drug Peramivir\u2014 which was developed using pandemic preparedness funds\u2014was made  available for the first time during the H1N1 pandemic, and CDC delivered  about 2,100 5-day treatment courses to hospitals. Also, according to CDC  officials involved in the response, no national shortage of adult antiviral  drugs occurred during the H1N1 pandemic, which may have been due in  part to prior federal and state stockpiling efforts. There was, however, a  shortage of pediatric antiviral drugs in the fall of 2009.", "Through interagency planning efforts, federal officials built relationships  that helped facilitate the federal response to the H1N1 pandemic. Officials  from HHS\u2019s ASPR and CDC, DHS, and Education stated that these  interagency meetings, working together on existing pandemic and  nonpandemic programs, and exercises conducted prior to the H1N1  pandemic built relationships that were valuable for the H1N1 pandemic  response. Specifically, HHS officials said that federal coordination during  the H1N1 pandemic was much easier because of these formal networks  and informal relationships built during pandemic planning activities and  exercises. For example, in developing the national pandemic strategy and  national pandemic implementation plan, the HSC convened regular  interagency meetings to facilitate cooperation and coordination across the  federal government to prepare for an influenza pandemic. The NSS  continued to hold these interagency meetings during the H1N1 pandemic  response. Also, Education and CDC officials told us that in addition to  these formal meetings, they had existing working relationships with each  other that had been built while developing and managing a range of  programs. Finally, officials from HHS, DHS, and other agencies held joint  pandemic exercises to test various parts of the plan. As we have  previously reported, DHS officials have said that exercises offer the best  opportunity\u2014short of actual emergencies\u2014to determine if plans are  understood and work. DHS officials stated that as a result of pandemic  planning and exercises, DHS and other federal agency officials knew  whom to contact within federal agencies when H1N1 influenza emerged.  NSS and HHS officials reported to us in April 2011 that many of the same  departments and officials are meeting regularly as part of a new group to  discuss emerging pandemic threats.", "Planning efforts also allowed federal and state officials to build upon  preexisting relationships that were useful during the pandemic response.  These relationships had been built through daily interactions  implementing grant programs, developing state and local pandemic plans,  and working together in pandemic planning exercises. For example, CDC  held a pandemic planning exercise with other federal officials and 11 state  and local jurisdictions in October 2008. During this exercise, officials  practiced responding to a pandemic influenza situation. A senior CDC  official said that preexisting relationships with states and localities  allowed them to be frank, informal, and comfortable with each other when  responding to the H1N1 pandemic. Georgia health officials told us that  they spoke to CDC project officers daily during the H1N1 response to  provide real-time situational awareness because of their relationships  formed prior to the pandemic. Washington health officials also said that  existing relationships with CDC officials helped their response efforts.  Specifically, CDC revised school closure guidance based in part on  experiences with school closures in Seattle, Washington. This revised  guidance recognized that because the disease severity of H1N1 influenza  was similar to that of seasonal influenza and the virus had already spread  within communities, the focus was on keeping sick children and staff at  home rather than closing schools as a way to stop the spread of the virus."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Failure to Meet Public Expectations about Vaccine Availability Diminished Government Credibility, but Some Practices for H1N1 Vaccine Distribution Were Reported to Be Valuable", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "H1N1 Vaccine Was Not Widely Available When Expected nor When Demand Was Highest", "paragraphs": ["By the time H1N1 vaccine was widely available, the peak of H1N1  influenza activity had passed and many individuals were no longer as  interested in getting vaccinated.

The national pandemic  implementation plan established a goal of expanding influenza vaccine  manufacturing surge capacity for the production of pandemic vaccines to  allow for the entire domestic population to be able to receive a vaccine  within 6 months of a pandemic declaration. During the H1N1 pandemic,  the H1N1 vaccine was first available in the United States in October 2009,  or almost 4 months after WHO\u2019s pandemic declaration, but was not widely  available for all who wanted to be vaccinated until late December 2009.  (See fig. 4 for a timeline of key events related to H1N1 vaccine production  and distribution.) A RAND Corporation study found that at the onset of  influenza activity, about half of adults were willing to get vaccinated, but  after the vaccine became available, CDC reported that only about 23  percent of adults actually were vaccinated.", "The credibility of all levels of government was diminished when the  amount of vaccine available to the public in October 2009 did not meet  expectations set by federal officials. During the summer of 2009, HHS  conveyed to state and local jurisdictions, and to the public, that a robust  H1N1 vaccine supply, about 120 million to 160 million doses, was expected  to be available in October 2009. Ultimately, only about 23 million doses of  H1N1 vaccine were allocated for ordering by states and local jurisdictions  at the end of October 2009, and because of the time required to order and  ship the vaccine, fewer than 17 million doses were shipped out that month. Consequently, the public had an unfavorable view of the federal  government\u2019s ability to provide the country with the H1N1 vaccine. A  Gallup survey of U.S. adults from early November 2009, found that 54  percent of adults said the federal government was doing a poor (41  percent) or very poor (13 percent) job of providing the country with  adequate supplies of the vaccine. An ASTHO report echoed that loss of  government credibility also was a concern at the state level. ASTHO  concluded that state health department officials felt that dealing with slow  and variable vaccine delivery and shifting messages about vaccine  availability overshadowed all of their other response activities. For  example, when vaccine availability was less than anticipated, state and  local health departments had to cancel planned and publicized mass  vaccination clinics and change their messages to the public about  vaccination at a time when H1N1 influenza activity was peaking. Also, at  the local level, health department officials in Fulton County, Georgia,  stated that they canceled several school-based vaccination clinics because  they lacked the H1N1 vaccine. According to these officials, once the H1N1  vaccine became available, parents were not interested in vaccinating their  children because H1N1 influenza activity had already peaked in the area.", "HHS has acknowledged that the H1N1 vaccine arrived too late in the  response and noted the department is actively looking for ways to shorten  the time required for vaccine production. The agency plans to use a  portion of the remaining 2009 pandemic supplemental funds for these  efforts. According to the Director of BARDA\u2014who during the H1N1  pandemic response was responsible for overseeing the largest  development and production of vaccine in U.S. history\u2014once HHS staff  were positioned at the vaccine manufacturing plants and manufacturers  were required to report their time frames in a standard manner, HHS had a  better understanding of the vaccine manufacturing process and the  estimates for vaccine availability became more accurate in November  2009.

NACCHO, as well as participants in a series of IOM  workshops, reported that officials from state and local jurisdictions  welcomed the flexibility to determine their own vaccine distribution plans.  At the same time, state officials acknowledged that the flexibility, while  appreciated, also led to confusion or the appearance of inequity, especially  when the public became aware of different approaches taken in  neighboring jurisdictions. Participants in an IOM workshop reported that  officials from jurisdictions that had approaches different from neighboring  jurisdictions found it hard to communicate to the public about why one  county or state was vaccinating a certain subset of their population while  another was not. For example, Snohomish County, Washington, initially  included teachers in its target groups and conducted mass vaccination  clinics, while neighboring Seattle-King County did not include teachers  and distributed its initial supply of vaccine to physicians who were to  vaccinate their patients. An official from the Seattle-King County health  department reported that the public was confused by the differences.  Washington health officials told us that they attempted to coordinate use  of the target groups at the state level, but because local jurisdictions  ultimately have control of local public health policies in the state, there  were still differences between counties in implementation. Also, Vermont  officials told us that the neighboring state of New York began vaccinating  the general public beyond the target groups while Vermont was still  waiting for guidance from CDC to widen its distribution.", "CDC attempted to minimize confusion and anxiety by alerting the public  that there would be differences in distribution methods. CDC\u2019s  spokespeople emphasized this variation in the majority of the 18 press  briefings that the agency held from September 2009 through December  2009 that we reviewed.

The Vaccines for Children program\u2019s  central distributor shipped the H1N1 vaccine from regional distribution  centers that received the H1N1 vaccines from five vaccine manufacturers  to individual providers or organizations identified by state and local  jurisdictions. State and local health officials, in conjunction with  professional associations such as the American Medical Association,  identified providers who signed agreements to administer the H1N1  vaccine, including providers who had not previously participated in the  Vaccines for Children program, such as obstetricians, gynecologists, and  other physicians who treat and immunize adults. According to CDC  officials, once H1N1 vaccine arrived at the central distributor\u2019s regional  distribution centers, 95 percent of the ordered doses of H1N1 vaccine were  shipped out in accordance with CDC\u2019s contract. An official with the  Association of Immunization Managers, which represents immunization  program managers in state and local jurisdictions, involved in the response  reported that use of the central distributor was a \u201cbest\u201d practice during the  H1N1 pandemic response because the central distributor was already in  place and in operation. This official noted that she did not hear any issues  or complaints from her association\u2019s members about the use of the central  distributor. Officials from four of the states we contacted also noted that  the central distributor worked well. Alternatively, CDC could have shipped  the H1N1 vaccine out to SNS receiving sites in states; CDC\u2019s prior  pandemic planning had focused on direct distribution by manufacturers to  a limited number of state health department\u2013designated sites. However,  officials had decided that using a private distributor\u2014that routinely  distributes seasonal influenza and other vaccines\u2014was a preferable  method. CDC officials stated that because of the success of the central  distributor during the H1N1 pandemic, CDC now views this method as the  most efficient and effective method of vaccine distribution. State officials  in two states reported that using the SNS sites instead of the central  distributor would have caused logistical challenges.", "While the use of a central vaccine distributor was generally cited as an  effective practice by state and local health officials during the H1N1  pandemic, some state health officials noted challenges with the  distribution process. Specifically, some state officials said that the central  distributor\u2019s 100-dose minimum shipment requirement caused problems.  As part of its contract with CDC, the central distributor required that  shipments to each site include a minimum of 100 doses of H1N1 vaccine.  Officials in three of the five states we contacted, as well as the U.S. Virgin  Islands, told us that the 100-dose minimum ordering requirement caused  difficulties because they had to break down the 100-dose shipments into  smaller shipments so they could be shipped to smaller vaccine providers.  Texas officials told us that the state hired a third-party contractor to  receive and repackage the shipments for smaller vaccine providers.  ASTHO also cited this issue as a challenge, noting that the dosage order  requirements caused delays in some providers receiving the H1N1  vaccine. According to CDC officials, at the time that they were  negotiating the distribution contract, the possibility existed that up to 600  million doses of H1N1 vaccine would need to be distributed as quickly and  efficiently as possible, a magnitude that was unprecedented and  untested. At that time, CDC and the distributor determined that it would  be inefficient and even cost prohibitive for the contractor to hire the  additional staff to break packages into smaller units for distribution."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Public Surveys Generally Found CDC\u2019s Public Communication Campaign to Be Effective, but Communication Materials Were Not Accessible for All Populations", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Public Surveys Found CDC\u2019s Communication Campaign to Be Effective", "paragraphs": ["Public surveys, state officials, and representatives from professional  associations generally found CDC\u2019s public communication campaign to be  effective. To gauge the effectiveness of its communication campaign and  other aspects of the H1N1 response, CDC and others contracted with the  Harvard School of Public Health to conduct regular surveys of the public  regarding the H1N1 response. One study, conducted as part of this  initiative in March 2010 and April 2010 with a nationally representative  sample of U.S. adults aged 18 years and older, found that 70 percent of  adults rated CDC\u2019s H1N1 influenza communication campaign as excellent  (25 percent) or good (45 percent). Ratings of the communication  campaign did not differ considerably among different ethnic groups.  Further, more than half of adults reported seeing or hearing the key H1N1  protection and prevention messages, which included messages suggesting  that people should get the H1N1 vaccine, wash their hands or use hand  sanitizer frequently, stay home from work or school if sick, and cough or  sneeze into one\u2019s elbow or shoulder.

The Director of the Center for Infectious Disease  Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota noted that CDC\u2019s  communication campaign gave the public the sense that the federal  government was in charge of the pandemic response. CDC also held a 2- day conference in August 2009 to educate the media about influenza and  what the fall influenza season could entail. CDC officials said the  conference provided context for the media representatives in attendance,  fostered an environment of transparency, and established a relationship  between media and CDC officials. In addition to the interactions with the  media, CDC used a variety of tools to reach the public directly (see fig. 5).  According to CDC officials, communications was an integrated part of the  response, with senior communications officials from across the agency  represented when all major decisions were made.

For example, CDC had representatives  from professional associations representing state and local health officials  at its Emergency Operations Center during the second wave of the  pandemic, which occurred in fall 2009. This was the first time that this  type of involvement had happened, according to the association and CDC  officials. According to CDC officials, the inclusion of these organizations  helped foster transparency and allowed for the federal government to  better understand the perspectives of state and local jurisdictions.  Officials from Texas\u2019s health department noted that CDC shared talking  points with them before conference calls. These officials told us that this  gave them credibility because they were aware of information before it  was shared broadly.

In 2007, HHS and the Department of Labor issued joint  guidance recommending that health care workers use respirators when in  close contact with patients who have confirmed or suspected influenza  during a pandemic. In May 2009, CDC released infection control guidance  for clinicians to use during the H1N1 outbreak that was consistent with the  2007 guidance. Further, a September 2009 study by IOM, which was  requested by CDC and Department of Labor\u2019s OSHA, agreed with the  existing 2007 guidance in the specific case of H1N1 influenza.

The Infectious Disease Society of America and WHO  recommended that health care workers only be required to wear  respirators during health care procedures that involve specific types of  exposure, such as intubation, resuscitation, or open suctioning of the  respiratory tract. According to HHS officials, many clinicians preferred to  adhere to the infection control procedures that they use for seasonal  influenza. An ASTHO report noted that conflicts in guidance left health  care and other affected organizations wondering which guidance to  follow. Further, ASTHO reported that the requirement for health care  workers to wear respirators resulted in supply shortages and required  extra time and resources by health care facilities for fit testing. Officials  from OSHA told us, and IOM reported, that the available guidance is  contradictory because scientific research about routes of disease  transmission and respirator efficacy is inconclusive.

Specifically, while the  H1N1 pandemic provided the opportunity to test and implement many  aspects of the federal government\u2019s plans to respond to a pandemic, not all  parts of these plans\u2014such as those dealing with critical infrastructure  protection and implementing border and trade measures\u2014were tested. In  addition, the shared leadership structure was not fully tested, and states  raised concerns about their brief experience with these shared leadership  roles. HHS\u2019s and DHS\u2019s plans to test this structure will be an important  step to addressing this gap. These aspects may prove to be necessary in  response to a future pandemic, given that avian and other strains of  influenza remain a threat.", "Our review of the federal government\u2019s response to the H1N1 pandemic  highlighted several key lessons:    Planning and preparedness pay off. While the actual H1N1 outbreak  and pandemic differed from the avian influenza pandemic scenario  that was the basis for the planning, many of the funding and planning  activities\u2014including funding for vaccine production capacity, planning  exercises, and interagency meetings prior to the H1N1 pandemic\u2014 positioned the government to respond effectively. The interagency  working group, convened by the NSS, fostered relationships that  proved advantageous during the response.", "Effective communication on the availability of vaccine is central to a  successful response. Although the federal government was able to  purchase and distribute millions of doses of H1N1 vaccine, the vaccine  was not widely available when the public expected it and at the peak  of demand. Because the failure to effectively manage public  expectations can undermine government credibility, it is essential that  vaccine production efforts be paired with effective communication  strategies regarding the availability of the vaccine.", "Timely, accessible information from CDC is valuable. The public  proved to be highly receptive to the information CDC disseminated  regarding the pandemic and what individuals could do to reduce their  susceptibility to H1N1 influenza. However, the effectiveness of  communication materials was diminished for some non-English- speaking populations when translated materials were not available to  them in a timely manner. We heard from state and local health  jurisdictions that they need materials in more languages, and they  suggested that communications would be more accurate and  translated more efficiently if key materials were translated centrally.", "Given the key role of the SNS in a public health emergency,  consideration of logistics, inventory, and different scenarios is  important in planning for SNS deployment. The largest deployment of  the SNS to date occurred during the H1N1 pandemic response, but  several issues emerged because scenarios arose that had not been  anticipated. Resolving these issues now\u2014in planning for future SNS  deployment\u2014will allow for better use of SNS resources during the  next public health emergency.", "Novel strains of influenza, including avian influenza strains, will continue  to pose the threat of an influenza pandemic that could be more severe than  the H1N1 pandemic. Accordingly, the failure to learn from the federal  government\u2019s response to the H1N1 pandemic could be costly in terms of  lives and resources, regardless of whether future planning is specific to a  pandemic scenario or if it is incorporated into a broader   \u201call-hazards\u201d planning scenario. Although the NSS has requested that  federal agencies prepare after-action reports, NSS officials have not  decided how they will work with HHS and DHS to incorporate these  lessons into any future planning, as called for by the National Response  Framework, or how they will share these lessons with key stakeholders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Homeland Security Council direct the National  Security Staff to take the following two actions: In order to help the federal government prepare for a future influenza  pandemic, work with the Departments of Health and Human Services  and Homeland Security\u2014as well as other federal agencies and state  and local jurisdictions, as applicable\u2014to update planning and  exercising by incorporating lessons learned from federal agencies\u2019  H1N1 after-action reports and the lessons we identified from the H1N1  pandemic.
