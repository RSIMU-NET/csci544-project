My remarks today are  based on an ongoing study and our observations are preliminary.

As a  result, the number of workers paying into the system for each beneficiary  is projected to decline. This demographic trend is occurring or will occur  in all OECD countries. Although the number of workers for every elderly  person in the U.S. has been relatively stable over the past few decades, it  has already fallen substantially in other developed countries. The number  of workers for every elderly person in the U.S. is projected to fall from 4.1  in 2005 to 2.9 in 2020. In nine of the OECD countries, this number has  already fallen below the level projected for the U.S. in 2020. This rise in the  share of the elderly in the population could have significant effects on  countries\u2019 economies, particularly during the period from 2010 to 2030.  These effects may include slower economic growth and increased costs  for aging-related government programs.", "Historically, developed countries have relied on some form of a PAYG  program and have used a variety of approaches to reform their national  pension systems. In many cases, these approaches provide a basic or  minimum benefit as well as a benefit based on the level of a worker\u2019s  earnings. Several countries are preparing to pay future benefits by either  supplementing or replacing their PAYG programs. For example, some have  set aside and invested current resources in a national pension reserve fund  to partially pre-fund their PAYG program. Some have established fully  funded individual accounts. These are not mutually exclusive types of  reform. In fact, many countries have undertaken more than one of the  following types of reform:    Adjustments to existing pay-as-you-go systems. Typically, these are  designed to create a more sustainable program by increasing contributions  or decreasing benefits, or both, while preserving the basic structure of the  system. Measures include phasing in higher retirement ages, equalizing  retirement ages across genders, and increasing the earnings period over  which initial benefits are calculated. Some countries have created notional  defined contribution (NDC) accounts for each worker, which tie benefits  more closely to each worker\u2019s contributions and to factors such as the  growth rate of the economy.", "National pension reserve funds. These are set up to partially pre-fund  PAYG national pension programs. Governments commit to make regular  transfers to these investment funds from, for example, budgetary  surpluses. To the extent that these contribute to national saving, they  reduce the need for future borrowing or large increases in contribution  rates to pay scheduled benefits. Funds can be invested in a combination of  government securities and domestic as well as foreign equities.", "Individual accounts. These fully funded accounts are administered either  by employers or the government or designated third parties. The level of  retirement benefits depends largely on the amount of each person\u2019s  contributions into the account during their working life, investment  earnings, and the amount of fees they are required to pay.", "We are applying GAO\u2019s Social Security reform criteria to the experiences  of countries that are members of the OECD as well as Chile, which  pioneered individual accounts in 1981. We are assessing both the extent to  which another country\u2019s circumstances are similar enough to those in the  U.S. to provide a useful example and the extent to which particular  approaches to pension reform were considered to be successful. Countries  have different starting points, including unique economic and political  environments. Moreover availability of other sources of retirement  income, such as occupation-based pensions, varies greatly. Recognizing  this, GAO uses three criteria for evaluating pension reforms:    Financing Sustainable Solvency. We are looking at the extent to which  particular reforms influence the funds available to pay benefits and how  the reforms affect the ability of the economy, the government\u2019s budget,  and national savings to support the program on a continuing basis.", "Balancing Equity and Adequacy. We are examining the relative balance  struck between the goals of allowing individuals to receive a fair return on  their contributions and ensuring an adequate level of benefits to prevent  dependency and poverty.", "Implementing and Administering Reforms. We are considering how  easily a reform is implemented and administered and how the public is  educated concerning the reform.", "Because each country is introducing reforms in a unique demographic,  economic, and political context these factors will likely affect reform  choices and outcomes. For instance, several European countries we are  reviewing have strong occupation-based pension programs that contribute  to retirement income security. In addition, some countries had more  generous national pensions and other programs supporting the elderly  than others. All countries also provide benefits for survivors and the  disabled; often these are funded separately from old age benefit programs.  Some countries are carrying out reforms against a backdrop of broader  national change. For example, Hungary and Poland were undergoing large  political and economic transformations as they reformed their national  pension systems. All of these issues should be considered when drawing  lessons.", "In addition to the adjustments that countries have made to their existing  PAYG systems, many countries have undergone other changes as well,  indicating that change may not be a one-time experience.

Generally countries with national pension programs that are relatively  financially sustainable have undertaken a package of several far-reaching  adjustments. The countries we are studying increased contributions to  PAYG programs by raising contribution rates, increasing the range of  earnings or kinds of earnings subject to contribution requirements, or  increasing the retirement age. Most of these countries increased  contribution rates for some or all workers. Canada, for example, increased  contributions to its Canadian Pension Plan from a total of 5.85 percent to  9.9 percent of wages, half paid by employers and half by employees.  Several countries, including the UK, increased contributions by expanding  the range of earnings subject to contributions requirements.", "Nearly all of the countries we are studying decreased scheduled benefits,  using a wide range of techniques. Some techniques reduce the level of  initial benefits; others reduce the rate at which benefits increase during  retirement or adjust benefits based on retirees\u2019 financial means.", "Increased years of earnings. To reduce initial benefits several countries  increased the number of years of earnings they consider in calculating an  average lifetime earnings level. France previously based its calculation on  10 years, but increased this to 25 years for its basic public program.", "Increased minimum years of contributions. Another approach is to  increase the minimum number of years of contributions required to  receive a full benefit. France increased the required number of years from  37.5 to 40 years. Belgium is increasing its minimum requirement for early  retirement from 20 to 35 years.", "Changed formula for calculating benefits. Another approach to decreasing  the initial benefit is to change the formula for adjusting prior years\u2019  earnings. Countries with traditional PAYG programs all make some  adjustment to the nominal amount of wages earned previously to reflect  changes in prices or wages over the intervening years. Although most of  the countries we are studying use some kind of average wage index,  others, including Belgium and France, have adopted the use of price  indices. The choice of a wage or price index can have quite different  effects depending on the rate at which wages increase in comparison to  prices. We see variation in the extent to which wages outpace prices over  time and among countries.", "Changed basis for determining year-to-year increases in benefits. In many  of the countries we are studying, the rate at which monthly retirement  benefits increase from year-to-year during retirement is based on increases  in prices, which generally rise more slowly than earnings. Others,  including Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, use  increases in earnings or a combination of wage and price indices. Hungary,  for example, changed from the use of a wage index to the Swiss method\u2014 an index weighted 50 percent on price changes and 50 percent on changes  in earnings.", "Implemented provisions that provide a closer link between pension  contributions and benefits. Countries that have adopted this approach  stop promising a defined level of benefits and instead keep track of  notional contributions into workers\u2019 NDC accounts. Unlike individual  accounts, these notional defined accounts are not funded. Current  contributions to the program continue to be used largely to pay benefits to  current workers, while at the same time they are credited to individuals\u2019  notional accounts. When these programs include adjustments that link  benefits to factors such as economic growth, longevity, and/or the ratio of  workers to retirees, they may contribute to the financial sustainability of  national pension systems.", "Several countries, such as Sweden and the UK, have undertaken one or  more of these adjustments to their PAYG programs and have achieved, or  are on track to achieve relative financial sustainability. Others, including  Japan, France, and Germany, may need additional reforms to fund future  benefit commitments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Maintenance of a Safety Net and Work and Saving Incentives Proved Important", "paragraphs": ["All of the countries have included in their reforms provisions to ensure  adequate benefits for lower-income groups and put into place programs  designed to ensure that all qualified retirees have a minimum level of  income. Most do so by providing a targeted means-tested program that  provides more benefits to retirees with limited financial means. Two  countries\u2014Germany and Italy\u2014provide retirees access to general social  welfare programs that are available to people of all ages rather than  programs with different provisions for elderly people.", "Twelve countries use another approach to providing a safety net: a basic  retirement benefit. The level of the benefit is either a given amount per  month for all retirees or an amount based on years of contributions to the  program. In Ireland, for example, workers who contribute to the program  for a specified period receive a minimum pension. Chile set a minimum  pension equal to the minimum wage\u2014about one-quarter of average  earnings as of 2005. In addition, several of the countries we are studying  give very low-income workers credit for a minimum level contribution.  Other countries give workers credit for years in which they were  unemployed, pursued postsecondary education, or cared for dependents.", "In selecting between the many reform options, policy makers need to  strike a careful balance among the following objectives: provide a safety  net, contain costs, and maintain incentives to work and save. Costs can be  high if a generous basic pension is provided to all eligible retirees  regardless of their income. On the other hand, means-tested benefits can  diminish incentives to work and save. The UK provides both a basic state  pension and a means-tested pension credit. Concerned about the decline  in the proportion of preretirement earnings provided by the basic state  pension, some have advocated making it more generous. Others argue that  focusing safety-net spending on those in need enables the government to  alleviate pensioner poverty in a cost effective manner. However, a  guaranteed minimum income could reduce some peoples\u2019 incentive to  save. In view of this disincentive, the UK adopted an additional means- tested benefit that provides higher benefits for retirees near the minimum  income level. This benefit, called the savings credit, allows low-income  retirees near the minimum pension level to retain a portion of their  additional income. However, any loss of income due to means-testing still  diminishes incentives to save. Without changes to pension rules, the  proportion of pensioners eligible for means-tested income is expected to  increase to include almost 65 percent of retiree households by 2050."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation, Administration, and Public Education Are Important", "paragraphs": ["The extent to which new provisions are implemented, administered, and  explained to the public may affect the outcome of the reform.

As of early 2004, the  system generated statements indicating contributions workers made  during 2002, but there was no indication of what workers contributed in  earlier years or to previous pension programs. Without knowing how  much they have in their notional defined accounts, workers may have a  difficult time planning for their retirement. Some governments have had  limited success in efforts to educate workers about changes in provisions  that will affect their retirement income. For example, a survey of women  in the UK showed that only about 43 percent of women who will be  affected by an increase in the retirement age knew the age that applied to  them."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Early Action and Effective Management Help Make National Pension Reserve Funds Successful", "paragraphs": ["Another type of pension reform is the accumulation of reserves in national  pension funds, which can contribute to the system\u2019s financial  sustainability depending on when the funds are created or reformed and  how they are managed. Countries that chose to partially pre-fund their  PAYG programs decades ago have had more time to amass substantial  reserves, reducing the risk that they will not meet their pension  obligations. A record of poor fund performance has led some countries to  put reserve funds under the administration of relatively independent  managers with the mandate to maximize returns without undue risk."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Early Action Matters", "paragraphs": ["Establishing reserve funds ahead of demographic changes\u2014well before  the share of elderly in the population increases substantially\u2014makes it  more likely that enough assets will accumulate to meet future pension  obligations. In countries such as Sweden, Denmark, and Finland, which  have had long experiences with partial pre-funding of PAYG programs,  important reserves have already built up. These resources are expected to  make significant contributions to the long-term finances of national  pension programs. Other countries that have recently created pension  reserve funds for their pension program have a tighter time frame to  accumulate enough reserves before population aging starts straining  public finances. In particular, the imminent retirement of the baby-boom  generation is likely to make it challenging to continue channeling a  substantial amount of resources to these funds. France, for example, relies  primarily on social security surpluses to finance its pension reserve fund  set up in 1999, but given its demographic trends, may be able to do so only  in the next few years. Similarly, Belgium and the Netherlands plan on  maintaining a budget surplus, reducing public debt and the interest  payments associated with the debt, and transferring these earmarked  resources to their reserve funds. However, maintaining a surplus will  require sustained budgetary discipline as a growing number of retirees  begins putting pressure on public finances."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effective Management Can Contribute to Financial Sustainability", "paragraphs": ["Examples from several countries reveal that pre-funding with national  pension reserve funds is less likely to be effective in helping ensure that  national pension programs are financially sustainable if these funds are  used for purposes other than supporting the PAYGO program. Some  countries have used funds to pursue industrial, economic, or social  objectives. For example, Japan used its reserve fund to support  infrastructure projects, provide housing and education loans, and  subsidize small and medium enterprises. As a result, Japan compromised  to some extent the principal goal of pre-funding.", "Past experiences have also highlighted the need to mitigate certain risks  that pension reserve funds face. One kind of risk has to do with the fact  that asset build-up in a fund may lead to competing pressures for tax cuts  and spending increases, especially when a fund is integrated in the  national budget. For example, governments may view fund resources as a  ready source of credit. As a result, they may be inclined to spend more  than they would otherwise, potentially undermining the purpose of pre- funding. Ireland alleviated the risk that its reserve fund could raise  government consumption by prohibiting investment of fund assets in  domestic government bonds.", "Another risk is the pressure that groups may exert on the investment  choices of a pension reserve fund, potentially lowering returns. For  example, Canada and Japan have requirements to invest a minimum share  of their fund portfolio in domestic assets, restricting holdings of foreign  assets to stimulate economic development at home. Funds in several  countries have also faced pressure to adopt ethical investment criteria,  with possible negative impacts on returns. In recent years, some countries  have taken steps to ensure that funds are managed to maximize returns,  without undue risk. Canada, for example, has put its fund under the  control of an independent Investment Board operating at arm\u2019s length  from the government since the late 1990\u2019s.

A common  challenge faced by countries that adopt individual accounts is how to pay  for both a new funded pension and an existing PAYG pension  simultaneously, known as transition costs. Countries will encounter  transition costs depending on whether the individual accounts redirect  revenue from the existing PAYG program, the amount of revenue  redirected, and how liabilities under the existing PAYG program are  treated.", "The countries we are examining offer a range of approaches for including  individual accounts and dealing with the prospective transition costs.  Australia and Switzerland avoided transition costs altogether by adding  individual accounts to their existing national pension systems, which are  modest relative to those in the other countries we are studying. Some  countries diverted revenue from the existing PAYG program to the  individual accounts. The resulting shortfall reflects, in part, the portion of  the PAYG program being replaced with individual accounts and the  amount of PAYG revenue being redirected to fund the accounts. For  example, transition costs may be less in countries such as Sweden or  Denmark where the contribution to individual accounts is 2.5 percent of  covered earnings and 1 percent, respectively, than for Poland or Hungary,  which replaced a larger portion of the PAYG program.", "All of the countries we are reviewing also made changes to their PAYG  program that were meant to help reduce transition costs, such as  increasing taxes or decreasing benefits. In addition, Chile built a surplus in  anticipation of major pension reform, and Sweden had large budget  surpluses in place prior to establishing individual accounts. Countries also  transfer funds from general budget revenues to help pay benefits to  current and near retirees, expanding public borrowing. If individual  accounts are financed through borrowing they will not positively affect  national saving until the debt is repaid, as contributions to individual  accounts are offset by increased public debt. For example, Poland\u2019s debt  is expected to exceed 60 percent of GDP in the next few years in part  because of its public borrowing to pay for the movement to individual  accounts.", "It is sometimes difficult for countries to predict their transition costs. In  particular, countries that allow workers to opt in or out of individual  account programs have had difficulty estimating costs. For example,  Hungary and Poland experienced higher than anticipated enrollment from  current workers in their individual account programs, leaving the existing  PAYG program with less funding than planned. As a result, both countries  had to make subsequent changes to their individual account and PAYG  programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Balancing Opportunities to Realize High Returns and Benefit Adequacy Is Important", "paragraphs": ["Countries adopting individual accounts as part of their national pension  system have had to make trade-offs between giving workers the  opportunity to maximize returns in their accounts and ensuring that  benefits will be adequate for all participants. Some countries set a  guaranteed rate of return to reduce certain investment risks and help  ensure adequacy of benefits. These guarantees may, however, result in  limited investment diversification with a potentially negative impact on  returns. In Chile, for example, fund managers\u2019 performance is measured  against the returns of other funds. This has resulted in a \u201cherding\u201d effect  because funds hold similar portfolios, reducing meaningful choice for  workers. All the countries with individual accounts provide some form of  a minimum guaranteed benefit so retirees will have at least some level of  income.

For example, an annuity payout option can help to  ensure that individuals will not outlive their assets in retirement.  However, purchasing an annuity can leave some people worse off if, for  example, the annuities market is not fully developed, premiums are high,  or inflation erodes the purchasing power of benefits. Several countries  also allow for phased withdrawals, in some cases with restrictions, helping  to mitigate the risk of individuals outliving their assets and becoming  reliant on the government\u2019s basic or safety-net pension.

The  experiences of countries we are studying also indicate the importance of  keeping administrative fees and charges under control. The fees that  countries permit pension funds to charge can have a big influence on the  amount of income retirees receive from their individual accounts. Several  countries have limits on the level and types of fees providers can charge.  Additionally, the level of fees should take into consideration the potential  impact not only on individuals\u2019 accounts, but also on fund managers.

Several countries require disclosure statements about  the status of a pension fund, and some provide annual statements. To help  individuals choose a fund manager, one important component of these  statements should be the disclosure of fees charged.

Restoring long-term  financial balance invariably involves cutting benefits, raising revenues, or  both. Additionally, with early reform, policy makers can avoid the need for  more costly and difficult changes later.

Reforms that encourage employment and saving, offer incentives to  postpone retirement, and promote growth are more likely to produce a  pension system that delivers adequate retirement income and is financially  sound for the long term.", "Regardless of a country\u2019s approach, its institutions need to effectively  operate and supervise the different aspects of reform. A government\u2019s  capacity to implement and administer the publicly managed elements of  reform and its ability to regulate and oversee the privately managed  components are crucial. In addition, education of the public becomes  increasingly important as workers and retirees face more choices and the  national pension system becomes more complex. This is particularly true  in the case of individual account reforms, which require higher levels of  financial literacy and personal responsibility.", "In nearly every country we are studying, debate continues about  alternatives for additional reform measures. It is clearly not a process that  ends with one reform. This may be true in part because success can only  be measured over the long term, but problems may arise and need to be  dealt with in the short term.
