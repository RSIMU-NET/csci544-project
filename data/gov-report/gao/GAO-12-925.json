NRC is responsible for regulating the commercial use of sealed sources and has relinquished its regulatory authority to 37 states, known as Agreement States. In 2008, NNSA established a program to provide security upgrades to U.S. hospitals and medical facilities that use radiological sources. GAO was asked to determine (1) the extent to which NRC's requirements ensure the security of radiological sources at U.S. medical facilities and (2) the status of NNSA's efforts to improve the security of sources at these facilities. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; interviewed federal agency and state officials; and visited 26 hospitals and medical facilities in 7 states and Washington, D.C."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) requirements do not consistently ensure the security of high-risk radiological sources at the 26 selected hospitals and medical facilities GAO visited. One reason for this is that the requirements are broadly written and do not prescribe specific measures that hospitals and medical facilities must take to secure medical equipment containing sealed sources, such as the use of cameras or alarms. Rather, the requirements provide a general framework for what constitutes adequate security practices, which is implemented in various ways at different hospitals. Some of the medical equipment in the facilities visited was more vulnerable to potential tampering or theft than that of other facilities because some hospitals developed better security controls than others. Some examples of poor security GAO observed included: an irradiator, used for medical research and containing almost 2,000 curies of cesium-137, was stored on a wheeled pallet down the hall from, and accessible to, a loading dock at one facility; at a second facility, the combination to a locked door, which housed an irradiator containing 1,500 curies of cesium- 137, was clearly written on the door frame; and at a third facility, an official told GAO that the number of people with unescorted access to the facility's radiological sources was estimated to be at least 500. In addition, some NRC and Agreement State inspectors said the training NRC requires is not sufficient.", "As of March 2012, the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) had spent $105 million to complete security upgrades at 321 of the 1,503 U.S. hospitals and medical facilities it identified as having high-risk radiological sources. Of the 26 hospitals and medical facilities that GAO visited, 13 had volunteered for the NNSA security upgrades and had received security upgrades, such as remote monitoring systems, surveillance cameras, enhanced security doors, iris scanners, motion detectors, and tamper alarms; three others were in the process of receiving upgrades. However, NNSA does not anticipate completing all such security upgrades until 2025, leaving a number of facilities potentially vulnerable. In addition, the program's impact is limited because, among other things, it is voluntary, and facilities can decline to participate. To date, 14 facilities, including 4 in large urban areas, have declined to participate in the program. Combined, those 14 facilities have medical equipment containing over 41,000 curies of high-risk radiological material. According to police department officials in a major city, one hospital with a blood irradiator of approximately 1,700 curies has declined the NNSA upgrades due in part to cost concerns, even though the police department considers it to be a high-risk facility."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that NRC strengthen its security requirements by providing medical facilities with specific measures they must take to develop and sustain a more effective security program.

Material used for these purposes is typically sealed in a metal  capsule such as stainless steel, titanium, or platinum, to prevent its  dispersal and is commonly called a sealed source. Some of these  sources are highly radioactive, and can be found in medical equipment in  U.S. hospitals and medical facilities, which are often open to the public  and located in large population centers. The small size and portability of  sealed radiological sources make them potentially vulnerable to theft or  misuse when not adequately secured.", "In the hands of terrorists, these sealed sources could be used to produce  a simple and crude but potentially dangerous weapon, known as a dirty  bomb, by packaging explosives with the radioactive material for dispersal  when the bomb goes off. A dirty bomb detonation would likely result in  few deaths, mainly from the explosion, but could create significant social  and economic impacts from public panic, decontamination costs, and  denial of access to the area in which the detonation took place for  extended periods. A 2004 study by the National Defense University noted  that the economic impact on a major populated area from a successful  dirty bomb attack is likely to equal, and perhaps exceed, that of the  September 11, 2001, attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C.  The potential impacts of a dirty bomb attack could also produce  significant health consequences. In 2002, the Federation of American  Scientists concluded that an americium radiological source combined with  1 pound of explosives would require medical supervision and monitoring  for the population of an area 10 times larger than the area hit by the initial  blast.", "Incidents involving radiological sources can provide a measure of  understanding of what could happen in the case of a dirty bomb attack.  For example, in 1987, an accident involving an abandoned, or orphaned,  teletherapy machine, which is used to treat cancer by focusing a beam of  radiation from a highly active radiological source at affected tissue, killed  four people and injured many more in the region of Goiania in central  Brazil. The device encapsulated about 1,400 curies of cesium-137, which is generally in the form of a powder similar to talc and highly dispersible. The accident and its aftermath caused about $36 million in damages to  the region, according to an official from Brazil\u2019s Nuclear Energy  Commission. In addition, the accident created environmental and medical  problems. Specifically, 85 houses were significantly contaminated, and 41  of these had to be evacuated. The decontamination process required the  demolition of homes and other buildings and generated 3,500 cubic  meters of radioactive waste. Furthermore, over 8,000 persons requested  monitoring for contamination in order to obtain certificates stating they  were not contaminated.", "A curie is a unit of measurement of radioactivity. In modern nuclear physics, it is precisely  defined as the amount of substance in which 37 billion atoms per second undergo  radioactive disintegration.

However, NRC  did not specify in its regulations how licensees were required to  implement the specific requirements. After September 11, 2001, NRC  reviewed the existing security requirements and determined that  increased security of radiological material was necessary. Therefore,  NRC issued a security order in 2005 directing those licensees possessing  certain types of radiological materials, including those commonly used in  hospitals and medical facilities, to implement increased security  measures, such as conducting employee background checks. In 2007,  NRC issued an additional security order requiring that individuals  requesting unescorted access to radiological material also undergo  fingerprinting with verification through the Federal Bureau of  Investigation.

However, the pending regulations allow licensees to choose any single  option, regardless of the risk posed by the radiological source or the  location of the licensee\u2019s facility.

The  upgrading of hospitals and medical facilities is one component of the  Domestic Material Protection program, which also secures high-risk  radiological sources in other commercial facilities and sites. NNSA has  identified approximately 1,500 U.S. hospitals and medical facilities with  high-risk radiological sources that contain approximately 28 million curies  of radioactive material and that are candidates for security upgrades.  NNSA also provides training for hospital personnel and local police  departments through its Alarm Response Training program at the Y-12  National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

We also interviewed experts in the  field of nuclear security, state government officials in selected states, and  safety and security personnel at hospitals to obtain their views on how  radiological sources are secured at U.S. hospitals and medical facilities.  To examine how NRC\u2019s requirements affect the security of high-risk  radiological sources at U.S. hospitals and medical facilities, we collected  information and interviewed agency officials responsible for overseeing  and securing sources at NRC, NNSA, VA, DOD, DHS, and DOJ. We also  gathered information from Agreement States and NRC regions by  collecting information and interviewing officials at 20 selected Agreement  States and the three NRC regional offices with responsibility for  overseeing high-risk radiological sources. To learn how NRC  requirements are implemented at the facilities, we visited 26 hospitals and  medical facilities in California, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania,  Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. We selected these  hospitals and medical facilities on the basis of geographic dispersion, the  amount of curies contained in their radiological sources, and types of  radiological devices. The facility information is not generalizable to all  hospitals or medical facilities but provides illustrative examples. We also  visited local law enforcement agencies in California, New York, and  Washington, D.C. To evaluate the extent to which NNSA has enhanced  the security of high-risk radiological sources at U.S. hospitals and medical  facilities and the challenges they face, we analyzed information from and  interviewed NNSA officials about their Domestic Material Protection  program, which partners with hospitals and medical facilities to provide  voluntary security upgrades to facilities with high-risk radiological sources.  We also visited facilities that received NNSA upgrades and security  assessments in California, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas,  Virginia, and Washington, D.C. These facilities were selected to provide  us with a cross section of hospitals and medical facilities that had  completed security upgrades, were in the process of completing  upgrades, or had volunteered for the program and were negotiating with  NNSA about the scope of the upgrades. To determine the costs of these  security upgrades, we obtained cost data from NNSA and interviewed the  agency officials who oversee the program. To assess the reliability of  these data, we discussed their reliability with knowledgeable NNSA  officials and questioned them about the system\u2019s internal controls to verify  the accuracy and completeness of the data.

See figure 2, which shows an example of an  americium-241 sealed radiological source. Sealed sources vary in size  from the size of a pencil eraser to rods up to several inches in length.", "Radiological material can be found in various forms, such as metals or  powders, and is measured by its level of activity. The greater the activity  level\u2014measured in curies\u2014the more radiation emitted, which increases  the potential risk to public health and safety if improperly used or  controlled. The intensity of radiological materials decays over time at  various rates. The term \u201chalf-life\u201d is used to indicate the period during  which the radioactivity decreases by half as a result of decay. In general,  the shorter the half-life and the larger the mass, the more radiation will be  emitted within a particular period.", "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),of protection provided by users of the radiological material should be  commensurate with the safety and security risks that it presents if  improperly used. For example, radiological materials used for certain  diagnostic purposes, such as diagnostic imaging, have low levels of  activity and do not present a significant safety or security risk. However,  high-risk sealed radiological sources that contain cobalt-60, cesium-137  or iridium-192, could pose a greater threat to the public and the  environment and could also pose a potentially more significant security  risk, particularly if acquired by terrorists to produce a dirty bomb.", "Two types of licenses are associated with the use of radioactive materials\u2014general  licenses and specific licenses. General licenses are associated with products that contain  some radioactive material, such as fixed gauges or exit signs, and the owners of these  products do not have to apply to NRC or an Agreement State for a license.

The  security controls provide minimum requirements that must be met to  ensure adequate security, and licensees may go beyond the minimum  requirements.", "NRC officials told us that they have adopted a risk-based approach to  security, in which the level of security should be commensurate with the  type and amount of sources they are attempting to protect. In addition,  NRC officials said that they take facility costs into consideration when  issuing new security requirements. The risk-based approach reflects the  agency\u2019s concerns regarding the potential adverse financial effect that  additional security measures could have on private medical facilities  throughout the United States. As a result, the security controls issued by  NRC are intentionally broad to allow licensees flexibility when  implementing security upgrades. However, according to NRC officials,  NRC requirements relating to the adequate protection of public health and  safety do not consider costs. The officials state that this approach aligns  with Executive Order 12866, which directs Executive Branch agencies to  tailor their regulations to impose the least burden on society, including  individuals, businesses of differing sizes, and other entities (including  small communities and governmental entities), consistent with obtaining  the regulatory objectives, taking into account, among other things, and to  the extent practicable, the costs of cumulative regulations. However, the  Executive Order requirements in pertinent part do not apply to the NRC,  but NRC follows many of the provisions voluntarily. In late April 2012,  NRC released a document that stated, among other things, that its  security program is a multilayered, non prescriptive framework that allows  licensees to develop security programs specifically tailored to their  facilities. NRC officials told us that due to diverse economic conditions,  facility type, layout, and operations of hospital and medical facilities, a  \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to radiological source security is neither  practical nor desirable. The officials said that the ability to tailor security to  a facility\u2019s needs and resources is particularly important for commercial  facilities with limited resources. For example, personnel from one smaller  medical facility we visited told us that implementing specific security  requirements\u2014such as cameras and other surveillance equipment\u2014 could jeopardize their continued operations because of the costs  associated with the installation and maintenance of this equipment.", "NRC\u2019s implementation guidance, which supplements the security orders,  provides examples of how hospitals and medical facilities can secure their  high-risk radiological material and meet security requirements. In their  implementation guidance, NRC provides that facilities may meet the  security requirements by, for example, limiting the distribution of keys, key  cards, or combinations to doors and gates to approved individuals;  activating locked doors and gates by using remote surveillance; using a  card reader and electronic locking devices at control points; and having a  person approved for unescorted access conduct constant surveillance of  the devices containing the radiological material.", "However, ultimate responsibility for implementing NRC\u2019s security controls  is left to the discretion of the hospital and medical facility personnel that  possess the materials. The controls do not prescribe the specific  measures that licensees must take to secure their sources, such as the  use of cameras, alarms, and other physical security measures. The  licensee determines, for example, if security cameras are necessary or  what types of locks or alarms, if any, are needed to secure doors or  windows. For some locations we visited that are staffed 24 hours a day,   7 days a week, such as blood banks, requirements for access control can  be met when the room where the medical device containing radiological  material is located is continuously staffed by an individual or individuals  who are determined to be trustworthy and reliable. As long as the room is  staffed at all times, the facility is not required to have any additional  physical security, such as cameras or motion detection equipment.", "NRC\u2019s security controls require hospital and medical facility personnel to  conduct background checks to determine the trustworthiness and  reliability of individuals requesting unescorted access to radiological  material. NRC officials told us that background checks are important for  protecting against an \u201cinsider threat,\u201d in which someone with access to  the radiological material might try to remove, tamper with, or sabotage the  source. NRC\u2019s implementation guidance states that the commission\u2019s  requirements are not intended to stop determined adversaries intent on  malevolent action from gaining access to the radioactive material. Rather,  these requirements are designed to provide reasonable assurance that  individuals with unescorted access to the radioactive material are  trustworthy and reliable and that facilities have a reliable means to rapidly  identify events that are potentially malevolent and have a process for  prompt police response. Furthermore, hospital and medical facility  officials are responsible for appointing a trustworthiness and reliability  official (T&R official), who is to determine which employees will be  granted unescorted access to the device containing radioactive material.  The T&R officials at the 26 hospitals and medical facilities we visited were  typically RSOs, security officials, or officials from the human resources  department. When granting unescorted access for individuals employed  less than 3 years, NRC also requires hospitals and medical facilities to, at  a minimum, verify employment history, education, and personal  references. For individuals employed for longer than 3 years, facilities are  to determine trustworthiness and reliability, at a minimum, by reviewing  the employee\u2019s employment history with the facility.", "Officials at 5 of the 26 hospitals and medical facilities we visited told us  they face challenges in determining which individuals are suitable for a  trustworthiness and reliability certification.

Performing  background checks on foreign nationals is also particularly challenging.  Officials at 6 of the 26 hospitals and medical facilities we visited agreed,  citing, for example, the difficulty in acquiring relevant background  information from different countries, the inability to corroborate written  documentation, and language barriers.

According to IAEA, a  design basis threat includes the attributes and characteristics of a  potential insider and/or external adversaries, who might attempt  unauthorized removal or sabotage, against which a physical protection  system is designed and evaluated. NRC officials noted that, according to  IAEA\u2019s Nuclear Security Series Implementation Guide No. 11, \u201cSecurity of  Radioactive Sources,\u201d the design and evaluation of a security system  should take into account the current national threat assessment and may  include the development and application of a design basis threat,  although it is not required.", "Typically, a design basis threat characterizes the elements of a potential  attack, including the number of attackers, their training, and the weapons  and tactics they are capable of employing. Instead, NRC relies solely on  the amount of curies under the control of a hospital or medical facility  when determining if the facility is subject to increased security controls.  According to NRC, it would not be feasible to require a design basis  threat analysis for U.S. hospitals and medical facilities because of the  varied nature of the facilities and the additional resources required to  conduct an analysis for individual facilities. NNSA also does not use a  design basis threat for its security assessments of hospitals and medical  facilities but does employ a threat scenario (known as potential adversary  capability) as the basis for its recommendations for security  enhancements. NNSA defines Potential Adversary Capabilities as the  method for documenting a realistic threat level that the security upgrades  must enhance protection against. At VA, which is overseen by NRC under  a Master Materials License (MML),radiological security told us that VA initially developed a generic threat  scenario for use at its facilities with high-risk radiological materials  because NRC did not provide a design basis threat as part of its security  controls. Later, VA coordinated closely with NNSA to complete security  assessments and install security upgrades at the VA facilities with high  risk sources. The assessments were completed from 2009 through 2011,  with installation of the agreed upon security upgrades currently ongoing.  VA facilities have also participated in the NNSA Alarm Response training  program.", "All of the 26 medical facilities we visited have implemented NRC\u2019s  security controls and undergone inspections by either NRC or Agreement  State inspectors. At some facilities, the implementation of the controls  resulted in significant security upgrades, such as the addition of  surveillance cameras, upgrades to locks on doors, and alarms. NRC  stated that, although hospitals are open to the public, the specific location  housing a radiological source generally is not. These sources are  shielded inside medical devices that can weigh thousands of pounds,  which make it difficult to remove or tamper with the radiological material,  according to NRC.", "Notwithstanding NRC\u2019s views, we observed potential security  weaknesses in several facilities we visited, such as the following:", "At a hospital in one state, two cesium-137 research irradiators (i.e.,  used for medical or biological research), that contain approximately  2,000 curies and 6,000 curies, respectively, are housed in the  basement of a building that is open to the public. The hallway leading  to the irradiator room has a camera, but it is pointed away from the  room. The door to the room is opened by a swipe card lock, and there  are no cameras or other security measures inside the room. We  observed that one of the irradiators was sitting on a wheeled pallet.  When we asked the RSO if he had considered removing the wheels,  he said no. Furthermore, we observed that the irradiator room is  located in close proximity to an external loading dock and that the  cameras along the corridor to the loading dock are displayed on a  single monitor, making it difficult for someone monitoring the corridor  to interpret what activity is occurring. This facility had passed its most  recent NRC security inspection, according to a hospital official,  because access to the room where the irradiators were located was  restricted through use of a swipe card. However, this facility could be  vulnerable because of the limited security we observed and the  mobility of one of the irradiators.", "At a hospital in a major U.S. city, we observed that the interior door to  the hospital blood bank, which had a cesium-137 blood irradiator of  approximately 1,500 curies, had the combination to the lock written  on the door frame. The door is in a busy hallway with heavy traffic,  and the security administrator for the hospital said that he often walks  around erasing door combinations that are written next to the locks.  According to NRC officials, a single lock is not necessarily a security  weakness; however, failure to control the combination and restrict  access to only trustworthy and reliable individuals is a clear violation  of NRC requirements. Figure 3 shows the combination written on the  door frame to the blood bank.", "At a blood center in a third state we visited, we observed a cesium- 137 blood irradiator of approximately 1,400 curies in a room that was  secured by a conventional key lock. The irradiator was located in the  middle of the room and not secured to the floor. The room had an  exterior wall with a bank of unalarmed and unsecured windows that  looked out onto a publically accessible loading dock. The blood center  officials said that, while they met NRC\u2019s security controls, they  acknowledged that the center is highly vulnerable to theft or sabotage  of their radiological sources.

The course takes place at DOE national laboratories, with recent training  occurring at Sandia National Laboratory in New Mexico. It includes 17  modules providing information on how to protect against malicious uses  of radioactive materials, such as the introduction to physical protection,  target identification, intrusion detection, security lighting, access control  systems, barriers, locking systems, and response forces. The course also  covers NRC security controls associated with the increased security  measures. However, even with this training, 6 of the 48 inspectors we  spoke with who cover both NRC regions and Agreement States told us  that they do not feel comfortable conducting security inspections at  hospitals and medical facilities. According to the inspectors, NRC\u2019s  training course provides an introduction to security practices for those  with limited security experience and trains inspectors generally in how to  conduct security inspections. The inspectors typically have educational  backgrounds in radiation safety or health physics rather than security.  The inspectors said that not having security experience has made it  difficult for them to transition to conducting security inspections.

In addition, staff  turnover issues have kept inspectors from receiving needed on-the-job  training or mentoring from experienced inspectors. As a result, inspectors  have difficulty assessing whether licensees comply with NRC security  controls. According to NRC\u2019s review of the state program, the state  inspectors took steps to incorporate interviews with appropriate personnel  and performance observations into their inspection activities. However,  inspectors often did not adequately follow up on potential items of non  compliance that were observed during the performance reviews. NRC\u2019s  review noted that the state inspectors did not have sufficient familiarity  with NRC\u2019s security controls and therefore had difficulty assessing  licensee compliance with the requirements.

NNSA\u2019s prioritization criteria  include four factors: (1) attractiveness level of the radiological material,  (2) site security conditions, (3) threat environment, and (4) location or  proximity to a target. In addition, NNSA officials told us that when ranking  facilities for upgrades, they consider whether the facility has requested or  volunteered for a security assessment under the program, if there are  multiple high-risk sources in the same facility, and if NNSA can gain  access to a number of sites through a partnership with other federal  agencies and organizations such as the Department of Agriculture, the  National Institutes of Health, and the American Red Cross.", "Our analysis of NNSA data shows that NNSA is focusing the majority of  the program\u2019s resources on states with high curie amounts and large  numbers of hospitals and medical buildings with high-risk radiological  sources.

In addition, some states with  relatively few hospitals and medical facilities and a small amount of curies  have each received more than $1 million from NNSA to upgrade their  facilities. These states were Hawaii and Rhode Island. In the case of  Hawaii, NNSA officials told us that the state has over 50,000 curies of  non-medical cesium-137, which made doing medical upgrades at the  same time cost effective. In addition, NNSA said that Hawaii served as a  model for how a network of facilities could be integrated into a centralized  security network.

These officials stated that budgetary  uncertainty makes it necessary to identify states where they can  maximize their resources by upgrading a number of facilities in close  proximity to each other. In addition, NNSA conducts outreach efforts in  partnership with NRC and Agreement States to educate licensees about  its program and find hospitals and medical facilities that want to  participate. NNSA officials told us their outreach and promotional efforts  are constrained because they do not want to enlist more facilities in the  program than can be funded in a reasonable period of time. Additionally,  NRC has supported NNSA\u2019s program by making licensees aware of the  program in a January 2010 NRC Regulatory Issue Summary. In the  issue summary, NRC officials encouraged licensees to work  cooperatively with manufacturers; regulators; and other federal, state, and  local authorities to look for opportunities to further enhance the security of  their sources and devices and incorporate best practices, where  appropriate.

For example,  NNSA has not completed upgrades in some states with a large number of  radiological sources, like Michigan and Wisconsin.

It is therefore in the interest of the  federal government to ensure that all high-risk radiological materials in  U.S. hospitals and medical facilities are secured as quickly as possible  from potential theft or sabotage. However, NNSA does not expect to  complete security upgrades at all hospitals and medical facilities in the  United States until 2025; one-fifth of the upgrades are completed to date.  In addition, the voluntary nature of NNSA\u2019s security upgrade program  allows hospitals and medical facilities that contain high-risk radiological  materials to refuse security upgrades, even though they are initially paid  for by NNSA. As a result, 14 hospitals and medical facilities, with a  combined 41,000 curies of high-risk radiological material, have declined  to participate in the program, and several of these facilities are located in  or in close proximity to populated urban areas. NNSA has taken steps to  promote the program both by speaking at conferences and through other  outreach efforts. In addition, NRC and Agreement States have provided  support through promotion activities, such as NRC issuing a Regulatory  Issue Summary in 2010 that described the NNSA program. These are  positive steps, but there are still many hospitals that are not participating  in this important program. While we understand that some hospitals and  medical facilities may not participate in the program due to cost concerns,  the longer the security upgrades remain unimplemented, the greater the  risk that potentially dangerous radiological materials from these facilities  could be used as a terrorist weapon.", "NRC has taken a risk-based approach to improve the security of  radiological sources at U.S. hospitals and medical facilities, but this  approach is not based on facility specific security risks and results in a  wide variety of security measures implemented by the medical facilities  we visited. The risk-based requirements do not go far enough as several  of the medical facilities we visited did not have adequate security  measures in place. NRC\u2019s security controls are designed to improve  security but do not prescribe the specific measures that licensees should  take to secure their sources, such as specific direction on the use of  cameras, alarms, and other physical security measures. As a result,  these security controls, and the manner in which they are implemented,  have left some hospitals and medical facilities we visited vulnerable to  possible theft or sabotage of potentially dangerous radiological sources.  Furthermore, NRC\u2019s pending regulations will require that licensees  choose security measures to implement from a menu of options based on  NRC\u2019s earlier implementation guidance. Similar to the current security  requirements, the pending regulations do not specify which measures  best address the risks posed by hospital radiological sources, allowing  medical facilities to potentially choose the least disruptive option for their  operations or the most economical option regardless of the risk.", "The limitations in NRC\u2019s security controls are exacerbated because NRC  and Agreement State inspectors may not receive adequate training from  the agency on the security of high-risk radiological material at hospitals  and medical facilities. According to the views of several inspectors we  interviewed\u2014the 5 days of training provided by NRC is not sufficient for  inspectors who typically have a health and safety background and limited  security experience. According to NRC, the training is one component for  qualification to perform independent security inspections. Other  components include: 1) qualification as a NRC health and safety  inspector, 2) observation of security inspections conducted by other  experienced security inspectors, and 3) conducting an inspection under  the direct oversight of a qualified security inspector. Nevertheless, the  inspectors may not be in the best position to make the most informed  decisions and judgments about the security of licensees\u2019 radiological  materials. For example, we were told that an irradiator stored on a  wheeled pallet located down the hall from a loading dock had not raised  inspectors\u2019 concerns during the facility\u2019s most recent NRC security  inspection. Moreover, some hospital officials, including RSOs, rely on  inspectors for advice on how to implement NRC\u2019s security controls.  However, these inspectors have minimal security training, and hospital  officials receive limited security guidance from NRC in how to implement  the security controls. Additional vulnerabilities are created because NRC  security controls do not require that medical facility officials and RSOs  have security experience. Without adequate security guidance, medical  facility officials, including RSOs, who may be responsible for  implementing NRC\u2019s security controls may not have adequate knowledge  of securing equipment containing high-risk radiological sources. Finally,  ensuring that hospitals only grant unescorted access to trustworthy  individuals is critical to strengthening security, especially for securing  against an insider threat. However, the current background examination  process relies upon the judgment of hospital personnel, who may not  have adequate experience to make that determination. For this reason,  some hospital administrators told us that NRC should provide them with  additional support for conducting background checks and making  trustworthiness and reliability determinations as to which employees  would have unescorted access to equipment containing high-risk  radiological sources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations.", "Because the security of radiological sources in hospitals and medical  facilities has national security implications, and many potentially  vulnerable medical facilities with high-risk sources have not received  security upgrades, we recommend that the Administrator of NNSA, in  consultation with the Chairman of NRC and Agreement State officials,  take the following action:  Increase outreach efforts to promote awareness of and participation in  NNSA\u2019s security upgrade program.

Specifically, NRC agreed that the Administrator of NNSA, in consultation  with NRC and Agreement state officials, increase outreach efforts to  promote awareness of NNSA\u2019s security upgrade program, with special  attention given to medical facilities in urban areas or in close proximity to  urban areas that contain medical equipment with high-risk radiological  sources.", "NRC neither agreed nor disagreed with our other recommendations that it  (1) strengthen its security requirements by providing hospital and medical  facilities with specific measures they must take to develop and sustain a  more effective security program; (2) ensure that NRC and Agreement  State inspectors receive more comprehensive training to improve their  security awareness and ability to conduct related security inspections;  and (3) train facility officials who may be responsible for implementing  NRC security controls in how to adequately secure equipment and  conduct trustworthiness and reliability determinations. In its comments,  NRC provided additional information regarding each of these three  recommendations as follows:  Strengthening NRC security requirements. NRC stated that per its policy  it uses a multilayered risk informed performance-based approach for the  security of radioactive materials in the United States. It also stated in its  comments that the requirements were developed in consultation with the  Agreement States, in consideration of available intelligence reporting and  security assessments performed by experts inside and outside the NRC,  and are consistent with IAEA security guidelines and Executive Order  12866. We do not take issue with NRC\u2019s statement that its performance- based approach is consistent with IAEA security guidelines and Executive  Order 12866. However, we note that a more prescriptive approach for the  security of radioactive materials, such as that we are recommending, is  also consistent with IAEA security guidelines. In fact, the guidelines point  out that a performance-based approach functions most effectively where  there are professional advisors with expertise to design and implement  the necessary security measures, a situation we found not to exist in  many of the medical facilities we visited. With respect to Executive Order  12866, we would also note that NRC states that the requirements of the  order do not apply to it. However, even if the order did apply to NRC, the  order itself provides only that \u201cto the extent feasible\u201d agencies should  adopt a performance-based approach. The order further directs agencies  to which the order applies to tailor their regulations to impose the least  burden possible \u201cconsistent with obtaining regulatory objectives.\u201d We  found that NRC\u2019s current performance-based approach does not  consistently ensure that NRC is meeting its objective of securing high-risk  radiological sources at the 26 selected hospitals and medical facilities we  visited.", "NRC also stated that in its view, our recommendation is based on four  security issues identified in the report, two of which they identified as  violations of the existing requirements. NRC states that the failure of a  licensee to properly implement security controls established under a  performance based regulatory requirement is a compliance issue, and  does not mean that the intended control itself is inadequate. We  recognize in our draft report that NRC has adopted a risk-based approach  to radiological security and state that NRC\u2019s security requirements are  non-prescriptive, which allows licensees to develop security programs  specifically tailored to their facilities. However, as we also noted in our  draft report, this risk-based approach is not based on security risks  specific to hospitals and medical facilities and results in a wide variety of  security measures implemented by the medical facilities we visited during  the course of our audit work. Consequently, we found that some of the  medical equipment in the facilities we visited was more vulnerable to  potential tampering or theft than that of other facilities, even though all the  facilities we visited had implemented NRC\u2019s security controls and  undergone inspections by either NRC or Agreement State inspectors.  Furthermore, we are not basing our recommendation, as NRC states,  solely on our observations at 26 medical facilities. Rather, we are also  relying on the views of law enforcement personnel from states with  significant amounts of high-risk radiological material, who told us that  NRC\u2019s security controls have an inherent weakness: the security controls  do not specify what the facility is protecting against and are not linked to a  design basis threat. In addition, NNSA has developed a specific program  to upgrade the physical security at hospitals and medical facilities in the  United States, which already meet NRC\u2019s security controls. In our view, it  stands to reason that if NNSA has identified security vulnerabilities at 321  hospitals and medical facilities in the United Sates, and taken actions to  address them, then NRC\u2019s existing security controls need to be  strengthened. This is not merely an issue of how licensees comply with  existing security regulations but involves both the security requirements  and their implementation. For these reasons, we continue to believe our  recommendation that NRC strengthen its security requirements is  appropriate.", "Additional training for inspectors. NRC stated that its training course  provides instruction on a performance based methodology to evaluate  and assess the adequacy of a physical protection system to protect  against theft or sabotage of materials identified in NRC\u2019s security  controls. NRC also stated that its one 5-day training course, in  combination with on the job training and other requirements, prepares  NRC and Agreement State inspectors to complete their required duties.  NRC stated that it will evaluate whether any additional training  enhancements are needed to its inspector qualification program based on  our recommendation, and it plans to review and revise the training  associated with the inspector qualification program in conjunction with  pending security regulation. We are encouraged that NRC will evaluate  whether any additional enhancements are needed to its inspector  qualification program in response to our recommendation. We believe  that NRC\u2019s review of its training is necessary and should be completed as  quickly as possible, with an eye toward adopting a more comprehensive  inspector training program, as envisioned in our recommendation.", "Training for hospital personnel. NRC recognizes our concern that there is  a need to improve the licensee\u2019s knowledge of acceptable security  practices. According to NRC, as a regulator, it must maintain  independent, objective oversight of licensees and may not operate in a  consultative role. Therefore, NRC stated that it does not provide training  to licensees but provides regulatory guidance documents to aid facility  officials as they establish programs and specific controls to meet security  requirements, including implementing guidance and over 200 questions  and answers for the existing security requirements on its public website.  However, as we stated in the draft report, even with this guidance, facility  officials at 15 of the 26 hospitals and medical facilities we visited told us  that they have limited security experience and no training from NRC on  how to implement the security controls. In addition, the current  background examination process (trustworthiness and reliability) relies on  the judgment of hospital personnel, who may not have adequate  experience to make that determination. Therefore, we continue to believe  that medical facility officials would benefit from additional support from  NRC when implementing the security controls at their facilities. Because  NRC believes it cannot provide training to its licensees given its  independent role as a regulator, we are modifying the recommendation to  encourage NRC to supplement existing guidance and ensure that it is  widely disseminated, rather than provide specific training to facility  officials.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretaries of the  Departments of Defense, Energy, and Veterans Affairs; as well as the  Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration; the  Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; the appropriate  congressional committees; and other interested parties.

We also performed work at the  Departments of Defense (DOD), Homeland Security (DHS), Justice  (DOJ), and Veterans Affairs (VA) because they are also involved in  securing radiological material. In addition, we interviewed experts in the  field of nuclear security, representatives from state government, and  safety and security personnel at hospitals and medical facilities to discuss  their views on how radiological material is secured at U.S. hospitals and  medical facilities. In August 2011, we attended the Organization of  Agreement States (OAS) annual meeting in Richmond, Virginia, where  we spoke to Agreement State representatives and attended sessions on  how states oversee the security of radiological material.", "We visited hospitals and medical facilities in California, Maryland, New  York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.  We selected these states and Washington D.C., on the basis of  geographic dispersion, curies of radiological sources, number of buildings  with high-risk radiological sources in the state, and number of sites with  NNSA security upgrades completed or in progress. Overall, these seven  states and Washington, D.C., contain over 12 million curies, or 43 percent  of all curies in U.S. hospitals and medical facilities. In addition, the seven  states and Washington, D.C., have 625 hospitals and medical buildings  with high-risk radiological sources, or 42 percent of all medical sites with  high-risk radiological material in the United States. As of March 1, 2012,  NNSA spent almost $56 million in the seven states and Washington,  D.C., on assessing sites and completing upgrades, or 53 percent of the  program\u2019s total expenditure. During our review, we observed physical  security upgrades at 26 hospitals and medical facilities. These sites  included university and private hospitals, medical research facilities, blood  banks, and cancer treatment facilities. The 26 sites we visited are a non  generalizable sample, selected on the basis of the number of radiological  devices in the state and the total number of cumulative curies contained  in these devices in each state. In addition, we considered if the site had  undergone security upgrades funded by NNSA, and whether the site is  located in a large urban area. At each location, we interviewed facility  staff responsible for implementing procedures to secure radiological  sources. We also met with security personnel at each site, when  available, and spoke to officials with local law enforcement agencies  responsible for responding to security breaches. We also met with local  law enforcement personnel in Los Angeles County, New York City, and  Washington, D.C., to discuss coordination of security across large urban  areas.", "We received electronic data from NNSA\u2019s G-2 database, which  aggregates data from NRC\u2019s National Source Tracking System (NSTS).  To determine the reliability of these data, we conducted electronic testing  and interviewed staff at NNSA and NRC about the reliability of these data.  We tested these data to ensure both their completeness and accuracy,  and determined that these data were sufficiently reliable to use in  selecting locations to visit and summarizing by state the total number of  buildings, number of buildings with completed security upgrades, and  total number of curies.", "To examine how NRC\u2019s regulations direct the security of high-risk  radiological material at U.S. hospitals and medical facilities, we reviewed  information and interviewed officials responsible for overseeing and  securing sources at NRC, NNSA, VA, DOD, DHS, and DOJ. We also  reviewed information from Agreement States and NRC regions and  interviewed officials at 20 of the 37 Agreement States and the three NRC  regional offices with responsibility for overseeing high-risk radiological  material. We spoke with officials about how Agreement States implement  the NRC security controls from the following 20 of the 37 Agreement  States: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida,  Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Mexico, New York,  North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia,  Washington, and Wisconsin. We also spoke with officials in NRC Regions  I, III, and IV. We selected the Agreement State and NRC Regional Office  officials based on their experience with inspecting for the security of high- risk radiological sources across the United States.", "To learn how NRC security requirement are implemented at the facilities,  we visited hospitals, medical facilities, and local law enforcement  agencies in the seven states and Washington, D.C., and interviewed  officials about NRC\u2019s security requirements. To assess NRC\u2019s new rule,  approved by the NRC on March 16, 2012, we reviewed the proposed  regulation and spoke with NRC officials about its implementation. To  determine the extent to which NRC and Agreement State inspectors  receive security training, we discussed training procedures with NRC  headquarters staff, reviewed training materials, and interviewed  inspectors in NRC regional offices and Agreement States about the  effectiveness of the training. To determine the sufficiency of staffing and  resources in the 37 Agreement States, we reviewed 40 Integrated  Materials Performance Evaluation Program (IMPEP) reports conducted  by NRC in 40 state programs or NRC regions from 2006 to 2011. We  analyzed the IMPEP reports to assess how Agreement States are  implementing NRC\u2019s security controls.", "To evaluate the extent to which NNSA has enhanced the security of high- risk radiological sources at U.S. hospitals and medical facilities and the  challenges they face, we analyzed information and interviewed NNSA  officials about the Domestic Material Protection program, which provides  voluntary upgrades to facilities with high-risk radiological material. We  analyzed NNSA data outlining the number of facilities that have received  upgrades or are in the process of receiving upgrades and visited facilities  that have received NNSA upgrades and security assessments in  California, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and  Washington, D.C. To assess the voluntary nature of the program and  sustainability of the upgrades, we spoke with hospital and medical facility  officials about the program. To assess NNSA\u2019s prioritization criteria and  determine how much money the agency has spent on security  enhancements, we gathered cost data from NNSA and contacted the  agency officials who oversee the program. We also analyzed NNSA  expenditure data to determine in which states NNSA has spent money on  upgrades and assessments since the program began. We conducted  electronic testing and discussed the reliability of these data with NNSA  officials, and we determined that they were sufficiently reliable to  summarize the total cost of the upgrades by state.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2011 to September 2012  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
