Gen-3 would have potentially enabled collection and analysis of air samples in less than 6 hours, unlike Gen-2 which can take up to 36 hours to detect and confirm the presence of biological pathogens.

For example, the analysis of alternatives (AoA) prepared for the Gen-3 acquisition did not fully explore costs or consider benefits and risk information in accordance with DHS's Acquisition Life-cycle Framework. To help ensure DHS based its acquisition decisions on reliable performance, cost, and schedule information, GAO recommended that before continuing the Gen-3 acquisition, DHS reevaluate the mission need and alternatives. DHS concurred with the recommendation and in 2012 decided to reassess mission needs and conduct a more robust AoA. Following the issuance of the AoA in December 2013, DHS decided in April 2014 to cancel Gen-3 acquisition and move the technology development back to the Science and Technology Directorate (S&T). According to DHS's acquisition decisions memorandum, the AoA did not confirm an overwhelming benefit to justify the cost of a full technology switch to Gen-3. Moreover, DHS officials said the decision to cancel the Gen-3 acquisition was a cost-effectiveness measure, because the system was going to be too costly to develop and maintain in its current form.", "GAO's prior work on DHS research and development (R&D) highlights challenges DHS may face in shifting efforts back to S&T and acquiring another biodetection technology. In September 2012, GAO reported that while S&T had dozens of technology transition agreements with DHS components, none of these had yet resulted in a technology developed by S&T being used by a component. At the same time, other DHS component officials GAO interviewed did not view S&T's coordination practices positively. GAO recommended that DHS develop and implement policies and guidance for defining and overseeing R&D at the department that includes a well-understood definition of R&D that provides reasonable assurance that reliable accounting and reporting of R&D resources and activities for internal and external use are achieved. S&T agreed with GAO's recommendations and efforts to address them are ongoing. Addressing these coordination challenges could help to ensure that S&T's technology development efforts meet the operational needs of OHA.", "Cancellation of the Gen-3 acquisition also raises potential challenges that the currently deployed Gen-2 system could face going forward. According to DHS officials, DHS will continue to rely on its Gen-2 system as an early indicator of an aerosolized biological attack. However, in 2011, National Academy of Sciences raised questions about the effectiveness of the currently deployed Gen-2 system. While Gen-2 has been used in the field for over a decade, the National Academy of Sciences reported that information about the technical capabilities of the system, including the limits of detection, is limited. In April 2014, DHS officials also indicated that they will soon need to replace laboratory equipment of the currently deployed Gen-2 system and readjust life cycle costs since there will be no Gen-3 technology to replace it."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our observations on the  Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) BioWatch program, with  particular focus on the cancellation of BioWatch Generation 3 (Gen-3)  and future considerations for the program. In recent years, there has  been an increasing awareness of the potential for biological agents to be  used as weapons of mass destruction. Experts and practitioners, reacting  to an increasing awareness of the speed and intensity with which a  biological weapon of mass destruction could affect the nation, have  sought to augment traditional surveillance activities with biosurveillance  programs and systems. DHS\u2019s BioWatch program is an example of such  an effort.

In  September 2012, we found that DHS approved the Gen-3 acquisition in  October 2009 without fully developing critical knowledge that would help  ensure sound investment decision making, pursuit of optimal solutions,  and reliable performance, cost, and schedule information. Specifically, we  found that DHS did not engage the initial phase of its Acquisition Life- cycle Framework, which is designed to help ensure that the mission need  driving the acquisition warrants investment of limited resources.  BioWatch officials stated that they were aware that the Mission Needs  Statement prepared in October 2009 did not reflect a systematic effort to  justify a capability need, but stated that the department directed them to  proceed because there was already departmental consensus around the  solution. Accordingly, we concluded that the utility of the Mission Needs  Statement as a foundation for subsequent acquisition efforts was limited.", "Additionally, in September 2012, we found that DHS did not use the  processes established by its Acquisition Life-cycle Framework to  systematically ensure that it was pursuing the optimal solution\u2014based on  cost, benefit, and risk\u2014to mitigate the capability gap identified in the  Mission Needs Statement. The DHS Acquisition Life-cycle Framework  calls for the program office to develop an analysis of alternatives (AoA)  that systematically identifies possible alternative solutions that could  satisfy the identified need, considers cost-benefit and risk information for  each alternative, and finally selects the best option from among the  alternatives. However, we found that the AoA prepared for the Gen-3  acquisition did not reflect a systematic decision-making process. For  example, in addition to\u2014or perhaps reflecting\u2014its origin in a  predetermined solution from the Mission Needs Statement, the AoA did  not fully explore costs or consider benefits and risk information as part of  the analysis. Instead, the AoA focused on just one cost metric that  justified the decision to pursue autonomous detection\u2014cost per detection  cycle\u2014to the exclusion of other cost and benefit considerations that might  have further informed decision makers. Additionally, we found that the  AoA examined only two alternatives, though the guidance calls for at least  three. The first alternative was the currently deployed Gen-2 technology  with a modified operational model (which by definition was unable to meet  the established goals). The second alternative was the complete  replacement of the deployed Gen-2 program with an autonomous  detection technology and expanded deployment.", "As we reported in September 2012, BioWatch program officials  acknowledged that other options\u2014including but not limited to deploying  some combination of both technologies (the currently deployed system  and an autonomous detection system), based on risk and logistical  considerations\u2014may be more cost-effective. As with the Mission Needs  Statement, program officials told us that they were advised that a  comprehensive AoA would not be necessary because there was already  departmental consensus that autonomous detection was the optimal  solution. Because the Gen-3 AoA did not: evaluate a complete solution  set; consider complete information on cost and benefits; and include a  cost-benefit analysis, we concluded that it did not provide information on  which to base trade-off decisions.", "To help ensure DHS based its acquisition decisions on reliable  performance, cost, and schedule information developed in accordance  with guidance and good practices, in our September 2012 report, we  recommended that before continuing the Gen-3 acquisition, DHS  reevaluate the mission need and possible alternatives based on cost- benefit and risk information. DHS concurred with the recommendation  and in 2012, DHS directed the BioWatch program to complete an updated  AoA.", "DHS contracted with the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) to conduct  the updated AoA, which they issued in December 2013. In January 2014,  as part of recommendation follow-up, we reviewed the completed  analysis. IDA cited the DHS Acquisition Management  Instruction/Guidebook and its appendix on conducting an AoA as the  criteria for their study. The management directive lays out a sample  framework that details the specific steps to take in evaluating acquisition  alternatives, which the contractor used for completing its study. On the  basis of our review, we concluded that the IDA-conducted AoA followed  the DHS guidance and resulted in a more robust exploration of  alternatives than the previous effort. The AoA was not intended to identify  a specific solution to address DHS\u2019s requirements for earlier warning and  detection capabilities. According to IDA, the AoA does not claim to select  a solution, but rather to present alternatives and the information required  to select an alternative based on cost and effectiveness trade-offs.", "On April 24, 2014, the DHS Acquisition Review Board reviewed the  BioWatch Gen-3 acquisition with OHA and issued an ADM announcing  the cancellation of the acquisition of Gen-3.

The ADM also announced that S&T will  explore development and maturation of an effective and affordable  automated aerosol biodetection capability, or other operational  enhancements, that meet the operational requirements of the BioWatch  system.", "In April 2014, BioWatch Program officials said multiple factors influenced  the decision to end the Gen-3 acquisition, including budget  considerations, considerations regarding the readiness level of the  technology, and the cost to field and maintain the technology. BioWatch  Program officials said that the Homeland Security Studies and Analysis  Institute\u2019s and our recommendations to complete a robust AoA, which  resulted in not identifying a clear path forward for a single technology type  for the Gen-3 acquisition, was also a contributing factor. According to  BioWatch Program officials, DHS has not ruled out the possibility of  pursuing autonomous detection for the BioWatch program, but officials  said the technology would have to cost less to develop and maintain than  was estimated for the Gen-3 system.", "Earlier this year, we reported that when programs have been canceled,  cost, schedule, and performance problems have often been cited as  reasons for this decision, and cancellation can be perceived as failure.  However, in some circumstances, program cancellation may be the best  choice. In an April 2014 interview, BioWatch Program officials said the  Gen-3 acquisitions process yielded many benefits, despite its  cancellation. BioWatch Program officials said the program office has  learned and gained much from this experience, including engaging state  and local stakeholders to help ensure confidence in the system and  BioWatch program; finding better ways to test technologies and refine the  Testing and Evaluation guidance; and developing robust acquisition  documentation for the department. BioWatch program officials said the  decision to cancel the Gen-3 acquisition was a cost-effectiveness  measure, because the system was going to be too costly to develop and  maintain in its current form. We reported in 2012 that while the DHS June  2011 life-cycle cost estimate reported $104 million in actual and  estimated costs from fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2011, it also  indicated that Gen-3 was expected to cost $5.8 billion (80 percent  confidence) from fiscal year 2012 through June 2028.

However, our prior work reviewing DHS research and  development efforts highlights challenges DHS may face in transitioning  the future biodetection development efforts S&T is now charged with  exploring back to the program office, OHA. For example, S&T works with  DHS components to ensure that it meets their R&D needs by signing  technology transition agreements (TTA) to ensure that components use  the technologies S&T develops. However, we previously reported in  September 2012 that while S&T had 42 TTAs with DHS components,  none of these TTAs has yet resulted in a technology being transitioned  from S&T to a component. In that review we also found that other DHS  component officials we interviewed did not view S&T\u2019s coordination  practices positively. Specifically, we interviewed officials in six  components to discuss the extent to which they coordinated with S&T on  R&D activities. Officials in four components stated that S&T did not have  an established process that detailed how S&T would work with its  customers or for coordinating all activities at DHS. For example, officials  in one component stated that S&T has conducted R&D that it thought  would address the component\u2019s operational need but, when work was  completed, the R&D project did not fit into the operational environment to  meet the component\u2019s needs.", "We also reported in 2012 that OHA, which oversees operation of the  BioWatch program, and S&T already had a history of working together on  advancing the technology used by the BioWatch program. differences of opinion on key performance measures had created a  challenge for these two offices related to future biodetection technologies.  For example, during our 2012 review of the Gen-3 acquisition, officials  from OHA said both OHA and S&T commissioned the Sandia National  Laboratory to conduct similar studies on the performance characteristics  of the Gen-3 autonomous detection system, but the two offices requested  the use of different performance metrics to evaluate Gen-3\u2019s detection  capability. OHA officials said they supported using the fraction of the  population covered as the metric because it is directly related to public  health outcomes, while S&T preferred to use the probability of detection.  While we recognize there are advantages and disadvantages for  choosing different performance metrics, technology transition of the R&D  project developed by S&T could prove challenging in the future if  fundamental differences like this are not resolved early to help ensure the  technology meets the operational needs of the program office. processes for coordinating R&D.

DHS agreed with our recommendation, and in April 2014,  updated its guidance to include a definition of R&D, but efforts to develop  a specific policy outlining R&D roles and responsibilities and a process for  coordinating R&D with other offices remain ongoing and have not yet  been completed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Future Considerations for the Currently Deployed Gen-2 system", "paragraphs": ["With the cancellation of the Gen-3 acquisition, DHS will continue to rely  on its currently deployed Gen-2 system as an early indicator of an  aerosolized biological attack.
