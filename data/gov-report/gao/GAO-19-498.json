The data identified the entity  or entities responsible for performing each of 10 drug benefit  management services under plan sponsors\u2019 Part D contracts. According  to CMS, these are the key drug benefit management services associated  with providing Part D drug coverage and include paying pharmacy claims  and negotiating rebates and other price concessions. CMS provided  HPMS data for the 624 Part D plan sponsor contracts that were effective  in 2016. For each contract, we used the HPMS data to determine the  extent to which a plan sponsor performed a service itself, contracted with  a PBM to perform the service, or performed the service in coordination  with a PBM. In this report, we refer to any organization (other than the  plan sponsor itself) that provides one of the 10 drug benefit management  services to a plan sponsor as a PBM.", "To examine how PBMs earn revenue for the services they provide to Part  D plan sponsors, we examined 20 service agreements between PBMs  and Part D plan sponsors. These agreements generally contain detailed  information on the services that the PBM will provide, how the plan  sponsor will pay the PBMs for those services, and the rates pharmacies  will be paid for prescription drugs. The 20 service agreements were  those approved between January 2016 and May 2018 that had the  highest enrollment in June 2018, the most recent data available at the  time of our analysis.", "We also examined PBM revenue reported to CMS by Part D plan  sponsors in their rebates and other price concession data reports\u2014also  referred to as direct and indirect remuneration (DIR)\u2014in 2016, the most  recent data available at the time of our analysis. These data include  information on any price concessions made after a drug is purchased  from the pharmacy by a beneficiary. One type of price concession is a  rebate, which is generally a discount paid by drug manufacturers to a Part  D plan sponsor, or by a PBM on the sponsor\u2019s behalf, after a beneficiary  purchases a drug. These discounts may be offered in exchange for  better placement on a plan sponsor\u2019s list of covered drugs, known as a  formulary, which encourages the use of the manufacturer\u2019s drugs by  assigning them to tiers within the formulary that have lower beneficiary  cost sharing. Plan sponsors and PBMs may receive other price  concessions that lower the price of a drug. For example, plan sponsors  may receive fees from pharmacies based on their performance, which  affect prices for certain drugs since the performance fees affect the  amount the plan sponsor pays the pharmacy. The rebate and other  price concession reports also include information on any revenue earned  by PBMs through their retaining a portion of negotiated rebates. We  define the gross price of a drug as the total amount paid to the pharmacy  by the Part D plan sponsor, the PBM on the sponsor\u2019s behalf, and the  beneficiary; gross price less rebates and other price concessions is the  net price. The rebate and other price concession reports to CMS also  include monies that are not concessions used in the calculation of net  price, such as certain sources of PBM revenue, including fees paid by  manufacturers to PBMs for certain services, as well as spread pricing\u2014 where PBMs earn revenue by keeping the difference between the amount  they charged the pharmacy and the amount the they charged the plan for  a drug.", "To examine trends in rebates and other price concessions obtained by  Part D plan sponsors and PBMs from manufacturers and others for Part  D drugs, we analyzed plan sponsors\u2019 gross and net expenditures for  these drugs from 2014 through 2016. For a given drug, gross  expenditures reflect what was paid to the pharmacy by the Part D plan  sponsor, PBMs on the sponsor\u2019s behalf, and the beneficiary. To calculate  gross expenditures, we used Medicare prescription drug event (PDE)  data to calculate gross brand-name and generic drug expenditures and  utilization for all Part D plan sponsors. Net expenditures reflect any  rebates and other price concessions obtained by Part D plan sponsors  and PBMs after a beneficiary receives a drug. To calculate net  expenditures, we obtained rebate and other price concession information  and subtracted it from plan sponsors\u2019 brand-name and generic gross  expenditures. We identified brand-name and generic drugs by grouping  expenditure claims with the same active ingredient, strength, dosage  form, and route of administration. We also used CMS Part D enrollment  data to examine gross and net expenditures per Medicare beneficiary for  sponsor contracts in 2016. We also examined differences in the amount  of rebates and other price concessions relative to expenditures obtained  by Part D plan sponsors that used a PBM, relative to those that did not.", "To obtain more information on drugs that have the greatest fiscal impact  on the Part D program and its beneficiaries, we calculated gross and net  expenditures for the brand-name and generic drugs with the highest  expenditures, highest utilization, and highest expenditure per utilization in  2016.

As a result of overlap in the groups of drugs, these criteria yielded lists of  the 444 unique highest expenditure, highest utilization brand-name drugs  and the 476 unique highest expenditure, highest utilization generic drugs.  Together, these 920 highest expenditure, highest utilization brand-name  and generic drugs accounted for 81 percent of Part D expenditures in  2016.", "To examine the extent to which Part D drug prices are discounted off of  manufacturer list prices, we compared the median gross and net prices  for the 444 brand-name and 476 generic highest expenditure, highest  utilization drugs to (1) list prices established by manufacturers and (2) the  cost to pharmacies of acquiring these drugs. For the list price, we used  the 2016 average wholesale price (AWP)\u2014which we refer to as  manufacturer list price\u2014which reflects the average price manufacturers  suggest wholesalers charge pharmacies for a drug. For pharmacy  acquisition costs, which reflect the price pharmacies paid to obtain the  drug, we used retail community pharmacy acquisition cost data from  National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC) data. Part D plan  sponsors and PBMs acting on the sponsor\u2019s behalf may negotiate prices  paid to pharmacies that are lower than manufacturers\u2019 list price, but  higher than pharmacies\u2019 acquisition costs. Separately, the plan sponsor  or PBM may also receive rebates and other price concessions that are  not part of their payments to pharmacies, but are reflected in their net  price. We also calculated a gross Part D drug price using 2016 PDE data  by dividing gross per unit expenditures for a given drug by the total  quantity dispensed for the drug. To calculate a net Part D price, we  subtracted rebates and other concessions per quantity dispensed from  the gross per unit price. We separated drugs sold in retail community  pharmacies from those sold in specialty pharmacies, as they dispense  low-volume and high-cost drugs to patients undergoing intensive  therapies for illnesses. For each drug, we then determined median  pharmacy acquisition costs, median gross Part D prices, and median net  Part D prices as a proportion of median manufacturer list prices.", "To examine what is known about savings and other effects of utilization  management services commonly used in Part D plans, we conducted a  literature search for studies that examined the effect of utilization  management services in Part D (regardless of whether they were  provided by a PBM or another entity) on the following outcomes: (1)  financial costs or savings, (2) beneficiaries\u2019 health indicators, and (3)  beneficiaries\u2019 access to clinically appropriate medications or taking their  medications as prescribed (adherence). The literature search was  performed from April 2018 to July 2018 using keyword searches in  bibliographic databases, including ProQuest, EBSCO, and Scopus.

Officials from  two of these PBMs noted that CMS requirements create a disincentive to  engage in spread pricing that is not present in the commercial sector.  Beginning in 2010, CMS required that plan sponsors base the amount of  beneficiary cost-sharing on the amount received by the pharmacy for a  drug\u2014known as the \u201cpass-through price.\u201d CMS also required that an  estimate of rebates or other price concessions be included in the  administrative costs submitted by the plan sponsor for bid  determinations. Part D plan sponsors can still agree to pay the PBM  based on the higher price of the drug without accounting for rebates,  known as the lock-in price.
