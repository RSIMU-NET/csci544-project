OSHA took longer than OPPTS to produce a final product, and OPPTS' process incorporated more steps to obtain input from external parties. Twice before final posting, OSHA officials had decided to not release drafts that had been prepared, because they needed more data to understand how pervasive asbestos in brake products were and wanted to avoid raising unnecessary alarm. For a time, staff from OSHA and OPPTS considered releasing a joint product. Overall, OSHA and OPPTS took years to complete all the process steps to produce their products on asbestos in automotive brakes and clutches--approximately 5-? years for OSHA and approximately 3-? years for OPPTS. In preparing their respective communication products, both OSHA and OPPTS generally followed applicable agency policies and procedures. Both OSHA and OPPTS have standard processes that guide the initiation, development, review, and dissemination of their communication products. OSHA publicly posts all of its applicable instructions, while OPPTS publicly posts only some. Under both agencies' processes, communication products may be initiated by various sources, developed only after getting management approval, and undergo intraagency coordination and management-level clearance. But interagency (including OMB) or other external reviews are not always required. OSHA's policies for disseminating products focus on responsibilities for posting and maintaining final products on the agency's Web site. Beginning at the development phase, OPPTS policies call for the formulation of a communication plan intended to ensure that the dissemination of a particular product is tailored to reach the intended audience. The agencies' processes establish no specific time frames or benchmarks for how long the preparation of a product should take. GAO identified at least five areas where the agencies' processes for preparing communication products and those for rules have significant differences. In contrast to the agencies' processes for communication products, rulemaking imposes requirements on agencies regarding (1) justification of the rule, (2) interagency reviews of drafts, (3) transparency of the processes used, (4) opportunities for public comment, and (5) the public's ability to monitor development and review. These differences are to be expected, given the binding effect of rules, and are each rooted in legal requirements that apply to rulemaking, but not to the preparation of communication products. In January 2007, the administration imposed new requirements for agencies' significant guidance documents, for example requiring agencies to provide OMB advance notice and an opportunity to consult on significant guidance before issuance. These changes move the treatment of significant guidance closer to the requirements for rules but do not cover any other types of communication products."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Federal regulatory agencies address their missions not only by  Federal regulatory agencies address their missions not only by  promulgating and enforcing regulations, but also by issuing a wide variety  promulgating and enforcing regulations, but also by issuing a wide variety  of related communication products, such as guidance documents, fact  of related communication products, such as guidance documents, fact  sheets, and brochures.

Both agencies had  the processes by which such products are prepared. Both agencies had  published materials about asbestos in brakes and clutches prior to 2000. In  published materials about asbestos in brakes and clutches prior to 2000. In  1986, OSHA published asbestos standards and EPA issued a safety  1986, OSHA published asbestos standards and EPA issued a safety  brochure (known as the Gold Book) that provided information to  brochure (known as the Gold Book) that provided information to  automobile professional and home mechanics on preventing exposure to  brake and clutch dust that may contain asbestos fibers. In 1994, OSHA  updated and made mandatory work practice standards (regulations)  regarding occupational exposure to asbestos, including automotive brake  repair in commercial shops. For example, the standards require that  employers prohibit certain practices, such as the use of compressed air, to  remove asbestos. Beginning in 2000, a series of events, news articles, and  research studies refocused attention on the issue and prompted OSHA and  EPA\u2019s Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances (OPPTS) to  announce plans to disseminate updated information to the public. As the  asbestos-in-brakes issue reemerged, it also generated controversy. Some  parties raised concerns that workers and the general public were not  aware that asbestos was still present in both old and replacement brakes  and clutches and continued to pose a health risk to persons performing  repairs. Other parties cited data published since 1986 that they believed  showed no increased risk of asbestos-related illnesses associated with  brake work. Media reports also raised concerns about the length of time  taken by both OSHA and OPPTS to release new communication products.", "In response to this controversy, and to obtain insights about the intra- and  interagency processes used for developing and reviewing the asbestos  information and similar products, you asked us to address the following  questions:  1.  How did OSHA and OPPTS initiate, develop, review, and disseminate  updated communication products on exposure to asbestos in  automotive brakes, how long did the processes take, and did the  agencies follow applicable policies and procedures?  2.  What general policies and procedures do OSHA and OPPTS have for  the initiation, development, review, and dissemination of  communication products?  3.  How do the agencies\u2019 policies and procedures for communication  products compare to those applicable to the initiation, development,  review, and dissemination of rules, and what might be the effects of  2007 administration initiatives on guidance documents?", "To address the first objective, we obtained and analyzed information on  the preparation of the OSHA and OPPTS communication products on  asbestos in automotive brakes. We asked agency officials to provide a  chronology and description of events that led to the initiation,  development, review, and eventual dissemination of the products. We also  asked the officials to provide any available documentation that would  corroborate the events and processes described in their respective  chronologies. To address the second objective, we reviewed available  documents on the agencies\u2019 applicable internal policies, procedures, and  practices (collectively referred to as processes throughout this report) that  govern the preparation of communication products. We interviewed  agency officials at DOL/OSHA and EPA/OPPTS about their respective  agencies\u2019 processes for preparing communication products, as well as  officials at OMB about interagency reviews of such products. We assessed  the processes to determine how they addressed the generic phases of  product preparation. To address the third objective, we again reviewed  applicable documents and interviewed officials at the three agencies to  obtain information about the differences between rulemaking and the  processes used to prepare communication products. We also solicited the  views of agency officials regarding effects they anticipated from  implementation of amendments to the executive order on regulatory  review and planning and an OMB bulletin on good guidance practices.", "Our scope and methodology were limited to focusing on only the broad  category of communication products\u2014not all nonrule regulatory  products\u2014and on the applicable processes of OSHA and OPPTS, the two  agencies responsible for preparing the communication products on  asbestos in automotive brakes. To illustrate the application of the  agencies\u2019 processes for preparing such products, we relied on detailed  examinations of the asbestos communication products because we  concluded that it would not be possible to identify a representative sample  of issued products in order to do a comparative analysis that would be  meaningful and generalizable to a larger population of products. Because  the agencies keep only limited documentation on the preparation of  communication products, we also relied heavily on testimonial evidence.  We conducted our review in Washington, D.C., from September 2006  through October 2007 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Detailed information on our scope and methodology  appears in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Asbestos is the name given to a number of naturally occurring fibrous  silicate minerals mined for their useful properties, such as thermal  insulation, chemical and thermal stability, and high tensile strength.  Asbestos has been used intentionally in the manufacture of products  ranging from insulation and roofing materials to floor tiles and automotive  brakes, and it may occur as a contaminant in a variety of mineral products,  including vermiculite, talc, and gravel. However, asbestos fibers embedded  in lung tissue over time may cause serious lung diseases, including pleural  abnormalities, reduced lung function, asbestosis, lung cancer, and  mesothelioma. Diseases caused by inhalation of asbestos fibers may not  appear until years after exposure has occurred.", "Multiple federal agencies, including OSHA and EPA, have roles and  responsibilities for regulating or otherwise addressing hazards associated  with exposure to asbestos. In July 1989, EPA issued a final rule banning  most asbestos-containing products. In October 1991, the United States  Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated and remanded EPA\u2019s rule as  it applied to existing asbestos-containing products, but left intact that  portion banning products that were not being manufactured, produced, or  imported when the rule was published on July 12, 1989, which includes all  new uses of asbestos as defined in the ban. Specifically with regard to  asbestos in automotive brakes and clutches, OSHA\u2019s asbestos standard  requires the use of controls and safe work practices to protect employees  of automotive repair facilities. State and local governments with  employees who perform brake and clutch work in states without OSHA- approved state plans must follow the identical regulations found under the  EPA Asbestos Worker Protection Rule. EPA also provides information for  home mechanics outside the automotive repair industry.", "Asbestos is a hazard for which agencies use both rules and informational  communication products to protect the health of workers and the general  public. Rules and nonrule communication products affect the public  differently and serve different purposes. The Administrative Procedure Act  (APA) defines a rule, in part, as \u201cthe whole or a part of an agency  statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed  to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describing the  organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency.\u201d The  APA established the most long-standing and broadly applicable federal  requirements for informal rulemaking, also known as notice and comment  rulemaking. Among other things, the APA generally requires that agencies  publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register. After  giving interested persons an opportunity to comment on the proposed rule  by providing \u201cwritten data, views, or arguments,\u201d and after considering the  public comments, the agency may then publish the final rule. OSHA  rulemaking is conducted pursuant to separate\u2014although analogous\u2014 provisions found in the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as  amended. Rules affect regulated entities by creating binding legal  obligations and are subject to judicial review by the courts if, for example,  a party believes that an agency did not follow required rulemaking  procedures.", "In contrast, communication products, such as guidance documents and  other informational products for the public, are generally advisory in  nature and informational in content. In fact, under the APA, there is a  statutory exception for having to go through notice and comment  rulemaking for general statements of policy and interpretive rules.  Agencies sometimes include disclaimers in guidance and other  communication products to specifically note that the documents have no  binding effect on regulated parties or the agencies themselves. OSHA and  EPA officials noted that their offices produce large numbers of a variety of  different communication products that may include, but are not limited to,  brochures and pamphlets, compliance guides, educational and training  materials, guidance, and regulatory fact sheets. These products have  different characteristics and purposes. For example, in most cases OSHA  develops SHIBs to address a new hazard or refocus the public\u2019s attention  on a recurring hazard in light of a recent incident, while informational fact  sheets are limited to discussing OSHA standards and technical  information, and \u201cquick cards\u201d are a simplified form of fact sheets that are  targeted to a specific worker audience. Figure 1 illustrates some of the  different types of products disseminated by OSHA and EPA.", "Despite the general distinctions between rules and communication  products, determining whether an agency action is a rule is sometimes  difficult and has been the subject of much litigation. Legal scholars and  federal courts have at times struggled to determine whether an agency  action is a rule that should be subject to the APA\u2019s notice and comment  requirements or is simply guidance or a policy statement, and therefore  exempt from these requirements. Even though not legally binding,  communication materials and guidance documents can have a significant  impact, both because of agencies\u2019 reliance on large volumes of such  products and the fact that the products can prompt changes in the  behavior of regulated parties and the general public. Concerns about the  effects of agency guidance documents and how to ensure that agencies do  not cross the line into rulemaking when drafting guidance are part of what  prompted OMB to issue a bulletin on good guidance practices in January  2007.", "We have published prior work on both agencies\u2019 actions to address  hazards associated with asbestos and the rulemaking process in general.  Several reports and testimonies that we released in 2007 contained  findings and recommendations about opportunities to improve federal  agencies\u2019 communication of information about potential asbestos  hazards. These products showed the need to be timely in getting out  information to the public. For example, had additional or more complete  information been provided, people might have made different decisions or  taken different actions to protect themselves. In addition, Congress has  often asked us to review aspects of federal rulemaking procedures and  practices. However, with rare exceptions, such as a report on agencies\u2019  small entity compliance guides, we have not previously been asked to  review agencies\u2019 general processes regarding communication products.  Our prior reports and testimonies contained a variety of recommendations  to improve various aspects of rulemaking procedures and practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OSHA and OPPTS Used Different Processes during Multiyear Efforts to Complete Communication Products on Asbestos", "paragraphs": ["OSHA and OPPTS followed different paths from 2000 through 2007 to  prepare their SHIB and brochure, respectively, on asbestos in automobile  brakes and clutches. Among the primary differences, the two agencies  initiated work on their asbestos products in response to different triggers,  OSHA took longer than OPPTS to produce a final product, and OPPTS\u2019  process incorporated more steps to obtain input from external parties.  Each agency initiated the development of their product in response to  external events that agency officials decided needed to be addressed  through the publication of communication products. In total, OSHA and  OPPTS took years to complete all the steps of their processes from  initiation through dissemination of their products on asbestos in  automotive brakes\u2014approximately 5-\u00bd years for OSHA and  approximately 3-\u00bd years for OPPTS. In doing so, both OSHA and OPPTS  generally followed applicable agency policies and procedures for  preparing communication products, as described below. The following is a  description of the steps that OSHA and OPPTS took to initiate, develop,  review, and disseminate the communication products on asbestos in  automobile brake and clutch repairs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OSHA and OPPTS Initiated Development of Products on Asbestos in Response to Different Triggers", "paragraphs": ["From 2000 through 2007, OSHA and OPPTS responded to the potential  hazards associated with exposure to asbestos in brake and clutch repairs  by developing and publishing their own communication products. (Fig. 2  illustrates one of the potential hazards.)", "However, each agency initiated its product in response to different  triggering events. In December 2000, an OSHA regional office became  aware of a media report that discussed the potential exposure to asbestos  during brake and clutch repairs and its effect on automobile mechanics.  According to the article, there were indications that mechanics were being  exposed to asbestos levels potentially much higher than the level  recommended in the standards. The article also raised concerns that many  people were unaware that the EPA ban on asbestos products had been  partially overturned and that asbestos-related products\u2014including  automobile brakes\u2014were still being sold and used. Therefore, mechanics  and automobile shop owners might not have been taking preventive  measures to avoid exposure to asbestos fibers. OSHA regional officials  suggested that the agency could either issue a hazard alert to automotive  associations via the internet as a means of disseminating information to  the public, or implement a local emphasis program (LEP) to address this  issue. After being notified by its regional office, the OSHA National Office  decided that the agency\u2019s response would be to develop a hazard  information bulletin. According to agency officials, LEPs are developed by  the regional or area office and reviewed by the Directorate of Enforcement  Programs, however, the regional office did not develop an LEP to address  the issues of exposure to asbestos in automotive brakes. Officials decided  that among the OSHA communication products available, the health  information bulletin would alert the public in the most efficient manner.  However, according to OSHA officials, the asbestos SHIB was unique  because, in most cases, a SHIB is developed to address a new hazard or  refocus the public\u2019s attention on a recurring hazard in light of a recent  incident. This was not the case for the asbestos bulletin because there had  not been any recent incidents associated with asbestos in automobile  brakes.", "OPPTS began to develop its communication product in 2003 in response to  two events. The first was an EPA-initiated asbestos strategy project that  recommended in its 2003 report that the agency revise its materials on  asbestos. This project focused on how oversight, outreach, and education  could help identify priorities and promote innovative approaches and best  practices to address and manage costs and risks associated with asbestos.  The other triggering event was a request for correction under the IQA that  asked EPA to withdraw its 1986 Gold Book. Among other things, the IQA  allows \u201caffected persons\u201d to seek and obtain correction of information  maintained and disseminated by agencies. In essence, the requester  asserted that the Gold Book contained statements that were based on  inadequate and inappropriate scientific information, and that the book  itself was badly outdated given the scientific studies published since 1986.  Once the agency received the request for correction, updating the Gold  Book became a higher priority. OPPTS officials acknowledged that,  although the information provided by the Gold Book was still accurate, the  format and presentation of the information could be perceived as very  technical and not \u201cuser-friendly.\u201d Therefore, officials decided to develop a  product that would provide the necessary information and meet the needs  of professional automobile mechanics and home mechanics, in a simple  and user-friendly format. They agreed that the best approach would be a  brochure. However, according to OPPTS officials the brochure was also a  unique communication product. In most cases, OPPTS develops a  communication product in response to a need that is identified by the  agency itself or is brought to the attention of agency officials. According to  agency officials, the brochure for the existing Gold Book was under  revision to provide more relevant context and illustrations and to conform  with communications practices developed in the years since its last  publication in 1986 (including practices of plain English language and Web  site addresses for additional information). Revision of the asbestos  brochure did not address a new need and did not provide new information  that was not available elsewhere on EPA\u2019s Web site."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OSHA and OPPTS Took Years to Develop and Release Updated Communication Products on Asbestos in Brakes", "paragraphs": ["As illustrated in figure 3, the preparation of the OSHA and OPPTS  communication products on asbestos in automobile brakes occurred over  several years, but OSHA\u2019s SHIB was in development longer than OPPTS\u2019  brochure. From initiation to public dissemination of a final SHIB, OSHA\u2019s  process took approximately 5-\u00bd years. OPPTS\u2019 process took  approximately 3-\u00bd years. OSHA and OPPTS officials stated that one  reason for the delay in developing and disseminating the asbestos  communication products was that other priorities, such as responding to  Hurricane Katrina in the fall of 2005, overtook the development of these  communication products. However, officials from both agencies pointed  out that previously released information about the dangers of exposure to  asbestos, applicable protective standards, and protective measures  remained available during the products\u2019 development.", "OSHA began developing its SHIB in 2001, and posted the final version of  the SHIB to the agency\u2019s Web site in the summer of 2006. During these 5-\u00bd  years, OSHA officials drafted the SHIB and reviewed it, but did not clear it  on two separate occasions (see fig 5). In 2003, agency officials decided not  to publish the SHIB because they were unsure of the extent to which  asbestos in brake products was a problem. They were concerned about  raising an unnecessary alarm about the possible exposure to asbestos in  automobile brakes because they found information about the problem was  limited and inconclusive. In 2004, OSHA received a draft of OPPTS\u2019  brochure addressing the same issue. At that time, OSHA was still  conducting research to determine the extent to which asbestos-containing  products were still available in the market. For example, OSHA staff  reviewed data from the U.S. Geological Survey that indicated that there  were still friction products with asbestos available in the market but it was  difficult to determine the exact amount of automobile brake and clutch  products that contained asbestos. However, officials determined that none  of the sources were able to provide information on the extent to which  asbestos-containing brakes and clutches were still available in the market.  In 2005, OSHA again decided against issuing a revised SHIB because it  repeated existing standards, and agency officials were still uncertain as to  the extent to which automobile brakes and clutches containing asbestos  were still available in the market. OSHA officials said that the  development of the SHIB was given lower priority when the agency staff  became involved with the response to Hurricane Katrina, including the  production of compliance assistance materials related to this event. In  2006, OSHA officials received the OPPTS\u2019 draft brochure prior to its  publication in the Federal Register and also became aware of another  media report that raised concerns about the delays and the lack of activity  at OSHA on the SHIB. OSHA officials consulted with an automobile  manufacturer to determine if asbestos-containing brakes and clutches  were still being used in the manufacture of new automobiles and the  extent to which these parts were still available in the market. While the  information was still inconclusive, at the end of July 2006, OSHA officials  decided to issue the SHIB\u2014that included a cross-reference to the EPA  asbestos Web site\u2014and posted it to the agency\u2019s Web site. (See app. III for  a copy of the final asbestos SHIB.)", "In 2003, OPPTS officials began to develop their brochure in response to  the request for correction and its internal review of asbestos information  products. OPPTS officials reviewed existing data to determine the  prevalence of asbestos-containing automobile brakes and clutches in the  market. OPPTS staff also consulted officials at the U.S. Geological Survey  as well as with industry officials to determine if asbestos-containing  products were still available in the market. According to their contacts,  there were still products with asbestos available in the market but it was  difficult to determine the amount of products. OPPTS officials decided  that given the uncertainty about the prevalence, there was a need to  inform the public about the potential hazard. By April 2004, after  developing a draft of the brochure, OPPTS was ready to submit its draft  for comments from other federal agencies. In July, OPPTS staff learned  about the SHIB that OSHA had begun to draft in 2001 that addressed the  same hazard. At various points during the rest of the development of the  brochure, staff at OSHA and OPPTS worked together to ensure that the  OPPTS brochure incorporated language from the OSHA SHIB and cross- referenced the OSHA SHIB and Web site. By the fall of 2004, OPPTS  officials decided to defer to OSHA. They halted further development of the  brochure. According to OSHA officials, in early 2005, EPA officials  indicated to OSHA that they were no longer interested in pursuing a joint  communications product on exposure to asbestos in automotive brakes. In  2006, OSHA officials confirmed their decision not to publish the  information bulletin, and OPPTS officials moved forward with the  development of their brochure, because they were responding to a request  for correction, and finalized the draft by the summer. In August 2006,  OPPTS published its draft brochure, and in March 2007 OPPTS published  the final brochure. (See app. IV for a copy of the final brochure.)", "OPPTS also consulted and coordinated with officials at OMB. Because  OPPTS was responding to a request for correction, OMB, in its oversight  role under IQA, monitored the agency\u2019s response to the request. However,  there was no formal requirement for interagency coordination between  OMB and OPPTS in developing communication products. According to  OSHA officials, OMB\u2019s inquiries into the SHIB development were due to  EPA reporting to OMB that it was not developing its own response to the  request for correction because OSHA was developing a SHIB that  addressed the same hazard. However, there was no requirement for OMB  to monitor or review the development of the SHIB.", "While OSHA and OPPTS developed new products that addressed the same  health hazard and varied in the amount of time needed for development  and review, agency officials stated that neither product contained any  information that was not already available to the public. OSHA\u2019s  information bulletin was based on the existing workplace asbestos  standards, and EPA\u2019s brochure was an update to the Gold Book (a 16-page  booklet). According to agency officials, these were products that were  intended not only to inform the public about the potential health hazard,  but also to provide other sources of information within each agency in a  more user-friendly format. However, the EPA brochure differs from the  previous Gold Book in several ways. The Gold Book not only drew  attention to what it considered to be very serious health consequences  that resulted from exposure to asbestos during brake and clutch repair,  but also stated that it was very difficult to make the repair of asbestos- containing parts safe. The new brochure lists the health consequences of  exposure to asbestos, but also outlines best practices that when followed,  can reduce the potential for exposure to asbestos so that repair work on  asbestos brakes can be conducted in a safe manner. While the brochure  does not elaborate on the reasons for the discussion on best practices,  OPPTS officials stated that the shorter brochure (a trifold pamphlet) was  intended to be more user-friendly and not a compilation of all of the  available information on the potential health consequences associated  with asbestos exposure in a single publication. (Within the brochure,  officials provided the link to the agency\u2019s Web page that has more  information on the health consequences associated with asbestos  exposure.) Some of the respondents to OPPTS\u2019 request for public  comments questioned these differences in content. For example, one  organization said that the draft failed to provide sufficient information  concerning the risks of asbestos and appropriate risk practices and  recommended that the final brochure address in more detail the issue of  latency in the effects of asbestos disease, and that language of the EPA  document should mirror the language of the OSHA SHIB, for example by  stating that \u201cMechanics should assume that all brakes have asbestos-type  shoes.\u201d Another respondent, while generally supportive of the changes  made in the new brochure, stated that warnings of health effects  associated with exposure to asbestos listed in the new document should  be expanded and should include information about the danger of exposing  family members by wearing work clothes home. OPPTS officials stated  that the intent of the brochure was to update the Gold Book and convey  the work practice information in a more user-friendly format, and that  other information related to asbestos could be found on the agency\u2019s Web  site."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OSHA and OPPTS Included External Parties to Different Degrees in the Review of the Asbestos Products", "paragraphs": ["Under both OSHA and OPPTS processes, reviewing a communication  product always includes internal review but also may include external  review.

In  comparison, OSHA\u2019s process had more limited participation from external  parties. As part if its process, OPPTS consulted with other federal agencies  in the development of the brochure. In addition, in order to determine the  extent to which asbestos was still present in automobile brakes and  clutches, OSHA and OPPTS staff consulted officials at the U.S. Geological  Survey. OSHA also consulted with an automobile manufacturer and  OPPTS consulted with some automobile parts manufacturers and retailers  to determine if asbestos-containing products were still prevalent.  According to their contacts, there were still products with asbestos  available in the market but it was difficult to determine their prevalence.  Once OPPTS officials decided to develop their own brochure, they  submitted the draft to OMB for review and coordination of the interagency  review.

For example,  the SHIB directive states that it might be appropriate to disseminate  information to or through OSHA field offices as a SHIB when OSHA  becomes aware of new, unusual, noteworthy, previously unrecognized, or  little known but significant occupational safety and health hazards.  Officials said that most ideas for SHIBs come from the field, and most  come out of OSHA\u2019s inspections.

The OSHA  instruction on nonpolicy issuances includes a process flow checklist to  determine whether a proposed issuance is appropriate for release as a  nonpolicy issuance.", "One distinguishing feature of OSHA\u2019s instructions is that for SHIBs in  particular and compliance assistance products in general, the Assistant  Secretary of OSHA must approve the proposed product before  development of a draft can proceed. There are also earlier steps during  which field, regional, and national office officials determine whether an  issue merits national attention. These approvals serve as an important  internal control. For example, according to agency officials, OSHA  developed its instruction on compliance assistance products to   (1) implement a process that ensures that the development of guidance is  appropriately coordinated between the national office and field operations  before resources are spent to develop the products and (2) establish a  process by which guidance projects are approved by OSHA management  before the expenditure of resources.", "Centralized top-management approval is a prominent feature of OSHA\u2019s  new instruction on compliance assistance products. Under that  instruction, the initiating OSHA region, directorate, or office must obtain  approval from the Assistant Secretary of OSHA before development of any  such products. To do so, OSHA will filter the proposals through OSHA\u2019s  Compliance Assistance Coordinating Group (CACG). Proposals are to be  entered into a database and, unless expedited review has been requested,  CACG will coordinate requests for presentation to the Assistant Secretary  on a quarterly basis. (OSHA\u2019s directive indicates that the agency will use  the \u201cCompliance Assistance Products under Development\u201d database to  track not only the initiation and approval of proposed products, but also  their development and clearance.)

During the development phase, national and field office staff may consult  with each other. However, according to agency officials, OSHA typically  does not survey or consult with outside parties for additional information  when developing a SHIB.

The  SHIB directive suggests that the Director of DSTM refer to current OSHA  Alliances to ensure inclusion of appropriate stakeholders (for example,  trade associations connected with a topic). However, OSHA officials  pointed out that their process for SHIBs and other guidance documents is  largely internal, unless there is some reason to go outside OSHA. Officials  told us that some products, such as guidance on pandemic flu, go through  interagency and OMB review.

Specifically, if major issues surface  during reviews, but the agency still wishes to proceed with a SHIB,  officials would revise the document to address the concerns, and the draft  would have to go through appropriate review steps again.", "Under the September 2007 OSHA instructions on compliance assistance  products, the review and clearance processes are very similar to those  outlined in the SHIB directive. However, unlike the SHIB directive, the  instructions on compliance assistance products include some specific time  frames for reviews. For example, offices generally are required to allow at  least 20 working days for review of compliance assistance products. After  incorporating appropriate changes, OSHA management determines  whether a second review is needed.

At EPA, nonrule products include, among others,  communication materials, scientific documents, analyses, reports,  guidance, and compliance assistance materials. Among the main EPA-wide  procedures or guidelines that may affect the procedural steps followed to  prepare communication products are (1) EPA\u2019s Action Development  Process: Guidance for EPA Staff on Developing Quality Actions,   (2) Policy and Implementation Guide for Communications Product  Development and Approval (guidelines from EPA\u2019s Office of Public  Affairs, also referred to as the agency\u2019s Product Review Process), (3) the  agency\u2019s procedures for notices to be published in the Federal Register,  and (4) EPA\u2019s information quality guidelines.

According to the officials, regardless of whether  written procedures are developed for a particular category of products,  the process that OPPTS follows is built around these core phases. Figure 5  illustrates the OPPTS process for preparing communication products.  OPPTS officials characterized this process as one that they typically follow  to prepare products, such as the brochure on preventing asbestos  exposure among brake and clutch repair workers. However, it is not  necessary for each communication product to follow each of these steps.", "During the initiation phase, OPPTS officials generally will identify the need  for the product, identify the type of product to consider developing (for  example, Web page, fact sheet, brochure, or Q&A document), consult with  stakeholders (if officials determine there is a need for consultation), and  obtain approval for the concept from the appropriate officials. Agency  officials told us that the need to develop a new communication product, or  to revise or update an existing product, might arise from several sources,  including a legal mandate, identification by their staff responding to  inquiries or implementing a program, or OPPTS management. In some  cases, OPPTS may consult with another agency or affected stakeholders to  identify the need for creating or revising a communication product. In the  case of a product developed as a result of a regulatory program, the  stakeholders may be representatives of the regulated community or other  interested members of the public. Pursuant to EPA\u2019s Product Review  Process for Communications Materials, an important step in initiation is  that OPPTS management agrees that the product needs to be developed or  revised, and EPA\u2019s Office of Public Affairs also reviews and approves the  concept."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Development", "paragraphs": ["Once a concept for a product is approved, the program officials consult  with stakeholders (as appropriate), develop a time frame for product  completion and a plan for disseminating the product (a communications  plan), and determine whether a specific process applies to the  development of a particular product.

OPPTS officials told us that  development time frames may vary for different product types depending  on the specific needs identified and circumstances related to that product,  and also depending on whether a process has been developed or needs to  be developed. Unless specifically mandated by statute, or driven by other  legal deadlines or an identified critical need, the time frame for developing  the product is flexible and subject to change based on competing demands  for the staff\u2019s attention and other resources. The agency\u2019s processes set no  specific time frames for how long development of a product should take.  In addition, OPPTS may decide to engage partner agencies, stakeholders,  or both at different points during the development of the product, based  primarily on the circumstances specific to the particular product.  According to OPPTS officials, because the nature of communication  products and the circumstances surrounding their development vary  significantly, the process provides sufficient flexibility to ensure the  development of a quality product.

However, the agency maintains several  lists of some of the available products for the public; for example, officials  noted that the National Service Center for Environmental Publications is a  central repository for EPA documents available for distribution, but this is  not all-inclusive. An EPA official also pointed out that almost all  communication products\u2014whether from OPPTS or other EPA program  offices\u2014ultimately are reviewed by EPA\u2019s Office of Public Affairs, which  maintains an inventory of all public communication products that it has  reviewed. As OPPTS officials said, it may also be less meaningful to  attempt to catalog communication materials as the agency increasingly  posts information to its Web site for quicker dissemination and wider  accessibility and uses a variety of simpler, more focused formats to convey  that information. They said that the differences between EPA\u2019s 1986 Gold  Book and the agency\u2019s 2007 asbestos brochure illustrate this change. While  the agency\u2019s goal for the Gold Book was to compile all of the available  information into a single publication, OPPTS now provides links to source  documents, rather than repeating all the details. OPPTS officials noted that  using a link or reference ensures that the public has up-to-date information  and minimizes the need to correct or revise the brochure when the source  information changes.

Under other statutes  and executive orders\u2014such as the Paperwork Reduction Act, Regulatory  Flexibility Act, Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, Congressional Review  Act, and Executive Order 12866 on regulatory planning and review\u2014 agencies may also be required to complete and publish analyses  supporting the rule and the options selected by the agency. In some cases,  statutes impose additional requirements on specific kinds of rules, such as  requirements for public hearings. There are no such general statutory  requirements for agencies to provide justification for their communication  products, although, as discussed above, OSHA and OPPTS procedures  typically involve a step where agency officials determine that there is a  need for a proposed communication product.", "Interagency reviews \u2013 Under Executive Order 12866, OMB\u2019s Office of  Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) reviews significant draft rules  (for example, rules expected to have an annual effect of $100 million or  more on the economy or that raise other coordination, budgetary, or  policy issues) before they are published as proposed or final rules. The  executive order generally requires OIRA to complete its reviews of  significant rules within 90 days after an agency formally submits a draft  regulation. In contrast, officials from OMB, OSHA, and EPA all noted that  there generally are no formal procedures and requirements governing  interagency and OMB reviews of communication products\u2014with the  exception of a recently implemented requirement for OMB reviews of  significant guidance documents (discussed below). Agency officials  confirmed that such reviews do take place informally for some  communication products (although they are not necessarily required).", "Transparency of the process \u2013 In prior work, we identified transparency  as a regulatory best practice, noted that transparency requirements help to  make agencies\u2019 processes more open (and promote participation), and  quoted an Administrator of OIRA who pointed out that openness can help  transform the public debate about regulation to one of substance rather  than process. However, the transparency of the processes used to  prepare communication products is much more limited than for  rulemaking. During rulemaking, agencies typically maintain a rulemaking  record, in the form of a public docket. Moreover, Executive Order 12866  requires OIRA and the agencies to document and disclose certain  information about OIRA\u2019s reviews of draft rules, including the substantive  changes made to rules during OIRA\u2019s review and at OIRA\u2019s suggestion or  recommendation, as well as any documents exchanged between the  agencies and OIRA. OIRA is also required to disclosure its substantive  communications (including telephone calls, meetings, and incoming  correspondence) with outside parties (persons not employed by the  executive branch) regarding rules under review. However, as discussed in  our 2003 report on this process, such requirements do not necessarily  ensure transparency. OMB and agencies may engage in informal reviews  that are not subject to any of the documentation and disclosure  requirements that apply when a draft rule is undergoing formal review.  Agencies\u2019 preparation of communication products is not subject to the  same requirements as rulemaking for documentation and disclosure of the  processes and steps taken. Further, information related solely to the  internal practices of an agency is exempt from public disclosure under the  Freedom of Information Act. Therefore, while OSHA and OPPTS officials  confirmed that they document the internal review processes followed to  prepare communication products, such documentation is not subject to  public disclosure. Also, as we noted earlier, the basic processes that the  agencies use are not always documented in writing or made publicly  available.", "Public comment \u2013 In rulemaking, agencies are required to give interested  persons an opportunity to comment on proposed rules by providing  \u201cwritten data, views, or arguments,\u201d and also to consider the public  comments before issuing a final rule. There generally are no such  requirements for the agencies to provide the public an opportunity to  comment on draft communication products. However, OSHA and OPPTS  officials noted that they still may choose to seek public comments on  certain products. For example, OPPTS officials said that they may provide  external stakeholders an opportunity to comment on a communication  product in circumstances involving new products, stakeholder interest,  external commitments for comment opportunities, potentially  controversial issues, or for other reasons. OSHA officials told us that they  sometimes provide opportunities for public comment on communication  products, although they have not done so for SHIBs.", "Monitoring development and review \u2013 The public is better able to track  the status of the development and review of significant rulemaking. In  response to provisions of Executive Order 12866, as amended, agencies  make general information on rulemaking in process publicly available  through mechanisms such as the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory  and Deregulatory Actions, the Regulatory Plan, and OMB\u2019s database on  the status of draft rules submitted for review under the executive order.  No similar mechanisms are available for publicly tracking communication  products.

OMB noted that well-designed guidance documents can serve many  important or even critical functions in regulatory programs and, among  other things, can channel the discretion of agency employees, increase  efficiency, and enhance fairness. OMB cited various reasons for issuing the  bulletin, noting, for example, that as the impact of guidance documents on  the public has grown, so too has the need for good guidance practices.  OMB also stated that guidance documents may not receive the benefit of  careful consideration accorded under the procedures for development and  review of rules, and OMB raised the concern that because it is  procedurally easier to issue guidance documents, there may be an  incentive for regulators to issue guidance documents in lieu of rules. OMB  also cited potential benefits from enhancing the quality and transparency  of agency guidance practices\u2014including, when practical, using  opportunities for public input to increase the quality of products and  provide for greater public confidence in and acceptance of agency  judgments.", "Among other things, the executive order, bulletin, and implementation  memorandum require agencies to (1) develop clearance procedures for  significant guidance documents; (2) provide OMB advance notice and an  opportunity for consultation on significant guidance; (3) create and  maintain a current list of all significant guidance on their Web sites and  establish a means for the public to submit comments electronically on  significant guidance, as well as requests for issuance, reconsideration,  modification, or rescission of significant guidance documents; and   (4) provide public notice and seek public comments on any economically  significant guidance. These changes move the treatment of significant  guidance closer to the requirements for rules. However, the changes only  apply to significant guidance documents, not to any other types of  communication products.", "The OMB bulletin outlines basic standards expected for significant  guidance, including both approval procedures and standard elements of  each significant guidance document. OSHA officials said that although  their directive on compliance assistance products was not developed  specifically to implement OMB\u2019s bulletin and the revised executive order,  its procedures appropriately reflect those requirements. EPA also revised  its processes to reflect the new requirements for guidance documents. As  required by the bulletin, both OSHA and EPA have listed the significant  guidance documents subject to Executive Order 12866, as amended, and  OMB\u2019s bulletin on their Web sites.", "Under Executive Order 12866, as amended, and OIRA\u2019s implementation  memorandum, the requirements regarding notification to OIRA of a  significant guidance document are similar, but not identical, to those  applicable to OIRA\u2019s reviews of significant rules. Agencies are required to  provide advance notification to OIRA of a significant guidance  document\u2014as a general rule, no less than 10 days prior to intended  dissemination. If the Administrator of OIRA determines that additional  consultation is warranted, OIRA will review the guidance and coordinate  review among appropriate executive branch departments and agencies.  The Executive Order does not specify a time period for review of  significant guidance documents, but according to the implementing  memorandum, OIRA will complete its consultation on the guidance  document within 30 days or, at that time, will advise the agency when  consultation will be complete. However, the executive order amendments,  OMB bulletin, and OIRA memorandum did not extend the transparency  and documentation requirements applicable to OIRA\u2019s review of draft  rules (such as disclosing changes made at OIRA\u2019s suggestion or  documenting contacts with external parties) to its reviews of draft  guidance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["OSHA and OPPTS initiated work on their asbestos communication  products for different reasons, but in both cases the agencies\u2019 processes  took years to complete. OSHA initiated work in 2000 in response to news  reports that workers were not aware that asbestos had not been banned  from automotive products and might still pose a potential hazard. OPPTS  initiated work in 2003 in response to a request that the agency correct  information in its Gold Book. From initiation to dissemination of final  products, OSHA took approximately 5-\u00bd years to publish its asbestos  SHIB, while OPPTS took approximately 3-\u00bd years to publish its final  asbestos brochure. OSHA\u2019s iterative review process contributed to delays  in producing its SHIB, as OSHA officials cited the need to address  uncertainties regarding the prevalence of asbestos in brake products.  OPPTS officials also cited a number of explanations for the time required  to produce their final brochure, including their external coordination and  review activities and competing demands on resources. Officials from both  agencies pointed out that, during the time that they worked on their  asbestos products, information about the potential hazard and protective  measures that could be taken remained available on the agencies\u2019 Web  sites. Ultimately, both OSHA and OPPTS determined that new asbestos  communication products were needed, and the products were publicly  released.", "Communication products are an important tool that OSHA and OPPTS (as  well as other agencies) use to support and augment their regulatory  activities. Communication products provide crucial information to  regulated parties and the general public. Therefore, it is important that  communication products be issued in a timely manner. Timeliness is but  one of a range of performance indicators that agencies may use to  measure whether they are achieving their goals, as managers balance  competing priorities. But timeliness seems especially relevant once an  agency has determined that there is a need to communicate information  about how people can protect themselves from health and safety hazards  to which they might be exposed. Having such information might lead  people to make different decisions or take different actions to protect  themselves than they would in the absence of such information. As the  various OSHA and OPPTS processes for preparing communication  products are currently designed, they contain few, if any, performance  time frames or benchmarks to help ensure that the processes can produce  final products in a timely fashion. Although there can be no single  standard for how long the entire process should take, OSHA\u2019s and OPPTS\u2019  processes could benefit from general time frames or benchmarks to  provide some impetus for moving products the agencies identified as  needed through to dissemination. It should also be remembered that one  of the reasons why agencies use alternatives to rulemaking\u2014such as  guidance or general communication products\u2014is because these  alternatives have the advantage of being less time consuming than  rulemaking.", "It is also important that the processes the agencies use to prepare  communication products be documented, transparent, and understood.  Differences between the processes for preparing communication products  and rules are to be expected, given the legal effect and consequences of  rules. Preparation of communication products should not require the same  level of justification, documentation, disclosure, and public comment as  rulemaking. However, communication products are also important and  can affect the actions of regulated parties and the public, so enhancing the  general transparency and accountability of agencies\u2019 processes could be  beneficial. Knowing the many steps that agencies take when preparing  communication products could not only help external parties contribute,  when appropriate, to the preparation of the agencies\u2019 products, but could  also help those parties to understand why the process is sometimes  lengthy.", "There are opportunities for both OSHA and OPPTS to enhance the  transparency and accountability of the processes they use to prepare  communication products. Those processes are not always easy to identify  and understand, in part because of the great variety of the agencies\u2019  products and processes, but also because not all key elements of the  processes the agencies may follow are documented. For example, with the  exception of required OMB reviews of significant guidance documents,  OMB, OSHA, and OPPTS officials noted that they have no formal written  procedures governing interagency and/or OMB reviews of communication  products. Nevertheless, agency officials confirmed that such reviews do  occur (although they are not necessarily required). As another example,  OSHA\u2019s process includes a potential review \u201cloop\u201d that OSHA officials said  would not be apparent from reading their directive on SHIBs but can  result in staff having to revise the product and repeat the review process.", "The transparency and accountability of the agencies\u2019 processes can also be  limited if they are not publicly disclosed. For both OSHA and OPPTS, this  would include disclosing the unwritten elements of their key processes  mentioned above, once documented. In addition, EPA/OPPTS could do  more to publicize existing written guidelines about key processes for  preparing communication products. In contrast to OSHA, which has  posted its key written process instructions, this is not always the case for  EPA/OPPTS. In particular, EPA\u2019s Action Development Process is not  publicly available but applies to the agency\u2019s most significant actions,  including rules. Although the agency\u2019s process guidelines focus primarily  on internal policies and procedures, the final products generated by the  agency may be of interest to and affect a variety of external parties, from  Congress and other federal agencies to regulated parties and the general  public. Greater disclosure about OSHA\u2019s and OPPTS\u2019 processes could be  limited to providing more information about their general processes and  would not require the agencies to reveal the actual details of internal  policy deliberations for individual communication products.", "We also observed that EPA/OPPTS identified difficulties in identifying  communication products that have been disseminated, even when we  limited our request to a subset of product types. OPPTS officials told us  that their agency increasingly relies on disseminating information through  a variety of formats and links on its Web site. They believe this is a more  effective approach to disseminating information to the public, but it may  also make it more difficult for the agency to catalog what has been  disseminated. We think that it is important, as a matter of basic internal  controls, for an agency to maintain an inventory of the products it  produces. We recognize that EPA and OPPTS already have a number of  separate databases to track various types of communication products, but  we remain concerned that some of the products and information  disseminated might not be captured by existing databases. Adopting a  mechanism such as the centralized database that OSHA is implementing  might enhance OPPTS\u2019 ability to track, identify, and manage the inventory  of its disseminated products.", "OSHA also could enhance its existing processes for preparing  communication products. For example, the OPPTS processes, both in  general and as illustrated during preparation of the asbestos brochure,  prompt more and earlier consultation with external parties than seems to  be the case with OSHA\u2019s SHIB process. Although OSHA may seek external  reviews in some cases, agency officials said that their processes for  preparing SHIBs and other guidance documents are largely internal. We  recognize that this, in part, reflects the different purposes and context for  OSHA communication products, and that outreach to external parties  comes at a cost to the agency in terms of both time and resources.  However, consultation, outreach, and coordination also can provide  important benefits, as OMB cited when explaining the need for agency  good guidance practices. Just as the OMB guidance was intended to  increase the quality and transparency of agency guidance practices\u2014 including, when practical, using opportunities for public input to increase  the quality of products and provide for greater public confidence in and  acceptance of agency judgments\u2014so too may the preparation of other  communication products benefit from appropriate outreach efforts.", "Similarly, OSHA might wish to enhance its existing process instructions  regarding dissemination of communication products by considering  elements of the EPA/OPPTS process. While OSHA\u2019s directives prompt  agency officials to post final products to the agency\u2019s Web site and  encourage OSHA staff to consult with the agency\u2019s Office of  Communications about whether an announcement should be made, the  directives provide more guidance on distribution of the final products  within OSHA than on distribution to regulated workplaces and the public.  The EPA/OPPTS processes prompt early and ongoing attention to effective  notification about and dissemination of communication products, through  tools such as a communications plan, and also provide more guidance to  agency staff about communications planning."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["While we recognize that OSHA and EPA/OPPTS have taken some steps in  each of the following areas, more could be done to improve the  transparency, accountability, and timeliness of their processes for the  initiation, development, review, and dissemination of communication  products. Therefore, we are making the following six recommendations:  1.  The Assistant Secretary for OSHA and the Administrator of EPA  should ensure that their key general policies and procedures for  preparing communication products include, as appropriate, time  frames or benchmarks to help ensure that products that the agencies  have determined are needed are developed, reviewed, and  disseminated in a timely manner.  2.  The Assistant Secretary for OSHA and the Administrator of EPA  should take steps to ensure that their key general policies and  procedures for preparing communication products are fully  documented. To the extent feasible, this should include identifying the  applicable policies and procedures governing OMB/interagency  coordination and reviews of such products, as well as any other key  processes that the agencies believe are important to understanding  how they prepare their products.  3.  The Assistant Secretary for OSHA and the Administrator of EPA  should ensure that their agencies make public the key general policies  and procedures for preparing communication products, including any  updated in response to the previous objective.  4.  The Administrator of EPA should consider adopting for OPPTS\u2014and  other EPA offices, as appropriate\u2014a centralized database or databases  to more completely account for the inventory of communication  materials disseminated by the agency.  5.  The Assistant Secretary for OSHA should augment existing OSHA  directives on the preparation of SHIBs and other communication  products to prompt OSHA staff to identify opportunities to solicit input  from external parties, as practical, during the preparation of  communication products.  6.  The Assistant Secretary for OSHA should augment existing OSHA  directives on the preparation of SHIBs and other communication  products to provide more guidance to OSHA staff on developing a  communications strategy during the product development process (for  example, to identify who the agency needs to inform of the product,  how notification and dissemination will be done, and who will be  responsible for specific notification and dissemination tasks)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Secretary of Labor, the  Administrator of EPA, and the Director of OMB for their review and  comment. In comments on the report, EPA generally agreed with the  recommendations and concurred that a formal, well-understood process  for coordination and review of communication materials is important to  ensure quality information products (see app. V). With regard to the first  recommendation, EPA also commented that a fair amount of flexibility  and discretion is necessary for the development of communication  materials. We agree and had already stated in our conclusions that there  can be no single standard for how long the process should take and in our  recommendation that agencies should incorporate time frames and  benchmarks \u201cas appropriate.\u201d EPA also noted that the time frame  associated with its development of the brakes brochure was an anomaly  and may not be a useful standard to compare to other cases. However, we  based our recommendations on our review of EPA\u2019s (and OSHA\u2019s) general  policies and procedures, not on our review of the specific products on  asbestos in brakes. With regard to the second, third, and fourth  recommendations, EPA identified steps that it already has taken, such as  more fully documenting the agency\u2019s process guidance, making guidance  available to the public on the agency\u2019s Web site, and having a centralized  approach and database on the development of communication materials.  We recognized in our conclusions and recommendations that EPA (and  OSHA) were already taking steps that addressed some elements of our  recommendations. However, as discussed in our conclusions, we believe  that more could be done to enhance the transparency and accountability  of the agencies\u2019 processes.

We asked agency officials to provide a  chronology and description of events that led to the initiation,  development, review/clearance, and eventual dissemination of the  products. We also asked the officials to provide any documentation, to the  extent available, that would corroborate the events and processes as  described in their respective chronologies. We compared the policies and  procedures to identify the steps for (1) initiating the development of the  asbestos communication products, (2) developing, or drafting, the  asbestos communication products, (3) reviewing\u2014internally, externally,  or both\u2014the asbestos communication products, and (4) disseminating the  asbestos communication products. For some of the steps, the processes  are informal, and therefore, difficult to document. Therefore, because the  information was based, in large part, on testimonial evidence, we prepared  statements of facts on our review at each agency and provided these  statements to the agencies for vetting and confirmation of the information.  The agency officials verified the information, and provided comments and  technical corrections that we incorporated, as appropriate.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed the agencies\u2019 applicable  internal policies, procedures, and guidance documents governing the  preparation of communication products. We reviewed relevant and  available primary documents, such as the agencies\u2019 Information Quality  guidelines, EPA-specific guidance on the development and review of  communication products, and OSHA directives governing the development  and review of guidance documents, in particular, Safety and Health  Information Bulletins (SHIB). Further, we interviewed agency officials at  DOL/OSHA and EPA/OPPTS who are involved in the development and  review of their respective agencies\u2019 communication products, as well as  officials at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to obtain  information on interagency reviews of communication products. We  compared the policies and procedures to identify the steps for   (1) initiating, (2) developing or drafting, (3) reviewing (internally and  externally), and (4) disseminating a communication product. For some of  the steps, the processes are informal and not documented. Therefore,  because some of the key information to address our findings was based on  testimonial evidence, we prepared statements of facts on our review at  each agency and provided these statements to the agencies for vetting and  confirmation of the information.

To illustrate the application of the  agencies\u2019 processes for preparing such products, we performed a detailed  examination of their asbestos communication products. While we initially  had expected to compare the processes used in developing the two  asbestos products with the processes used to prepare a sample of like  products, we concluded that it would not be possible to identify a  representative sample of issued products in order to do a comparative  analysis that would be meaningful and generalizable to a larger population  of products. Agency officials told us the timeline and process undertaken  for one product could be quite different from the timelines for other  products of that type.
