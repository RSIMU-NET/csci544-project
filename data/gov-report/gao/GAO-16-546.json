Data on the occurrence of sexual violence are critical to preventing, addressing, and understanding the consequences of these types of crimes. GAO was asked to identify and compare federal efforts to collect data on sexual violence.", "This report addresses two questions: (1) What are the federal efforts underway to collect data on sexual violence, and how, if at all, do these efforts differ? (2) How do any differences across the data collection efforts affect the understanding of sexual violence, and to what extent are federal agencies addressing any challenges posed by the differences? GAO reviewed agency documentation and academic literature, and interviewed agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Four federal agencies\u2014the Departments of Defense, Education, Health and Human Services (HHS), and Justice (DOJ)\u2014manage at least 10 efforts to collect data on sexual violence, which differ in target population, terminology, measurements, and methodology. Some of these data collection efforts focus on a specific population that the agency serves\u2014for example, the incarcerated population\u2014while others include information from the general population. These data collection efforts use 23 different terms to describe sexual violence. Data collection efforts also differ in how they categorize particular acts of sexual violence. For example, the same act of sexual violence could be categorized by one data collection effort as \u201crape,\u201d whereas it could be categorized by other efforts as \u201cassault-sexual\u201d or \u201cnonconsensual sexual acts,\u201d among other terms. In addition, five data collection efforts\u2014overseen by Education, HHS, and DOJ\u2014reflect inconsistencies between their measurements and definitions of sexual violence. Further, these data collection efforts do not have publicly-available descriptions of what is included in their respective measurements to allow persons using the data to understand the differences, which may lead to confusion for data users. Publicly-available measurement information could enhance the clarity and transparency of sexual violence data. Data collection efforts also differ in terms of the context in which data are collected, data sources, units of measurement, and time frames.", "Differences in data collection efforts may hinder the understanding of the occurrence of sexual violence, and agencies' efforts to explain and lessen differences have been fragmented and limited in scope. Differences across the data collection efforts may address specific agency interests, but collectively, the differences lead to varying estimates of sexual violence. For example, in 2011 (the most recent year of available data), estimates ranged from 244,190 rape or sexual assault victimizations to 1,929,000 victims of rape or attempted rape. These differences can lead to confusion for the public. Officials from federal agencies and entities GAO spoke with who use federal data on sexual violence emphasized that the differences across the data collection efforts are such that the results are not comparable, and entities reported using data that best suited their needs. Agencies have taken some steps to clarify the differences between the data collection efforts. For example, two DOJ entities coauthored a statement that describes the differences between their two efforts. In addition, agencies have taken some steps to harmonize the data collection efforts\u2014that is, coordinate practices to achieve a shared goal. However, actions to increase harmonization have been fragmented, generally only involving 2 of the 10 data collection efforts at a time, and limited in scope. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) through its authority to coordinate federal statistics has previously convened interagency working groups, such as the Interagency Working Group for Research on Race and Ethnicity, to improve federal statistics. OMB has no plans to convene a working group on sexual violence data. Additional collaboration, facilitated by OMB, between agencies that manage data collection efforts about which differences help or hinder the overall understanding of sexual violence could help to clarify the scope of the problem of sexual violence in the United States."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Education, HHS, and DOJ make information that is included in their measurements of sexual violence publicly available. GAO also recommends that OMB establish a federal interagency forum on sexual violence data. Education, HHS, and DOJ agreed with the recommendation. OMB stated that convening a forum may not be the most effective use of resources at this time, in part because the data collection efforts are not far enough along in their research. However, OMB said it will consider convening or sharing information across agencies in the future."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["There is concern about sexual violence in the United States, particularly  involving college students, incarcerated individuals, and military  personnel. Research has shown that sexual violence has long-lasting  effects on victims, including sexually-transmitted diseases, eating  disorders, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.  Further, the economic costs of rape, including medical and social  services, loss of productivity, decreased quality of life, and law  enforcement resources, are estimated to range from $41,247 to $150,000  per incident.", "According to research, victims often do not report sexual violence to law  enforcement officials due to feelings of guilt, shame, and embarrassment;  fear of the perpetrator; or fear of not being believed, among other  reasons. Therefore, the occurrence of sexual violence is considered to be  underestimated.", "Congress, state and local governments, and the public depend on data  collected by the federal government to prioritize resources, design  policies and programs that prevent and address crimes of sexual  violence, and evaluate those policies and programs. Federal data on  sexual violence are also used in crafting initiatives to mitigate the effects  of these experiences on victims and in gauging the effectiveness of these  initiatives.", "You asked us to identify the primary sources of information on sexual  violence collected by the federal government and to identify any  challenges that may result from the differences across the data collection  efforts.

(2) How do any differences across the data  collection efforts affect the understanding of sexual violence, and to what  extent are federal agencies addressing any challenges posed by the  differences?", "For the purpose of our analysis, we selected data collection efforts which  focus on data that: provided information on the extent to which acts of sexual violence  occur in the United States in a particular year (for example, the  number of times an act of sexual violence occurred or the number of  victims of sexual violence); were collected since 2010; were collected at least once every 2 years; were reported publicly; and were not focused primarily on minors.", "We set these criteria to focus our analysis on data collection efforts that  provide current and regular information that is available to the public on  sexual violence. To narrow our scope, we chose to not include data  collection efforts that primarily focused on sexual violence against minors.  To identify data collection efforts that met our criteria, we reviewed past  GAO reports and a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) list of federal  agencies that may collect crime data. We asked officials at those  agencies if they had any data collection efforts that met our criteria. We  also asked academic experts and officials from entities that use federal  data on sexual violence about any additional federal data collection  efforts they were aware of that met our selection criteria. We identified  experts and officials from entities that use federal data on sexual violence  by conducting background research and by asking those experts and  officials that we interviewed to recommend additional experts and entities  that use federal data on sexual violence, including victim advocacy  groups, other special interest groups, and other federal agencies.", "To identify and describe differences across the data collection efforts, we  obtained information on the purpose, scope, and methodology of each  data collection effort. We obtained this information through a review of  documents, such as user manuals and program descriptions. We also  conducted interviews with senior agency officials, senior officials at  entities that use federal data on sexual violence, and academic experts.", "To identify how the differences affect understanding of sexual violence,  we obtained and reviewed federal reports and interviewed and reviewed  relevant documentation from agency officials, experts, and  representatives from entities that use federal data on sexual violence. We  also reviewed articles, conference papers, and government reports that  discuss differences across federal sexual violence data collection efforts.  To identify these articles, our research librarian conducted a search of  several bibliographic databases, such as ProQuest, Embase, and  Scopus.", "To describe the extent to which federal agencies are addressing any  challenges posed by differences across the data collection efforts, we  interviewed senior agency officials and academic experts and obtained  relevant agency documentation.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2015 to July 2016, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has implemented a number of initiatives to  address sexual violence or mitigate its effects. For example, the  Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) Office on Violence Against Women  (OVW), created in 1995 in order to help implement the Violence Against  Women Act (VAWA), sponsors grant programs for local law enforcement  agencies, prosecutors and judges, health care providers, and other  organizations that assist victims of sexual violence by providing, for  example, forensic medical services in sexual violence cases in rural areas  and specialized counseling services for victims from underserved  populations. Another office within DOJ, the Office for Victims of Crime  (OVC), convened crime victim advocates and experts in 2013 as part of  the Vision 21 Initiative and recommended in their report, among other  things, that federal agencies collaborate and expand the collection and  analysis of data on all forms of criminal victimization. The Department of  Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Family Violence Prevention and  Services Program supports two national resource centers on domestic  violence and special-issue and culturally-specific resource centers. In  addition, HHS\u2019s College Sexual Assault Policy and Prevention Initiative  was launched in 2016 and is intended to provide support for organizations  that are implementing policies and practices at postsecondary schools to  prevent sexual assault on their campuses. The Department of  Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued guidance to colleges and  universities, one in 2011 and another in 2014, concerning the  responsibilities of those institutions under Title IX of the Education  Amendments of 1972 with regard to addressing sexual violence against  students. OCR\u2019s guidance sets standards for the grievance procedures  institutions must adopt and publish to promptly and equitably resolve  complaints brought by students alleging sex discrimination (including acts  of sexual violence and sexual harassment), and recommends preventive  education and training programs designed to reduce the occurrence of  sexual violence on campus and improve institutions\u2019 responses to sexual  violence on campus when it does occur. In 2004, Congress passed a law  that required the Secretary of Defense to develop, among other things, a  comprehensive policy for the Department of Defense (DOD) on the  prevention of sexual assaults involving servicemembers. In response to  that statutory requirement, DOD established its sexual-assault prevention  and response program in 2005, and in 2008, DOD published its first  sexual assault prevention strategy.", "Several of the federal government\u2019s responses to sexual violence involve  data collection on the occurrence of sexual violence. For example, the  Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) of 2003 directed DOJ to carry out  studies of the incidence and effects of prison rape. The Jeanne Clery  Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act,  as amended by VAWA in 2013, requires that all institutions of higher  education that participate in federal student financial assistance programs  disclose statistics on certain crimes, including those related to sexual  violence, to the Department of Education (Education). Since 2005,  National Defense Authorization Acts have directed DOD to, among other  things, collect and report information on sexual assaults against service  members.", "Under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), the Office of Information and  Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) in the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) is charged with improving the efficiency and effectiveness of  federal information resources, which includes functions relating to  statistical policy and coordination.

Some of these  data collection efforts focus on a target population that the agency serves.  For example, Education\u2019s Clery Act data collection effort obtains  information on the occurrence of sexual violence at institutions of higher  education. DOD\u2019s Defense Sexual Assault Incident Database (DSAID)  and the Workplace and Gender Relations Survey of Active Duty Members  (WGRA) include and collect data on sexual violence involving military  service members. Others, such as the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting  Program (UCR) data collection efforts compile data from law enforcement  agencies on the general population. Those data collection efforts that  include information from the general population differ in terms of the ages  of respondents or individuals from whom reports of sexual violence are  taken. For example, the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence  Survey (NISVS) collects data from individuals who are 18 and older while  the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) collects data on  household members who are 12 and older; both the Uniform Crime  Reporting Program-Summary Reporting System (UCR-SRS) and the  Uniform Crime Reporting Program-National Incident-Based Reporting  System (UCR-NIBRS) include data from law enforcement agencies on  criminal incidents involving people of all ages.

For example, Education officials told us that  Education\u2019s Office of Federal Student Aid administers inquiries to specific  campuses if Clery Act data show unusually high incidences of certain  crimes, including rape. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) reports that  the National Inmate Survey (NIS) and the Survey of Sexual Victimization  (SSV) data provide helpful information for understanding and addressing  the problem of sexual violence in prisons, jails, and juvenile correctional  facilities. In March 2015, we reported on the importance of using military  data on sexual violence to inform program decisionmaking.", "The 5 data collection efforts whose target population is a segment of the  national population are the result of specific congressional mandates,  while the 5 data collection efforts that focus on the general population are  discretionary initiatives arising from broad agency missions. For  example, BJS is mandated under the terms of the Prison Rape  Elimination Act (PREA) of 2003 to collect data on sexual violence in  prisons, jails, and other detention facilities. BJS conducts both the NIS  and SSV in response to that mandate. In contrast, according to HHS\u2019s  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officials, the agency  launched NISVS as part of its public health mission, and with support  from the National Institute of Justice and DOD as a result of requests  from organizations in the field of sexual violence prevention.", "The extent to which the data collection efforts focus on sexual violence  also varies. Some of the data collection efforts collect information solely  or primarily on the occurrence of sexual violence, such as the SSV or  DSAID. Other data collection efforts have a larger focus. For example, the  UCR-SRS, UCR-NIBRS, and NCVS include information on a broad  spectrum of crimes, and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance  System\u2013All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) includes information on a wide  variety of types of injuries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data Collection Efforts Differ in the Terms They Use to Describe Sexual Violence, and Measurements and Definitions for Some Efforts are Inconsistent", "paragraphs": ["Data collection efforts use a range of terms to describe sexual violence in  publicly-available agency documentation.

For example,  regarding sexual violence involving vaginal penetration of a victim, 6 data  collection efforts include this act of sexual violence in their measurement  of \u201crape,\u201d 2 include it in their measurements of \u201cnonconsensual sexual  acts\u201d or \u201cstaff sexual misconduct,\u201d 2 include it in their measurements of  \u201csexual assault\u201d or \u201cassault-sexual,\u201d 1 includes it in its measurement of  \u201csexual coercion,\u201d 1 includes it in its measurement of \u201cpenetrative sexual  assault,\u201d and 1 includes it in its measurement of \u201csexual assault with an  object.\u201d See tables 5 through 7 in app. II for additional information on  acts of sexual violence included in measurements of sexual violence by  data collection effort.", "It is also the case that one data collection effort may use multiple terms to  characterize a particular act of sexual violence, depending on the  contextual factors that may be involved, such as whether the perpetrator  used physical force. For example, if a victim is penetrated vaginally,  NISVS may characterize that particular act as either \u201crape\u201d or \u201csexual  coercion,\u201d and the decision as to which term is most appropriate is based  on the contextual factors surrounding the act. As such, NISVS  characterizes vaginal penetration of a victim as \u201crape\u201d if the act involves  the use of physical force or threats to physically harm the victim. On the  other hand, NISVS characterizes this same act as \u201csexual coercion\u201d if the  act occurs after the victim is verbally pressured in a nonphysical way, for  example if the perpetrator uses their influence or authority.", "Based on our analysis, data collection efforts rarely use the same  terminology to describe sexual violence; however, when they do, there  are some differences in the particular acts of sexual violence and  contextual factors that they include in their measurements of those terms.  For example, 4 of the 6 data collection efforts that use the term \u201crape\u201d  consider whether actual physical force was used and the other two do  not. Three of the 6 that use the term \u201crape\u201d consider whether the threat of  physical force was used and the other 3 do not. See tables 8 through 10  in app. II for additional information on contextual factors included in  measurements of sexual violence by data collection effort.", "In general, measurements of sexual violence closely relate to definitions  of sexual violence in federal data collection efforts. For 5 of the data  collection efforts we reviewed, the acts of sexual violence and contextual  factors that are included in the measurements generally align with the  acts of sexual violence and contextual factors that are included in the  definitions.", "However, for the remaining 5 data collection efforts, some of the acts of  sexual violence or contextual factors are included in both their  measurements and definitions and others are not. Further, these data  collection efforts do not have publicly-available descriptions of what is  included in their respective measurements to allow persons using the  data to understand the differences. Specifically, Clery Act data include  attempted rapes in its measurement of rape, but do not include attempted  rapes in its definition of rape. NEISS-AIP includes acts of sexual violence  involving penetration of a victim with an object and acts of sexual violence  involving a victim being made to penetrate someone else with an object in  its measurement of assault-sexual, but does not explicitly include these  acts of sexual violence in its definition of assault-sexual or in the  description of assault-sexual in the NEISS-AIP coding manual.  Additionally, NCVS includes the contextual factors of \u201cvictim unable to  consent or refuse\u201d and \u201cvictim alcohol/drug facilitated\u201d in its  measurements of rape and sexual assault, but does not include these  contextual factors in its definitions of rape and sexual assault. Similarly,  SSV includes attempted nonconsensual sexual acts in its measurement  of nonconsensual sexual acts, but does not include attempts in its  definition of nonconsensual acts. NIS includes the act of victim  penetration with an object in its measurements of nonconsensual sexual  acts and staff sexual misconduct, but does not include it in its definitions  of nonconsensual sexual acts and staff sexual misconduct.", "The National Academy of Sciences\u2019 Principles and Practices for a Federal  Statistical Agency states that data releases from a statistical program  should include the methods and assumptions used for data collection and  reporting. Similarly, OMB guidelines regarding the federal Information  Quality Act call for agencies that disseminate government information to  ensure its utility, objectivity, and integrity, which refers to information  reproducibility and transparency. Additionally, federal internal control  standards state that an agency\u2019s information requirements should  consider the expectations of both internal and external users and that  reliable internal and external information sources should provide data that  faithfully represent what they purport to represent. Education officials  told us that they are updating The Handbook for Campus Safety and  Security Reporting and expect to issue the updated handbook in summer  2016. This may provide an opportunity for Education to eliminate  discrepancies between the Clery Act\u2019s sexual violence measurements  and definitions. Regarding NEISS-AIP, CDC officials told us that the  definition of \u201cassault-sexual\u201d is intended to include the range of sexual  assault experiences that victims presenting to the emergency department  may report. BJS officials told us that it is not possible to enumerate every  act of sexual violence that is included under NCVS\u2019s terms of sexual  violence and that data users can make their own determinations about  what acts of sexual violence are included in the measurements. BJS  officials also told us that the definitions included in the NIS and SSV  summary reports are intended for the general public, and acknowledged  that the reports present ambiguity regarding which acts of sexual violence  and contextual factors are included in the measurements. CDC and BJS  officials told us that researchers who are interested in descriptions of  what is included in the measurements for NEISS-AIP, NIS, and SSV  could access coding information, which is available at the University of  Michigan\u2019s National Archive of Criminal Justice Data of the Interuniversity  Consortium for Political and Social Research.

Of the 10 data collection efforts within our scope,  7 collect data primarily in a criminal justice context, and 2 collect data  primarily in a public health context, and 1 data collection effort combines  both contexts. Table 11 in app. II outlines which data collection efforts fall  into each category.", "According to agency officials, context can determine how each data  collection effort is designed and how the data are collected\u2014and context  may inform what is included in the measurements of sexual violence in  the data collection efforts. The data collection efforts of BJS and FBI  included in this report have a criminal justice focus, intended to collect  information on crimes, victims, or trends. CDC officials stated that their  data collection efforts\u2014NEISS-AIP and NISVS\u2014which both have a public  health focus, are more concerned with assessing the health impacts of  victimization and informing violence prevention efforts and are less  concerned with categorizing incidents as crimes. In some public health  surveys, interviewers begin by asking basic health and lifestyle questions  to establish a rapport with the interviewee and introduce the concepts of  public health and experiences rather than crimes and criminal events.  According to BJS and CDC officials, some studies with a focus on  criminal justice may ask questions about sexual violence as crimes that  have occurred, whereas some studies with a public health focus may ask  questions about violent sexual experiences by describing specific acts of  sexual violence while avoiding criminal terminology. For instance, NISVS  does not use the word rape when questioning interviewees, whereas  NCVS asks respondents if anyone has been attacked for example by  rape, attempted rape, or other type of sexual attack. NISVS program  documentation states that the term rape may carry a stigma or have  different meanings to different people, so the survey poses multiple  questions about behaviorally specific sexual acts, without using the term  rape."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data Sources", "paragraphs": ["Federal sexual violence data primarily come from two sources:  information reported to authorities and information obtained from victim  surveys. Some data collection efforts compile information reported to  relevant authorities. Other federal data collection efforts obtain their data  from surveys where agencies attempt to identify victims from a larger  population and invite them to share information about their experiences  with sexual violence. Table 12 in app. II outlines which data collections  fall into each category.", "Information reported to authorities may originate from situations in which  a victim or observer reports an alleged act of sexual violence to law  enforcement, campus, or prison authorities or to military officials. Data  collection efforts vary in how and to whom the information is submitted.  For DSAID, restricted and unrestricted reports of sexual violence are  reported by victims to sexual assault response coordinators or victim  advocates who input information on the incident into DSAID. Whereas for  Clery Act data, all institutions of higher education that receive federal  student financial aid are required to report campus security data  (including information on sexual violence) to the Department of  Education.", "Some data collection efforts obtain information on sexual violence  through surveys. Each survey uses different methods to collect data from  their subjects. For instance, NISVS employs a random digit dialing  telephone survey while the NCVS uses a mix of face-to-face and  telephone interviewing.", "Both types of data sources involve tradeoffs. With respect to information  reported to authorities, according to agency documentation and a senior  official from a law enforcement special interest group, data collection  efforts that provide information on crimes reported to authorities are  useful for administrative and funding decisions related to law  enforcement. For example, the Bureau of Justice Assistance uses UCR- SRS data, in part, to determine how much grant funding should be  awarded to state, local, and tribal governments through the Edward Byrne  Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program, which made $255.7 million  in funding available to states, territories, and localities in fiscal year 2015.  However, one limitation is that these data may underestimate the scope  of the problem, since acts of sexual violence are historically  underreported to authorities.", "As such, obtaining information through a survey may identify more  instances of sexual violence than efforts that rely on information reported  to authorities. However, surveys also have their limitations. Surveys are  subject to variable response rates over time, and different surveys may  have different response rates, which may affect the resulting estimates  and the validity of the data. For example, response rates of the data  collection efforts included in our review range from 24 percent for WGRA  in 2012 to 33 percent for NISVS in 2011 to 84 percent for NCVS in  2014. Survey results may also be subject to response biases, for  example the tendency for a respondent to provide untruthful but socially  acceptable responses or the tendency for individuals who either have or  have not experienced the action (e.g., sexual violence) to not participate  in the survey (which can lead to nonresponse bias). Also, according to  BJS officials, obtaining information directly from victims creates a burden  on survey respondents and interview subjects, and research and officials  from an entity that uses federal data on sexual violence stated that such  surveys may face difficulties in getting people to discuss victimization  experiences with strangers during interviews. Furthermore, administrative  costs associated with surveys and interviews can affect the practical  frequency of data collection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Units of Measurement", "paragraphs": ["Different federal data collection efforts measure and report different  aspects of the occurrence of sexual violence. Some data collection efforts  report the number of incidents that involved an act of sexual violence,  some report the number of unique victims of sexual violence, and some  report information about the number of times an act of sexual violence  occurred. On the surface it may appear that the number of incidents that  involve an act of sexual violence and the number of times an act of sexual  violence occurred are synonymous, but that is not necessarily the case.  Multiple offenses could occur in the same incident, and one incident could  involve multiple victims. For example, a perpetrator could both rob and  sexually assault someone in the same incident, or a perpetrator could  carry out sexually violent acts against multiple victims in the same  incident.", "Table 3 outlines the units of measurement that each data collection effort  reports.", "The 4 data collection efforts that report the number of times an act of  sexual violence occurred\u2014NCVS, NIS, UCR-SRS, and UCR-NIBRS\u2014 may not record the exact number of acts of sexual violence from each  individual incident in some cases. These data collection efforts count one  act of sexual violence per victim per incident, meaning they would capture  acts against multiple victims in a single incident but not multiple acts  against each individual victim.", "The data source each federal data collection effort uses is an important  determinant of the units of measurement that each study uses in reporting  its results. Data collection efforts that use information reported to  authorities generally measure the number of incidents or reports that  involve sexual violence. Those efforts may or may not publish a count of  the number of acts of sexual violence that occurred. Such efforts are  generally not set up to count the number of unique victims across  incidents; they may report a count of victims, but have no mechanism to  avoid the double-counting of victims who experience multiple incidents  and are thus not measuring the same quantity that surveys that seek to  report a number of unique victims measure. By contrast, data collection  efforts that use information obtained from victim surveys generally  measure and report the number of victims rather than the number of  incidents that involved sexual violence. These efforts also collect data on  the number of separate times each individual respondent has been a  victim of sexual violence. However, the agencies operating those studies  are cognizant of the challenges associated with asking respondents about  multiple incidents, particularly with respect to the respondent\u2019s ability to  accurately recall multiple experiences of sexual violence. For example, a  DOD official stated that WGRA asks questions about how many times a  crime has been committed against the respondent, but DOD does not  report a total number of times that an act of sexual violence occurred  because respondents\u2019 recall of multiple events may be subject to memory  biases and confirming details of each act may be overly burdensome in a  survey."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Time Frames", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies collect sexual violence data for different periods of time  and report the data at different frequencies.
