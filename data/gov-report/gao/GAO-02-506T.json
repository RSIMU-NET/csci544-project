Second, SPAWAR Systems Center needs to more carefully implement internal review and oversight activities, which have been ineffective. Third, GAO identified a significant impairment of management \"tone at the top\" at SPAWAR Systems Center during the last quarter of fiscal year 2001. The two basic internal controls over the purchase card program that GAO tested remained ineffective during the last quarter of fiscal year 2001 at both units.

As we previously reported, the Department of Defense  (DOD) has increased the use of purchase cards with the intention of  eliminating the bureaucracy and paperwork long associated with making  small purchases and intends to expand the use of purchase cards over the  next several years.", "However, the benefits of the purchase card may be substantially reduced if  controls are not in place to ensure its proper use.  As the comptroller  general testified on March 6, 2002, following the events of September 11,  reducing fraud, waste, and abuse is even more imperative to ensure that  DOD\u2019s resources are available to meet national priorities such as homeland  security and the war on terrorism.  We believe that DOD, with its long- standing problems in financial management, must take steps to ensure the  proper stewardship of the increasing amounts of taxpayer dollars devoted  to its vital missions.  Careful examination of the controls over the purchase  card program is one aspect of ensuring that DOD is getting the most from  every dollar.", "At this subcommittee\u2019s July 30, 2001, hearing, we testified on the results of  our audit of key internal controls over purchase card activity at two Navy  units based in San Diego\u2014the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command  (SPAWAR) Systems Center and the Navy Public Works Center (NPWC).   Overall, we found a significant breakdown in internal controls over  $68 million in fiscal year 2000 purchase card transactions, leaving these  two units vulnerable to fraudulent, improper, and abusive purchases and  theft and misuse of government property.  We also reported that weak  internal controls contributed to five recent cases of alleged purchase card  fraud related to Navy purchase card programs in the San Diego area and  investigated by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) and other  cases that we referred to our own Office of Special Investigations for  further review.", "Our July 2001 testimony was followed by a report in which we summarized  our findings and offered 29 recommendations for improving Navy purchase  card controls.

We  briefed officials from the Department of Defense Purchase Card Program  Management Office, Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP), assistant  secretaries of Navy for financial management (comptroller) and research  development and acquisition, SPAWAR Systems Center, and NPWC on the  details of our audit, including our objectives, scope, and methodology and  our findings and conclusions.  We referred instances of potentially  fraudulent transactions that we identified during our work to our Office of  Special Investigations for further investigation.  Our control tests were  based on stratified random probability samples of 50 SPAWAR Systems  Center purchase card transactions and 94 NPWC transactions.  We also  reviewed a nonrepresentative selection of transactions using data mining  intended to identify potentially fraudulent, improper, abusive, or otherwise  questionable transactions.  In total, we audited 161 SPAWAR Systems  Center and 145 NPWC fiscal year 2001 transactions.

However, the control environment at SPAWAR Systems  Center continued to have significant weaknesses, while NPWC had made  major strides towards a positive control environment. GAO\u2019s Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government (GAO/AIMD-00-21.3.1,  November 1999) state that, \u201cA positive control environment is the  foundation for all other standards.  It provides discipline and structure as  well as the climate which influences the quality of internal control.\u201d Our  previous work found that a weak internal control environment at SPAWAR  Systems Center and NPWC contributed to internal control weaknesses and  fraudulent, improper, and abusive or questionable activity.  In July 2001, we  testified that the specific factors that contributed to the lack of a positive  control environment at these two units included a proliferation of  cardholders, ineffective training of cardholders and certifying officers, and  a lack of monitoring and oversight.  The following sections provide an  update on the status of these conditions as well as information on several  additional factors that affected the overall control environment at these  Navy units."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Number of Cardholders Reduced but Significant Financial Exposure Continued", "paragraphs": ["Although both units have reduced the number of cardholders, balancing  the business needs of the unit with the training, monitoring, and oversight  needed for a substantial number of cardholders remains a key issue.  In  October 2001, NAVSUP issued an interim change to its existing purchase  card instructions to establish minimum criteria that prospective purchase  card holders must meet before a purchase card account (including  convenience check accounts) can be established in the employee\u2019s name.   The interim change issued by NAVSUP also established a maximum \u201cspan  of control\u201d of 5 to 7 cardholders to each approving official and required  that Navy activities establish local policies and procedures for approving  and issuing purchase cards to activity personnel.  The Navy\u2019s span of  control requirement reflects guidance issued by the Department of Defense  Purchase Card Program Management Office on July 5, 2001, shortly before  the Subcommittee hearing.  The revised guidance stated that, generally, an  approving official\u2019s span of control\u2014cardholders per approving official\u2014 should not exceed a ratio of 7 to 1.  Neither of the two units increased the  number of approving officials to meet the suggested ratio until well after  the start of fiscal year 2002.  Table 1 summarizes the progress made by both  units.", "The data in table 1 show that from September 21, 2000, to January 21, 2002,  SPAWAR Systems Center had a net reduction in the number of cardholders  of 360 (31 percent) and NPWC, 107 (37 percent).  In addition, in fiscal year  2002, SPAWAR Systems Center increased the number of approving officials  to 203 and NPWC, to 43.  As a result, the approving official ratio for  SPAWAR Systems Center and NPWC is now in line with DOD\u2019s criterion of  no more that 7 cardholders per official.  However, as of January 21, 2002,  SPAWAR Systems Center still had 23 approving officials who were  responsible for more than 7 cardholders and therefore did not comply with  the DOD and Navy span of control requirements.", "SPAWAR Systems Center records show that it significantly reduced the  number of cardholders, primarily through canceling cards of those that did  not need them and through employee attrition.  According to SPAWAR  Systems Center officials, some SPAWAR Systems Center purchase cards  were canceled because of misuse; however, we were unable to determine  from SPAWAR Systems Center records how many of the cards were  canceled for this reason.  We previously reported that SPAWAR Systems  Center had a significant span-of-control issue with one approving official  responsible for certifying monthly purchase card statements for all of its  cardholders.  According to Citibank and SPAWAR Systems Center records,  effective for the billing period ending January 21, 2002, SPAWAR Systems  Center increased from 1 to 203 the number of approving officials  responsible for certifying monthly summary invoices.  This change reduced  SPAWAR Systems Center\u2019s average span of control to 4 cardholders to each  approving official, which is in line with DOD and Navy guidelines.  We did  not perform any testing for fiscal year 2002 transactions to determine  whether the approving officials were in place and performing effective  reviews.  SPAWAR Systems Center management told us that they are  continuing to evaluate the number of cardholders and the impact any  further cuts would have on management\u2019s ability to support operations and  keep employees working efficiently.", "NPWC reduced the number of its cardholders through employee attrition  and by canceling the cards of individuals who no longer needed them, had  not taken required training, or had misused the card.  Specifically, on July 6,  2001, the agency program coordinator (APC) gave each business line  manager an analysis of monthly purchase card usage data for each of the  cardholders under his or her supervision.  The business line managers were  instructed to analyze cardholder monthly transaction volume and reduce  the number of cardholders by eliminating those cardholders they believed  no longer needed a purchase card.  NPWC also recently increased its  number of approving officials from 7 as of September 21, 2001, to 43 by  January 21, 2002.  This significant increase brought the ratio of cardholders  to approving officials in line with DOD and Navy guidelines.", "Another key factor in minimizing the government\u2019s financial exposure is  assessing the monthly credit limits available to cardholders.  The  undersecretary of defense for acquisition and technology emphasized in an  August 2001 memorandum to the directors of all defense agencies, among  others, that not every cardholder needs to have the maximum transaction  or monthly limit and that supervisors should set reasonable limits based on  what each person needs to buy as part of his or her job.  We concur with the  undersecretary\u2019s statements and continue to recommend that cardholder  spending authority be limited as a way of minimizing the federal  government\u2019s financial exposure.", "As shown in table 2, total financial exposure, as evidenced by monthly  credit limits for  SPAWAR Systems Center and NPWC cardholders, has  decreased substantially.", "SPAWAR Systems Center reduced the overall credit limits of it cardholders  by about $29 million primarily by (1) eliminating nearly $10 million of credit  assigned to each of two cardholders and (2) reducing the net number of  cardholders by 360.  As we previously reported, most SPAWAR Systems  Center cardholders had a $25,000 credit limit, and no cardholder had a  credit limit of less than $25,000.  We continue to believe that a $25,000  minimum credit limit is more than most SPAWAR Systems Center  cardholders need to perform their mission.  This point is best demonstrated  by the fact that even when we used SPAWAR Systems Center\u2019s reduced  number of cardholders, the average monthly purchase card bill in fiscal  year 2001 would have been less than $5,000.", "As shown in table 2, Citibank\u2019s records indicate that between  September 21, 2000, and January 21, 2002, NPWC reduced its cardholder  exposure from about $13.5 million to $12.1 million\u2014a $1.4 million  reduction.  NPWC achieved this reduction primarily by reducing by 107 the  number of individuals who had purchase cards and by reevaluating  cardholders\u2019 monthly credit limits.  We previously reported that most  NPWC cardholders were granted a monthly credit limit of $20,000.   Currently, about 20 NPWC cardholders have a credit limit of less than  $20,000, about 42 percent still have a $20,000 credit limit, and the remaining  cardholders have higher credit limits to meet job needs.  Further, the  average monthly purchase card bill (using the reduced number of  cardholders) in fiscal year 2001 for NPWC cardholders would have been  about $11,500.  On September 7, 2001, the NPWC agency program  coordinator distributed spreadsheet analyses of individual cardholder  actual monthly and average charges, along with suggested new monthly  cardholder limits, to the respective cardholder\u2019s business line managers.   The agency program coordinator required the business line managers to  respond to the agency program coordinator with new limits for cardholders  by the close of business on September 21, 2001.  At the exit meeting we  held with NPWC officials, NPWC provided Citibank records documenting  that NPWC further reduced its cardholder credit limits to $5.6 million in  February 2002.", "In addition to the reductions in the number of cardholders and aggregate  financial exposure, the dollar volume of transactions decreased  significantly in fiscal year 2001 when compared to fiscal year 2000, as  shown in table 3.", "The NPWC agency program coordinator attributed a portion of this  decrease to increased controls over the use of purchase cards, resulting in  a reduction in unnecessary and improper card usage.  Other reasons were a  reduction in the number of projects worked on during fiscal year 2001 and  the use of more contracts for goods and services, which are paid by means  other than the purchase card.  The SPAWAR Systems Center senior military  contracting official told us that SPAWAR Systems Center\u2019s reduction in  purchase card use is a result of a decrease in workload and an increase in  concern over purchase card controls brought on as a result of our audit and  the congressional hearing."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Training of Cardholders", "paragraphs": ["While both SPAWAR Systems Center and NPWC have taken steps to  implement our recommendations regarding cardholder training and proper  documentation of training, SPAWAR Systems Center still needs to do more  to make sure all cardholders receive required training and to document the  training taken by cardholders.   We previously reported that the lack of  documented evidence of purchase card training contributed to a weak  internal control environment at these two units.  GAO\u2019s internal control  standards emphasize that effective management of an organization\u2019s  workforce\u2014its human capital\u2014is essential to achieving results and is an  important part of internal control.  Training is key to ensuring that the  workforce has the skills necessary to achieve organizational goals.  In  accordance with NAVSUP Instruction 4200.94, all cardholders and  approving officials must receive purchase card training.  Specifically,  NAVSUP 4200.94 requires that prior to the issuance of a purchase card, all  prospective cardholders and approving officials must receive training  regarding both Navy policies and procedures as well as local internal  operating procedures.  Once initial training is received, the Instruction  requires all cardholders to receive refresher training every 2 years.  Further,  in response to our previous audit and the July 30, 2001, hearing, NAVSUP  sent a message in August 2001 to all Navy units directing them to train all of  their cardholders concerning the proper use of the purchase cards on or  about September 12, 2001.", "SPAWAR Systems Center training records indicated that as of January 21,  2002, 146 cardholders either had not completed the NAVSUP-mandated  training or had not produced a certificate evidencing completion of the  training.  In addition, 13 active cardholders had not satisfied the  requirement to take refresher training every 2 years.   SPAWAR Systems  Center officials told us that they intended to suspend the accounts of  cardholders who had not taken the required training; however, as of  February 15, 2002, the accounts of only 5 cardholders had been suspended.", "NPWC has taken well-documented steps to provide cardholders and  approving officials the necessary training and to assure itself that untrained  personnel do not remain purchase card holders.  As a result of our previous  audit findings in this area, NPWC held mandatory cardholder training  sessions in June 2001 and July 2001, which all cardholders and their  supervisors attended.  In addition, NPWC presented NAVSUP-prepared  training for all cardholders and approving officials in September 2001.  The  mandatory NAVSUP training addressed the issues of receipt and  acceptance, spending limits, accounting, unauthorized or personal use of  the card, policies and procedures, improper transactions, NPWC internal  procedures, other required training, the NAVSUP and Citibank Web sites,  and our findings from the previous purchase card testimony and related  report.  All but 15 of NPWC\u2019s cardholders and approving officials attended  the mandatory NAVSUP training, and on October 26, 2001, NPWC canceled  the 15 remaining cardholder accounts for noncompliance with the training  requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Monitoring and Oversight", "paragraphs": ["Both SPAWAR Systems Center and NPWC have recently made some efforts  to implement new policies directed at improving internal review and  oversight activities, which, as we previously testified, were ineffective.  We  also testified that the Navy\u2019s purchase card policies and procedures did not  require that the results of internal reviews be documented or that  corrective actions be monitored to help ensure that they are effectively  implemented. While still relatively ineffective, this area has great potential  to strengthen the control environment at these two Navy units.", "We also previously testified that, although the SPAWAR Headquarters  Command inspector general (IG) reviewed purchase card transactions  generated by Headquarter cardholders during fiscal year 2000 and prepared  a draft report summarizing the results of this review, the final report had  not been issued at the conclusion of our fieldwork for the July 30, 2001,  testimony.  The final report of this review was issued on July 19, 2001, and  identified many of the internal control findings discussed in our prior  review; however, the IG\u2019s report did not identify the kind of abusive  transactions we identified.  Also, on August 13, 2001, the Command IG  began a limited review of the 2 most recent months of purchase card  activity for Headquarters cardholders.  The summary findings, which were  released in a report dated October 16, 2001, have many of the internal  control findings discussed later in this statement and similarly point to the  need for clear, comprehensive policies, procedures, and training to resolve  many of the control weaknesses and instances of questionable  transactions.  The IG also reported that it found some \u201ctransactions that  appeared to be either \u2018excessive\u2019 or may have been of questionable good  judgment,\u201d but did not provide examples of these potentially abusive  transactions.  The IG also reported that several cardholders had stated that  they felt uncomfortable making purchases, but did not want to tell their  supervisor \u201cno\u201d and suffer potentially adverse career consequences.", "At the July 30, 2001, hearing we reported that the Naval Audit Service had  conducted an audit of the NPWC purchase card program for which a report  had not been issued.  The Naval Audit Service completed its audit in  December 2000 and reviewed transactions primarily occurring from March  1999 through August 2000.  The Naval Audit Service issued its report over  1 year later, on January 10, 2002.  Some of the Naval Audit Service findings  are of the same nature and significance as the findings reported in our  previous testimony, although the Naval Audit Service report did not identify  the improper or abusive transactions we discussed.  The Naval Audit  Service concluded that management of the purchase card program at  NPWC was not sufficient to ensure the integrity of the command\u2019s purchase  card program and that NPWC\u2019s internal operating procedures did not  clearly define duties and responsibilities or adequately control the various  processes involved in purchase card transactions.  Further, the Naval Audit  Service reported that maintenance and repair services were obtained on a  \u201cpiece-meal\u201d basis instead of being aggregated and performed as entire  projects, which resulted in NPWC not taking advantage of its buying power  to obtain discounts on its recurring purchases.", "Further, in August 2001, following the July 30, 2001, purchase card  congressional hearing, NAVSUP directed all Navy units to review 12  months of purchase card transactions.   In response to this requirement,  both SPAWAR Systems Center and NPWC reviewed samples of  transactions, although neither performed an in-depth analysis of the  selected transactions.  For example, SPAWAR Systems Center told us that it  reviewed 16,393 of the 45,318 transactions for the 9-month period ended  July 2001.  According to SPAWAR Systems Center, its stand-down review  identified 187 split purchases and 9 transactions that initially appeared  questionable or suspicious.   After completing their review, SPAWAR  Systems Center officials concluded that only one of these nine transactions  was not for a legitimate government purpose, because the cardholder in  question accidentally used the purchase card instead of a personal credit  card.  However, we question whether the stand-down review was designed  and performed to be a thorough and critical analysis of the nature and  magnitude of the control weaknesses and the extent to which fraudulent,  improper, or abusive transactions were occurring during the 9-month  period reviewed.  Our own statistical sample of 50 transactions from just  the last 3 billing cycles of fiscal year 2001 found one potentially fraudulent  and subsequently disputed purchase and a total of 11 abusive or improper  transactions on the monthly statements for 9 cardholders.  Furthermore, as  detailed later, we found numerous examples of abusive and improper  transactions occurring in the first nine billing cycles of fiscal year 2001.", "NPWC\u2019s stand-down review subjected 9,099 transactions out of 50,850 for  the 12-month period ended August 31, 2001, to a documentation review.   The review identified several cases of potential improper use and 320 cases  of potential split purchases.  However, the primary finding related to the  use of the card for prohibited acquisitions of \u201cnoncommonly used\u201d  hazardous materials.  NPWC estimated that approximately 600 of the  transactions reviewed violated the Navy\u2019s prohibition against using the  purchase card to acquire noncommonly used hazardous materials.   Specifically, Navy purchase card policies and procedures require that prior  to acquiring potentially hazardous materials, cardholders must first  determine that a requested purchase meets the definition of a commonly  used hazardous material and that the materials are carried on the unit\u2019s  Authorized Use List.  If the requested purchase does not meet the  \u201ccommonly used\u201d definition, the hazardous materials are to be procured by  other means that bring the hazardous material under the control of a  Hazardous Substance Management System (HSMS).  Compliance with  these requirements would then help ensure the safe storage, use, and  disposal of the hazardous materials.", "NPWC found that cardholders were using the purchase card to acquire  noncommonly used hazardous materials such as bacterial control agents  and toxic, corrosive solvents used to descale and deodorize sewage  systems.  Such hazardous material purchases were not being subjected to  the required controls and, consequently, NPWC had no assurance that the  approximately 600 reported purchases were stored, used, and disposed of  in a safe and environmentally acceptable manner.  To alleviate this  problem, NPWC is working with the Fleet Industrial Supply Service to  coordinate the maintenance and control of Navy hazardous materials.   NPWC\u2019s identification and proactive attitude towards resolving this matter  again demonstrate a positive control environment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Management \u201cTone at the Top\u201d Was Significantly Impaired at SPAWAR Systems Center", "paragraphs": ["GAO\u2019s internal control standards state that management plays a key role  in demonstrating and maintaining an organization\u2019s integrity and ethical  values, \u201cespecially in setting and maintaining the organization\u2019s ethical  tone, providing guidance for proper behavior, removing temptations for  unethical behavior, and providing discipline when appropriate.\u201d  At the  time we began our follow-up review, the SPAWAR Systems Center  commanding officer not only did not demonstrate a commitment to  improving management controls but openly supported the status quo.   Consequently, the lack of a positive control environment continued.  In  contrast, the commanding officer at NPWC continued to support a  proactive attitude in addressing the weaknesses we identified and took  immediate action to address any improper or prohibited uses of the  purchase card.  It is not surprising that, given these differences in the  management tone at the two units, we continued to find numerous  examples of potentially improper, abusive, and otherwise questionable use  of the purchase card at SPAWAR Systems Center, while we found few such  cases at NPWC.", "The former SPAWAR Systems Center commanding officer testified on  July 30, 2001, that the purchase card program at SPAWAR Systems Center  had effective management controls and an honest and trustworthy  workforce.  The commanding officer went on to incorrectly characterize  our audit approach and findings by stating that there was not a pervasive  and serious abuse and fraud problem at SPAWAR Systems Center and that  over 99.98 percent of purchases made by cardholders were for legitimate  government purposes.  The commanding officer did not acknowledge that  the serious weaknesses in SPAWAR Systems Center\u2019s system of internal  controls over the purchase card program left SPAWAR Systems Center  vulnerable to the types of abusive and improper transactions that we found  and that such abuses could occur without being detected.", "Upon his return to San Diego following the hearing, the commanding  officer held an \u201call-hands\u201d meeting at a SPAWAR Systems Center  auditorium that cardholders, approving officials, and managers were  particularly encouraged to attend \u201c\u2026 to clarify the substantial differences  between the perception of problems reported in the press and the reality of  the situation.\u201d  At the meeting, the commanding officer showed a videotape  of the entire congressional hearing.  By denying that these weaknesses  resulted in undetected misuse of purchase cards, the commanding officer  effectively diminished the likelihood that substantive changes would be  implemented or, if implemented, taken seriously.  The underlying message  of his testimony, his subsequent \u201call hands\u201d meeting, and his meetings with  us, was that the trust SPAWAR Systems Center management had in its staff  was an acceptable substitute for a cost-effective system of internal  controls.", "The commanding officer was relieved of duty in December 2001 for matters  unrelated to the purchase card program.  The admiral in charge of SPAWAR  held a nonjudicial punishment hearing on December 8, 2001, and found that  the commanding officer had violated two articles of the Uniform Code of  Military Justice, including dereliction of duty and conduct unbecoming an  officer.  The admiral issued the commanding officer a Punitive Letter of  Reprimand, relieved him of his command at SPAWAR Systems Center, and  endorsed his request for retirement from the Navy.", "The new commanding officer at SPAWAR Systems Center now has an  opportunity to set a \u201ctone at the top\u201d that reflects a true commitment to  establishing a positive control environment.  Based on our discussions with  the commanding officer and some of the actions we have observed, we are  encouraged by her commitment to ensure that an effective, well-controlled  purchase card program is implemented at SPAWAR Systems Center.  At the  same time, we remain concerned that there will be significant cultural  resistance to change in the internal control environment.  For example, up  to the time we completed our fieldwork in February 2002, some  cardholders and managers continued to rationalize the questionable  purchases we brought to their attention\u2014including expensive laptop  carrying cases, Lego robot kits, clothing, food, and designer day planners\u2014 as discussed later in this statement.

As shown in table  4, the specific controls that we tested were (1) independent, documented  receipt and acceptance of goods and services and (2) independent,  documented review and certification of monthly purchase card statements.", "In addition, we attempted to test whether the accountable items\u2014easily  pilferable or sensitive items\u2014included in some of the transactions in our  samples were recorded in the units\u2019 property records to help prevent theft,  loss, and misuse of government assets.

We previously reported a 65 percent  control failure rate for fiscal year 2000.", "NPWC improved its adherence to the internal control of documenting  independent receipt and acceptance of items acquired with a purchase  card, although its 16 percent failure rate in this control technique remained  unacceptable.  We previously testified that NPWC generally did not have  documented independent receipt and acceptance for goods and services  and reported a 47 percent control failure rate for fiscal year 2000.

We previously reported that SPAWAR Systems Center and NPWC  approving officials who certify the monthly purchase card statements for  payment generally rely upon the silence of a cardholder to assume that all  purchase card transactions listed on the monthly statements are valid  government purchases.  However, this process does not compensate for the  fact that a cardholder might have failed to forward corrections or  exceptions to the account statement in a timely manner or, even worse,  may not have reviewed the statement.  As a result of the breakdown of this  control, for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001, SPAWAR Systems Center  and NPWC were paying the monthly credit card bills without any  independent review of the monthly cardholder statements prior to payment  to verify that the purchases were for a valid, necessary government need.", "Under 31 U.S.C. 3325 and DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation,  disbursements are required to be made on the basis of a voucher certified  by an authorized agency official.  The certifying official is responsible for  ensuring (1) the adequacy of supporting documentation, (2) the accuracy  of payment calculations, and (3) the legality of the proposed payment  under the appropriation or fund charged.  The certification function is a  preventive control that requires and provides the incentive for certifying  officers to maintain proper controls over public funds.  It also helps detect  fraudulent and improper payments, including unsupported or prohibited  transactions, split purchases, and duplicate payments.  Further, section 933  of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 requires the  Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations that ensure, among other  things, that each purchase card holder and approving official is responsible  for reconciling charges on a billing statement with receipts and other  supporting documentation before certification of the monthly bill.", "We previously reported that NAVSUP policy is inconsistent with the  purpose of certifying vouchers prior to payment and made  recommendations to revise the policy appropriately.  Navy agreed with our  recommendations concerning the need to change this portion of the  purchase card instruction.", "For the last quarter of fiscal year 2001, SPAWAR Systems Center continued  to have only one approving official to certify for payment the monthly  purchase card statements of almost 1,000 cardholders.  This unacceptable  span of control led us to conclude that all transactions selected as part of  our statistical sample were not properly reviewed and approved by a  certifying officer.  NPWC also continued to inappropriately certify  purchase card statements for payment before receiving cardholder  assurance that the purchases were proper.  Our review of purchase card  transactions disclosed that no significant change in this process had taken  place during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001, and we therefore  identified a 100 percent failure rate for this control at SPAWAR Systems  Center and NPWC.", "However, in keeping with its proactive attitude, instead of waiting for  NAVSUP to issue its new purchase card payment certification procedures,  the NPWC agency program coordinator issued local guidance in December  2001 that requires approving officials, prior to certifying their summary  invoice for payment, to obtain notifications from cardholders that their  statements do not include disputed items.  The guidance also indicates that  approving officials and cardholders should conduct ongoing reviews during  the month of the transactions in their purchase card accounts using  Citidirect online services.  While this does not fully implement the  recommendation that we made in our November 30, 2001 report, this is a  positive interim step.

We previously testified that most of  the accountable items\u2014easily pilferable or sensitive items\u2014in our samples  for fiscal year 2000 were not recorded in property records.", "On August 1, 2001, the Department of the Navy changed its definition for  what constitutes pilferable property.  Unlike the previous policy, which was  prescriptive in identifying what was pilferable, the new policy provides  commanding officers with latitude in determining what is and what is not  pilferable.  Specifically, the new policy defines pilferable to be an item\u2014 regardless of cost\u2014that is portable, can be easily converted to personal  use, is critical to the activity\u2019s business/mission, and is hard to repair or  replace.  Citing the \u201chard to repair or replace\u201d criteria in the new policy, on  November 1, 2001, SPAWAR Systems Center determined that only  computer systems and notebook/laptop computers would be considered  pilferable items.  Thus, based on our fiscal year 2000 and 2001 audit work,  SPAWAR Systems Center did not maintain accountability over numerous  sensitive and pilferable items, such as digital cameras and personal digital  assistants (PDA), leaving them subject to possible theft, misuse, or transfer  to personal use.", "SPAWAR Systems Center\u2019s new commanding officer and executive director  told us that they do not believe that it is cost beneficial to account for and  track these assets, but instead rely on supervisory oversight and personal  employee trust to provide the necessary accountability of these assets.  The  commanding officer and the executive director stated that SPAWAR  Systems Center is a diversified organization in which its scientists and  engineers are working on as many as 1,000 different projects at any one  time, which would make it difficult to keep track of these lower cost items.   We acknowledge the important mission that SPAWAR Systems Center  serves, but we also believe that the diverse nature of its operations is one of  the key reasons why SPAWAR Systems Center needs to maintain  accountability of its pilferable items.  As discussed later in this testimony,  we believe that SPAWAR Systems Center\u2019s lack of accountability over items  that are pilferable contributed to several abusive and questionable  purchases.", "Although NPWC also had the opportunity to redefine what constitutes  pilferable property, NPWC did not institute a similar policy change.

Once effectively implemented, the ERP system would facilitate on-line  review, reconciliation, and monitoring of credit card activity.  The system  would also result in reduced storage needs because ERP requires receipt  and acceptance documentation to be scanned into a database storage  container. However, our limited assessment of the control environment  identified several weaknesses. Although the new system has the stated  capability to address the weaknesses we identified in the purchase card  program, until it is effectively implemented and individuals comply with  purchase card policies and procedures, SPAWAR Systems Center has little  assurance that the weaknesses we previously identified will be corrected  or mitigated.", "For example, the implementation of the ERP system at the time of our  review did not provide for an adequate separation of duties or proper  certification of purchase card transactions for payment.  Specifically, a  systems administrator with high-level administrative access privileges on  the system performed both cardholder and approving official duties. In  addition, the administrator pushed transactions through the system as an  approving official without the required cardholder reconciliation or any  knowledge of the transactions. Further, the administrator, who performed  approving official duties, did not review the transactions to determine if  they complied with Navy policies and procedures.  That responsibility  remained with the existing approving official; however, as we previously  testified about the manual process, we found no evidence that the  approving official verified compliance. SPAWAR Systems Center officials  stated that by the end of February 2002, the administrator should no longer  have these duties because all of the newly designated approving officials  will have completed the required ERP training.  We have not verified this  corrective action or whether the approving officials are properly  performing their duties.", "In assessing the control environment, we attempted, but were unable, to  obtain documentation such as (1) the DOD Information Technology  Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP) for the  system and (2) formal procedures on granting and removing access to the  ERP.  First, SPAWAR Systems Center officials stated that the certification  and accreditation for the ERP system was not complete and that it was  currently operating under interim authority. The DITSCAP would give an  indication as to whether SPAWAR Systems Center had established its  information security requirements and whether the system implementation  meets the established security requirements.

In fact, most of the  transactions that we identified as improper, abusive, or questionable at  SPAWAR Systems Center were approved and represented to us as being an  appropriate, proper use of the purchase card.  In contrast, using the same  data mining techniques at NPWC, the number and severity of the problems  we identified were substantially less than at SPAWAR Systems Center.  In  addition, rather than dispute our findings on each transaction, NPWC  showed a proactive response and not only concurred with our findings but  immediately took action to prevent future improper or abusive transactions  from occurring.

Other cases involved vendors  charging Navy purchase cards for unauthorized transactions.", "Both SPAWAR Systems Center and NPWC had policies and procedures that  were designed to prevent the payment of fraudulent purchases; however,  our tests showed that although both units made some improvements,  particularly NPWC, they did not implement the controls as intended.  For  example, as discussed previously, controls were ineffective for  independent verification of receipt and acceptance and proper review and  certification of monthly statements prior to payment.  Fraudulent activities  must therefore be detected after the fact, during supervisor or internal  reviews, and disputed charge procedures must be initiated to obtain a  credit from Citibank.  Table 5 shows examples of potentially fraudulent  transactions that we identified at SPAWAR Systems Center.  Using the same  audit techniques, we did not find documented evidence of potentially  fraudulent NPWC transactions for fiscal year 2001.  However, as noted  previously, our tests were not designed to identify all fraudulent  transactions, and considering the control weaknesses identified at  SPAWAR Systems Center and NPWC, and the substantial number of  compromised accounts discussed later, fraudulent transactions may have  occurred during fiscal year 2001 and not have been detected.", "The fact that all of the unauthorized transactions in table 5 were authorized  for payment by SPAWAR Systems Center clearly demonstrates the lack of  an effective review and monthly certification process.  SPAWAR Systems  Center officials told us that they were aware of all of these potentially  fraudulent transactions and eventually received a credit from either the  vendor or Citibank or reimbursement from the cardholder, but in some  cases after many months.  For example, the car rental transaction related  to a SPAWAR Systems Center employee who stated that she had  inadvertently used the purchase card rather than a personal credit card.   However, it took the employee 5 months to reimburse the government for  this personal and unauthorized charge.  Three of the examples in table 5  relate to the 2,595 Navy purchase card compromised accounts discussed  below.  The card numbers used to make the internet purchases were not on  the list of compromised accounts.  These cardholders reported to Citibank  that the transactions were unauthorized, and Citibank provided credits to  their accounts for disputed amounts up to three months after SPAWAR  Systems Center paid the bill.  The $10,600 of potentially fraudulent charges  represent numerous unauthorized charges, many of which were about $500  each, during fiscal year 2001 by a safety product vendor that SPAWAR  Systems Center paid despite the fact that no goods were received.  As of  January 21, 2002, SPAWAR Systems Center had not received a credit from  the bank or the vendor for about $3,100 of the unauthorized charges.", "In our July 2001 testimony, we identified about $12,000 in potentially  fraudulent fiscal year 2000 transactions on the purchase card of a former  NPWC employee.

After leaving  work on her last day at NPWC, the cardholder improperly used the  NPWC purchase card\u2014which should have been canceled\u2014for a  personal automobile rental that was initially paid by NPWC and  subsequently reversed through a credit from Citibank.  The cardholder  was supposed to, but has not yet, repaid Citibank the $358 owed.", "The cardholder also misused a government travel card by purchasing  three airline tickets for personal use.  The cardholder partially repaid  the cost of the tickets but had a remaining balance of $379.

The individual who approved the payment to Citibank  for these fraudulent charges told us that he signed off on the January 2000  statement without reviewing it to determine if the transactions were valid.   It is unclear whether the credit NPWC ultimately received was the result of  the Citibank investigation of the case or NPWC\u2019s determining some time  after payment of the bill that the charges were fraudulent.  NPWC also did  not properly cancel the purchase card account of this cardholder after the  cardholder had moved on to another organization within the Navy.  Further,  NPWC paid the purchase card bill that included this cardholder\u2019s personal  automobile rental, a clear indication that the monthly review and  certification of bills was not being done.

We recommended that the Navy act immediately to cancel all known active  compromised accounts.  In December 2001, Navy notified us that all 681  compromised accounts we identified in the July testimony were cancelled,  including 22 active SPAWAR Systems Center accounts.  However, no other  action was taken by the Navy to identify or cancel the remaining nearly  2,000 accounts that were compromised in September 1999.  Our  investigators subsequently identified the source of the compromised  accounts as the database of a Navy vendor, which provided NCIS with the  names of its former employees who were possible suspects in the theft of  data.  In January 2002, the vendor provided our investigators with the entire  list of the 2,595 compromised accounts.  We provided this list to the Navy  and recommended that it immediately cancel the remaining 1,914  compromised account numbers.  We found that 78 SPAWAR Systems  Center and 10 NPWC compromised accounts were active as of December  2001.  As noted previously, 3 of the examples of potentially fraudulent  SPAWAR Systems Center activity reported in table 5 involved these  compromised accounts.", "As we reported in our previous testimony, as of January 2001, at least 30 of  the nearly 2,600 compromised account numbers were used by 27 alleged  suspects to make more than $27,000 in fraudulent transactions for pizza,  jewelry, phone calls, tires, and flowers.  However, with the lack of effective  controls over independent receipt for goods and services and proper  review and certification of purchase card statements for payment that we  identified at the two units, it will be difficult, if not impossible, for the  Navy\u2014including SPAWAR Systems Center and NPWC\u2014to identify  fraudulent purchases as they occur, or to determine the extent of the  fraudulent use of compromised accounts.  On December 11, 2001, the NCIS  case on the compromised Navy purchase card numbers was presented to  the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Southern District of California, San Diego, for  prosecution.  The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office declined prosecution of the case  due to the low known dollar loss of $28,734.

However, adequate monitoring of purchase card  transactions, along with the enforcement of controls\u2014such as  documentation of independent confirmation of receipt and acceptance  and recording of accountable items in property records\u2014will make  detection easier.  In this case, the cardholder allegedly made fraudulent  purchase card acquisitions during the period of April 1999 through  December 1999 to obtain electronic planners, leather organizers, a  digital camera, a scanner/printer, and various cellular telephone  accessories for himself and his supervisor.  These items totaled more  than $2,500.  NPWC initiated administrative action and gave a notice of  proposed removal to the cardholder on August 15, 2000, and to the  supervisor on August 1, 2000.

As shown in table 6, we found examples of purchases  that were not authorized by law, regulation, or policy.", "Food.  We found a number of purchases of food at SPAWAR Headquarters,  SPAWAR Systems Center and NPWC that represent an improper use of  federal funds.  Without statutory authority, appropriated funds may not be  used to furnish meals or refreshments to employees within their normal  duty stations.  Free food and other refreshments normally cannot be  justified as a necessary expense of an agency\u2019s appropriation because these  items are considered personal expenses that federal employees should pay  for from their own salaries.  In January 2000, the General Services  Administration (GSA) amended the government travel regulations to  permit agencies to provide light refreshments to employees attending  conferences involving travel.  In response to GSA\u2019s action, DOD amended  the Joint Travel Regulation (JTR) and Joint Federal Travel Regulation  (JFTR) to permit similar light refreshments for DOD civilian employees and  military members.  In April 2001, DOD clarified the JTR/JFTR rule to permit  light refreshments only when a majority of the attendees (51 percent or  more) are in travel status.  The following food purchases should not have  been paid for with appropriated funds.", "Three instances in which NPWC purchased primarily meals and light  refreshments for employee-related activities, including team meetings,  at a cost of about $4,100.  The supporting documentation we were  provided initially by NPWC showed these purchases to be the rental of  rooms for meetings.  However, after our further inquiry of the Admiral  Kidd Catering Center we found that a large portion of the purchases  were related to food and refreshments including luncheon buffets.   Officials from the Admiral Kidd Catering Center indicated that the  invoices for these events do not show the food purchases because they  knew that the Navy is not allowed to pay for food at these conferences.", "Five instances in which SPAWAR Headquarters or Systems Center  cardholders purchased primarily light refreshments for employee team  meetings or training sessions when less than a majority of the attendees  were on travel, at a total cost of about $1,000.", "One transaction in which a SPAWAR Headquarters program  management office had a 2-day off-site meeting at a San Diego hotel for  about 20 staff, and SPAWAR Headquarters provided all participants with  lunch and refreshments.  The cardholder provided us with  documentation indicating that SPAWAR Headquarters spent $2,400 to  rent a room at the hotel where the meeting was held.  The assistant  program manager told us that the $2,400 charge was just for the meeting  room rental.  However, we obtained documents directly from the hotel,  which were signed by the assistant program manager, that prove that  SPAWAR Headquarters paid about $1,400 for lunch and refreshments for  both days.  Furthermore, by comparing the hotel\u2019s copy of the event  confirmation form with the copy of the same form provided by SPAWAR  Headquarters, it appeared that the form had been altered to indicate that  the $2,400 was only for rent.  After briefing SPAWAR Headquarters and  System Center management of our findings, the SPAWAR Headquarters  inspector general opened an investigation of this matter that is still  ongoing.", "Clothing.  We identified several purchases of clothing by SPAWAR Systems  Center employees that should not have been purchased with appropriated  funds. According to 5 U.S.C. 7903, agencies are authorized to purchase  protective clothing for employee use if the agency can show that (1) the  item is special and not part of the ordinary furnishings that an employee is  expected to supply, (2) the item is essential for the safe and successful  accomplishment of the agency\u2019s mission, not solely for the employee\u2019s  protection, and (3) the employee is engaged in hazardous duty.  Further,  according to a comptroller general decision dated March 6, 1984, clothing  purchased pursuant to this statute is property of the U.S. government and  must only be used for official government business.  Thus, except for rare  circumstances in which a clothing purchase meets stringent requirements,  it is usually considered a personal item that should be purchased by the  individual.", "For the transactions that we tested, we found that several SPAWAR  Systems Center employees had purchased clothing, such as a lightweight  hooded jacket, long pants, and a shirt that should have been purchased by  the employees with their own money.  One of the cardholders told us that  he believed his purchases of clothing were appropriate because other  SPAWAR Systems Center employees were also purchasing clothing.  As a  result of this statement, we expanded our analysis and found that during  fiscal year 2001 SPAWAR Systems Center cardholders purchased about  $4,400 worth of socks, gloves, parkas, jackets, hats, shirts, and sweatpants  from REI and Cabela\u2019s that appear to also be improper.  Because we did not  test each of these transactions to determine if they were adequately  justified, we included the $4,400 as questionable clothing purchases in table  8.", "Luxury car rentals.  We identified 34 fiscal year 2001 purchases totaling  $7,028 in which NPWC could not support the representation that rentals of  Lincoln Town Cars or similar luxury cars were for individuals authorized to  obtain a luxury car.  DOD policy provides that only four-star admirals and  above (or equivalent) qualify to rent such luxury vehicles.  Our analysis of  NPWC\u2019s fiscal year 2001 purchase card transactions for rentals of  commercial vehicles disclosed 42 instances of rentals of luxury vehicles  (e.g., Lincoln Town Cars and Cadillac DeVilles).  NPWC cardholder  documentation showed that only 8 of the 42 rentals were for four-star  admirals.  In the other 34 instances, cardholder documentation either  disclosed that a rental of a Lincoln Town Car or similar vehicle was for a  Navy captain or lower-ranking admiral, or the documentation was  insufficient to determine who rented the automobile.  As a result of its  inappropriately renting the Lincolns and other luxury cars, we estimated  that NPWC spent about $2,000 more than it would have if NPWC had rented  an automobile that was consistent with DOD policy.  Consistent with  NPWC\u2019s proactive approach, the day after we brought this issue to  management\u2019s attention, controls and procedures were put in place to  resolve this issue.  Because these purchases were at an excessive cost, they  also fall under the definition of abusive transactions.", "Prepayment of goods and services.  We also identified 75 SPAWAR Systems  Center purchase card transactions, for about $164,000 with a  telecommunications contractor, that appear to be advance payments for  electrical engineering services.  Section 3324 of title 31, United States Code,  prohibits an agency from paying for goods or services before the  government has received them (with limited exceptions).  Further, Navy  purchase card procedures prohibit advance payment for goods and  services, except in cases such as subscriptions and post office box rentals.   SPAWAR Systems Center project managers gave us with several conflicting  explanations of the nature of the arrangement with the contractor, first  indicating that the charges were for time and materials and later stating  that each purchase was a fixed-fee agreement.  No documentation was  provided to support either explanation.  We were also told by SPAWAR  Systems Center employees that the purchase card was used to expedite the  procurement of goods and services from the contractor because the  preparation, approval, and issuance of a delivery order was too time- consuming in certain circumstances.", "For all 75 transactions, we found that the contractor\u2019s estimated costs were  almost always equal or close to the $2,500 micropurchase threshold.   Because we found no documentation of independent receipt and  acceptance of the services provided or any documentation that the work  for these charges was performed, these charges are also potentially  fraudulent.  We therefore referred the SPAWAR Systems Center purchase  card activity with this contractor to our Office of Special Investigations for  further investigation.", "Convenience checks.  We found that SPAWAR Systems Center improperly  used convenience checks in fiscal year 2001, which ultimately resulted in  NAVSUP canceling the use of these checks at SPAWAR Systems Center in  November 2001, after we made inquires concerning the number of SPAWAR  Systems Center convenience checks issued that exceeded the $2,500-per-  check limit.  Convenience checks are charged directly to the government  purchase card account and are used to pay vendors and other government  agencies that do not accept the purchase card.  According to the SPAWAR  Systems Center agency program coordinator, two Citibank convenience  check accounts were established in December 1998, presumably before  NAVSUP changed its policy allowing only one account per unit.  The  SPAWAR Systems Center head of supply and contracts canceled one of  these accounts on November 15, 2001, after we made inquires concerning  SPAWAR Systems Center\u2019s convenience check usage.", "We found that the two employees responsible for these two accounts had  issued 187 checks during fiscal year 2001, 30 of which were in excess of the  $2,500 limit for individual checks, for a total of over $347,000.  The checks  that exceeded the $2,500 limit were issued to pay for postage meter  charges, various services to vendors who were sole source providers, and  training. After we made inquires to the DOD Purchase Card Program Office  regarding the propriety of SPAWAR Systems Center\u2019s writing convenience  checks in excess of $2,500, NAVSUP canceled SPAWAR Systems Center\u2019s  convenience check privileges on November 20, 2001.  We also believe the  use of convenience checks for over $2,500 purchases is not economical  because of the 1.25 percent fee charged per transaction.  For example,  SPAWAR Systems Center used convenience checks to make one purchase  of $10,000 for postage, which resulted in a fee of $125.", "Printing.  In addition, we identified several instances in which SPAWAR  Systems Center did not adhere to DOD\u2019s policy to use the Defense  Automated Printing Service (DAPS) to perform all printing jobs. Further,  the Navy\u2019s purchase card list of prohibited or special-approval items states  that cardholders are prohibited from buying printing or duplication  services from entities other than DAPS.  In two of the transactions that we  audited, SPAWAR Systems Center paid about $3,800 to Kinko\u2019s for printing  manuals.", "Sales tax.  We identified eight instances of sales taxes paid on SPAWAR  Systems Center purchases.  Payment of sales tax for the purchase of goods  and services for the government is not authorized by law.  According to  SPAWAR Systems Center employees, these sales tax payments generally  occurred when the vendors did not know how to process a nontaxable  transaction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Split Purchases", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of the population of fiscal year 2001 transactions made by one  or more cardholders on the same day from the same vendor, which  appeared to circumvent cardholder single transaction limits, identified  about $7.5 million in SPAWAR Systems Center potential split purchases and  nearly $3 million in NPWC potential split purchases.  The Federal  Acquisition Regulation and Navy purchase card policies and procedures  prohibit splitting a purchase into more than one transaction to avoid the  requirement to obtain competitive bids for purchases over the $2,500  micropurchase threshold or to avoid other established credit limits.  Once  items exceed the $2,500 micropurchase threshold, they are to be purchased  in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures, which are more  stringent than those for micropurchases.", "Our analysis of the population of fiscal year 2001 SPAWAR Systems Center  and NPWC transactions identified a substantial number of potential split  purchases.  To determine whether these were, in fact, split purchases, we  obtained and analyzed the supporting documentation for 30 potential split  purchases at SPAWAR Systems Center and 20 potential split purchases at  NPWC.  We found that in many instances, cardholders made multiple  purchases from the same vendor within a few minutes or a few hours for  items such as computers, computer-related equipment, cell phone services,  and small contracts that involved the same, sequential, or nearly sequential  purchase order and vendor invoice numbers.  Based on our analyses, we  concluded that 13 of the 30 SPAWAR Systems Center and 10 of the 20  NPWC purchases that we examined were split into two or more  transactions to avoid micropurchase thresholds.  Table 7 provides several  examples of cardholder purchases that we believe represent split  purchases intended to circumvent the $2,500 micropurchase limit or other  cardholder single transaction limit.", "By circumventing the competitive requirements of the simplified  acquisition procedures, we believe that in many instances SPAWAR  Systems Center and NPWC may not be getting the best prices possible for  the government.  As a result, these split purchases are likely increasing the  cost of government procurements using the purchase card and, thus, at  least partially offsetting its benefits."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Abusive and Questionable Transactions", "paragraphs": ["We identified numerous examples of abusive and questionable transactions  at SPAWAR Systems Center during fiscal year 2001.  Several of the  improper transactions for NPWC discussed previously are also abusive or  questionable; however, we found no other abusive items related to NPWC  in our statistical sample or data mining.  We defined abusive transactions as  those that were authorized, but the items purchased were at an excessive  cost (e.g., \u201cgold plated\u201d) or for a questionable government need, or both.   Questionable transactions are those that appear to be improper or abusive  but for which there is insufficient documentation to conclude either.  For  all abusive or questionable items, we concluded that cardholders  purchased items for which there was not a reasonable and/or documented  justification.", "Many of the purchases we found to be abusive or questionable fall into  categories described in GAO\u2019s Guide for Evaluating and Testing Controls  Over Sensitive Payments (GAO/AFMD-8.1.2, May 1993).  The guide states:  \u201cAbuse is distinct from illegal acts (noncompliance).  When abuse occurs,  no law or regulation is violated.  Rather, abuse occurs when the conduct of  a government organization, program, activity, or function falls short of  societal expectations of prudent behavior.\u201d  Table 8 shows the potentially  abusive and questionable transactions we identified at SPAWAR Systems  Center for fiscal year 2001.", "Further, several of these items fall into the category of pilferable items,  which, as discussed previously, SPAWAR Systems Center no longer records  in its property records and therefore does not maintain accountability over  them.  For example, the cell phones and headset are items that could easily  be converted to personal use without detection as they are not subject to  bar coding and periodic inventory.  In addition, items that may have limited  use on one project could be made available for use on other projects, if  their existence and location were recorded in centralized property records.   Such visibility could serve to avoid duplicative purchases as well as provide  the control needed to help prevent misuse of government property.", "Room rental and refreshments.  We identified meeting room rental and  refreshments at Bally\u2019s, a hotel and casino in Las Vegas, which is a  questionable transaction.  This charge was related to a trip for about 30  staff members from SPAWAR Headquarters.  SPAWAR officials told us that  the trip was an organizational meeting to work out the details of a planned  merger of two program management working groups.  According to  SPAWAR Headquarters officials, the staff members who attended the  organizational meeting spent the first morning of the 3-day trip at Nellis Air  Force Base discussing issues related to an ongoing project involving a test  and evaluation squadron.  The cost of the transaction we reviewed was  about $2,300, and we estimate the total cost of the trip was between  $15,000 and $20,000.    For the specific transaction we reviewed, we found  that the same control weaknesses we reported earlier applied, including  lack of independent receipt of goods and proper certification of the  monthly bill.  There was no documentation showing that this transaction  had been authorized in advance or that management had fully considered  the cost of this trip and potentially less costly alternatives.", "GAO\u2019s Guide for Evaluating and Testing Controls Over Sensitive  Payments notes the importance of the control environment and the need  for effective controls related to sensitive payments.  A trip for about 30  employees to a Las Vegas hotel and casino for 3 days at a significant cost to  the government is clearly sensitive and should be subjected to a high level  of scrutiny, with clear documentation and approval in advance of the event.   We would expect to see authorization in advance of the procurement by  someone at a higher level than the most senior individual involved in the  event\u2014in this case, a captain.  We found no documented justification to  indicate a valid need for this 3-day meeting to be held in Las Vegas nor did  we find an evaluation of the cost-benefit of having the meeting in Las Vegas  versus alternative sites.  Thus, we question whether the entire cost of the  trip was a prudent expenditure of government funds.  We did not review the  travel vouchers and related documentation for the other component costs  of the trip such as airfare, rental cars, or hotel bills; however, in estimating  the total cost of the trip, we reviewed available documentation related to  travel card usage from Bank of America.", "Cell phone usage.  We found significant breakdowns in controls at SPAWAR  Systems Center over the use of cell phones and related services, resulting  in abusive and wasteful expenditures of government resources.  In  addition, we found a proliferation of cell phone agreements, with the  purchase card being used to purchase equipment and services from more  than 40 different cell phone companies at a total cost of $341,000 for fiscal  year 2001.  According to SPAWAR Systems Center management, they have a  master cell phone contract with AT&T Wireless.   However, lack of  management oversight and a large number of available purchase cards has  resulted in individuals with purchase cards or their supervisors deciding  who needs a cell phone, which cell phone company to use, and what type  of calling plan to purchase.  For all but one of the transactions that we  audited, we did not find any evidence that the monthly cell phone bills had  been independently reviewed to ensure the transactions were reasonable  and for valid government purposes.", "In the large case we audited, we identified a $24,000 monthly bill for about  200 Nextel cell phones and related services that were acquired to provide a  voice communication system for coordination and control among various  groups during a demonstration and test of a military wide area relay  network.  The Nextel phones were selected for evaluation as an alternative  not for their standard cellular phone-to-phone capability, but for their  \u201cgroup-talk\u201d feature, which provides a wireless \u201cwalkie-talkie\u201d like  capability for preprogrammed work groups.  One of the key control failures  with this cell phone procurement was related to SPAWAR Systems Center\u2019s  handing out cell phones to project team members and government  contractors without keeping an inventory of who had each cell phone.   Contractors that used these government cell phones told us that SPAWAR  Systems Center officials brought a box of 60 or 70 cell phones to a meeting  and handed them out to contractors that were part of the team.  The  contractors told us that SPAWAR Systems Center provided them with no  instructions on proper use of the cell phone.  The approximately 200 cell  phones were not physically controlled and SPAWAR Systems Center did  not have a list of who had the cell phones.  Based on further investigation,  we found that these contractors were using the cell phones to call friends  and family and to conduct other personal business.  Based on our review of  the bills for this Nextel account\u2014which totaled about $74,000 during fiscal  year 2001\u2014we estimated that about $9,200 was spent on long distance and  other local telephone calls, which was not the primary intended purpose of  these cell phones.", "In addition to the Nextel contract, we also identified cell phone contracts  with large monthly fees for phones that were either used infrequently or  not at all.  For example, we audited one account with five cell phones.  The  service for each phone included 500 minutes of airtime, and the basic  service cost of each cell phone was $50 a month.  For the 3 months of  activity we audited, we found that three of the five phones had either no  voice activity or very little. For example, one of these cell phones had only  2 minutes of calls during a month that we audited.  This is the equivalent of  the government paying $25 per minute for airtime.", "We identified a number of other abusive and questionable charges  including the following.", "One cardholder purchased $775 of luggage including wallets, passport  holders, backpacks, neck pouches, and other items.  The cardholder  told us that these items were used to carry or ship equipment to  universities for outreach activities.  At the end of the events, the  individual told us that the items were given away.  There is no  documentation available showing the authorization and need to  purchase this luggage for purposes of carrying or shipping equipment.   This purchase appears abusive because a valid government need is  neither apparent nor documented, particularly since the cardholder  gave away government property that could easily be converted to  personal use.", "As part of our data mining, we identified purchases of day planners from  commercial vendors, including calendar refills along with designer  leather holders purchased from Louis Vuitton.  By law, government  agencies are directed to purchase certain products, including day  planners and calendars, from certified nonprofit agencies that employ  people who are blind or severely disabled.  This program is referred to  as the Javits-Wagner-O\u2019Day (JWOD) program, which is intended to  provide employment opportunities for thousands of people with  disabilities to earn good wages and move toward greater independence.   In addition, DOD\u2019s policy requires the use of JWOD sources, whether or  not the procurement is made using a purchase card, unless the central  JWOD agency specifically authorizes an exception.  In this year\u2019s audit,  we found that SPAWAR Systems Center employees had purchased three  Louis Vuitton calendar refills for $27 each, and we identified three  purchases of Louis Vuitton calendar holders at a cost of $255 each in  fiscal year 2000.  The most expensive JWOD calendar holders\u2014 specifically designed for DOD\u2014cost about $40.", "In addition, we identified about $33,000 in purchases from Franklin  Covey of designer and high-cost leather briefcases, purses (totes),  portfolios, day planners and refills, palm pilot cases, and wallets.  For  example, we found leather purses costing up to $195 each and portfolios  costing up to $135 each.  Many of these purchases are of a questionable  government need and should be paid for by the individual.  To the extent  the day planners and calendar refills were proper government  purchases, they were at an excessive cost and, as with the Louis Vuitton  day planners, should have been purchased from a JWOD source at a  substantially lower cost.  Circumventing the JWOD requirements and  purchasing these items from commercial vendors is not only an abuse  and waste of taxpayer dollars, but shows particularly poor judgment and  serious internal control weaknesses.", "We identified the purchase of three computer bags from SkyMall at a  cost of $161 each, and another purchase of a computer bag at a store in  Italy for almost $250.  All three computer bags were purchased by  employees who were traveling on SPAWAR Systems Center business.   The cost of these computer bag purchases is excessive compared to  other standard bags we found purchased for $25.  In addition, the  cardholder who purchased the SkyMall bags told us that one of the two  bags, along with another bag purchased in a separate transaction, was  given to non\u2013SPAWAR Systems Center government employees working  on the project.", "We identified the purchase of a Bose headset at a cost of $299.  The  cardholder told us that the headset was originally purchased for a  project but had never been used on the project.  The cardholder stated  that he has used the headset to listen to music on official government  travel aboard airplanes.", "We identified four Lego \u201cMindstorm\u201d computer robot kits that were  purchased at Toys R Us at a total cost of $800.  The SPAWAR Systems  Center employee who requested that these robots be purchased initially  told us that they were purchased as a learning tool for new professionals  and junior engineers to learn cooperative behavior between robots and  to conduct robotic research.  However, during our interview, this  SPAWAR Systems Center employee stated that at the time of these  purchases his division did not have any new professionals scheduled to  rotate through his assignment.  Within 6 weeks of purchasing the kits,  the employee removed all four from SPAWAR Systems Center, brought  two of them to a local elementary school where he mentors an after  school science club, and brought two to his home.  We believe this  purchase is abusive because there does not appear to be a valid  government need for the purchase, and because the cardholder  effectively gave away government property that could easily be  converted to personal use.  As part of the NAVSUP mandated stand- down transaction review, SPAWAR Systems Center also reviewed the  transactions for the Lego robot kits and initially questioned their  propriety.  However, contrary to our conclusion that these purchases  were abusive, SPAWAR Systems Center ultimately considered the Lego  kits to be a valid government purchase."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disciplinary Action Seldom Taken Against Cardholders Who Made Abusive Purchases", "paragraphs": ["In our November 30, 2001, report on the purchase card controls at  SPAWAR Systems Center and NPWC, we recommended that action be  taken to help ensure that cardholders adhere to applicable purchase card  laws, regulations, internal control and accounting standards, and policies  and procedures.  Specifically, we recommended that the commander, Naval  Supply Systems Command, revise NAVSUP Instruction 4200.94 to include  specific consequences for noncompliance with purchase card policies and  procedures.  DOD did not concur with that recommendation and stated  that existing Navy policy clearly identifies consequences for fraud, abuse,  and misuse.   We continue to believe that Navy needs to establish specific  consequences for these purchase card problems because the Navy policy  does not identify any specific consequences for failure to follow control  requirements.  Enforcement of the consequences is also critical.  For  example, only one of the cardholders referred to in this testimony or our  July 30, 2001, testimony had formal disciplinary or administrative action\u2014 in the form of removal of the purchase card\u2014taken against them.", "Thus, we reiterate our previous recommendation that the Navy enforce  purchase card controls by establishing specific formal disciplinary and/or  administrative consequences\u2014such as withdrawal of cardholder status,  reprimand, suspension from employment for several days, and, if  necessary, firing.

In  light of the events of September 11, and the federal government\u2019s short- and  long-term budget challenges, it is more important than ever that DOD get  the most from every dollar spent.  As Secretary Rumsfeld has noted,  billions of dollars of resources could be freed up for national defense  priorities by eliminating waste and inefficiencies in existing DOD business  processes.  The cultural issues we identified at SPAWAR Systems Center\u2014  such as the failure to acknowledge significant control weaknesses in the  purchase card program, the parochial approach to program management  without regard to broader Navy and DOD initiatives, and the lack of  consequences on a personal or organizational level for failure to adhere to  controls\u2014are a major impediment to the improvements that are needed to  stop wasteful and abusive purchases and ensure that taxpayer dollars are  spent where national priorities dictate.

According to unaudited DOD data,  SPAWAR Systems Center and NPWC made about $64 million in purchase  card acquisitions during fiscal year 2001.  Because these two units have  cardholders located outside the San Diego area, we limited our testing to  only those SPAWAR Systems Center and NPWC cardholders who are  located in San Diego, California.

To assess the management control environment, we applied the  fundamental concepts and standards in the GAO internal control standards  to the practices followed by management in the four areas reviewed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Statistical Sample of Internal Control Procedures", "paragraphs": ["To test controls, we used a two-step sampling process for purchase card  transactions that were recorded by Navy during the fourth quarter of fiscal  year 2001.  At SPAWAR Systems Center, we selected stratified random  probability samples of 50 purchase card transactions from a population of  7,267 transactions totaling $5,919,635.  Because the majority of SPAWAR  Systems Center transactions failed the control test we did not have to  expand our sampling size.  At NPWC, we initially selected a sample of 50  purchase card transactions from a population of 11,021 transactions  totaling $6,030,501.  In light of NPWC\u2019s improvements in the area of  documenting independent receipt and acceptance, we increased our  sample size of NPWC transactions to 94 to generate a more accurate  assessment of the control failure rate at NPWC.", "We stratified the each of the samples into two groups\u2014transactions from  vendors likely to represent purchases of computer equipment and other  vendors.  With this statistically valid probability sample, each transaction in  the population had a nonzero probability of being included, and that  probability could be computed for any transaction.  Each sample element  was subsequently weighted in the analysis to account statistically for all the  transactions in the population, including those that were not selected.   Table 9 presents our test results on three key transaction-level controls and  shows the confidence intervals for the estimates for the universes of fiscal  year 2001 purchase card transactions made by SPAWAR Systems Center  and NPWC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data Mining", "paragraphs": ["In addition to selecting statistical samples of SPAWAR Systems Center and  NPWC transactions to test specific internal controls, we also made  nonrepresentative selections of SPAWAR Systems Center and NPWC  transactions based on data mining of fiscal year 2001 transactions.  The  purpose of the data mining procedures was twofold.  Specifically, we  conducted separate analysis of acquisitions that were (1) potentially  fraudulent, improper, and abusive or otherwise questionable and (2) split  into multiple transactions to circumvent either the micropurchase or  cardholder transaction thresholds.", "Our data mining for potentially fraudulent, improper, and abusive or  questionable transactions was limited to cardholders who worked in San  Diego and covered 36,216 fiscal year 2001 transactions totaling about  $26.1 million at SPAWAR Systems Center, and 46,709 fiscal year  transactions totaling about $23.9 million at the NPWC.  For this review, we  scanned the two units\u2019 San Diego-based activities for transactions with  vendors that are likely to sell goods or services (1) on NAVSUP\u2019s list of  prohibited items, (2) that are personal items, and (3) that are otherwise  questionable. Our expectation was that transactions with certain vendors  had a more likely chance of being fraudulent, improper, abusive, or  questionable.  Because of the large number of transactions that met these  criteria we did not look at all potential abuses of the purchase card.   Rather, we made nonrepresentative selections of transactions based on  transactions with the vendors who fit these criteria.  For example, we  reviewed, and in some cases made inquires, concerning 162 transactions  and other related transactions on the same monthly purchase card  statement with vendors that sold such items as sporting goods, groceries,  luggage, flowers, and clothing. While we identified some improper and  potentially fraudulent and abusive transactions, our work was not designed  to identify, and we cannot determine, the extent of fraudulent, improper,  and abusive or questionable transactions.", "Our data mining also included nonrepresentative selections of acquisitions  that SPAWAR Systems Center and NPWC entered into during the period  June 22, 2001, through September 21, 2001, that were potentially split into  multiple transactions to circumvent either the micropurchase competition  requirements or cardholder single transaction thresholds.  We limited our  data mining to this period because senior SPAWAR Systems Center and  NPWC officials acknowledged to us in early June 2001 that cardholders had  made split transactions and that they would attempt to correct the  problem.  Therefore, to allow the two units an opportunity to resolve this  issue, we limited our review to transactions that occurred subsequent to  SPAWAR Systems Center and NPWC\u2019s acknowledging a problem with  splitting purchases.", "We briefed DOD managers, including officials in DOD\u2019s Purchase Card  Joint Program Management Office, and Navy managers, including NAVSUP,  SPAWAR Systems Center, and NPWC officials, on the details of our review,  including our objectives, scope, and methodology and our findings and  conclusions.  Where appropriate, we incorporated their comments into this  testimony.  We conducted our audit work from November 2001 through  February 2002 in accordance with U.S. generally accepted government  auditing standards, and we performed our investigative work in  accordance with standards prescribed by the President\u2019s Council on  Integrity and Efficiency."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
