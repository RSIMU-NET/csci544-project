Over the past 100 years, efforts to manage the flow of water through the ecosystem have jeopardized its health. In 2000, a strategy to restore the ecosystem was set; restoration was expected to take at least 40 years and cost $15.4 billion. The restoration comprises hundreds of projects, including 60 key projects known as the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), to be undertaken by a partnership of federal, state, local, and tribal governments. Given the size and complexity of the restoration, GAO was asked to report on the (1) status of project implementation and expected benefits, (2) factors that determine project sequencing, (3) amount of funding provided for the effort and extent that costs have increased, and (4) primary mathematical models that guide the restoration."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While many of the restoration effort's 222 projects have been completed or are ongoing, a core set of projects that are critical to the success of the restoration are behind schedule or not yet started. Specifically, 43 projects have been completed, 107 are being implemented, and 72 are in design, in planning, or are not yet started. The completed projects will provide improved water quality and additional habitat for wildlife, and the ongoing projects will also help restore wildlife habitat and improve water flow within the ecosystem. However, the projects most critical to the restoration's overall success--the CERP projects--are among those that are currently being designed, planned, or have not yet been started. Some of these projects are behind schedule by up to 6 years. Despite project delays, officials believe that significant progress has been made in acquiring land, constructing water quality projects, and restoring a natural water flow to the Kissimmee River--the headwater of the ecosystem. In addition, many of the policies, strategies, and agreements required to guide the restoration in the future are now in place. To help provide further momentum to the restoration, Florida recently began expediting the design and construction of eight key projects, with the hope that they would immediately benefit the environment, enhance flood control, and increase water supply. There are no overarching sequencing criteria that restoration officials use when making implementation decisions for all 222 projects that make up the restoration effort. Instead, decisions for 162 projects are driven largely by the availability of funds. For the remaining 60 projects--which are among the most critical to the success of the restoration effort--the Corps of Engineers and the Congress established criteria to ensure the goals and purposes of CERP are achieved. However, the sequencing plan developed for these projects in 2005 is not consistent with the criteria established by the Corps. Therefore, there is little assurance that the plan will be effective. From fiscal years 1999 through 2006, the federal government contributed $2.3 billion, and Florida contributed $4.8 billion, for a total of about $7.1 billion for the restoration. However, CERP funding was about $1.2 billion short of the funds originally projected for this period. In addition, the total estimated costs for the restoration have increased by 28 percent--from $15.4 billion in 2000 to at least $19.7 billion in 2006. More importantly, these cost estimates do not represent the true costs for the overall restoration effort because they do not include all cost components for a number of projects. There are 27 primary mathematical models that guide the restoration effort. These include (1) hydrological, (2) water quality, and (3) ecological models. Although 21 of the 27 models are able to interface with other models and provide a more comprehensive pictureof the impact of restoration efforts on the ecosystem, many agency officials stated that additional interfaces are needed. Because coordinating the development of these interfaces is resource intensive, it has been a low priority for the agencies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The South Florida ecosystem, which covers about 18,000 square miles,  extends from the Kissimmee Chain of Lakes south of Orlando, Florida, to  the reefs southwest of the Florida Keys. This vast ecosystem is home to  the Everglades, one of the world\u2019s unique environmental resources, and to  the only living coral reef in North America. The South Florida ecosystem is  also home to a rapidly growing population of more than 6 million people  and supports a large agriculture-, tourism-, and recreation-based economy.  Over the past 100 years, engineering projects designed to control floods  and supply water to the residents of South Florida have diverted water  from the Everglades. This alteration of the water flow, coupled with  agricultural and industrial activities and urbanization, has jeopardized the  ecosystem\u2019s health and reduced the Everglades to about half its original  size. In 2000, when the strategy for restoring the South Florida ecosystem  was set, the restoration effort was expected to take at least 40 years and  cost $15.4 billion.", "In response to growing signs of ecosystem deterioration, federal agencies  established the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force in 1993  to coordinate ongoing federal restoration activities. The Water Resources  Development Act of 1996 formally established the Task Force and  expanded its membership to include state, local, and tribal  representatives, and charged it with coordinating and facilitating efforts to  restore the ecosystem. To accomplish the restoration, the Task Force  established the following three goals:    Get the water right. The purpose of this goal is to deliver the right  amount of water, of the right quality, to the right places, at the right  times. However, restoring a more natural water flow to the ecosystem  while providing adequate water supplies and controlling floods will  require efforts to expand the ecosystem\u2019s freshwater supply and  improve the delivery of water to natural areas. Natural areas of the  ecosystem are made up of federal and state lands, and coastal waters,  estuaries, bays, and islands.", "Restore, preserve, and protect natural habitats and species. To restore  lost and altered habitats and recover the endangered or threatened  species native to these habitats, the federal and state governments will  have to acquire lands and reconnect natural habitats that have become  disconnected through growth and development, and halt the spread of  invasive species.", "Foster compatibility of the built and natural systems. To achieve the  long-term sustainability of the ecosystem, the restoration effort has the  goal of maintaining the quality of life in urban areas while ensuring that  (1) development practices limit habitat fragmentation and support  conservation and (2) traditional industries, such as agriculture, fishing,  and manufacturing, continue to be supported and do not damage the  ecosystem.", "To achieve these three overall goals, agencies participating in the  restoration effort are implementing 222 ecosystem restoration projects.  These 222 projects comprise a full spectrum of restoration activities and  include the following:   Water storage and flow. These types of projects include (1)  constructing reservoirs and underground wells to store rainwater that  would otherwise flow to the ocean through Florida\u2019s canal system; (2)  removing barriers such as canals, levees, and roads to allow this stored  water to flow naturally throughout the ecosystem; (3) reducing seepage  of groundwater from natural areas; and (4) developing new protocols  for managing water levels and flows across South Florida to ensure  that the right quantity of water gets to the right places at the right  times.", "Water quality. These types of projects involve (1) constructing man- made wetlands that can function as stormwater treatment areas and  help reduce contaminants such as phosphorus and nitrogen in urban  and agricultural runoff and (2) developing regulatory approaches and promoting best management practices that can further help reduce  these contaminants.", "Water supply. These types of projects help reduce the amount of water  used by the public and in commerce, landscaping, and agriculture as  well as increase water resources. These projects include revising water  permitting procedures, encouraging the reuse of wastewater in regions  throughout the ecosystem, and developing alternative technologies.", "Habitat acquisition and improvement. These types of projects  include federal and state purchases of land tracts or easements, or  improvements made to lands already in public ownership, that can be  used to preserve habitat for native plants and animals, provide sites for  reservoirs, and act as buffers near existing natural areas.", "Invasive species control. These types of projects include efforts to  eradicate invasive plants that have displaced native plant and animal  species throughout the South Florida ecosystem.", "One of the key components of the restoration effort is the Comprehensive  Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP)\u2014the primary means by which the  goal of \u201cgetting the water right\u201d will be achieved. Approved by the Water  Resources Development Act of 2000 (WRDA 2000), CERP is one of the  most ambitious restoration efforts the federal government has ever  undertaken. It currently encompasses 60 individual projects that will be  designed and implemented over approximately 40 years. These projects  are intended to increase the water available for the natural areas by  capturing much of the water that is currently being diverted, storing the  water in many different reservoirs and storage wells, and releasing it when  it is needed. The cost of implementing CERP will be shared equally  between the federal government and the state of Florida and will be  carried out primarily by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) and  the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD), which is the state  authority that manages water resources for South Florida. After the Corps  and SFWMD complete the initial planning and design for individual CERP  projects, they must submit the proposed projects to the Congress to obtain  authorization and funding for construction.", "In addition to the CERP projects, another 162 projects are also part of the  overall restoration effort. Twenty-eight of these projects, when completed,  will serve as the foundation for many of the CERP projects and are  intended to restore a more natural water flow to Everglades National Park  and improve water quality in the ecosystem. Nearly all of these \u201cCERP- related\u201d projects were already being designed or implemented by federal  and state agencies, such as the Department of the Interior and SFWMD, in  2000 when the Congress approved CERP. The remaining 134 projects  include a variety of efforts that will, among other things, expand wildlife  refuges, eradicate invasive species, and restore wildlife habitat, and are  being implemented by a number of federal, state, and tribal agencies, such  as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Florida Department of  Environmental Protection (FDEP), and the Seminole Tribe of Florida.  Because these projects were not authorized as part of CERP and do not  serve as CERP\u2019s foundation, for the purposes of this report we refer to  them as \u201cnon-CERP\u201d projects.", "Success in completing the restoration effort to achieve the expected  benefits for the ecosystem as quickly as possible and in the most cost- effective manner depends on the order, or sequencing, in which many of  the 222 projects will be designed and completed. Appropriate sequencing  is also important to ensure that interdependencies among restoration  projects are not ignored. For example, projects that will construct water  storage facilities and stormwater treatment areas need to be completed  before undertaking projects that remove levees and restore a more natural  water flow to the ecosystem.", "The Task Force has identified a set of key guiding principles for managing  the restoration effort and its many related projects. One of the key  principles is that decisions about restoration projects will be based on  sound scientific information. A tool that can provide agencies with this  kind of scientific information is the use of mathematical models that  simulate hydrological, ecological, and water quality processes and shows  how restoration projects will change, or have changed, the ecosystem. The  models also help identify project adjustments that are needed to achieve  the restoration goals. Because no single model can comprehensively  predict and assess all of the effects of a project, models may need to be  designed to interface with other models so that they can exchange  information for a more holistic simulation of a project\u2019s impact.", "Given the complexity and enormity of the South Florida ecosystem  restoration, you asked us to review the current status of the effort,  focusing specifically on the (1) status of restoration projects and their  expected benefits; (2) factors that influence the sequencing of project  implementation; (3) amount of funding provided to the restoration effort  since 1999; (4) extent to which cost increases have occurred and the  reasons for these increases; and (5) primary mathematical models used to  guide the restoration effort and the extent to which these models have  interfaces.", "To determine the extent to which restoration projects have been  completed and to identify their expected benefits, we obtained and  analyzed documents from the Task Force and agencies participating in the  restoration effort and interviewed agency and Task Force officials. On the  basis of this information, we compiled a master list of completed, ongoing,  and planned restoration projects and their benefits. For this review, we  generally categorized projects and expected benefits by their primary  purpose, as identified by the Task Force.", "To determine the factors that participating agencies considered when  deciding on the sequence for implementing restoration projects, we  contacted the agencies responsible for the largest number of restoration  projects\u2014the Corps, the Department of the Interior, SFWMD, and FDEP.  We also selected certain CERP projects for more detailed analysis,  obtained and reviewed documents and related material, and conducted  interviews with the Corps and SFWMD officials responsible for sequencing  decisions related to these projects. In addition, we reviewed comments by  other agencies and external stakeholders about the appropriateness of the  factors used to determine the sequencing of CERP projects. To determine  the amount of funding that participating agencies provided and the extent  to which restoration costs have increased, we asked participating federal  and state agencies to provide funding information for fiscal years 1999  through 2006 and estimated project costs through June 30, 2006. We  interviewed agency officials about the factors contributing to cost  increases. All funding and cost data presented in this report are in  constant 2006 dollars. We assessed the reliability of the funding and cost  data and determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our study. To determine the primary models that can be used  to guide the restoration effort and the interfaces among them, we  compiled a universe of models available for the restoration effort, and  then asked managers and scientists familiar with modeling and the  restoration effort to identify those primary models and their interfaces. We  also reviewed academic and agency Web sites to obtain supplemental  information about these models and their interfaces.", "A more detailed description of our scope and methodology is presented in  appendix I.

The Central  and Southern Florida project, a large-scale water control project begun in  the late 1940s, constructed more than 1,700 miles of canals and levees and  over 200 water control structures that drain an average of 1.7 billion  gallons of water per day into the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico.  This construction resulted in insufficient water for the natural system and  for the growing population, along with degraded water quality.

For the  remaining 44 CERP projects that require construction, the full estimated  cost is likely to rise if they, like other CERP projects, have higher  completion costs than originally anticipated. For example, as mentioned  above for one project that we examined\u2014the Site 1 Impoundment  project\u2014after the project implementation report was completed the  estimated total costs grew by $36 million, from $46 million to $81 million.  If other CERP projects, for which initial planning and design have not yet  been completed, also experience similar increases in project costs then  the estimated total costs of not only CERP but the overall restoration  effort will grow significantly. Since the federal government provides 50  percent of the cost for CERP and for certain CERP-related projects, its  contribution to cover these rising costs will also continue to increase.", "Second, the full cost of acquiring land for the restoration effort is not  known. For 56 non-CERP land projects, expected to total 862,796 acres,  land acquisition costs have not been reported. Costs are not estimated due  to price escalation and also to avoid adversely impacting ongoing  negotiations of land acquisitions. For these non-CERP land acquisitions,  the Task Force computed an estimated range of land costs from $2.5  billion to $4.1 billion based on the 779,000 acres remaining to be acquired  as of 2004. However, the higher cost may be more realistic, and could be a  conservative estimate, given the rising costs of land in Florida. According  to state officials, Florida land prices are escalating rapidly, owing  primarily to development pressures. Consequently, future project costs are  likely to rise with higher land costs. While land acquisition costs for CERP  projects are included as part of the total estimated project costs, thus far,  the state has acquired only 54 percent of the land needed for CERP  projects, at a cost of $1.4 billion. An additional 178,000 acres have yet to be  acquired; the cost of these purchases is not yet known and is therefore not  fully reflected in the cost of CERP and overall restoration costs.", "Third, the cost of using new technologies for the restoration effort is  unknown. The Congress authorized pilot projects in 1999 and 2000 to  determine the feasibility of applying certain new technologies for storing  water, managing seepage, and reusing treated wastewater. Under this  authority, the Corps implemented six pilot projects that are estimated to  cost a total of $123 million. While the pilot projects have been authorized,  the cost to construct or implement projects based on the results of the  pilots is not yet known. For example, one of the key water storage  technologies proposed is the use of aquifer storage and recovery (ASR).  Using ASR technology would require the Corps and SFWMD to drill many  wells deep into an aquifer to store water and then to pump it out as  needed. While ASR technology has been used successfully in the state in  the past, the restoration agencies plan to create water storage reservoirs  that are larger than any previously created. Three ASR pilot projects have  been approved to address the technical uncertainties related to the  implementation of these large scale ASRs. The agencies reported that the  ASR pilot costs constitute approximately 20 percent of the cost of CERP,  but they do not know what the ASR technology on the scale envisioned  will cost or what the costs would be for alternative water storage if the  ASR technology proves to be infeasible."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Twenty-Seven Primary Models Guide the Restoration Effort, but Additional Interfaces Are Needed to Enhance Their Usefulness", "paragraphs": ["Of more than 100 available mathematical models, 27 primary models guide  the restoration effort.

These models take into  account different aspects of the unique hydrology of South Florida\u2014flat  topography, a high water table, sandy soils, and the easy movement of  water through the aquifer system. A total of 13 primary models simulate  water quality processes\u2014such as the migration of pollutants in both  surface water and groundwater systems. The three primary ecological  models simulate how plant and animal species interact with their habitat.  For example, an ecological model might simulate changes in the  population of an endangered species, like the Cape Sable Seaside Sparrow,  in relation to changes in hydrological conditions and the availability of  food.

For example, the Corps and SFWMD are each focusing  on certifying the reliability of the models that they developed through a  peer review process, while Interior is setting priorities for ecological  science activities that affect the development of ecological models.

In this context, therefore, the order in which these projects are  implemented becomes critical to ensuring that the maximum  environmental benefits are achieved as quickly as possible in the most  cost-effective manner. However, the process that participating agencies  have used so far to make sequencing decisions for these projects, and in  particular for the CERP projects, has been governed largely by funding  availability and technical dependencies and constraints among projects,  not the full range of criteria that the Corps developed under WRDA 2000.  These criteria were not fully applied when sequencing decisions were  made for the CERP projects in 2005. This happened because key data,  such as updated benefits information and interim goals for CERP, which  are needed to fully apply these criteria were not available.

The state of Florida,  however, expressed concerns that our recommendation would serve to  delay restoration and increase costs and stated that it supports the  Incremental Adaptive Restoration process recommended by the National  Research Council. While we understand the state\u2019s concerns, we do not  believe that implementing the adaptive management approach  recommended by the Council is incompatible with our recommendation.", "In fact, our report discusses the Corps\u2019 plans to incorporate this approach  and allow CERP projects to move forward in incremental steps.  Furthermore, given the delays that have already occurred and the  criticality of CERP to the success of the restoration, we believe that it is  even more important for the Corps to apply the full set of sequencing  factors, as outlined in the program regulations, to ensure that CERP  sequencing decisions will achieve maximum restoration benefits as early  as possible and in the most cost-effective manner.", "In responding to our recommendation that the Departments of Defense  and the Interior reach an agreement on interim goals with the Governor of  Florida, both federal agencies and the state of Florida reported that the  Secretaries of the Army and the Interior and the Governor of Florida  signed an Interim Goals Agreement in late April/early May 2007. Because  this happened after our report was sent to the agencies and the state for  comment, we have revised our report and removed the recommendation  to reflect this recent action. We believe that having the interim goals in  place will provide a way of measuring the progress made in implementing  CERP and achieve its goals as early as possible and in a cost-effective  manner.", "The Department of the Interior and the state of Florida agreed with our  recommendation that the Secretary of the Interior, as chair of the Task  Force, take the lead on helping participating agencies better coordinate  their efforts to develop models and their interfaces and that such an effort  should include the Interagency Modeling Center. Interior said that it  agreed that coordination in the area of modeling will be beneficial and that  the Task Force\u2019s Science Coordination Group and the Interagency  Modeling Center could assist in this effort. Interior also said that it will  make such a recommendation to the Task Force. The state of Florida said  that it is important that the Task Force provide direction to the model  development process and that interfaces for models are important. The  state also recognized that while coordination of modeling could be  improved, it is important that the Interagency Modeling Center continue to  provide policy guidance. Although this recommendation was not  addressed to the Department of Defense, in its comments the department  stated that it did not agree with the recommendation because the  Interagency Modeling Center has responsibility for coordinating and  developing models and interfaces. We have included information in the  report to recognize the role of the Interagency Modeling Center. However,  we believe that because the Interagency Modeling Center\u2019s responsibilities  pertain primarily to CERP, and not the whole restoration effort, the Task  Force as the science and research coordinating body for the overall  restoration is the most appropriate body for coordinating the development  of models and their interfaces.", "We also received technical comments from the state of Florida, which we  have incorporated, as appropriate, throughout the report.

On the basis of these interviews, we determined that  the most complete list of current restoration projects was found in the  Task Force\u2019s 2005 Integrated Financial Plan. This list, updated annually, is  intended to contain all of the restoration projects completed,  implemented, and planned by the federal, state, local, and tribal entities  participating in the South Florida ecosystem restoration. The list is  supplemented by project profile sheets that give additional details about  each project. Using the Task Force\u2019s list as a baseline and supplementing it  with research and agency interviews, we identified 222 restoration  projects. We requested and received information on these projects from  the participating agencies that sponsor nearly all of the 222 projects: the  Army Corps of Engineers (Corps); the Departments of Agriculture  (USDA)\u2014including the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and Natural  Resources Conservation Service (NRCS); Commerce\u2014including the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); and the  Interior\u2014including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and National  Park Service (NPS); the Florida Department of Environmental Protection  (FDEP); Miami-Dade County; the Miccosukee Tribe; the Seminole Tribe;  and the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD).", "Specifically, we requested data on project status, project start and end  dates, and related information. We conducted follow-up interviews where  appropriate to clarify the project information we received. On the basis of  this information, we compiled a master list of completed, ongoing, and  planned restoration projects. Using the information collected regarding  project status, we grouped the projects into the following four categories:  (1) completed, (2) in implementation, (3) in planning or design, and (4) not  yet started.", "To separate the 222 projects into smaller groups for further analysis, we  relied upon the project information in the Task Force\u2019s 2005 Integrated  Financial Plan, as well as in the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration  Plan (CERP) 2005 report to the Congress. On the basis of our analysis of  these two documents and verification provided by responses on project  status from participating agencies, we developed the following three  project groups: (1) CERP projects\u201460 individual projects approved by the  Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2000 to restore, preserve,  and protect the South Florida ecosystem while providing for other water- related needs of the region, including water supply and flood control; (2)  CERP-related projects\u201428 projects that provide a foundation for CERP\u2014 many of these were authorized before WRDA 2000; and (3) non-CERP  projects\u2014134 restoration projects that are not as closely related to CERP.", "To identify project benefits, we generally categorized expected benefits for  each project by its primary purpose, as identified by the Task Force in its  2005 Integrated Financial Plan. According to the Task Force, these primary  purposes are identified by communications between the Task Force and  each project\u2019s sponsor(s). We reviewed the project descriptions as  reported by the Task Force, as well as other available project information,  to assess the reasonableness of the Task Force\u2019s determination for each  project\u2019s primary purpose. For projects that did not appear in the 2005  Integrated Financial Plan, or for those that appeared in the plan but did  not have a supporting project profile sheet, we requested and reviewed  project information from the project\u2019s sponsor(s) where available.  Through this analysis, we developed broad categories of expected  benefits\u2014water storage, habitat acquisition and improvement, and water  quality, among others\u2014and assigned each project to one of them on the  basis of its primary purpose.", "Following our initial data collection, we conducted additional outreach  through April 2007 to ensure that our master project list was as complete  as possible and incorporated any changes that may have occurred. We (1)  reviewed the Task Force\u2019s draft 2006 Integrated Financial Plan to  incorporate newly completed projects and other relevant changes; (2)  requested the Task Force\u2019s assistance in reconciling our project list with  the original project list that it published in 2000 to incorporate projects  that may have been completed and then removed from the Integrated  Financial Plans issued between 2000 and 2005; and (3) contacted  participating agencies and followed up on ongoing projects with estimated  end dates that were reported as \u201c2006\u201d in the agencies\u2019 original status  response to determine if these projects had in fact been completed.", "To determine the factors that influence the sequencing of project  implementation for the restoration projects, we obtained and reviewed  available agency guidance, regulations, and related material from the  Corps; the Department of the Interior (including NPS and FWS); FDEP;  and SFWMD. We selected these agencies because they are responsible for  the largest number of CERP, CERP-related, and non-CERP projects. To  learn about sequencing criteria and to determine whether there are any  overarching criteria for all of the restoration projects, we interviewed  officials at these agencies, as well as officials at the Department of  Agriculture\u2019s Agricultural Research Service and Natural Resources  Conservation Service; Department of Commerce\u2019s National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration; Department of the Interior\u2019s U.S. Geological  Survey; the Seminole and Miccosukee tribes; Miami-Dade County; and the  South Florida Regional Planning Council. Once we determined that only  the CERP projects have clearly established criteria, we met with Corps  and SFWMD officials to determine the extent to which they applied these  criteria in making the sequencing decisions listed in the 2005 sequencing  plan and to identify other factors and considerations that they took into  account. In doing so, we selected certain CERP projects for more detailed  discussion and reviewed Corps documentation in support of its  sequencing decisions. Finally, we reviewed comments by other agencies  and external stakeholders about the appropriateness of the factors used to  determine the sequencing of CERP projects.", "To determine the amount of funding federal and state agencies have  contributed to the restoration effort for fiscal years 1999 through 2006, we  obtained information from the following lead project sponsors: the  Department of Agriculture, the Corps, the Department of the Interior,  SFWMD, and Florida Department of Environmental Protection. We also  obtained information from the Environmental Protection Agency. Federal  agencies account for their funds independently, and therefore no complete  and consolidated financial data on the restoration were available. For the  other agencies participating in the restoration effort, we used the funding  data for this period that these agencies had provided in the Task Force\u2019s  annual cross-cut budgets. These agencies included the Department of  Commerce, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, Florida  Department of Agriculture and Consumer Affairs, Florida Department of  Community Affairs, Florida Department of Transportation, and Florida  Department of Environmental Protection. In reporting the funding data in  total and by category type, we used funding amounts that were sometimes  rounded to the nearest million and sometimes rounded to the nearest  billion, and as a result, the amounts we report may not always equal the  funding totals originally provided by each agency. We made certain  judgments in allocating the funding based on the available funding data. As  a result, land costs for some fiscal years are only for a partial fiscal year  and do not include the entire fiscal year. We converted all funding data to  constant 2006 dollars. To assess the reliability of the funding data the  agencies provided, we asked the agencies to provide appropriation or  budget allocation documents that supported their funding contributions;  the lead project sponsors listed above provided supporting  documentation. Our review of the funding and the supporting  documentation indicated that the funding data were sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of this review.", "To determine any increases in estimated project costs and the reasons for  these increases, we used as our baseline the list of projects and their  associated costs in the Task Force\u2019s 2000 Integrated Financial Plan. We  updated this project list for any changes in projects from July 31, 2000,  through June 30, 2006. We then submitted the updated project list to the  participating federal and state agencies that were the lead project  sponsors and co-sponsors and asked them to provide the total estimated  cost for each project as of June 30, 2006, and identify factors that  contributed to increases in project costs. However, in 2000, the state of  Florida discontinued reporting acquisition costs for lands not yet acquired  for habitat protection. Therefore, the Task Force did not include these  costs in its 2002 through 2006 reports. Instead, to account for future land  costs in its 2004 Biennial Report, the Task Force computed a range of  estimated costs for future land acquisitions using a low and a high price  per acre. Moreover, the 2000 Task Force restoration cost estimate  consisted of total estimated costs for some projects, and total remaining  costs for other projects. In some instances where the cost estimate  provided a total remaining project cost, this was listed as \u201cto be  determined,\u201d because the Task Force did not identify a cost for land still to  be purchased. The 2006 restoration cost estimate we developed also  includes total estimated costs for some projects, and total remaining costs  for other projects. However, we developed cost estimates for some  projects whose costs were previously listed as \u201cto be determined.\u201d  Specifically, we conservatively estimated total remaining project costs for  uncompleted land acquisitions by multiplying the remaining acreage to be  purchased using the same low price per acre that the Task Force used in  computing these land costs in 2004. This difference in methodology could  account for some part of the estimated cost increase we report; however,  we did not assess the potential impact of this difference. In addition, for  the lead agencies that did not or could not provide estimated project costs  as of June 30, 2006, we used the estimated project costs these agencies  had provided in the 2005 Integrated Financial Plan and converted the costs  to constant 2006 dollars. We realize that converting these 2005 project  costs to 2006 dollars may not capture all of the factors that may contribute  to increases in project costs, but given the small number of projects  involved\u201430\u2014we do not believe the omission of some contributing  factors would significantly alter the total estimated cost of the restoration.  In arriving at a total estimated cost for the restoration for 2000 and 2006,  we added together the estimated project costs, future land costs, and non- project estimated costs for each year. Having calculated total estimated  restoration costs for 2000 and 2006, we subtracted the 2000 total estimated  restoration cost from the 2006 total estimated restoration cost to  determine the increase in the total estimated cost of the restoration. In  reporting the cost data in total and by category type, we used cost  amounts that were sometimes rounded to the nearest million and  sometimes to the nearest billion.", "In determining the reliability of the project and program support cost  estimates, we researched and reviewed audit reports prepared by  agencies\u2019 internal auditors, inspectors general, and outside independent  auditors for fiscal years 1999 through 2006 for information on actual costs  incurred. For estimated costs, we reviewed the processes and policies the  Corps and SFWMD used to estimate the costs for completing the projects.  We limited our data reliability review to the following agencies that were  lead project sponsors because they are responsible for tracking and  reporting project costs. These agencies were the Department of  Agriculture, the Corps, the Department of the Interior, SFWMD, and  FDEP. Our review of the audit reports and cost estimation policies and  procedures indicated that the cost data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this review.", "To identify the primary models that can be used to guide the restoration  and their interfaces, we obtained and analyzed key documents from  managers and scientists at the Corps, the Department of the Interior,  SFWMD, and other participating agencies. We also researched academic  and model Web sites to identify additional information related to models  and interfaces for the restoration. From these sources, we compiled a  universe of over 100 mathematical models available for the restoration  effort. Additionally, we conducted interviews with agency scientists and  managers, and other stakeholders, including the external scientific  community, to determine which models are considered primary to guide  the restoration and to obtain additional information about these models.  We defined primary models as those that have broad application for use at  the project, sub-regional, or regional level. Through our conversations  with agency scientists and managers, and our analysis of agency  documents and academic and model Web sites, we identified 27 primary  models. We also determined who developed the models, the type, and  study area of the models, and the interfaces for each of the models.
