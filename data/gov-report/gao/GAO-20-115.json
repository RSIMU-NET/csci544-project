Internal control comprises the plans, methods, and  procedures used to meet an agency\u2019s mission, goals, and objectives.

Some control sets contained both controls that SEC  designated as internal supervisory controls and those that it did not so  designate.

We judgmentally selected 18 internal supervisory  controls from the population of 39 internal supervisory controls reviewed  in the third objective, based on whether the controls were labeled as key  to achieving objectives, high-risk, potentially having a major impact, or as  having a likelihood of failure. For these controls, we reviewed  documentation of control implementation to determine if the procedures  outlined in the controls\u2019 designs were followed.

For example, OCIE no longer  classifies examination program strategy and selection controls (such as  development and dissemination of examination program goals) as  internal supervisory controls. Therefore, the controls are no longer  assessed under section 961.

Following SEC guidance for developing detailed control  activities could help divisions and offices ensure evidence of control  execution and better enable control monitoring by SEC and external  parties, such as GAO and the SEC Inspector General.

We examined (1) the extent to which SEC\u2019s internal  supervisory control framework during fiscal years 2016\u20132018 reflected  federal internal control standards; (2) how SEC evaluated the  effectiveness of staff procedures in fiscal year 2018; (3) the extent to  which selected controls in fiscal year 2018 were designed consistent with  relevant standards; and (4) the extent to which selected controls operated  as intended in fiscal year 2018.", "For our first objective, we obtained and reviewed relevant documentation  on SEC\u2019s internal supervisory control framework for fiscal years 2016\u2013 2018 and interviewed division and office staff responsible for developing  and updating the framework. We then assessed this framework against  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government and determined  the extent to which the framework reflected these standards. Specifically,  we assessed the framework against the five components of internal  control\u2014control environment, risk assessment, control activities,  information and communication, and monitoring\u2014and the 17 principles  associated with these components. We compared information on  changes SEC made to its internal supervisory control framework with  information from our previous review and federal internal control  standards to determine the extent to which the framework continued to  reflect internal control standards.", "For our second objective, we reviewed policies, procedures, and  guidance documents (for fiscal year 2018) relating to SEC assessments  of the effectiveness of procedures applicable to staff who perform  examinations of registered entities, enforcement investigations, and  reviews of corporate financial securities filings. We also interviewed SEC  staff to obtain an understanding of the steps and activities that divisions  and offices take to assess the effectiveness of staff procedures. We  intended to assess how SEC assessed staff procedures to determine the  extent to which SEC\u2019s assessments reflected federal internal control  standards. However, as discussed in the report, we found SEC did not  have a framework for assessing the effectiveness of staff procedures. We  therefore examined policies, procedures, and guidance, but did not  assess them against the components and principles associated with the  federal standards for internal control.", "For our third objective, we used the policies, procedures, and control  objectives to determine if the design of selected division and office  internal supervisory controls in place during fiscal year 2018 was  consistent with federal internal control standards and SEC guidance for  designing internal controls. We developed an evaluation template and  used it to assess selected controls from each division and office by  having multiple analysts conduct independent reviews and then reached  a final consensus by conducting a joint review with the same analysts.  We used Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government and  The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway  Commission\u2019s Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework to develop our  template.

We grouped these  controls into sets because some underlying staff processes had multiple  associated controls. In cases in which we selected a control that was part  of a set, we would review every control in the associated set. We selected  controls and control sets that SEC designated as being associated with  processes that have the highest risk or potential impact on achieving  stated objectives until we reached our target of 10\u201315 controls per  division or office. Some control sets also contained controls that were not  related to section 961. Therefore, to fully assess complete control sets  associated with underlying processes, our selection contained some  controls that were not related to section 961.

We  used the template to determine the extent to which the execution of  controls met the design criteria. Depending on the extent to which they  met criteria established from control design documents, the selected  controls were grouped under one of the following categories: (1) operated  as intended, (2) partially operated as intended, (3) did not operate as  intended, and (4) could not be assessed because control documentation  did not exist due to design weaknesses, was not received, or was not  relevant.", "Because the nature of controls varied, we evaluated controls by applying  the factors below in conjunction with professional judgment.

We then created a  generalizable, random sample of cases to review for eight controls, and  we reviewed all instances for the remaining controls because they  occurred annually or had few instances.
