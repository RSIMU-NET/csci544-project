The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) required GAO to study ambulance service costs. GAO examined providers' costs of ground ambulance transports in 2004 and factors that contributed to cost differences; average Medicare ambulance payments expected under the national fee schedule in 2010 and how those payments will relate to providers' costs per transport; and changes that occurred in Medicare beneficiaries' use of ambulance transports from 2001 to 2004. GAO estimated costs of ambulance transports based on a nationally representative survey of 215 ambulance providers that did not share costs with nonambulance services. Providers that shared costs with other institutions or services and could not report their costs for ambulance services separately, such as fire departments, were excluded because their reported costs appeared unreliable. GAO used its survey, Medicare claims, and other data for its analyses."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Costs of ground ambulance services were highly variable across providers that did not share costs with nonambulance services in 2004, reflecting differences in certain provider and community characteristics. Costs per transport among these providers varied from $99 per transport to $1,218. Providers without shared costs that had higher costs per transport typically had fewer transports per year, a greater percentage of transports in which more than a basic medical intervention occurred, more transports in super-rural areas (rural counties with lowest population density), lower productivity--measured as number of transports furnished per staffed hour, and a greater percentage of revenues from local tax support. Average payments under the national fee schedule in 2010 are expected to be higher than historical payments, but providers' Medicare margins will vary greatly. GAO could not assess whether, on average, providers without shared costs would break even, lose, or profit under the national fee schedule, because the average Medicare margin for providers without shared costs was estimated to fall from negative 14 percent to positive 2 percent. However, GAO estimated that approximately 39 to 56 percent of providers without shared costs would have average Medicare payments above their average cost per transport under the national fee schedule in 2010. From 2001 to 2004, utilization of ambulance transports per beneficiary increased 16 percent overall. However, use declined by 8 percent in super-rural areas. Declining utilization coupled with potentially negative Medicare margins in super-rural areas, which could be exacerbated when the MMA temporary payment provisions expire, raise questions as to whether Medicare payments will be adequate to support beneficiary access in super-rural areas."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2005, ambulance service providers completed more than 12.6 million  ground transports for Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare paid more than   $4 billion for ground ambulance transports and is likely the largest single  payer of ambulance services in the United States.", "As part of a series of Medicare payment reforms in 1997, Congress  required the Health Care Financing Administration, now the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), to develop a national fee schedule  for Medicare ambulance services, which was implemented in 2002.  Historically, CMS had used two methods to pay for ambulance services,  which resulted in wide variations in payment for the same service among  different types of ambulance service providers. In particular, CMS had  used one method\u2014reasonable costs\u2014to pay hospital-based providers. It  used another method\u2014reasonable charges\u2014to pay other, nonhospital- based types of ambulance service providers. This meant that hospital- based and nonhospital-based providers were paid different amounts for  the same ambulance services.", "In 2002, CMS began phasing in a national fee schedule that established a  single payment method for all ambulance services regardless of the type of  provider. This fee schedule standardized Medicare payments for  ambulance services. In general, providers strive to keep their costs of  delivering a service at or below the standard fee schedule rate for that  service. Under the Medicare ambulance national fee schedule, providers  that have costs of delivering ambulance services above the fee schedule  payment lose the difference between the payment amount and their costs,  while providers with costs below the fee schedule payment are able to  keep the difference between the payment amount and their costs. In  aggregate, these differences are known as Medicare margins and express  whether the provider makes a profit or loss on its Medicare transports.  Some providers rely heavily on Medicare revenues and adequate Medicare  margins help ensure the continuing availability of beneficiaries\u2019 access to  ambulance services.", "CMS phased in the ambulance national fee schedule from April 2002  through December 2005. During this transition, the new fee schedule  payments were blended with the previous reasonable-cost payments for  hospital-based providers and reasonable-charge payments for nonhospital- based providers. In 2003, Congress passed the Medicare Prescription Drug,  Improvement and Modernization Act (MMA), which introduced several  temporary payment provisions, including a regional fee schedule that  overlapped with the transition to the national fee schedule. Beginning in  July 2004, these temporary payment provisions were expected to add  about $840 million to Medicare payments for ambulance services through  December 2009, when the last of these provisions are set to expire.", "The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection  Act of 2000 and the MMA required GAO to study ambulance service costs.  As discussed with the congressional committees of jurisdiction, in this  report we (1) examined the differences in providers\u2019 costs of ambulance  transports in 2004 and the factors that contributed to these cost  differences, (2) assessed how the ambulance national fee schedule in 2010  is expected to affect average ambulance payments and how those  payments will relate to providers\u2019 costs per transport, (3) determined the  effect of MMA temporary payment provisions on ambulance payments,  and (4) described the change that occurred in Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 use  of ambulance transports from 2001 to 2004.", "To examine differences in costs of providing ambulance transports, we  conducted a national survey of ambulance providers in 2005. In our  survey, we requested information about providers\u2019 costs, revenues,  transports, and organizational characteristics for their most recently  completed fiscal year. We selected a stratified, random sample of 500  eligible providers that billed Medicare, and we received 321 completed  questionnaires for a response rate of 64 percent. We used this nationally  representative sample of 321 providers to describe the ambulance  industry. However, after excluding two cost outliers, our analysis was  further limited to a subgroup of providers that (1) did not share costs with  other institutions or services or (2) shared costs but reported costs of  ambulance services separately from the costs of their other services. Our  analysis and findings are nationally representative of this subgroup of  ambulance providers, which we refer to as providers without shared  costs. We excluded 104 providers that shared costs of ambulance  services with other institutions or nonambulance services and could not  distinguish their costs for providing ambulance services from other costs,  including but not limited to all fire departments. We excluded these  providers because their reported costs appeared to be unreliable. The  resulting sample size for our analysis was 215 providers without shared  costs. Although our sample is nationally representative of an estimated  5,200 providers without shared costs, the small sample size along with the  variability of responses reduces the precision of our estimates, increasing  the range of the 95 percent confidence intervals we report. A 95 percent  confidence interval is the range within which we expect the true  population estimate to fall 95 percent of the time, and it is the range of the  confidence interval that expresses the precision of our estimates.", "To examine factors that contributed to differences in costs, we used our  survey data and Medicare data supplemented by data from two other  sources. The Oil Price Information Service was our source for the average  annual retail price of fuel by zip code, and the United States Postal Service  supplied building rents because it tracks its facility costs in each zip code.  We used regression analysis to analyze the relationships between various  provider and local area characteristics and cost per transport among  providers without shared costs. We also compared Medicare claims data  for all nonrespondents with those of respondent providers without shared  costs and determined that our cost estimates were not biased by  nonresponse. See appendix I for details regarding our survey, other data  sources, data limitations, and the analytic methods we employed.", "To assess the effect of the ambulance national fee schedule on payments,  we used Medicare claims data to compute average payments for  ambulance transports in 2001, before the implementation of the  ambulance national fee schedule, and in 2004, 2 years after the phase-in of  the fee schedule had begun. For Medicare payment analyses, payments  were expressed in 2004 dollars to exclude the effects of inflation. We also  compared average payments for urban, rural, and super-rural transports.  We used Medicare claims data and payment formulas as specified in  federal regulations to simulate average payments under the national fee  schedule in 2010, after all of the MMA provisions expire, but computed  these payments in 2004 dollars, the year that best reflects the cost data  collected in our survey. To compare the simulated Medicare payments  under the national fee schedule for providers without shared costs with  the costs per transport of those providers, we computed providers\u2019  Medicare margins\u2014the percentage difference between average Medicare  payments and providers\u2019 costs per transport. All costs per transport and  provider margins are based solely on our sample of providers without  shared costs, and for this reason, these estimates are reported with their  confidence intervals.", "We also assessed the effect of the MMA temporary payment provisions on  payments in 2004 using Medicare claims data by examining the change in  payments from the first half of the year, before the MMA changes went  into effect, with the second half of the year, when MMA payment  provisions had their maximum effect. To assess the change in Medicare  beneficiaries\u2019 use of ambulance transports from 2001 to 2004, we used  Medicare claims and CMS enrollment data, which contain information  about beneficiaries, to compute transports per 1,000 beneficiaries for both  years.", "We tested the internal consistency and reliability of our survey data and all  non-Medicare data sources and determined that all data sources were  adequate for our purposes. We conducted our work from July 2004  through April 2007 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Ground ambulance services are provided by a wide range of organizations  that differ in their organizational structure, types of services offered,  staffing, and revenue sources. Local conditions\u2014including whether  providers are affiliated with other organizations; whether their service  areas are predominately urban, rural, or super-rural; and the amount of  community-dedicated revenues\u2014contribute to this diversity.", "In addition, communities have few, if any, tools to help them decide the  optimal organizational structure, staffing, or amount of funding for  ambulance services, given local conditions. Although there have been  efforts to establish national performance or quality standards, there is  limited information about how to best evaluate the costs of providing  ambulance services in a community. In recent years, industry associations  and federal agencies have worked to develop a data system and  mechanisms for measuring the performance of emergency medical  services (EMS); however, these tools cannot yet be applied to measure  performance and evaluate the efficiency of ambulance services. The lack  of data and performance standards makes it difficult to assess whether  any given provider is delivering quality care or whether services are being  provided efficiently.", "Organizational structures differ in that some ambulance providers are  affiliated with another institution, such as a hospital or fire department,  and in that providers may or may not offer other types of services, such as  hospital services, fire suppression, rescue, or wheelchair transportation.  Providers affiliated with another institution or that offer other types of  services may share resources and operational costs, such as building  space, administrative support, or personnel, with these other entities and  services. About two-fifths of the ambulance industry shared operational  costs with other institutions or services in 2004. Nine percent of the  ambulance industry was affiliated with a hospital, while 37 percent was  affiliated with a fire department and 21 percent was affiliated with another  government agency. Other communities (33 percent of the ambulance  industry in 2004) were served by freestanding, for-profit or not-for-profit  provider organizations.", "The types of services offered and the staff employed also vary among  providers. Some providers perform only emergency transports, in  response to a 911 or equivalent call, while other providers offer  nonemergency transports, which are typically transfers from one facility to  another and may be scheduled in advance. In 2004, 45 percent of the  ambulance industry performed only emergency transports; 55 percent  performed emergency and nonemergency transports. Some providers  perform only basic life support (BLS) transports because their staff are  not certified to perform more intensive medical assessments and  interventions, such as advanced life support (ALS) and other more  complex services. In 2004, 9 percent of the ambulance industry specialized  in only ALS and more complex Medicare transports, such as those  requiring one or more ALS services or respiratory care; 14 percent  performed only BLS Medicare transports; and 86 percent provided a mix  of BLS, ALS, and more complex Medicare transports. Fire departments  are more likely to be specialized in ALS and more complex services.  According to the fire departments that responded to our survey,   70 percent of their Medicare transports, on average, required ALS or more  complex services; for other providers ALS and more complex transport  services constituted only 49 percent of their Medicare transports.", "Ambulance providers use of a variety of staff to deliver services to their  communities. First, providers and communities determine what  proportion of their staff will be emergency medical technicians (EMT)  trained to perform BLS services, and what proportion will be EMT- intermediates or paramedics, who have training to perform more intensive  ALS interventions. In 2004, 77 percent of providers that completed our  survey reported having at least one staff member trained as a paramedic,  nurse, or physician, but the remaining 23 percent of respondent providers  relied on staff with less training than a paramedic. Other staffing choices  include whether to employ career-oriented paid staff, rely on volunteers,  or use a mix of paid and volunteer staff. Some providers choose to employ  cross-trained staff. In 2004, two-fifths of the ambulance industry relied  substantially on volunteer staff. In addition, providers and communities  make different choices about whether to maintain backup vehicles and  staff or to rely to a greater extent on nearby providers for backup  assistance.", "Providers\u2019 service areas can be urban, rural, super-rural, or a mix of areas.  During 2004, CMS defined urban transports as those that originate within  metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) and New England county  metropolitan areas (NECMA), rural transports as those that originate in  rural counties that are outside of MSAs and NECMAs, and super-rural  transports as those that originate in the bottom 25 percent of rural areas as  defined by population density. About half of the ambulance providers  served predominately urban areas, and the other half served  predominately rural and super-rural areas. However, three-fourths of all  Medicare transports originated in urban areas. Therefore, rural and super- rural providers performed fewer transports on average than urban  providers. In addition, rural and super-rural transports were longer than  urban transports, on average, requiring more time and resources per  transport. In 2004, urban Medicare transports averaged 7 miles, while rural  Medicare transports averaged 13 miles and Medicare transports from  super-rural areas averaged 20 miles.", "Providers have several potential revenue sources depending on their  communities and their choices about funding ambulance services.", "Revenue sources can include community tax support (such as revenue  from local governments); charitable donations; state and federal grants;  subscription programs; and reimbursements from Medicare or Medicaid  patients, and private health insurance companies. Not all providers receive  revenues from all sources, and the mix and amount of revenues available  may vary. For example, 48 percent of the ambulance industry indicated  that a state or local government approves the fees they may choose to  charge. In communities that limit ambulance providers\u2019 fees, providers  may bill Medicare (and other payers) less than the allowed amount and  therefore do not receive the maximum Medicare payment allowed for their  services. In 2004, Medicare payments for ambulance transports accounted  for 31 percent of the providers\u2019 revenues, on average, while Medicare  beneficiaries accounted for about 40 percent of their transports during  that same year. However, the percentage of Medicare revenues among  providers ranged from less than 1 percent to 80 percent. Furthermore,  different communities provide different levels of tax support to address  specific issues, such as ensuring a minimum level of service in remote  areas or being equipped with more sophisticated transport vehicles or  having more highly trained staff."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Medicare Ambulance National Fee Schedule", "paragraphs": ["The ambulance national fee schedule was part of a series of payment  reforms to make Medicare a more equitable and prudent purchaser of  health care services. Phased in from April 2002 through December 2005,  the national fee schedule standardized payment rates and reduced wide  variations in payments for the same service.", "Medicare ambulance payments under the fee schedule have two  components: a base-rate payment and a mileage payment. The base-rate  component of ambulance payments under the fee schedule consists of the  relative value unit (RVU), the conversion factor (CF), and a geographic  adjustment factor. Ambulance RVUs account for the relative resources  needed to provide services during an ambulance transport. The  ambulance CF converts the RVU into a payment expressed in dollars and  is set by CMS annually. Ambulance base-rate payments are also adjusted  by a geographic practice cost index (GPCI), which is intended to account  for regional differences in the cost of providing ambulance services. The  mileage component consists of the number of miles traveled during an  ambulance transport multiplied by the applicable mileage rate. (See fig. 1  for an example of the payment formula.)", "The ambulance national fee schedule was phased in from April 2002  through December 2005 by blending new fee schedule payments with  historical payments. During this transition, the national fee schedule  portion constituted a greater share of the total blended ambulance  payment each year until January 2006, when the historical payment  portion of the blend was discontinued. For example, in the latter part of  2002, total ambulance payments were a blend of 20 percent under the  national fee schedule and 80 percent under the historical payment system.  In 2004, the blend was 60 percent national fee schedule and 40 percent  historical payment system.

The  MMA provisions increased payment rates for urban and rural transports  and for transports 51 miles or greater. The MMA also provided a  significant base rate increase for transports originating in super-rural areas  and provided for a new regional fee schedule based on the nine census  divisions.", "The regional fee schedule was designed to ease the transition from the  historical payment system to the national fee schedule. The introduction  of the regional fee schedule overlapped with the phase-in of the national  fee schedule. The regional fee schedule gave temporarily higher  ambulance payments than what would generally be paid under the  national fee schedule to ambulance providers in census divisions that had  historically higher payments. If the regional base-rate payment was  determined to be greater than the national base-rate payment for a  particular region, then the region received the more advantageous blend of  the regional fee schedule base-rate payment and the national fee schedule  base-rate payment. For example, in the second half of 2004 under the  regional fee schedule, affected regions received a blend of 80 percent of  their regional fee schedule base-rate payment and 20 percent of the  national fee schedule base payment rate. This base-rate payment was then  further blended with historical payments as a part of the gradual phase-in  of the ambulance national fee schedule. The regional fee schedule  component of the base rate blend was reduced each year from 2005  through 2007, and expires at the end of 2009.

As a result, base  rate payments for transports originating in super-rural areas increased  about 23 percent. The MMA also provided for a 25 percent increase in the  mileage rate for every ambulance mile traveled exceeding 50.

Therefore,  ambulance providers that can control their costs per transport may have  an advantage over those that cannot control their costs per transport.", "A 2003 GAO study found that transport costs are likely to be higher in less  densely populated rural areas because rural providers furnish fewer  transports and because fewer transports were linked to higher costs per  transport. As a result, we recommended that CMS adjust payments for  transports in rural counties with particularly low population density to  help ensure Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 access to ambulance services in those  areas. Subsequently, the MMA increased payments for super-rural  transports from July 1, 2004, through December 31, 2009.

Our analysis affirms the finding of our prior work, that  volume of transports was the main characteristic affecting providers\u2019 costs  per transport. Because most ambulance costs are fixed, and therefore do  not increase significantly when a provider completes more transports, it is  expected that as the number of transports provided increases, associated  costs per transport will be lower. In 2004, the volume of transports  completed by a provider without shared costs ranged from 21 to more  than 50,000. Estimated average cost per transport is reduced, from $464  for providers without shared costs completing 2,000 or fewer transports a  year to $327 for those completing from 3,001 to 4,000 transports. Although  estimated average cost per transport is slightly higher for 4,001 to 5,000  transports, rising to $330, and again above 6,000 transports, rising to $330,  every other volume category of provider without shared costs had lower  estimated average costs per transport than the lowest volume group of  2,000 transports or less.", "Also, as expected, we observed that average costs per transport were  higher for providers without shared costs that also had a greater  percentage of ALS and more complex transports (compared with BLS  transports) and those with a greater percentage of super-rural transports  (compared with urban transports)\u2014two characteristics incorporated into  the national fee schedule to account for the additional costliness  associated with more intensive services and isolated service areas. ALS  and more complex transports completed by providers without shared  costs ranged from 0 to 100 percent of transports provided. We estimated  that providers without shared costs specializing in ALS and more complex  transport services had average costs of $476, which was 32 percent higher  than providers without shared costs specializing in BLS transport services.  We estimated that the average cost of a super-rural transport was $545,  while the average cost of an urban transport was $358. Rural transports  were not significantly higher cost than urban transports.", "Two other provider characteristics\u2014productivity and amount of local tax  support\u2014were also associated with higher average costs per transport.  Costs were higher when providers without shared costs had lower  productivity or a lower ratio of transports per staffed hour. The average  level of productivity for providers without shared costs was 0.12, or about  one transport per 8 staffed hours, and had an estimated average cost per  transport of $437. The second highest level of productivity for these  providers was 0.64, or more than five transports per 8 staffed hours, and  had an estimated average cost per transport of $386. The impact of  productivity on average costs may be explained by the fixed costs incurred  in maintaining readiness\u2014having an ambulance and crew available to  respond to emergency calls. Although providers may have discretion about  staffing and the ability to make backup arrangements to substitute for  additional staff, not all providers can increase productivity by increasing  the number of transports they provide or reducing the number of staffed  ambulance hours. For example, providers that operate in small or isolated  communities with one ambulance on call may serve only their own  community\u2019s needs and may not be able to expand their service area or  increase their volume of ambulance transports.", "Average costs were also higher for providers without shared costs that  derived a larger percentage of their total revenues from local tax support.  Among providers without shared costs, those with the largest percentage  of revenues from local tax support (81 percent of revenues) had estimated  average costs that were $240, or 61 percent, above those with no local tax  support. Again, this effect was independent of volume and mix of  transports, service area, cost of labor, use of volunteers, productivity, and  other provider and local area characteristics. The relationship between  greater local tax support and higher average costs may be explained as the  income effect: if an organization has more money, it is able to and likely to  spend more. Moreover, if costs increase without resulting in additional  transports, the average cost per transport will increase.", "Characteristics that did not significantly contribute to the variability of  average costs per transport among providers without shared costs  included type of provider; a provider\u2019s region, as measured by the nine  census divisions that defined the regional fee schedule; building rent; and  the price of fuel."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Average Payments under the National Fee Schedule Will Be Greater Than Average Historical Payments, but Providers\u2019 Expected Medicare Margins Will Vary Greatly", "paragraphs": ["Average ambulance national fee schedule payments in 2010 are estimated  to be 3 percent higher overall than payments in 2001, after adjusting for  inflation and assuming that providers bill the maximum amounts allowed.

For  example, some communities may prefer to fund the greater costs of  operating at a higher level of readiness or being equipped with more  sophisticated transport vehicles and more highly trained staff. Other  providers and communities have little or no control over the  characteristics that affect providers\u2019 cost per transport. These  communities, particularly more rural areas with low population density,  may be constrained by local conditions, including their financial  resources. Therefore, local conditions and community preferences may  explain some of the predicted variability in the financial experience of  providers without shared costs under the Medicare national fee schedule.", "We are unable to discern whether providers without shared costs would  be compensated appropriately under the national fee schedule for two  reasons. First, when providers experience the national fee schedule  payments in 2010 after all of the MMA temporary payment provisions  expire, they may make changes to control or reduce their costs. The cost  data we collected were from 2004 and may not reflect any changes  providers may make to control or reduce their costs in response to the  national fee schedule. Second, we did not assess if Medicare beneficiaries  are receiving quality care that is delivered efficiently. There are no  national performance standards to use as benchmarks for determining  quality and efficiency of services or for assessing whether providers could  increase productivity by increasing the number of transports they provide  or by reducing the number of staffed ambulance hours.

The decline in use of super-rural ground ambulance transports  from 2001 to 2004, a time when payments for super-rural transports were  increased, suggests that Medicare payment levels may not be linked to the  decreased utilization of transports in super-rural areas.

The second half of 2004  represented a period after the introduction of MMA provisions when the  regional fee schedule had its greatest effect.", "In general, average Medicare payments were estimated as the sum of the  average base rate payment\u2014that is, the amount paid for the level of  service\u2014and the average mileage payment. Base rate payments and  mileage payments for each period were computed separately. Average  Medicare payments were calculated nationally; by census division; and by  urban, rural, and super-rural areas. All payments are expressed in 2004  dollars.", "For the first half of 2004, the average base rate payment was calculated by  dividing total base rate payments by the total number of transports  provided in the first half of 2004. For 2001 and the second half of 2004, the  average service-level base payment rate was calculated by dividing total  base rate payments for each level of service by the total number of  transports provided at each level of service. Then we computed a  weighted average base rate payment for 2001 and for the second half of  2004 by applying the percentage of transports for each level of service  (also known as the mix of services) for the first half of 2004 to the service- level base payment rates in 2001 and the second half of 2004, respectively.  The 2001 payments were adjusted to 2004 dollars by multiplying weighted  average base rate payment by the ratio of the 2004 Consumer Price Index  for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) over the 2001 CPI-U.", "For simulated 2010 base rate payments, we multiplied the 2004 conversion  factor (CF) and applicable relative value unit (RVU) for each level of  service to compute the service level payments. Then, we computed a  weighted average base rate payment by applying the service mix from the  first half of 2004 to the 2004 service-level payments. The weighted average  base-rate payment was adjusted for regional differences in the cost of  providing ambulance services by the GPCI. In accordance with CMS\u2019s  payment methodology, only 70 percent of the average base rate payment  was adjusted by the GPCI.", "Average mileage payments were calculated by multiplying the average  miles per transport in each geographic level from the first half of 2004 by  mileage rates in the other periods. (See tables 12 and 13.) For example,  when estimating average 2001 mileage payments for urban transports, the  2001 mileage rate applicable to urban areas was used, but the average  mile per transport in urban areas for the first half of 2004 was applied. For  simulated payments in 2010, mileage rates from the first half of 2004 were  applied. For average national and census division mileage payments,  weighted mileage rates were applied reflecting the applicable percentage  of urban and rural miles in the first half of 2004. Because the average mile  per transport for super-rural areas was above 17, simulated payments for  super-rural areas were computed using the two rural mileage rates\u2014$8.48  for miles 1 through 17 and $5.65 for miles 18 through 50."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Medicare Margins", "paragraphs": ["We used simulated Medicare payments and costs per transport to compute  Medicare margins under the national fee schedule after MMA temporary  payment provisions are due to expire, to determine how much providers  stood to lose or gain. To do this, we merged the survey results with  providers\u2019 Medicare payment information from 2004. For each provider,  we computed the mix of services and the average miles per transport for  January 2004 through June 2004. This information was used to simulate  each provider\u2019s average Medicare payment under the national fee schedule  in 2010 after all MMA temporary payment provisions are set to expire on  December 31, 2009.
