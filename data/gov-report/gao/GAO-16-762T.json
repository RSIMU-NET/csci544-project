However, of significant concern was that VA (and DOD) had not identified outcome-oriented goals and metrics that would clearly define what it aims to achieve from its efforts. GAO recommended that VA develop goals and metrics, among other things. VA concurred with the recommendations and stated that it has initiated actions in response.", "VA had made progress in developing and implementing its Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS), with deployment of the initial version of the system. However, in September 2015, GAO reported that the development and implementation of the system was ongoing and noted three areas that could benefit from increased management attention: cost estimating, system availability, and system defects. The report also noted that VA had neither conducted a customer satisfaction survey nor developed goals for improving the system. GAO recommended that VA develop a plan with a time frame and a reliable cost estimate for completing VBMS, establish goals for system response time, minimize the incidences of high and medium severity system defects for future VBMS releases, assess user satisfaction, and establish satisfaction goals to promote improvement. VA agreed with the recommendations and noted steps it was taking to address them.", "Due to recent increases in utilization of VA care in the community, the department has had difficulty processing claims in a timely manner. In May 2016, GAO reported that VA officials and claims processing staff indicated that IT limitations, manual processes, and staffing challenges had delayed claims processing. The department had implemented interim measures to address some of the system's challenges, but did not expect to deploy solutions to address all challenges, including those related to IT, until fiscal year 2018 or later. Further, VA did not have a sound plan for modernizing its claims processing system, which GAO recommended it develop.

More specifically, VBA provides a variety of  benefits to veterans and their families including disability compensation,  educational opportunities, assistance with home ownership, and life  insurance. VHA provides health care services, including primary care and  specialized care, and it performs research and development to improve  veterans\u2019 needs. Lastly, NCA provides burial and memorial benefits to  veterans and their families.", "Collectively, the three components rely on approximately 340,000  employees to provide services and benefits.

The infrastructure  is to provide for data storage, transmission, and communications  requirements necessary to ensure the delivery of reliable, available, and  responsive support to all VA staff offices and administration customers,  as well as veterans.", "Toward this end, the department operates approximately 240 information  systems, manages 314,000 desktop computers and 30,000 laptops, and  administers nearly 460,000 network user accounts for employees and  contractors to facilitate providing benefits and health care to veterans.  These systems are used for the determination of benefits, benefits claims  processing, patient admission to hospitals and clinics, and access to  health records, among other services.", "For example, VBA relies on VBMS to collect and store information such  as military service records, medical examinations, and treatment records  from VA, DOD, and private medical service providers. IT also is widely  used and critically important to supporting the department in delivering  health care to veterans. VHA\u2019s systems provide capabilities to establish  and maintain electronic health records that health care providers and  other clinical staff use to view patient information in inpatient, outpatient,  and long-term care settings. Specifically, the Veterans Health Information  Systems and Technology Architecture, known as VistA, consists of many  computer applications and modules that collect, among other things,  information about a veteran\u2019s demographics, allergies, procedures,  immunizations, and medical diagnoses.", "However, a number of VA\u2019s systems are old. For example, our recent  report on legacy systems used by federal agencies identified 2 of the  department\u2019s systems as being over 50 years old and among the 10  oldest investments and/or systems that were reported by 12 selected  agencies.", "Personnel and Accounting Integrated Data (PAID)\u2014This 53-year old  system automates time and attendance for employees, timekeepers,  payroll, and supervisors. It is written in Common Business Oriented  Language (COBOL), a programming language developed in the late  1950s and early 1960s, and runs on IBM mainframes.

VA concurred with our  recommendation and stated that it is planning to retire PAID and BDN in  2017 and 2018, respectively.", "In 2014, VA issued its 6-year strategic plan, which emphasizes the  department\u2019s goal of increasing veterans\u2019 access to benefits and services,  eliminating the disability claims backlog, and ending veteran  homelessness. According to the plan, the department intends to improve  access to benefits and services through the use of improved technology  to provide veterans with access to more effective care management. The  plan also calls for VA to eliminate the disability claims backlog by fully  implementing an electronic claims process that is intended to reduce  processing time and increase accuracy. Further, the department has an  initiative under way that provides services, such as health care, housing  assistance, and job training, to end veteran homelessness. Toward this  end, VA is working with other agencies, such as the Department of Health  and Human Services, to implement more coordinated data entry systems  to streamline and facilitate access to appropriate housing and services.", "VA reported spending about $3.9 billion to improve and maintain its IT  resources in fiscal year 2015.

Among the five broad areas contributing to our determination was the  department\u2019s IT challenges. Of particular concern was the failed  modernization of a system, suspended development of another system,  and the extent of system interoperability\u2014the ability to exchange  information\u2014with DOD, which present risks to the timeliness, quality, and  safety of VA health care.", "We have reported on the department\u2019s failed attempts to modernize its  outpatient appointment scheduling system, which is about 30 years old.  Among the problems cited by VA staff responsible for scheduling  appointments are that the system requires them to use commands  requiring many keystrokes and that it does not allow them to view multiple  screens at once. Schedulers must open and close multiple screens to  check a provider\u2019s or a clinic\u2019s full availability when scheduling a medical  appointment, which is time-consuming and can lead to errors.", "In addition, we reported in May 2010 that after spending an estimated  $127 million over 9 years on its outpatient scheduling system project, VA  had not implemented any of the planned system\u2019s capabilities and was  essentially starting over by beginning a new initiative to build or purchase  another scheduling system. We also noted that VA had not developed a  project plan or schedule for the new initiative, stating that it intended to do  so after determining whether to build or purchase the new application. We  recommended that the department take six actions to improve key  systems development and acquisition processes essential to the second  outpatient scheduling system effort. The department generally concurred  with our recommendations, but as of May 2016, had not addressed four  of the six recommendations.", "Further, in January 2014, we reported that the inability to electronically  share data across facilities had led VA to suspend the development of a  system that would have allowed it to electronically store and retrieve  information about surgical implants (including tissue products) and the  veterans who receive them nationwide. Having this capability would be  particularly important in the event that a manufacturer or the Food and  Drug Administration ordered a recall on a medical device or tissue  product because of safety concerns. In the absence of a centralized  system, at the time of our report, VA clinicians tracked information about  implanted items using stand-alone systems or spreadsheets that were not  shared across VA facilities, which made it difficult for the department to  quickly determine which patients may have received an implant that was  subject to a safety recall.", "Additionally, we reported in February 2014 that VA and DOD lacked  electronic health record systems that permit the efficient electronic  exchange of patient health information as military service members  transition from DOD to VA health care systems. Since 1998, VA and  DOD have undertaken a patchwork of initiatives intended to allow their  health information systems to exchange information and increase  interoperability. Among others, these have included initiatives to share  viewable data in existing (legacy) systems, link and share computable  data between the departments\u2019 updated heath data repositories, and  jointly develop a single integrated system.", "In March 2011, the secretaries of the two departments announced that  they would develop a new, joint integrated electronic health record  system (referred to as iEHR). This was intended to replace the  departments\u2019 separate systems with a single common system, thus  sidestepping many of the challenges they had previously encountered in  trying to achieve interoperability. However, in February 2013, about 2  years after initiating iEHR, the secretaries announced that the  departments were abandoning plans to develop a joint system, due to  concerns about the program\u2019s cost, schedule, and ability to meet  deadlines. The Interagency Program Office (IPO) reported spending  about $564 million on iEHR between October 2011 and June 2013.", "In place of the iEHR initiative, VA stated that it would modernize VistA,  while DOD planned to buy a commercially available system. The  departments stated that they would ensure interoperability between these  updated systems, as well as with other public and private health care  providers. Our February 2014 report noted that the departments did not  substantiate their claims that it would be less expensive and faster than  developing a single, joint system. We have also noted that the  departments\u2019 plans to modernize their two separate systems were  duplicative and stressed that their decisions should be justified by  comparing the costs and schedules of alternate approaches. We  therefore recommended that the departments should develop cost and  schedule estimates that would include all elements of their approach (i.e.,  modernizing both departments\u2019 health information systems and  establishing interoperability between them) and compare them with  estimates of the cost and schedule for the single-system approach. If the  planned approach were projected to cost more or take longer, we  recommended that they provide a rationale for pursuing such an  approach.", "VA and DOD agreed with our prior recommendations and stated that  initial comparison indicated that the current approach would be more cost  effective. However, as of June 2016, the departments have not provided  us with a comparison of the estimated costs of their current and previous  approaches. Moreover, with respect to their assertions that separate  systems could be achieved faster, both departments have developed  schedules that indicate their separate modernizations are not expected to  be completed until after the 2017 planned completion date for the  previous single-system approach."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Evaluations Have Identified Additional IT Challenges", "paragraphs": ["To further highlight the department\u2019s IT challenges, our most recent report  in August 2015 on VA\u2019s efforts to achieve electronic health record  interoperability with DOD noted that the departments have engaged in  several near-term efforts focused on expanding interoperability between  their existing electronic health record systems. For example, the  departments analyzed data related to 25 \u201cdomains\u201d identified by the  Interagency Clinical Informatics Board and mapped health data in their  existing systems to standards identified by the IPO. The departments also  expanded the functionality of their Joint Legacy Viewer\u2014a tool that allows  clinicians to view certain health care data from both departments in a  single interface.", "In addition, VA and DOD have moved forward with plans to modernize  their respective electronic health record systems. For its part, VA has  developed a number of plans for its VistA modernization effort (known as  VistA Evolution), including an interoperability plan and a road map  describing functional capabilities to be deployed through fiscal year 2018.  According to the road map, the first set of capabilities was to be delivered  in September 2014, and was to include access to the Joint Legacy  Viewer, among other things. VA\u2019s CIO has asserted that the department  has continued to improve VistA. However, the CIO also recently indicated  that the department is taking a step back in reconsidering how best to  meet VA\u2019s future electronic health record system needs and has not  determined whether to modernize VistA or to replace it with an off-the- shelf system.", "Nevertheless, a significant concern that we identified is that VA (and  DOD) had not identified outcome-oriented goals and metrics that would  more clearly define what they aim to achieve from their interoperability  efforts and the value and benefits these efforts are intended to yield. As  we have stressed in our prior work, assessing the performance of a  program should include measuring its outcomes in terms of the results of  products or services. In this case, such outcomes could include  improvements in the quality of health care or clinician satisfaction.  Establishing outcome-oriented goals and metrics is essential to  determining whether a program is delivering value.", "In our August 2015 report, we stressed that using an effective outcome- based approach could provide VA with a more accurate picture of its  progress toward achieving interoperability with DOD and the value and  benefits generated. Accordingly, we recommended that the departments,  working with the IPO, establish a time frame for identifying outcome- oriented metrics, define related goals as a basis for determining the  extent to which the departments\u2019 modernized electronic health record  systems are achieving interoperability, and update IPO guidance  accordingly.

Further, after initial deployment, VBA continued developing and  implementing additional system functionality and enhancements to  support the electronic processing of disability compensation claims. As a  result, 95 percent of records related to veterans\u2019 disability claims are  electronic and reside in the system.", "Nevertheless, we found that VBMS was not able to fully support disability  and pension claims, as well as appeals processing. Specifically, while the  Under Secretary for Benefits stated in March 2013 that the development  of the system was expected to be completed in 2015, implementation of  functionality to fully support electronic claims processing was delayed  beyond 2015.

Without such an estimate, VA  management and the department\u2019s stakeholders had a limited view of  the system\u2019s future resource needs, and the program risked not  having sufficient funding to complete development and  implementation of the system.", "System availability: Although VBA had improved its performance  regarding system availability to users, it had not established system  response time goals. Without such goals, users did not have an  expectation of the system response times they could anticipate and  management did not have an indication of how well the system  performs relative to performance goals.", "System defects: While the program had actively managed system  defects, a recent system release included unresolved defects that  impacted system performance and users\u2019 experiences. Continuing to  deploy releases with large numbers of defects that reduce system  functionality could adversely affect users\u2019 ability to process disability  claims in an efficient manner.", "We also found in our September 2015 report that VA had not conducted a  customer satisfaction survey that would allow the department to compile  data on how users view the system\u2019s performance, and ultimately, to  develop goals for improving the system. GAO\u2019s 2014 survey of VBMS  users found that a majority of them were satisfied with the system, but  decision review officers were considerably less satisfied. Although the  results of our survey provided VBA with data about users\u2019 satisfaction  with VBMS, the absence of user satisfaction goals limited the utility of  survey results. Specifically, without having established goals to define  user satisfaction, VBA did not have a basis for gauging the success of its  efforts to promote satisfaction with the system, or for identifying areas  where its efforts to complete development and implementation of the  system might need attention.", "In our September 2015 report, we recommended that VA develop a plan  with a time frame and a reliable cost estimate for completing VBMS,  establish goals for system response time, minimize the incidence of high  and medium severity system defects for future VBMS releases, assess  user satisfaction, and establish satisfaction goals to promote  improvement.
