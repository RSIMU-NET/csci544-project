The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service has regulatory responsibility for ensuring the safety of meat, poultry, and some egg products, while the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Food and Drug Administration has regulatory responsibility for all other food products. Both these agencies inspect domestic and imported food. In addition, other federal agencies have food safety programs or responsibilities. As we have reported on many occasions, this fragmented system impedes the government\u2019s ability to efficiently and effectively oversee the safety of the food supply. Consequently, we have recommended consolidating federal food safety activities. In August 1998, the National Academy of Sciences also recommended consolidating food safety functions and suggested a number of approaches that could be considered, including a single food safety agency. Shortly after the National Academy issued its report, the President established a Council on Food Safety, which was to review and report on the Academy\u2019s report in 1999.", "To supplement the National Academy\u2019s study, you asked us to review the experiences of foreign countries that are consolidating their food safety responsibilities.

Estimates of the incidence of foodborne illness range from 6.5 million to 81 million cases each year and result in 500 to 9,100 deaths. These illnesses cost the nation between $7 billion and $37 billion annually in medical and productivity losses.", "Multiple agencies share the responsibility for regulating food safety in the United States\u201412 different federal agencies in six federal entities are involved. Our past reviews have shown inconsistencies and differences between agencies\u2019 approaches and enforcement authorities that undercut overall efforts to ensure a safe food supply. As such, we have recommended implementing a uniform, risk-based inspection system and a single food safety agency to help correct the problems created by this fragmented system.", "Fragmentation is not unique to the United States. Food safety officials in each of the four countries we visited maintained that similar fragmentation existed in their systems prior to consolidation. For example, before consolidation, the Danish food-processing sector encompassed seven laws, about 125 regulations, and more than 30 federal agencies and local offices overseeing food safety activities. Prior to Ireland\u2019s consolidation, more than 50 agencies shared food safety responsibilities.", "The four countries have recently completed or are still in the process of consolidating their activities. Specifically:", "Canada decided in 1996 to consolidate its food inspection activities into a single new agency. The new agency\u2014the Canadian Food Inspection Agency\u2014officially began operations in April 1997. However, the responsibility for setting health standards for food safety remained with Health Canada.", "Denmark phased in the consolidation of its food safety activities, beginning in 1995, by combining the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Fisheries into a single ministry\u2014the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. In December 1996, Denmark moved the food safety inspections conducted by its Health Ministry into the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries The new consolidated agency is called the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries. The district and local inspection offices of the old ministries are being reorganized into 11 regional inspection offices within the new Ministry. Once this reorganization takes place, the consolidation will be complete.", "Great Britain is in the process of consolidating its food safety activities. In September 1997, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of Health set up a work group composed of staff from both agencies\u2014known as the Joint Food Safety and Standards Group\u2014to plan the consolidation. In January 1998, the government formally proposed consolidating all food safety responsibilities under a new agency to be known as the Food Standards Agency. Final legislation establishing this agency had not been enacted as of January 1999. However, the British government expects Parliament to act on the new agency this year. Ireland approved the consolidation all of its food safety responsibilities under the umbrella of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland in July 1998. This Authority officially assumed its responsibilities in January 1999.", "The three European countries that we visited are members of the European Union and thus in some instances must follow Union directives.The European Commission, which is a regulatory body of the Union, recently made organizational changes that emphasized consumer protection in its food safety policy. The Commission has brought together certain responsibilities for consumer protection and public health for food into a single organization\u2014Directorate General XXIV\u2014which reports to the Commissioner for Consumer Policy and Health Protection. In addition, Directorate General XXIV is responsible for the relevant scientific committees in the food safety area. According to several of the European food safety officials with whom we met, these changes have made it easier for them to consolidate food safety responsibilities and to reorient newly consolidated agencies toward consumer protection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Foreign Countries\u2019 Approaches To, and Preliminary Results Of, Consolidating Food Safety Activities", "paragraphs": ["The four countries we visited had different reasons for consolidating their food safety activities, and therefore their approaches to reorganizing food safety responsibilities also differed.

None had developed performance measures and data early in the process to assess the effectiveness of their new systems."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Reasons For, and Responsibilities Of, New Food Safety Agencies", "paragraphs": ["The decisions to consolidate food safety responsibilities in the four countries we examined were based on each country\u2019s recent food safety history and economic considerations, among other things. Great Britain and Ireland chose or plan to have their newly consolidated food safety activities report to their ministers for health. In Canada, the new agency reports directly to the Minister for Agriculture. Denmark combined food safety activities with agricultural and fisheries activities, creating a new ministry.", "According to British food safety stakeholders, the British plan to consolidate food safety activities into a single agency\u2014the Food Standards Agency in the Department of Health\u2014was largely a result of the government\u2019s perceived mishandling of the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) outbreak. In Great Britain, as of February 1, 1999, the BSE outbreak has resulted in 35 human deaths from a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and has hurt the country\u2019s cattle industry: 3.7 million of Britain\u2019s 10 million cattle had to be destroyed. BSE has also had an adverse impact on the British beef export industry because the European Union banned the trading of British beef among member nations. Cattle producers have suffered large losses in the value of their animals because of depressed markets. Other industries affected by the BSE outbreak include slaughterhouses, auctioneers, truckers, and beef export firms. According to several food safety stakeholders, it was widely perceived that the fragmented and decentralized food safety system\u2014divided between several central government departments, such as the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of Health, as well as local authorities\u2014allowed this outbreak to occur. Some of the stakeholders were particularly concerned with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food\u2019s dual responsibilities to promote agriculture and the food industry as well as to regulate food safety.", "Consequently, during the 1997 election campaign for Parliament, the then candidate, and now prime minister, called for consolidating food safety responsibilities and for greater openness in the decision-making process about food safety. The public also demanded the consolidation of the food safety system as well as its removal from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. As of January 1999, British food safety officials and other stakeholders remained committed to consolidating all activities related to food, including, among other things, the management of nutrition, food safety, chemical, and other additives, genetically modified organisms, and meat hygiene and dairy inspections. The consolidated agency will report to the Secretary of State for Health\u2014the cabinet minister responsible for health. The enactment of the Food Standards Agency\u2019s enabling legislation has been delayed while budgetary and other issues are being addressed. In the interim, the government established the Joint Food Safety and Standards Group, which is jointly managed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of Health.", "Similarly in Ireland, outbreaks of foodborne illness and the potential economic consequences of real or perceived unsafe food products provided the impetus for the consolidation of food safety responsibilities into a single agency in July 1998\u2014the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. Irish food safety officials said that a succession of high-profile outbreaks of foodborne illnesses throughout the world, such as the BSE outbreak in Great Britain and the E.coli outbreak in Scotland, shook consumer confidence in the safety of food and in the ability of regulatory agencies to protect the public. In 1998, roughly 80 head of Irish cattle\u2014out of about 7 million head in total\u2014were found to be infected with BSE. These developments signaled not only a public health concern but also a potentially devastating economic problem because Ireland exports about 90 percent of the meat it produces. According to Irish food safety officials, these developments also served to highlight the difficulties that the Department of Agriculture and Food faced in trying to carry out the dual mission of protecting consumers and promoting the food industry.", "In July 1998, Ireland enacted legislation that (1) created the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, (2) made the Authority responsible for overseeing food safety activities, and (3) had the Authority report to the Minister of Health and Children. The legislation provided the Authority with the power to consolidate all food safety activities into a single agency. In exercising their new duties, as a first step, the Authority entered into service contracts with federal and local agencies to continue their food safety inspections and other activities. These contracts include mutually agreed-upon objectives and milestones. Preconsolidation funding arrangements were maintained. That is, the Parliament provides funds to agencies, which make resources available to fulfill their obligations with the Authority. According to Authority officials, if the service contracts are not satisfactorily performed, the Authority will initiate efforts to place all food safety activities under its direct control. The Authority received 6.5 million Irish pounds ($10 million in U.S. dollars) in its first year budget\u20141.5 million Irish pounds for start-up costs and 5.0 million Irish pounds for coordinating inspection services and new educational programs. The Authority took official charge of food safety on January 1, 1999.", "In contrast to Great Britain and Ireland, Canada initiated changes to its food safety activities to improve effectiveness and reduce costs. Canada did not face a loss of public confidence as did Great Britain and Ireland, but in the early 1990s, it faced a budgetary crisis and sought ways to reduce federal expenditures. By combining the various elements of its food inspection services, Canada expected to save about 13 percent of its food inspection budget, or $44 million Canadian per year, ($29 million in U.S. dollars) and improve the effectiveness of its inspection programs. In April 1997, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency began operations. While national food safety standards continue to be set by Health Canada\u2014Canada\u2019s Department of Health\u2014all federal food inspections are the responsibility of the new food inspection agency, which is also responsible for animal and plant health inspections. The new agency has the status of a departmental corporation under the Financial Administration Act, which provides the agency with the authority to raise and retain funds from its activities. In addition, from the outset the agency has had \u201cseparate employer status,\u201d which has enabled it to create its own personnel system. The new agency reports directly to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada\u2014Canada\u2019s department of agriculture.", "Denmark also launched changes to its food safety system to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness. In 1996, at the request of food safety stakeholders, Denmark sought to strengthen its efforts with respect to food safety and food quality by consolidating food safety activities in the newly created Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries. Denmark\u2019s aims were to simplify food safety administration, control, and legislation, believing that such reforms would lead to a more efficient and effective food safety system and provide assurances of the quality of Danish food products, many of which are exported. For example, prior to consolidation, three Danish ministries\u2014Health, Agriculture, and Fisheries, each with its own local food safety structure\u2014shared responsibilities for implementing food safety laws. According to the Permanent Secretary of the new ministry, the results of this fragmented approach included extensive overlapping responsibilities in some areas and gaps in coverage in other areas; inconsistent food safety inspections; and inefficient use of food safety resources. The Permanent Secretary and all other stakeholders in Denmark believe that consolidating food safety responsibilities will address these concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Countries Expect Long-Term Benefits but Are Incurring Start-Up Costs", "paragraphs": ["Officials in the four countries we visited anticipated start-up costs with the consolidation of food safety activities. These costs are in addition to the ongoing operational costs. Specifically, the new, consolidated agencies require additional funding to establish a fully operational food safety system, including such overhead costs as computers and telephones. While the countries may have similar start-up activities, their costs cannot be compared because of differences in the size of the countries, the food safety activities that will be included in these new approaches, and the infrastructure already in place before these new efforts were launched. In Denmark, the start-up cost was about 120 million kroner ($18 million in U.S. dollars, or about 3 percent of Denmark\u2019s food safety budget). Canadian officials estimated that their start-up costs were about $25 million Canadian dollars ($17 million in U.S. dollars, or about 7 percent of Canada\u2019s food safety budget). British food safety officials estimate that Great Britain will spend 30 million pounds ($49 million in U.S. dollars, or about 25 percent of the British food safety budget) for start-up over a 3-year period. According to Irish food safety officials, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland\u2019s start-up costs were about 1.5 million Irish pounds ($2 million in U.S. dollars). However, the start-up costs as a percentage of the total food safety budget could not be estimated. Canadian labor officials also noted less obvious costs, such as brief losses in productivity shortly before and immediately after consolidation.", "Over the long term, however, food safety stakeholders in all four of the countries we visited believe that the benefits of consolidating food safety activities will outweigh the additional costs. Through a more effective, streamlined approach, these officials believe, consolidated food safety agencies offer opportunities to enhance consumer protection and to improve working relationships with the food industry. Specifically, these officials believe that consolidating food safety activities would improve service delivery by providing a single contact for consumer and industry clients; reduce overlap and the duplication of services; improve or reduce the need to coordinate food safety activities, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of food safety regulation; provide more comprehensive oversight of food safety from \u201cfarm to enhance food safety, thereby providing continued access to international markets for producers and processors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "None of the Four Countries Has Developed Data for Evaluating the Effectiveness of Consolidation", "paragraphs": ["Food safety officials in all four countries said that their main priority to date has been to consolidate food safety activities. Nevertheless, they believe that evaluation is an important function. For example, in Canada, the legislation that created the Canadian Food Inspection Agency calls for performance measures. The Canadian inspection agency\u2019s first business plan for 1999 acknowledges the need to establish measures to evaluate the agency\u2019s performance. In Denmark, beginning in 1999, government officials said they plan to start using public health information, including foodborne illness data, to evaluate the effectiveness of the new organization. Great Britain has published a commitment to develop performance measures by the time the new agency begins operations. Ireland plans to introduce a system of monitoring its service contracts but has not yet determined when it would evaluate the Authority."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Lessons the Four Countries Learned From Their Experiences", "paragraphs": ["Officials in the four countries identified several lessons that can be learned from their consolidation experiences. One of the most important is developing a consensus on the need to reform the food safety system. Other lessons learned include the importance of (1) strong leadership; (2) dedicated start-up groups; (3) additional start-up funding; (4) organizational flexibility; (5) personnel integration strategies; (6) open decision-making; and (7) evaluation criteria. These lessons are discussed below.", "Consensus on the Need for Change. Officials believe that achieving consolidation requires strong support among stakeholders. This includes agreement not only on the need for a new system but also on its scope and configuration. Each of the four countries began with a highly fragmented and decentralized system. While food safety officials in these countries believe that these decentralized approaches were less than optimal, some stakeholders hesitated to embrace the new consolidated agencies.", "In Great Britain and Ireland, the health and economic threats posed by outbreaks of foodborne illnesses served as strong incentives for change.", "Although Ireland has already begun functioning under its new food safety system, as of January 1999, Great Britain had not yet passed enabling legislation. Food safety officials anticipate parliamentary action during the current session. The delay in Great Britain is occurring not because consensus is lacking about the need for consolidation but because (1) it has been difficult for stakeholders to arrive at a consensus on how to fund the new system and (2) Parliament has been occupied with a full slate of other pressing matters, such as the reform of the House of Lords. Although the government favors imposing some forms of user fees on the food industry to help pay for the new system, industry and some consumer groups generally oppose such fees. Industry groups oppose them because of the additional costs they would add to production. The consumer groups with which we met oppose user fees because they fear such fees could lead to dependence on the food industry for funding and to a conflict of interest within the new food standards agency.", "In Denmark and Canada, concerns about program effectiveness and budgetary savings drove the changes. In Denmark, food industry and consumer groups requested the government to reorganize the food safety system. In a letter to the Prime Minister, these groups called for consolidating the food safety system to improve the effectiveness of inspections. They believed that an efficient food safety system would help Denmark maintain its reputation for high-quality, safe foods\u2014especially for export markets. In Canada, officials said that initial support for a consolidated food safety approach was considerable, but food safety inspector unions presented some opposition in the hearings before Parliament. However, even this opposition faded once the new inspection agency became operational and its advantages became apparent.", "Strong leadership. Two of the four countries we visited relied upon strong leadership to get their new agencies started and to overcome initial bureaucratic opposition to change. In Ireland, a director was appointed early in the process to oversee the establishment of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. The director has been able to work effectively with consumers, industry representatives, and government officials to establish the new agency\u2019s agenda. The Authority gained credibility and support with the early appointment of its director, a well-known and respected medical doctor and veterinarian. Even before the new agency became fully operational, its director became Ireland\u2019s spokesperson on food safety issues. In speaking out on these issues, the new director was viewed as advocating consumer protection while being fair to industry. In Denmark, the Permanent Secretary of the new ministry led the reorganization of its food safety system. As of January 1999, Great Britain had not yet had a single individual in charge of the proposed new agency. Canadian officials noted that the Canadian Food Inspection Agency\u2019s first president was not appointed until late 1996, after many transition decisions had already been made. However, they also pointed out that each of the Canadian ministers involved in the transition provided strong leadership and support to the start-up group.", "Dedicated start-up groups. In Canada and Ireland, dedicated start-up groups helped ensure that the new agencies began operations in a timely fashion. For example, Canada recruited seven key officials from agencies that would be affected by the consolidation to lay the groundwork for the food inspection agency. Throughout the period leading up to the creation of Canada\u2019s food inspection agency, the affected departments made a commitment to free these key officials from day-to-day operations so they could focus on creating the new agency. In addition, these key officials obtained the financial and human resources they needed because they had management\u2019s full support. In Great Britain, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of Health established the Joint Food Safety and Standards Group, which brought together those parts of the two agencies likely to form the core of a consolidated food safety agency. As of January 1999, Great Britain had resolved many of the major issues regarding the creation of the Food Standards Agency, except the funding issue described earlier. Denmark did not rely on a start-up group because it consolidated food safety responsibilities in phases.", "Additional start-up funding. Funding for start-up activities in the three countries that have consolidated their food safety activities was handled differently, but all three found that they needed additional funds. For example, these countries had to operate dual systems (while the new systems were being brought on line, the old system had to continue to operate); purchase new equipment and office space; and standardize procedures from the different agencies involved in the consolidation. Irish officials told us that one of the keys to their early success has been having adequate start-up funds available. By contrast, Canadian officials told us that they anticipated from the outset that they would have to request more start-up funds than the amount originally allocated. Indeed, they did request additional assistance from the Parliament. For example, the new inspection agency became legally responsible for its own staffing system on April 1, 1998, a year after the agency officially opened its doors. According to Canadian officials, the delay in creating the new personnel system occurred, at least in part, because they had underestimated the funding and expertise required to develop and implement such a system. In Denmark, officials also noted the importance of additional funding for consolidation. They said they could more effectively manage additional start-up funds by phasing in food safety consolidation over several years.", "Organizational flexibility. Food safety officials in all four countries said that the new agency should have sufficient organizational flexibility to shift resources to the areas of greatest risk. For example, the new Canadian and Danish agencies can move resources from one area to another, such as moving inspectors when risk assessments indicate such movements are needed. In Ireland, officials said that the service contract arrangement may impede the agencies\u2019 ability to move resources to respond to new or increasing risks. As such, Irish food safety officials told us that they plan to evaluate the service contract arrangement in about 3 years. If, at the end of that time, the Authority believes that the service contract system does not adequately ensure the safety of the food supply, it would then move to control all food safety resources. Currently, within its service agreement context, the Authority can only request that other agencies shift their resource allocations.", "Personnel integration strategies. Integrating all of the new agency\u2019s personnel into a new organizational culture is important to ensuring its success, according to officials in two of the four countries we visited. For example, Canada recognized the need to integrate its inspection staff and to develop a new and distinct organizational culture and identity. As a result, the new agency\u2019s management devoted considerable time to obtain staff input on the agency\u2019s core mission and values. These consultations continue today to assist mangers in charting the agency\u2019s future. In Denmark, the new agency was formed from three separate ministries\u2014agriculture, health, and fisheries\u2014each with its own culture and procedures and with staff located in different offices. In order to successfully blend these disparate groups, Denmark adopted an incremental approach in which existing agencies were consolidated over a 4-year period ending in 1999. According to Danish officials, this strategy for integrating personnel has made the new food safety agency much more cohesive, and therefore more effective, than their previous system.", "Open decision-making. Openness in the new agencies\u2019 decisions and decision-making process is essential in order to maintain consensus and public confidence, according to officials in three of the four countries visited. To achieve openness, the new agencies will bring consumer protection groups into the decision-making process and will publicize food safety concerns. This approach is significantly different from previous government practices. Historically, in Great Britain and Ireland, the public was not always informed about the bases for food safety decisions and the processes by which these decisions were reached. Denmark has a similar history regarding decisions on meat products. According to officials in these countries, this lack of openness has fueled public cynicism and mistrust, especially during outbreaks of foodborne illnesses. For example, during the BSE outbreak in Great Britain, consumer groups believed that the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food withheld information from the public regarding the extent of the disease among the nation\u2019s cattle herds as well as information on the severity of the BSE threat to humans. All three European countries have made commitments to have open and transparent decision-making processes in their new food safety agencies.", "Evaluation criteria. The ability to evaluate the new consolidated system should be built in as early as possible in a new agency\u2019s development. Officials in three of the four countries believe that a new agency\u2019s goals and the criteria for evaluating the agency\u2019s progress towards these goals should be defined. Some of the criteria suggested for measuring the effectiveness of a new agency include (1) downward trends in the incidence of foodborne illnesses, (2) increases in the level of confidence the public has in the new agency, and (3) an a reduction in bacterial levels on food products, such as meat and poultry. However, no single criterion should be relied upon exclusively to measure the effectiveness of a new agency\u2019s approaches; rather, a combination of measures should be used. In evaluating the Canadian Food Inspection Agency\u2019s first year of operations, the Canadian Auditor General found that agency lacked specific performance expectations and therefore concluded that it was difficult to determine what the Agency was trying to achieve. As discussed earlier, both Canada and Denmark plan to begin developing criteria for and measuring the effectiveness of their consolidation efforts in 1999."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Four Countries Visited", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the food safety agencies of Canada, Denmark, Great Britain, and Ireland.

According to a 1998 report by the Canadian Auditor General, in the early 1990s, the government reviewed programs to determine more efficient and effective approaches to delivering government service. These reviews were conducted in large part because of serious deficit and debt problems, as well as changing public perceptions and expectations about the role and performance of government. Following these reviews, the government initiated changes in at least four areas, including food inspection, and began to introduce alternative ways of providing services. All of the Canadian food safety stakeholders with whom we met agreed that this emphasis on alternative ways of doing business helped address budget problems, improved program efficiency and effectiveness, reduced duplication and overlap, and helped create the right environment in which to consolidate responsibilities for food safety inspections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Responsibilities in the Old and New Food Safety Systems", "paragraphs": ["Prior to the creation of the new Canadian Food Inspection Agency, three departments\u2014Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Health Canada, and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans\u2014provided inspection and related services for food safety, animal and plant health, and agricultural inputs, that is, animal feed, seed, and fertilizer. Generally, Health Canada was responsible for ensuring the health and safety of all food in Canada. Health Canada typically evaluated and set standards for food safety, managed crises caused by outbreaks of foodborne illnesses, issued recalls, conducted domestic product inspections, investigated consumer complaints, and audited Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada\u2019s and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans\u2019 efforts to ensure compliance with food safety standards. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and the Department of Fisheries had health and safety responsibilities for the food products under their jurisdiction. For example, Agriculture set meat and poultry standards for international trade and domestic commerce; registered feed, seed, and fertilizer products; inspected imported and domestic products, such as meat, poultry, dairy, fruits, and vegetables; and reviewed the labeling and processing of products.
