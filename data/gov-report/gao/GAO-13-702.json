Specifically, the Food and Drug Administration  Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA) enacted section 503A of the FDCA.  This section exempted drug products compounded by a pharmacist or  physician based on a valid prescription for a compounded product that is  necessary for the identified patient from three key provisions of the FDCA  that are otherwise applicable to drugs, provided the pharmacy had,  among other conditions, not solicited prescriptions or advertised or  promoted the compounded drugs.", "In 2001, however, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit  struck down all of the advertising, promotion, and solicitation provisions of  section 503A of the FDCA because those provisions violated the Free  Speech Clause of the First Amendment. The court also held that,  because these provisions could not be severed from the remainder of  section 503A, all of section 503A was invalid. In 2002, the United States  Supreme Court struck down the law\u2019s advertising, promotion, and  solicitation restrictions without addressing whether the rest of   section 503A remained law. As a result, FDA issued a revised version of  its compliance policy guide on drug compounding in 2002, which provides  guidance, in light of the Ninth Circuit and Supreme Court decisions, on  the types of factors the agency will consider in determining whether to  take enforcement action against drug compounders for violations of the  FDCA. These factors include activities, such as offering compounded  drug products at wholesale, that suggest a drug compounder is engaged  in drug manufacturing, rather than drug compounding.

Using the Iowa nonresident licensed pharmacy list as a starting point,  NABP sent Iowa\u2019s list to each state to confirm information regarding these  pharmacies, such as whether the pharmacy has been disciplined,  whether it is engaged in sterile compounding, or whether it is engaged in  \u201cnontraditional\u201d compounding activities. In addition, NABP asked all states  to identify any known or suspected compounding pharmacies in their  state that are not on the Iowa nonresident pharmacy list. As a result,  NABP officials told us that NABP added some additional pharmacies to  Iowa\u2019s original inspection list. As of June 2013, NABP had inspected 215  pharmacies. In addition to its Compounding Action Plan, NABP created  and continues to maintain a Model State Pharmacy Act and Model Rules  for states to use when developing new pharmacy laws and regulations,  including rules specific to sterile compounding. According to NABP  officials, each state has adopted aspects of NABP\u2019s model act and model  rules.", "The Pharmacy Compounding Accreditation Board (PCAB): In 2006, eight  national pharmacy organizations established the PCAB, a voluntary  accrediting organization for sterile and nonsterile drug compounders.  According to an organization official, PCAB\u2019s national standards are  based on the consensus of industry experts of those elements that should  exist in a pharmacy that adheres to high quality standards. PCAB  accreditation indicates that the staff involved in compounding have proper  and ongoing training; that the pharmacy uses active pharmaceutical  ingredients and inactive materials from appropriate suppliers; that all  compounding procedures are fully documented and carried out in  conformance with established formulas; and USP standards for  compounding. According to a PCAB official, as of June 26, 2013,   176 drug compounding pharmacies received PCAB accreditation, and  124 additional drug compounding pharmacies have applied for PCAB  accreditation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Resource Constraints and Other Factors May Affect States\u2019 Ability to Oversee Drug Compounding", "paragraphs": ["Some states may lack the fiscal or staff resources to provide the  necessary oversight of drug compounding. A number of officials from  state boards of pharmacy attending a December 2012 meeting conducted  by FDA expressed confidence that their states had adequate resources to  oversee drug compounders, but were concerned about resources in other  states. They explained that, until recently, they depended on the states  where the pharmacies were located to license and regulate those  pharmacies. However, many state budgets have been cut and it is  uncertain whether all states have the resources or qualified staff to  inspect and otherwise appropriately oversee their licensed pharmacies.  The effect of limited state resources may reach across state lines, and it  may not be correct to assume that a pharmacy licensed by another state  is being regulated adequately.", "In addition, differences in pharmacy inspection practices among states  may affect oversight of drug compounding in other states. For example,  each of the four states we reviewed require licensure or registration of  nonresident pharmacies that provide pharmacy services to users in the  state, and they require nonresident pharmacies applying for a license or  registration to have a current license, permit, or registration issued by the  regulatory authority of their home state. The states in our review also  have generally relied on the home states of the nonresident pharmacies  to inspect these pharmacies on a regular basis. However, state officials  and officials from national pharmacy organizations we interviewed told us  that the frequency of pharmacy inspections and the qualifications of the  pharmacy inspectors vary widely among states, and it is uncertain  whether all nonresident pharmacies receive adequate oversight from their  home states. Of the four states in our review, one required annual  inspections of all pharmacies located in the state and one required annual  inspections of all sterile drug compounding pharmacies located in the  state, while another required routine inspections of retail pharmacies in  the state once every 4 years. In addition, three of the four states required  all pharmacy inspectors to have a license to practice pharmacy in that  state, while one state reported having some inspectors without  pharmacist licenses.", "Officials representing several national pharmacy organizations that we  interviewed also expressed concerns regarding whether states have  enough resources to regulate and inspect pharmacies on a timely basis.  Instead, some states inspect pharmacies only in response to a problem  they become aware of through a complaint or adverse drug event. Some  of these officials also expressed concern regarding FDA\u2019s resources to  oversee drug compounding. For example, officials from NABP told us that  both FDA and the state boards of pharmacy need more resources for the  oversight of drug compounding. Recognizing the need for additional  resources to oversee drug compounders, the bill that the California  legislature is considering\u2014a bill that would require nonresident  pharmacies shipping sterile compounded drugs into the state to have an  on-site inspection by the California Board of Pharmacy prior to  licensure\u2014would also require those pharmacies to pay for inspection- related travel expenses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that compounding pharmacies receive adequate oversight, it is  essential to have clear roles for FDA and states regarding the regulation  and oversight of drug compounding. The inconsistent federal circuit court  decisions complicate FDA\u2019s ability to oversee drug compounding by  requiring FDA to approach the regulation of drug compounding differently  in different parts of the country. In addition, state approaches to the  oversight of pharmacies, including compounding pharmacies, vary  depending upon each state\u2019s regulations and the resources each state  devotes to licensing and inspecting its pharmacies. Taken together, the  different regulatory approaches FDA must take and the variation in how  states oversee drug compounding, create gaps in oversight, which could  lead to inadequate assurance that public health is protected.", "To adequately carry out the oversight of compounded drugs, FDA must  have data systems in place to produce timely, reliable information on  inspections, the findings of those inspections, and enforcement actions  taken related to compounded drugs. Without reliable, timely data, the  agency will not have the information needed to intercede and protect  Americans from unnecessary harm when problems are identified. Recent  FDA inspections of 31 entities that produce compounded drugs and the  subsequent drug recalls highlight the potential risk to public health of  failing to oversee these types of entities.", "At the same time that FDA lacks complete information on inspections and  enforcement actions taken related to compounded drugs, entities that  compound drugs may register as manufacturers in the agency\u2019s  registration database, and some advertise themselves as FDA-registered.

Regarding  our first recommendation to direct FDA to consistently collect reliable and  timely information in FDA\u2019s existing databases on inspections and  enforcement actions associated with compounded drugs, HHS stated that  although FDA\u2019s FACTS database can be improved to better aggregate  data and to facilitate evaluation of compounding pharmacy activities,  these deficiencies do not materially impact FDA\u2019s ability to protect the  public from harm when problems are identified. We understand that FDA  has the ability to access the data associated with compounded drugs by  searching under a company name or requesting information across FDA  centers and offices; however, as our report notes, FDA lacks ready  access to all of the data and lacks the ability to run queries or aggregate  the data. For example, when we requested the final inspection  classifications for 194 inspections of compounding pharmacies, FDA  could not provide this information because, according to FDA officials, the  FACTS database does not contain all of the final decisions and obtaining  all of the final inspection classifications would require time-consuming  manual searches of information maintained in hard copy. As a result, we  could not ascertain how many of these inspections found problems that  were significant enough for FDA to determine that official action was  indicated. Therefore, we continue to believe that FDA should take steps  to consistently collect reliable and timely information in its databases on  inspections and enforcement actions associated with compounded drugs.  Doing so would provide the agency with ready access to key data to  inform its decision making on its oversight priorities and allow it to take  appropriate action when problems are identified. In its comments, HHS  stated that FDA will take steps to further improve its databases to ensure  that inspections and actions regarding compounding going forward are  coded consistently and are more readily identifiable through electronic  searches, and that the final classification for inspections of drug  compounders are entered into the FACTS database. These steps are  consistent with our recommendation.", "Regarding our second recommendation, HHS stated that FDA will  consider whether it would be possible or appropriate to differentiate in its  database those compounding pharmacies that register voluntarily from  conventional manufacturers of FDA-approved drugs that are required to  register. These conventional manufacturers are already subject to routine  inspections by FDA and are required to list the FDA-approved products  they manufacture. Therefore, these entities should already be known to  FDA. HHS also commented that FDA will provide information to the public  about what it means\u2014and does not mean\u2014to voluntarily register with  FDA.
