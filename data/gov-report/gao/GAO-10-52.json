However, each of the FAPs GAO reviewed, in place as of the end of fiscal year 2008, had gaps in certain areas, such as incomplete policies and procedures for some expenses. Although MCC agreements require that each country prepare a FAP, the initial guidance MCC provided to the three MCAs was general and did not contain sufficient information to help the countries develop sound internal control structures. For example, guidance stated that records must support transactions and that procedures must incorporate segregation of duties. However, specific guidance on payroll, travel, and inventory controls would have helped the MCAs develop comprehensive policies. To address this, MCC developed a FAP template in November 2008, but MCC allows the MCAs flexibility and does not require them to implement the template's policies and procedures. In addition, GAO identified a significant number of the transactions tested that lacked adequate supporting documentation or were not properly approved by management. These deficiencies increase the risk of fraud, waste, and abuse of MCC program funding. MCC has increased standardization of the MCA procurement guidelines, which were initially developed on a country-by-country basis. The MCAs GAO assessed generally adhered to MCC's procurement guidelines. GAO found that, in some cases, MCAs did not document a price reasonableness analysis of winning bids. GAO also found that when MCAs delegated procurement responsibility to outside entities, the procedures used by these entities were generally consistent with MCC's procurement framework. MCC conducts oversight of MCA infrastructure contracts and projects, but insufficient planning of projects during compact development and cost escalation has undermined project implementation. As a result of insufficient planning, designs had to be revised, and project scopes have been reduced. Significant delays to project schedules--the result of undertaking additional planning and design--further compounded the escalation in construction costs experienced on projects and contributed to the restructuring of projects. For example, two of five planned roads in Cape Verde were eliminated, in part due to insufficient design and cost increases. In addition, the schedule for construction of the remaining three roads was extended by 11 months. MCC has worked with the MCAs to significantly restructure projects to keep them within their budgets and 5-year compact time frames. MCC also has taken steps to provide increased assistance to MCAs to help them conduct better planning for projects. However, these changes alone will not address the problems projects encountered with design development and cost escalation. Industry best practices and past GAO work have shown that conducting design reviews and updating cost estimates prior to contract solicitation help to ensure that projects can be successfully bid and constructed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Established in January 2004 with the mission of reducing poverty through  economic growth, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) has  committed approximately $6.9 billion from the Millennium Challenge  Account (MCA) for compacts with 19 developing countries as of August  2009.

The lack of adequate and comprehensive policies contributes to  internal control structures that increase the risk of fraud, waste, and abuse  in MCC-funded projects. For example:    Travel policies in Honduras and Cape Verde lacked key requirements for  supporting documentation. For example, in Honduras, travel policy  allowed employees to be paid for lodging and per diem for local or  international travel prior to the trip but did not require staff to submit  detailed documentation related to hotel or airline flight receipts upon  return to document the completion of travel.

MCC\u2019s initial Guidance for Compact-Eligible Countries consisted  primarily of outlining the responsibilities of MCC and the recipient  government in matters related to financial management and provided  general guidance about the foundation of the policies and procedures to  be developed. For example, the guidance stated that (1) procedures must  be in place to ensure that disbursements are executed in accordance with  the compact or related documents, (2) records must be maintained that  provide clear support of a transaction, and (3) procedures must  incorporate the principle of segregation of duties and internal controls.  However, this guidance did not contain examples of the policies and  procedures that the MCAs could implement to ensure an adequate fiscal  accountability structure. For example, more specific or detailed guidance  in payroll, travel, and inventory controls would have assisted the MCAs in  developing comprehensive policies and procedures. According to MCC, to  help the MCAs comply with their responsibility for developing their FAPs,  MCC\u2019s fiscal accountability directors often worked hand-in-hand with the  MCAs and fiscal agents while drafting their initial guidance.

According to MCC officials, the template is designed  to be a guidance document that provides examples of how controls could  be structured for different expense types. For example, the template  requires employees to submit time sheets for supervisory approval and  travelers to submit hotel receipts for travel expenses. MCC management  does not require compact countries to model their policies and procedures  on the guidance provided in this template FAP or adopt its provisions  because MCC delegates responsibility for implementing internal control to  the countries\u2019 accountable entity, which can tailor their FAPs to meet their  needs.

Our past work found that it is  critical to set appropriate time frames to conduct planning, design, and  construction activities.", "Insufficient planning. Insufficiently developed project designs led to  redesign and delays in contract award and implementation in each of the  three compact countries. For example, in five of the six projects we  reviewed (six contracts for roads projects in each of the three countries,  and two contracts for the port and bridges projects in Cape Verde), we  found that insufficient planning\u2014principally due to poor topographic  surveys\u2014led to inadequate designs. The redesign of projects delayed the  bid process while designs were revised and, in other cases, resulted in  significant modification of designs after contract award. Industry experts  have found that actual costs for projects with limited planning can range  from 20 to 30 percent higher than estimated. The following examples  highlight some of the problems our review found that were reported by  MCC, the MCAs, and their consultants:    MCA-Georgia issued contract variation orders to address identified  shortcomings in the project design. After beginning construction, the  contractor found discrepancies between the design and the existing  roadway conditions. This discrepancy required additional topographic  engineering surveys, more-developed designs, and additional construction  work. In addition, trees between 8.0 and 15.9 centimeters are legally  required under Georgian law to be cut rather than uprooted with heavy  equipment, but this requirement was not identified as a payable item in  contract documents. Furthermore, the extent of the work required to  relocate utilities was not sufficiently addressed in the design, according to  the contractor. MCC officials noted that MCA-Georgia had contracted  separately for a utility relocation survey that proved to be deficient.", "MCA-Honduras had to undertake additional topographic engineering  surveys because earlier surveys were not sufficiently detailed or were  unavailable. This issue contributed to a 4\u00bd-month delay in awarding  contracts. In addition, fundamental planning decisions, such as adding  travel lanes, interchanges, and safety features, were still under review  during the design stage, which took time to resolve and resulted in  significant changes in scope.", "MCA-Cape Verde, after construction award, found that road designs,  accepted by the government of Cape Verde, were of poor quality and  inadequate as a basis for construction.

MCC requires the  MCAs to include an \u201cowner\u2019s contingency\u201d in project cost estimates to  cover unforeseen conditions and risks, such as cost escalation. MCC also  reviews cost estimates of MCA projects quarterly as part of the  disbursement request review process.", "Evidence we reviewed suggested that the MCAs\u2019 initial cost estimates  were not realigned when project scopes were revised or as prevailing  market conditions changed. For example, the budget and cost estimates  supporting the first MCA-Georgia road procurement\u2014canceled because  bids exceeded available project funding\u2014were largely based on planning  estimates that were 2 years old. In addition, the estimates did not  sufficiently account for (1) cost escalation, (2) changes in scope and  standards that occurred after the feasibility study, (3) weakening of the  U.S. dollar, and (4) an increase in construction work worldwide that  resulted in less competition.", "Design review. We found that MCC consultants\u2019 reviews of designs  before award of contract were insufficient.

MCC has taken some steps to modify  its compact development process by increasing its assistance to support  MCA planning for projects before implementation. Previously, final  feasibility studies, environmental assessments, and detailed project  planning were typically not completed until after entry-into-force.

While we cannot statistically project our findings to other countries  on the basis of these three countries, we chose these countries because  they totaled approximately 39 percent of MCC\u2019s disbursements at the end  of fiscal year 2008. Intervening political events in other MCC countries also  affected the selection of countries.", "To determine whether MCC\u2019s financial controls help ensure accountability  over compact country funding, we obtained an understanding of MCC  financial requirements imposed on the country when compact agreements  were signed. MCC delegates much of the development and implementation  of internal control procedures and the fiscal oversight of its federal  funding to the country\u2019s Millennium Challenge Account (MCA)  accountable entity.

Specifically, we:    Conducted walk-throughs and interviews with each MCA\u2019s financial  management officials to identify relevant policies and procedures,  including key internal control activities for its financial transactions.", "Performed tests of those control activities that we considered key in  providing reasonable assurance that transactions were correct and proper,  including segregation of duties related to the approval and authorization of  payments: dividing key duties and responsibilities among different  people to reduce the risk of error or fraud,    adequate supporting documentation: supporting the disbursements  through documentation to provide a basis for reconciling payment  amounts and authorizations to disbursement of funds,   proper execution of transactions and events: authorizing and executing  transactions by persons acting within the scope of their authority to  ensure that only valid transactions are initiated and approved, and   physical control over assets: securing assets and periodically counting  and comparing totals with control records.", "We tested MCA transactions using data collection instruments (DCI) and  criteria described in the MCA\u2019s policies and procedures as documented in  the MCA\u2019s FAP or other documentation, such as project- or program- related contracts or agreements with third parties hired to manage or  oversee implementation of the project activities.

Given the variation in the  programs and projects conducted by the three countries selected, we  divided our work into strata that included operational expenses such as  travel; payroll; and project-related expenses, such as credit lines,  resettlements, grants, and investments. See table 2 for additional details on  the number and dollar value of transactions tested.", "The MCAs often contract out the management or oversight of some  program- or project-related activities to implementing entities that have  more specialized knowledge or needed skills. For some of these  implementing entities, we selected additional transactions and tested  controls at their site to determine whether transactions were properly  documented and to assess the MCAs\u2019 oversight of those activities. We  selected items from the country\u2019s inventory list to test whether the MCA  had established an adequate system to ensure physical control over assets.  Disbursements for each country were randomly selected within each  stratum to ensure an objective selection.", "Our initial methodology for transaction testing included the selection of a  statistical sample of transactions at each MCA; however, as our countries  changed, we found that inconsistencies between the countries\u2019 financial  management reporting systems did not always allow us to select an  individual transaction to trace. For example, certain MCA systems  processed transactions, such as payroll, in a batch process, and a payment  selected from the database could be an entire monthly payroll, rather than  a payment involving an individual. In addition, for some credit line and  resettlement programs, the MCAs transferred large balances to credit  institutions that would be divided and paid to specific recipients. In these  cases, we selected additional transactions to test other key controls that  could not be tested with the large transfers. Because of this limitation, we  decided to use a random sample selection and to present results for the  selected samples, rather than projecting to the entire population.", "We assessed the reliability of the financial data provided by the three  countries we reviewed by (1) performing electronic testing of required  data elements, (2) reviewing existing information about the data and the  system that produced them, and (3) interviewing agency officials  knowledgeable about the data.

We assumed after  discussion with internal GAO procurement experts that fully implementing  World Bank/MCC guidelines would constitute open, fair, and competitive  procurement.", "We also interviewed MCC officials in Washington, D.C., and compact  countries, and MCA procurement officers and procurement agents in  compact countries, to further our understanding of how MCC and the  MCAs have managed and overseen procurement activities and to identify  any issues with implementing MCC\u2019s framework in practice. We analyzed  current and previous editions of MCC guidance and agreements to identify  how MCC\u2019s requirements and procedures have evolved. We further  reviewed MCC interim activity reviews and audits of the MCAs to  document MCC\u2019s post-review and audit processes.", "To assess the adherence of MCA compact countries to MCC\u2019s procurement  framework, we examined a stratified random sample of completed fiscal  year 2008 MCA entity procurements for our three focus countries. As  shown in table 3, we divided these procurements into the following four  strata: (1) sole source procurements, (2) the five largest dollar value  procurements, (3) procurements requiring MCC review, and   (4) procurements that did not require MCC review. We identified the  universe of procurements in each country using MCC\u2019s Procurement  Performance Report (PPR) for each country. To ensure that the PPR  sufficiently reflected the procurements in each country, we interviewed  staff at the MCAs and checked reported procurement dates and  descriptions in the files against those reported in the PPRs. We found a  high degree of accuracy in the data reported in the PPRs, which provided  us with reasonable assurance that the PPRs were sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of our analysis.", "We reviewed all sole source procurements in each country during fiscal  year 2008 because of their high risk for abuse, as outlined in the U.S.  Agency for International Development, Office of Inspector General\u2019s Fraud  Indicators. We also reviewed the five largest dollar value procurements in  each country because of the dollars involved and their importance for  compact implementation. We divided the remaining procurements into  those with and without MCC review to determine whether MCC  involvement in procurement changed the level of compliance with MCC\u2019s  guidelines. Because of the small number of procurements with MCC  review in each country, we selected all of these procurements in our  sample. In addition, because the number of procurements with MCC  review was so small relative to those without MCC review in each country,  we could not make a valid comparison between the two strata. In Cape  Verde and Honduras, we selected a stratified random probability sample  for each country large enough to generate percentage estimates with a  margin of error of at most plus or minus 10 percentage points at the   95 percent confidence level. We selected 63 of the 105 procurements from  Honduras and 47 of the 72 procurements from Cape Verde. With this  probability sample, each procurement in the population had a known,  nonzero probability of being included in the sample. Each procurement in  the sample was subsequently weighted in the analysis to account  statistically for all procurements in the population, including those that  were not selected. All percentage estimates from these samples presented  in this report have a margin of error of plus or minus 10 percent or less,  unless otherwise noted.", "In Georgia, we reviewed all 28 procurements conducted in fiscal year 2008  because the relatively small number of procurements conducted in the  country over that time period made sampling unnecessary.", "We examined the selected procurements using a DCI to determine  whether procurements were conducted according to MCC\u2019s procurement  criteria. We assessed the MCA procurement process on compliance with  MCC procurement guidelines, as outlined in table 4.", "We reviewed each file to assess whether it contained documentation that  the MCA had followed the required procedures. If required documentation  was not present in the file, we queried MCA officials to determine whether  the required document could be located elsewhere. We did not, however,  assess the quality of these required documents. In addition, our review  included only a limited number of procurements that were completed  following the introduction of MCC\u2019s implementation model and Schedule  B approvals matrix. Therefore, our findings do not assess the effectiveness  of the implementation model.", "In addition to the statistical selection of the procurements for review using  our DCI, we also judgmentally selected procurements whose reporting in  the PPR exhibited potential indicators of fraud, such as multiple contract  awards to a single entity, contracts awarded in multiple lots where  awarding as one lot would have required additional reviews, and contracts  awarded on a sole source basis. Some of these procurements were  selected for inclusion in our DCI analysis; the remainder were assessed  through interviews or document review to determine whether these  potential fraud indicators could be explained by other circumstances. In  addition, because canceled procurements represent lost time and effort  spent in developing the procurement or contract, we identified canceled  procurements in each country in fiscal year 2008. Although we did not do a  formal review of these procurements using the DCI, we interviewed the  MCA staff about these procurements to understand the reasons for  cancellation.", "To assess the time frames required for MCC procurements, we identified  key procurements in each of our three focus countries. We defined key  procurements as those with a contract award amount greater than or equal  to $1 million for goods, works, or consultant services. We then reviewed  Procurement Implementation Plans for those procurements, where  available, and compared the time frames anticipated in those plans with  the actual procurement time frames provided to MCC in the PPR to  determine the difference between planned and actual time frames. We  further reviewed associated reporting documents and discussed these key  procurements with the MCA procurement directors to determine the  causes for any delays in these key procurements.", "To assess MCC\u2019s development, implementation, and oversight of  contracts, we examined the three infrastructure construction contracts  with the largest dollar value and the largest consultant services contract  associated with construction services in each of our three sample  countries.", "We reviewed the following MCAs:    Honduras: The Honduras compact called for the improvement of  approximately 110 kilometers of the CA-5 highway comprising the \u201cNorth  Segment\u201d (sections 3 and 4) and a \u201cSouth Segment\u201d (sections 1 and 2),  both of which are located north of Tegucigalpa.

An earlier procurement effort\u2014identified as the \u201c1st  Procurement\u201d\u2014intended to award three contracts to rehabilitate 245  kilometers was canceled in June 2007 after contractor bids exceeded the  available budget. When Georgia received an additional $100 million in  compact funding, it allowed for a \u201c3rd procurement\u201d that enabled MCA- Georgia to award three additional road contracts, two in April 2009 and  the third in June 2009, totaling about 46 kilometers.

The contract for the phase  I port project, to upgrade and expand the port of Praia on Santiago Island,  was awarded for $42.3 million. The roads contract, to rehabilitate five  roads on Santiago Island, was awarded for more than $11.0 million. Two of  five roads were eliminated (identified as roads 3 and 5) from the contract  scope due to cost increases. The contract for reconstruction of four  bridges, on Santo Ant\u00e3o Island (not shown), was awarded for roughly   $3.3 million.

Those project reports generally report on project  status, including scope, cost, schedule, engineering, environmental, and  health and safety issues. To further understand and corroborate these  reports, we interviewed MCC officials in Washington, D.C., and MCC  resident country directors working in the compact countries.

Our evaluation of the sufficiency of MCC\u2019s  oversight documents was guided by lessons learned from past GAO work  on infrastructure projects and industry best practices. Lastly, we made  field visits to select projects in Honduras and Georgia to confirm some of  the information reported within contractor progress reports.

In its comments, MCC pointed out that for the purposes of travel,  MCA-Honduras and MCA-Cape Verde generally pay travelers a daily  subsistence allowance for each day of the travel to cover travelers\u2019  expenses related to lodging, meals, and incidental expenses. The  allowance is calculated using specified per diem rates. As MCC stated,  not every country requires the submission of receipts for such  expenses. However, if the MCA does not receive such supporting  documentation for travel expenses, the MCA has no proof that the  travel actually occurred. As a case in point, even though Cape Verde\u2019s  FAP lists a number of supporting documents that travelers should  provide after returning from a trip, we found that 19 of the 30 travel  transactions we tested lacked such documentation. Therefore, we  could not confirm that travel was completed. Furthermore, the  required trip reports were not always provided in Honduras and Cape  Verde to substantiate that the travel occurred. 2.  MCC noted that the FAP for MCA-Honduras calls for a monthly payroll  sheet to confirm payments to staff. However, we found that the  information on the monthly payroll sheet only included personnel  information, such as names and payment amounts. Without individual  time sheets, we were unable to verify that employees worked the  necessary number of hours for the payments made. We view this as a  key control in the payroll process. Additionally, MCC developed a FAP  template in November 2008 that provides examples of how controls  could be structured. For example, the template requires employees to  submit time sheets for supervisory approval. Taking actions to adopt  these procedures would help ensure the propriety of these  transactions. 3.  MCC pointed out that the Georgia Regional Development Fund  investments met guidelines that permit such investments. MCC also  stated that one investee was not a subsidiary of a larger company that  fell outside of the investment guidelines. Based on MCC\u2019s comments,  we reevaluated the evidence previously provided and agree with MCC  regarding the subsidiary, but reconfirmed the principal place of  business for the two companies as Tbilisi. We modified footnote 31 to  reflect this information. Also, as stated in footnote 31, the fund  manager used calculation methods that made it difficult to determine  whether one of the businesses complied with the investment  guidelines. Having clear supporting documentation and guidance are  critical to ensuring that these investments, and the other areas we had  concerns with, adhere to the guidelines. We appreciate that MCC  stated it plans to work with the MCAs to strengthen compliance with  documentation requirements where needed as part of a review of the  FAPs. 4.  MCC reports that, as of fiscal year 2008, it requires the completion of  full feasibility and environmental assessments, including resettlement  plans, before compact signature. We support MCC\u2019s efforts to take  action to finalize those project planning activities prior to compact  signing and are in the process of assessing the specific actions MCC  has taken to implement the recommendation. According to MCC, while  it instituted the process change in fiscal year 2008, the revised process  has thus far only been applied to the Senegal compact, signed in  September 2009, and to due diligence for a proposed compact with  Moldova. 5.  We recognize that MCC is using its independent engineers, the MCA\u2019s  project consultants, and the compact country\u2019s project stakeholders to  review designs. However, our assessment of the compacts we  reviewed, all of which had significant design issues, cost growth, and  schedule delays, indicates that the project review process can still be  improved before contract solicitation. For example, MCC could  expand its review of final designs, cost estimates, and risk  assumptions by soliciting services of a technical specialist with project  management experience in project risk analysis and project  scheduling. Based on the projects we reviewed and the problems we  found, we believe that outside expertise would benefit the project  review process and avoid the expense of addressing issues related to  the lack of planning."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the person named above, Emil Friberg, Jr. (Assistant  Director), Mike Armes, John Bauckman, Lynn Cothern, Lucia DeMaio, Tim  DiNapoli, Mattias Fenton, Jordan Hamory Holt, Elizabeth Martinez,  Heather Rasmussen, Donell Ries, Michael Simon, Susan Tieh, Patrick  Tobo, and Matt Wood made key contributions to this report.
