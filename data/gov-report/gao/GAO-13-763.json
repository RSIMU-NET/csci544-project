GAO was asked to assess DOD's planning and capabilities for a complex catastrophe. This report assesses the extent to which DOD has (1) planned for and identified capabilities to respond to complex catastrophes, and (2) established a command and control construct for complex catastrophes and other multistate incidents.

However, the commands are delaying the identification of capabilities that could be provided to execute the plans until the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the lead federal response agency, completes its regional planning efforts in 2018. NORTHCOM officials told us that the command's civil support plan would describe some general force requirements, such as types of military units, but that it will not identify specific capabilities that could be provided to civil authorities during a complex catastrophe. Similarly, according to PACOM officials, PACOM's plan also will not identify such capabilities. Still, defense coordinating officers--senior military officers who work closely with federal, state, and local officials in FEMA's regional offices--have taken some initial steps to coordinate with FEMA during its regional planning process to identify capabilities that the Department of Defense (DOD) may be required to provide in some regions. For example, a defense coordinating officer has helped one of the FEMA regions that has completed its regional plan to develop bundled mission assignments that pre-identify a group of capabilities that region will require during a complex catastrophe. DOD doctrine states that the department should interact with non-DOD agencies to gain a mutual understanding of their response capabilities and limitations. By working through the defense coordinating officers to identify an interim set of specific capabilities for a complex catastrophe-- instead of waiting for FEMA to complete its five-year regional planning process-- NORTHCOM and PACOM can enhance their preparedness and mitigate the risk of an unexpected capability gap during the five-year period until FEMA completes its regional plans in 2018.", "DOD has established a command and control framework for a federal military civil support response; however, the command and control structure for federal military forces during complex catastrophes is unclear because DOD has not developed a construct prescribing the roles, responsibilities, and relationships among command elements that may be involved in responding to such incidents across multiple states. This gap in the civil support framework was illustrated by recent events such as National Level Exercise 2011--which examined DOD's response to a complex catastrophe--and the federal military response to Hurricane Sandy in 2012. For example, officials from NORTHCOM's Army component told us that the exercise revealed that the absence of an operationallevel command element created challenges for NORTHCOM in managing the operations of federal military forces during a large-scale, multistate incident. Similarly, DOD after action reports on Hurricane Sandy found that the command and control structure for federal military forces was not clearly defined, resulting in the degradation of situational awareness and unity of effort, and the execution of missions without proper approval. DOD doctrine states that operational plans should identify the command structure expected to exist during their implementation. By identifying roles, responsibilities, and command relationships during multistate incidents such as complex catastrophes, DOD will be better positioned to manage and allocate resources across a multistate area and ensure effective and organized response operations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that combatant commands (1) work through the defense coordinating officers to develop an interim set of specific DOD capabilities that could be provided to prepare for and respond to complex catastrophes, as FEMA completes its five-year regional planning cycle; and (2) develop, clearly define, communicate, and implement a construct for the command and control of federal military forces during multistate civil support incidents such as complex catastrophes. DOD concurred with both recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United States continues to face an uncertain and complicated  security environment with the potential for major disasters and  emergencies, as incidents such as the Boston Marathon bombings,  Hurricane Sandy, and recent wildfires illustrate. DOD supports civil  authorities\u2019 response to domestic incidents through an array of activities  collectively termed civil support. After the September 11, 2001 terrorist  attacks, the Department of Defense (DOD) established U.S. Northern  Command (NORTHCOM) in October 2002 to, among other things,  provide for and manage DOD\u2019s civil support mission. DOD generally does  not acquire capabilities specifically for civil support, but it possesses a  broad array of resources developed for its warfighting mission that could  be brought to bear when civilian response capabilities are overwhelmed  or exhausted\u2014or in instances where DOD offers unique capabilities. For  example, DOD has been called upon to mitigate the effects of major  disasters and emergencies by providing fuel and medical care, and  certain military units within DOD may be tasked to provide specialized  life-saving and decontamination capabilities in response to a radiological  incident. The 2013 Strategy for Homeland Defense and Civil Support  recognizes that, although DOD is always in a support role to civilian  authorities for disaster response, the capacity, capabilities, and training of  the military mean that DOD often is expected to play a prominent  supporting role in response efforts. The strategy also notes that public  expectations for a rapid federal response have grown in the wake of  major disasters such as Hurricane Katrina.", "In July 2012, the Secretary of Defense issued a memorandum directing  the department to plan for a complex catastrophe\u2014that is, an incident  that results in cascading failures of critical infrastructure and causes  extraordinary levels of casualties or damage. DOD has defined a complex  catastrophe as a natural or man-made incident, including cyberspace  attack, power grid failure, and terrorism, which results in cascading  failures of multiple interdependent, critical, life-sustaining infrastructure  sectors and causes extraordinary levels of mass casualties, damage, or  disruption severely affecting the population, environment, economy,  public health, national morale, response efforts, and/or government  functions. A domestic incident of this scale is likely to affect multiple  states even though DOD\u2019s definition of a complex catastrophe does not  specifically include multiple states. An example of a complex catastrophe  is the earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear reactor meltdown that struck  Japan in 2011 and caused extensive loss of life and suffering. DOD said  that the scope, scale and duration of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which  affected several states on the East Coast of the United States, fell short  of the threshold for a complex catastrophe. According to Office of the  Secretary of Defense officials, the department\u2019s increased focus on  complex catastrophes is largely the result of lessons learned from a 2011  national-level planning exercise. This exercise tested the government\u2019s  response to a large earthquake scenario that involved numerous  casualties, and caused widespread property damage and critical  infrastructure degradation across eight states. A complex catastrophe has  not yet occurred in the United States; however, if it does occur it would  produce qualitative and quantitative effects that exceed those  experienced in major disasters such as Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy,  creating unprecedented demand for response capabilities at all levels of  government.", "In his July 2012 memorandum, the Secretary of Defense delineated nine  major tasks (and 28 related sub-tasks) requiring departmental entities to:  (1) define a complex catastrophe; (2) expedite access to reserve  components; (3) better leverage immediate response authority; (4)  enable effective access to and use of all defense capabilities; (5) update  DOD planning documents to include preparedness for complex  catastrophes; (6) integrate and synchronize DOD planning with federal,  regional, and state partners; (7) enable fastest identification of DOD  capabilities for complex catastrophe response; (8) strengthen shared  situational awareness, and (9) strengthen DOD preparedness through  improvements to doctrine, exercises, training, and education. Most of the  tasks and subtasks have a scheduled completion date, ranging from  August 2012 to September 2014.", "To date, we have published several reports on the progress DOD has  made to address civil support issues. Among other things, these reports  have focused on coordination between NORTHCOM and the states, the  National Guard Bureau, and other federal agencies for civil support  planning and response; capabilities requirements for civil support;  National Guard requirements for responding to large-scale civil support  incidents; DOD\u2019s planning, resourcing, and training for domestic  chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear incidents; NORTHCOM\u2019s  civil support exercise program; and NORTHCOM\u2019s civil support guidance  development and planning efforts. We recommended that DOD update its  civil support strategy, doctrine, and DOD directives related to civil support  and clarify roles and responsibilities for civil support personnel. The  department generally concurred with these recommendations. These  reports are listed in the Related GAO Products section at the end of this  report.

We also met with  several defense coordinating officers and Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA) officials to determine what planning was  being conducted at the regional level. We also met with officials at  NORTHCOM and U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM) to determine how the  commands are incorporating a complex catastrophe scenario into civil  support plans by the September 2013 and 2014 deadlines. We assessed  planning guidance issued by the Joint Staff and Secretary of Defense and  DOD joint doctrine against interviews with DOD and combatant command  officials to determine how DOD was incorporating a complex catastrophe  into civil support plans. To determine the extent to which DOD has  established a command and control construct for complex catastrophes  and other multistate incidents, we analyzed DOD doctrine and plans  related to operational planning and command and control.

The framework is based on a tiered,  graduated response; that is, incidents are managed at the lowest  jurisdictional level and supported by additional higher-tiered response  capabilities as needed. Overall coordination of federal incident- management activities is generally the responsibility of the Department of  Homeland Security. Within the Department of Homeland Security, FEMA  is responsible for coordinating and integrating the preparedness of  federal, state, local, and nongovernmental entities. In this capacity, FEMA  engages in a range of planning efforts to prepare for and mitigate the  effects of major disasters and emergencies. For example, FEMA is  currently developing regional all-hazards and incident-specific plans  intended to cover the full spectrum of hazards, including those that are  more likely to occur in each region. FEMA expects to complete its current  regional planning cycle by 2018.", "Local and county governments respond to emergencies daily using their  own capabilities and rely on mutual aid and other types of assistance  agreements with neighboring governments when they need additional  resources. For example, county and local authorities are likely to have the  capabilities needed to adequately respond to a small-scale incident, such  as a local factory explosion, and therefore would not request additional  resources. For larger-scale incidents, when resources are overwhelmed,  local and county governments will request assistance from the state.  States have resources, such as the National Guard of each state,that  they can marshal to help communities respond and recover. If additional  capabilities are required, states may request assistance from one another  through interstate mutual aid agreements, such as the Emergency  Management Assistance Compact, or the governors can seek federal  assistance.", "Various federal agencies play lead or supporting roles in responding to  major disasters and emergencies, based on their authorities and  capabilities, and the nature of the incident when federal assistance is  required. For example, the Department of Energy is the lead federal  agency for the reestablishment of damaged energy systems and  components, and may provide technical expertise during an incident  involving radiological and nuclear materials. DOD supports the lead  federal agency in responding to major disasters and emergencies when  (1) state, local, and other federal capabilities are overwhelmed, or unique  defense capabilities are required; (2) it is directed to do so by the  President or the Secretary of Defense; or (3) assistance is requested by  the lead federal agency.

For example, for  small-scale civil support responses, NORTHCOM\u2019s 2008 civil support  concept plan provides that a defense coordinating officer may be used  to command and control federal military forces so long as the response  force does not exceed the officer\u2019s command and control capability.  Should an event exceed that threshold, a task force may be needed to  command and control medium-scale military activities. Such a task force  could be composed of personnel from a single military service; or, if the  scope, complexity, or other factors of an incident require capabilities of at  least two military departments, a joint task force may be established. The  size, composition, and capabilities of a joint task force can vary  considerably depending on the mission and factors related to the  operational environment, including geography of the area, nature of the  crisis, and the time available to accomplish the mission. For large-scale  civil support responses, per the civil support concept plan, NORTHCOM  can establish or expand an existing joint task force with multiple  subordinate joint task forces, or appoint one or more of its land, air, or  maritime functional component commanders to oversee federal forces.  U.S. Army North, located at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, is NORTHCOM\u2019s  joint force land component commander. Air Force North, located at  Tyndall Air Force Base near Panama City, Florida, is NORTHCOM\u2019s joint  force air component commander.

Within  this structure, NORTHCOM transfers operational control of federal  military forces to a designated functional component commander. This  commander may then deploy a subordinate task force or multiple task  forces to execute command and control. For example, for land-based  incidents, NORTHCOM would transfer operational control of federal  forces to U.S. Army North, which could then deploy one or more of its  subordinate command and control task forces.

Federal military forces allocated to the dual-status commander through  the request for assistance process are to be under that commander\u2019s  control.

Dual status  commanders do not have command and control over state National  Guard forces in states that have not designated that commander as a  dual status commander.", "According to NORTHCOM\u2019s civil support concept plan, dual-status  commanders provide the advantage of a single commander who is  authorized to make decisions regarding issues that affect both federal  and state forces under their command, thereby enhancing unity of effort.  For example, dual-status authority allows the commander to coordinate  and de-conflict federal and state military efforts while maintaining  separate and distinct chains of command. Unlike some federal military  task forces, dual-status commanders, when employed, are under the  direct operational control of NORTHCOM, operating outside of the  functional component command structure. Dual-status commanders also  fall under a state chain-of-command that extends up through the state  Adjutant General and Governor.

For example, officials from U.S. Army  North told us that the exercise revealed that not having a level of  command between the dual-status commanders and NORTHCOM did  not work well for such a large-scale, multistate incident, in part, because  NORTHCOM, in the absence of an operational-level command element,  faced challenges in managing the operations of federal military forces  across a widespread area. According to DOD doctrine, operational-level  commands, such as a functional component commander like the joint  force land component commander, can directly link operations to strategic  objectives. To address this gap, two task forces were employed to  operate between the dual-status commanders and NORTHCOM. While  the task forces improved the overall command structure, according to  Army officials, there was confusion regarding the role of the task forces in  relation to the dual-status commanders, as well as federal military forces  in states without a dual-status commander\u2014which some of the state  governors involved in this exercise chose not to appoint.", "National Level Exercise 2011 illustrated other potential challenges  associated with the lack of a multistate command and control structure.  For example, according to NORTHCOM\u2019s publication on dual status  commander standard operating procedures, NORTHCOM is responsible  for coordinating the allocation of federal military forces among multiple  states or areas\u2014that is, determining where and how to employ federal  military forces, particularly when there are similar requests for assistance.  NORTHCOM officials told us that the command, looking at the totality of  requests for assistance, would normally make such force employment  determinations based on FEMA\u2019s prioritization of requests. However, in  the absence of a multistate command and control structure to provide the  necessary situational awareness over forces already engaged or  available, NORTHCOM may be impaired in its ability to make additional  informed decisions regarding the appropriate allocation of federal military  resources. For example, at the outset of a complex catastrophe, DOD  should expect to receive hundreds of requests with possibly redundant  requirements and no prioritization. Similarly, a preliminary NORTHCOM  analysis found that the current request for assistance process is unlikely  to handle the timely demands that a complex catastrophe would incur,  and that the prioritization of these requests would be unclear in the initial  hours and days of the incident. Army officials told us that without an  intermediate command entity to collate operational data and inform force  allocation decisions, it was unclear how DOD would prioritize requests for  federal military resources when there are multiple requests for the same  or similar capabilities. Officials from the Joint Staff, and defense  coordinating elements echoed these concerns, noting that it is unclear  how DOD would prioritize the allocation of federal military forces across  an affected multistate area when two or more dual-status commanders  are in place.", "Civil Support Operations during Hurricane  Sandy  DOD\u2019s activities during and after Hurricane  Sandy in October and November 2012  represented its largest civil support response  since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. DOD  received an unprecedented number of  requests for assistance, specifically in the  areas of power restoration and gasoline  distribution. According to DOD, the cascading  effects of the failures of critical infrastructure  in New York and New Jersey\u2014including mass  power outages, major transportation  disturbances, and disruption of the fuel  distribution system\u2014resembled those of a  complex catastrophe.", "Challenges associated with the lack of a multistate command and control  construct were evident in the federal military response to Hurricane  Sandy, which marked the first occasion in which multiple dual-status  commanders were employed. For example, NORTHCOM officials told us  that the command recognized the need for a command and control  element between the dual-status commanders and NORTHCOM and, in  early November 2012, employed a joint coordinating element\u2014a concept  without definition or doctrinal basis. According to DOD after action reports  for Hurricane Sandy, the purpose of the joint coordinating element,  employed as an extension of the joint force land component commander,  was to aid in the coordination, integration, and synchronization of federal  military forces. However, officials we spoke with from across the  department told us that the joint coordinating element\u2019s role was neither  well-defined nor well-communicated, rendering it largely ineffective. For  example, officials from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense  for Homeland Defense and Americas\u2019 Security Affairs told us that  uncertainty regarding the role of the joint coordinating element contributed  to confusion during DOD\u2019s response to Hurricane Sandy.", "Additionally, officials from one of the defense coordinating elements  involved in the federal military response to Hurricane Sandy told us that  the roles and responsibilities of the dual-status commander, joint  coordinating element, and defense coordinating officer were unclear.  According to these officials, such uncertainty hampered unity of command  across state boundaries and created confusion regarding command and  control relationships and force allocation across the affected multistate  area. Officials from U.S. Army North and the Joint Staff similarly told us  that there were challenges in allocating federal military forces during the  response to Hurricane Sandy, in part, because of the command and  control structure that was employed. Joint Staff officials noted that DOD\u2019s  joint coordinating element had limited visibility and control over federal  military forces.", "DOD after action reports covering the federal military response to  Hurricane Sandy also found that the command and control structure for  federal military forces operating in the affected area was not clearly  defined, resulting in the degradation of situational awareness and unity of  effort, and the execution of missions without proper approval. For  example, a U.S. Army North after action review concluded that while the  joint coordinating element initially had a positive effect on situational  awareness, inconsistencies in its purpose and task caused numerous  problems. Table 1 shows select Hurricane Sandy after action report  observations pertaining to command and control.", "According to NORTHCOM officials, the command has recognized the  need for a multistate command and control construct, is analyzing this  issue, and plans to incorporate the results of its analysis into the  command\u2019s updated civil support concept plan by October 2013.  NORTHCOM previously produced an analysis in March 2012 that  identified a command and control gap for multistate incidents along with  potential mitigation options, but this analysis was never approved. Also,  we recommended in 2012 that DOD develop implementation guidance for  the dual-status commanders that may partially address these challenges  by covering, among other things, criteria for determining when and how to  use dual-status commanders during civil support incidents affecting  multiple states. DOD agreed with this recommendation, and officials  from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland  Defense and Americas\u2019 Security Affairs told us that they are in the  process of drafting such guidance. DOD has established a command and  control framework for single-state civil support responses; but, until it  develops, clearly defines, communicates, and implements a multistate  command and control construct, federal military forces responding to a  multistate event will likely face a range of operational ambiguities that  could heighten the prospects for poorly synchronized response to major  disasters and emergencies. For example, uncertainty regarding command  structure may negatively affect the flow of information and prevent  commanders from having adequate situational awareness over DOD\u2019s  response, leading to reduced operational effectiveness and ineffective  use of DOD forces. By identifying roles, responsibilities, and command  relationships during multistate incidents such as complex catastrophes,  DOD will be better positioned to manage and allocate forces across a  multistate area, and ensure effective and organized response operations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD acknowledged in its 2013 strategy for homeland defense and civil  support that the department is expected to respond rapidly and effectively  to civil support incidents, including complex catastrophes\u2014incidents that  would cause extraordinary levels of mass casualties and severely affect  life-sustaining infrastructure. The effects of such an incident would  exceed those caused by any previous domestic incident. NORTHCOM  and PACOM, the combatant commands responsible for carrying out the  department\u2019s civil support mission, cannot effectively plan for complex  catastrophes in the absence of clearly defined capability requirements  and any associated capability gaps. Consequently, DOD\u2019s decision to  delay identifying capabilities that could be requested by civil authorities  during a complex catastrophe until FEMA completes its five-year regional  planning efforts may lead to a delayed response from DOD and  ineffective intergovernmental coordination should a catastrophic event  occur before 2018. An interim set of specific capabilities that DOD could  refine as FEMA completes its regional planning process should help to  mitigate the risk of a potential capability gap during a complex  catastrophe. Further, developing, clearly defining, communicating, and  implementing a command and control construct for federal military  response to multistate civil support incidents would also likely enhance  the effectiveness of DOD\u2019s response. National Level Exercise 11 and  Hurricane Sandy highlighted this critical gap in command and control.

We assessed planning guidance issued by the Joint  Staff and Secretary of Defense and DOD joint doctrine against interviews  with DOD and combatant command officials to determine how DOD was  incorporating a complex catastrophe into civil support plans. We also met  with several defense coordinating officers and Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA) officials to determine what planning was  being conducted at the regional level. We met with defense coordinating  officers from regions that were impacted by Hurricane Sandy, participated  in National Level Exercise 11, and completed their regional plans to gain  an understanding of issues across a number of FEMA regions.  NORTHCOM\u2019s deadline for completion of a complex catastrophe plan is  September 2013 and U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM\u2019s) deadline is  September 2014, which coincides with the commands\u2019 planning cycles.  To determine NORTHCOM\u2019s and PACOM\u2019s planning requirements, we  reviewed the July 2012 Secretary of Defense memorandum on complex  catastrophes that requires NORTHCOM and PACOM to incorporate  complex catastrophe scenarios into the commands\u2019 civil support plans  and the Joint Staff planning order related to complex catastrophes. We  compared planning requirements directed by the July 2012 Secretary of  Defense memorandum on complex catastrophes and other applicable  guidance to the federal and regional-level planning efforts to identify  capabilities for a complex catastrophe. We met with officials at  NORTHCOM and PACOM to determine how the commands are  incorporating a complex catastrophe scenario into civil support plans by  the September 2013 and September 2014 deadlines.
