The Information Quality Act (IQA) required that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issue guidelines to ensure the quality of information disseminated by federal agencies by fiscal year 2003. GAO was asked to (1) assess OMB's role in helping agencies implement IQA; (2) identify the number, type, and source of IQA correction requests agencies received; and (3) examine if IQA has adversely affected agencies' overall operations and, in particular, rulemaking processes. In response, GAO interviewed OMB and agency officials and reviewed agency IQA guidelines, related documents, and Web sites."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["OMB issued governmentwide guidelines that were the basis for other agencies' own IQA guidelines and required agencies to post guidelines and other IQA information to their Web sites. It also reviewed draft guidelines and undertook other efforts. OMB officials said that OMB primarily concentrated on cabinet-level and regulatory agencies, and 14 of the 15 cabinet-level agencies have guidelines. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) does not have department-level guidelines covering its 22 component agencies. Also, although the Environmental Protection Agency and 4 other independent agencies posted IQA guidelines and other information to their Web sites, 44 of 86 additional independent agencies that GAO examined have not posted their guidelines and may not have them in place. As a result, users of information from these agencies may not know whether agencies have guidelines or know how to request correction of agency information. OMB also has not clarified guidance to agencies about posting IQA-related information, including guidelines, to make that information more accessible. Of the 19 cabinet and independent agencies with guidelines, 4 had \"information quality\" links on their home pages, but others' IQA information online was difficult to locate. From fiscal years 2003 to 2004, three agencies shifted to using IQA to address substantive requests--those dealing with the underlying scientific, environmental, or other complex information--which declined from 42 to 38. In fiscal year 2003, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and two other agencies used IQA to address flood insurance rate maps, Web site addresses, photo captions, and other simple or administrative matters. But, in fiscal year 2004, these agencies changed their classification of these requests from being IQA requests and instead processed them using other correction mechanisms. As a result, the total number of all IQA requests dropped from over 24,000 in fiscal year 2003 to 62 in fiscal year 2004. Also, of the 80 substantive requests that agencies received during the 2-year period--over 50 percent of which came from businesses, trade groups, or other profit-oriented organizations--almost half (39) of the initial agency decisions of these 80 were appealed, with 8 appeals resulting in changes. The impact of IQA on agencies' operations could not be determined because neither agencies nor OMB have mechanisms to determine the costs or impacts of IQA on agency operations. However, GAO analysis of requests shows that agencies can take from a month to more than 2 years to resolve IQA requests on substantive matters. According to agency IQA officials, IQA duties were added into existing staff responsibilities and administering IQA requests has not been overly burdensome nor has it adversely affected agencies' operations, although there are no supporting data. But evidence suggests that certain program staff or units addressing IQA requests have seen their workloads increase without a related increase in resources. As for rulemaking, agencies addressed 16 correction requests related to rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act, not IQA."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies publicly disseminate a wide range of information that is  critical to government, business, and individuals.

The  second element required federal agencies covered by the Paperwork  Reduction Act to develop IQA guidelines by the end of fiscal year 2002,  establish administrative mechanisms allowing \u201caffected persons\u201d to seek  and obtain correction of information maintained and disseminated by the  agencies, as well as periodically report to the Director of OMB about the  number and nature of IQA complaints and how they handled such  complaints.", "IQA builds on previous federal efforts to improve the quality of  information, including OMB Circular A-130 and the Paperwork Reduction  Act of 1980, as amended.  For example, two of the purposes of the  Paperwork Reduction Act were to \u201cimprove quality and use of federal  information \u2026 and provide for the dissemination of public information \u2026  in a manner that promotes the utility of the information to the public and  makes effective use of information technology.\u201d  IQA requires, among other  things, that executive branch agencies manage their information resources  to \u201cimprove the integrity, quality, and utility of information to all users  within and outside an agency.\u201d7, 8   OIRA, which develops and oversees the implementation of  governmentwide policies in the areas of information technology, privacy,  and statistics, had responsibility for developing the governmentwide IQA  guidelines and helping agencies to meet the act\u2019s requirement that they  develop their own guidelines.  In an October 2002 memorandum describing  the implementation of IQA guidelines, OIRA\u2019s then administrator stated he  considered the IQA guidelines a continuation of the executive branch\u2019s  decades-long focus on improving the quality of information federal  agencies collect and disseminate.  The memorandum added that agencies\u2019  implementation \u201cof the Information Quality Law represented the first time  that the executive branch has developed a governmentwide set of  information quality guidelines, including agency-specific guidelines  tailored to each agency\u2019s unique programs and information.\u201d  Agencies\u2019  guidelines, which were to follow OMB\u2019s model, were to include  administrative mechanisms that allow \u201caffected parties\u201d\u2014as defined by the  agencies\u2014to request correction of information that they did not consider  correct.", "44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3506(b)(1)(C).", "No hearings or debates were held or committee reports filed before IQA was enacted as  part of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OMB Took Steps to Implement IQA, but IQA Guidelines and Information for Many Agencies Are Not Available or Easily Accessible", "paragraphs": ["OMB set up a framework for federal agencies to follow in implementing  IQA, including providing assistance and direction to agencies in developing  agency IQA guidelines and requiring them to post IQA information on their  Web sites.

According to OMB officials and OIRA\u2019s then administrator, OIRA  concentrated its communication and other outreach efforts on cabinet- level and regulatory agencies.  In written comments on a draft of our  report, OIRA noted that in working with agencies to develop and  implement information quality measures, it will consider the needed  resources for and the potential benefits of such measures.  Further, in a  number of cases where IQA information was posted online, locating the  information was difficult.

As required by IQA, OMB issued the basic set of  governmentwide IQA guidelines that agencies used as the basis for  developing their own guidelines.  These guidelines explained what agencies  were to do to help ensure the development and public dissemination of  quality information.  In developing these guidelines, OIRA espoused three  underlying principles that agencies were to reflect in their guidelines:  The guidelines are to apply to a wide variety of government information  dissemination activities that may vary in importance and scope.", "Agencies are to meet basic information quality standards, noting that the  more important the information, \u201cthe higher the quality standards to  which it should be held,\u201d but that \u201cagencies should weigh the costs \u2026  and the benefits of higher information quality in the development of  information.\u201d", "Agencies are to apply the guidelines in \u201ca common-sense and workable  manner,\u201d meaning that agency guidelines are not to \u201cimpose  unnecessary administrative burdens that would inhibit the agencies  from continuing to take advantage of the Internet and other  technologies to disseminate information that can be of great benefit and  value to the public.\u201d", "The guidelines, in elaborating on this last principle, explained that \u201cOMB  encourages agencies to incorporate the standards and procedures required  by these guidelines into their existing \u2026 administrative practices rather  than create new and potentially duplicative or contradictory processes.\u201d   The guidelines also noted that they were written to provide agencies with  flexibility as they developed their own guidelines.", "Moreover, the guidelines defined four key concepts related to the  dissemination of information\u2014quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity\u2014 and described how quality was the outcome of the other three components.   These guidelines further explained that agencies were to mirror these  principles and actions in establishing their own guidelines and to include  an administrative mechanism that data users who find mistakes in any  agency\u2019s public data or information can use to petition for correction.  This  mechanism was to include an appeals process, which allows a petitioner to  request that an agency reconsider its initial decision about the correction  request.  The guidelines\u2019 wording about the administrative correction  mechanism allowed agencies to avoid duplicating the public comment  process required by the rulemaking procedures under the Administrative  Procedure Act, in which interested persons are given the opportunity to  comment on proposed rules.", "In addition to writing the governmentwide IQA guidelines, OIRA took other  steps to help agencies implement the principles and standards of IQA.  As  part of helping agencies to develop their guidelines, OIRA offered them  assistance, including outreach to agencies such as conducting workshops  on drafting guidelines, and reviewed their guidelines.  IQA officials from a  number of agencies, including the Departments of Defense and Justice, told  us they considered this assistance beneficial.  OIRA officials also issued  memorandums to clarify how agencies were to satisfy the law and  otherwise implement IQA, including requiring agencies to post IQA  guidelines and related information on their Web sites.  Further, OIRA put  in place the mechanism for agencies to provide OMB with their annual IQA  reports on their implementation of IQA, the number of IQA requests and  appeals, and their status.  According to OIRA staff and officials and agency  memorandums, OIRA monitored IQA correction requests received by  agencies and assisted them in developing their responses.  Agency officials  told us that OMB\u2019s revisions consisted of comments that ranged from  editorial to significant and primarily involved IQA requests pertaining to  substantive issues.  For example, agency officials and OMB staff explained  that OMB at times asked for more detailed explanations, including  references to other relevant information, in agency responses to correction  requests.  According to these officials, OMB\u2019s review did not cause changes  that would have substantially changed the agencies\u2019 ultimate decision.  We  found no indication that OMB\u2019s involvement substantially changed  agencies responses when we examined nine specific IQA requests from  four agencies.", "As described in figure 1, agencies covered by IQA were to have their  guidelines and the correction and appeals mechanism in place by the start  of fiscal year 2003 (October 1, 2002).  The figure also shows that in April  2004, OMB reported to Congress in response to a mandate that OMB report  on the first year\u2014fiscal year 2003\u2014of the implementation of the act.  That  report included information about the characteristics of the correction  requests as well as the sources of the requests, and commented on a  number of common perceptions and concerns about the act.  OMB, of its  own volition, in December 2005, updated this information and included it in  a chapter in its report to Congress on the costs and benefits of federal  regulations.

By the fiscal year 2002  deadline, 14 of the 15 cabinet-level agencies had guidelines in place (see  table 1).  Further, following the flurry of activities to help agencies  develop their IQA guidelines by October 1, 2002, OIRA shifted its emphasis  away from helping agencies develop their IQA guidelines to helping  agencies that already had guidelines to address IQA correction requests.   According to OIRA staff, since November 2002 OIRA has not promulgated  additional guidance regarding the development of IQA guidelines to  agencies.", "Only one cabinet-level agency, DHS, the newest and one of the largest  federal agencies, has no department-level IQA guidelines covering its 22  agencies, which issue a wide array of information used by the public.   Because DHS was not created until January 2003\u2014after IQA was enacted  and IQA deadlines had passed\u2014OMB began working with DHS officials to  develop department-level guidelines after the other cabinet-level and  independent agencies had their guidelines in place, according to OMB\u2019s  April 2004 report to Congress.  As of March 2006, however, DHS did not  have its IQA guidelines in place and officials did not have a deadline for  establishing them.

For example,  the IQA guidelines for the Coast Guard, which was previously part of the  Department of Transportation (DOT), instructed information users  submitting IQA requests to file via DOT\u2019s Docket Management System, the  administrative mechanism that DOT directs the public to use to file  correction requests.  Additionally, FEMA has not updated its guidelines  since becoming part of DHS.  DHS officials told us that the component  agencies may update their guidelines after DHS has its departmentwide  guidelines in place.

We also could not find these agencies\u2019 Federal  Register notices announcing the establishment of their IQA guidelines,  although OMB required these notices.  Also, OIRA staff did not have copies  of the guidelines and said that they had focused their attention on cabinet  agencies and regulatory agencies.

In addition to the difficulties of  trying to find whether the independent agencies\u2019 Web sites contained IQA  guidelines, we had problems finding IQA guidelines on the Web sites of the  14 cabinet-level and 5 independent agencies that we knew had those  guidelines.  Of these 19 cabinet-level and independent agencies with IQA  guidelines that we reviewed, only 4 agencies\u2014the Departments of  Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, and the Interior\u2014provided a direct IQA  \u201cinformation quality\u201d link on their home pages, which likely would be  relatively easy for the public to use to access IQA information.

The total number of all IQA requests dropped from  over 24,000 in fiscal year 2003 to 62 in fiscal year 2004.  The overwhelming  cause for this decline was that in fiscal year 2004 FEMA no longer classified  requests to correct flood insurance rate maps as IQA requests or addressed  them through IQA.  The decline in the number of IQA requests does not  indicate that there was a corresponding decrease in agency workloads.", "In fiscal year 2003, agencies reported having received over 24,600 IQA  correction requests, with FEMA\u2019s 24,433 requests accounting for over 99  percent of the year\u2019s total.

In fiscal year 2004, FEMA, with OMB\u2019s  approval, no longer classified flood insurance rate map correction as IQA  requests.

Out of 183 non-FEMA requests in  fiscal year 2003, 42\u2014or almost one-fourth\u2014were substantive in nature.   Addressing these substantive requests required considerably more time  and staff resources than simple or administrative requests.  OMB and  agency officials considered the other 141 requests\u2014over three-fourths\u2014to  be of a simple or administrative nature\u2014for example, requests to correct  errors in photo captions, personal information, or Internet addresses.  Agencies were able to quickly correct these simple or administrative  requests\u2014correcting 17 requests took 7 or fewer days from the date the  agencies received them.

Specifically, according to agency IQA documents and OMB\u2019s December  2005 report, in fiscal 2004, FEMA, the Department of Justice, the Federal  Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and OSHA no longer classified and  addressed most simple or administrative types of errors as IQA correction  requests.  As a result, the majority of the correction requests that remained  to be processed through IQA were substantive requests.  For example, in  fiscal year 2004, the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS)  National Institutes of Health received a request related to information  about smokeless tobacco; EPA received a request challenging information  related to the water conservation benefits of water utility billing systems of  multifamily housing; and the Department of the Interior\u2019s Fish and Wildlife  Service received a request that challenged information used to protect the  Florida panther.", "We also found that no one agency dominated or accounted for the majority  of fiscal year 2004 requests.  In fact, in fiscal year 2004 the distribution of  requests was more broadly spread across agencies than in fiscal year 2003,  with EPA and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)  each reporting 12 correction requests, and HHS reporting 9 requests to  OMB.", "A few agencies did not experience a decrease in the total number of IQA  requests because they did not shift simple requests away from IQA or  otherwise change how they processed such requests during the 2-year  period.  For example, according to OMB and NARA IQA documents,  NARA\u2019s IQA requests\u20148 in fiscal 2003 and 12 in fiscal 2004\u2014continued to  be simple in nature and came primarily from individuals in both years.

Conversely, the more  significant the correction request, the lower the likelihood of a change.   HHS, for example, addressed 19 IQA requests that were substantive but  changed information for only 5 based on the initial request or an appeal.   Regardless of the complexity of the request, agency IQA documents  showed that agencies addressed all requests filed during the 2-year period.", "Substantial requests were less likely to result in an initial information  change but more likely to be appealed than simple or administrative  requests.  Few petitioners appealed agency decisions regarding simple or  administrative requests.  None of 131 \u201csimple or administrative\u201d fiscal year  2003 IQA requests from the Departments of Transportation, Labor, and the  Treasury and NARA was appealed.  By comparison, of the 80 substantive  requests over the 2-year period, petitioners appealed 39 (almost half) of the  agencies\u2019 decisions.

Two of the 39 appeals still  have outcomes pending after more than 2 years, demonstrating that  although the number of appeals may be considered small, the impact on  agency operations may be significant, depending on the complexity of the  specific issue.  For example, in table 4, the EPA appeal pending\u2014filed by  the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in April 2005\u2014affects 16 EPA databases  that deal with such issues as wastewater treatment and the  bioaccumulation of organic chemicals.  This case has been ongoing for  over 2 years, and could have effects on assessments regarding human  health risks, other environmental impacts, and cleanup decisions.   Also  listed in table 3 is another IQA appeal filed in October 2003 by a private  individual.  The initial request for correction was filed in January 2003  before the DOT\u2019s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) challenging the  analytical basis for its \u201cage 60 rule\u201d that forces air carrier pilots out of  service at age 60.  FAA upheld its \u201cage 60 rule\u201d in September 2003, but the  complainant filed an appeal in October 2003 and filed additional  amendments thereafter.  The request was still pending at the time we  completed our study, more than 3-\u00bd years after the initial IQA request was  made and almost 3 years after the appeal.", "As for the source of appeals, businesses, trade groups, and other profit- oriented organizations filed more appeals than other types of organizations  or individuals.  Businesses and profit-oriented organizations accounted for  25 of the 39 appeals of IQA requests filed during fiscal years 2003 and 2004.   Of these 25 appeals, 4 resulted in changes.  Appeals from  advocacy/nonprofit groups resulted in 1 change from 5 appeals.  Appeals  from private citizens resulted in 3 changes from 7 appeals.  The most  appeals\u201425, or almost two-thirds of them\u2014were filed with EPA, HHS, and  the Department of the Interior.  Those agencies also received nearly two- thirds of the requests that were classified as substantive."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Impact of IQA on Agencies Could Not Be Determined", "paragraphs": ["The impact of IQA on agencies could not be determined because agencies  and OMB do not have mechanisms in place to track the effects of  implementing IQA.  Agencies and OMB do not capture IQA workloads or  cost data, nor do they track the impact of IQA requests or resulting  information changes.  However, evidence indicates that in at least some  cases, addressing IQA requests and appeals can take agencies 2 years or  longer to resolve and requires a wide range of staff, particularly if IQA  correction requests center on substantive matters.", "More specifically, none of the agencies we visited had information about  the actual workload, the number of staff days, or other costs, with one  exception.  Agency IQA officials told us they do not collect such data.   They explained that their agencies did not capture specific workload or  cost data related to establishing IQA guidelines, nor do they track workload  or cost data involved in responding to IQA requests or have mechanisms to  measure any impact IQA information changes have on operations or the  quality of information.  Officials at two agencies\u2014the National Aeronautics  and Space Administration and the Department of the Interior\u2019s Fish and  Wildlife Service\u2014considered developing systems to track IQA costs but did  not.  Fish and Wildlife Service officials told us they decided against  implementing an IQA cost tracking system because of the declining number  of requests they have received since fiscal years 2003 and 2004 and the high  cost and administrative complexities of setting up such a system.   Additionally, IQA officials told us that addressing IQA requests is  considered to be part of their agencies\u2019 day-to-day business, and because of  the multifaceted nature of some requests, allocating time and resources to  one specific issue or linking work exclusively to IQA requests would be  difficult.  For example, Fish and Wildlife Service officials stated that when  agency biologists work on IQA requests, they are also frequently working  on broad biological, environmental, and related issues that go beyond a  given request and relate to other agency work, so it would be difficult to  allocate the biologists\u2019 time among various codes.  In their view, selecting a  specific code would be somewhat arbitrary, and time or other codes would  not necessarily accurately reflect the cross-cutting nature of the biologists\u2019  work.  Moreover, according to agency officials and OMB staff, neither the  agencies nor OMB have mechanisms in place to track the effects of  implementing the law.", "Agency IQA officials and OIRA staff and officials told us that administering  IQA has not been overly burdensome and that it has not adversely affected  agencies\u2019 overall operations to date.  Agencies IQA officials told us they  gave IQA responsibilities to various staff within their agencies\u2014generally  in offices already responsible for information-related issues\u2014and that no  staff are dedicated exclusively to administering IQA.  For example, most  agencies have folded responsibilities for IQA, including setting up  guidelines, into the office of the chief information officer or their public  affairs unit.  In addition, although they track the status of IQA correction  requests, they do not track changes resulting from IQA requests or appeals.", "Although there is a lack of comprehensive IQA-related cost or resource  data, evidence suggests that certain program staff or units involved in  creating IQA guidelines, including the correction mechanism, and  addressing IQA correction requests have seen their workloads increase  without any corresponding increase in resources.  For example, officials at  the Fish and Wildlife Service, HHS\u2019s National Institutes of Health, the  Department of Commerce\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, and the Department of Defense\u2019s Army Corps of Engineers  estimate the costs of addressing IQA requests are \u201cmany thousands of  dollars\u201d because of the number of high salary professional staff, such as  biologists, toxicologists, engineers, and managers, who review and respond  to substantive requests and appeals and the extensive time involved.   According to agency IQA officials and OMB staff, agencies did not receive  funds for IQA, and the act did not specify any funds for implementing IQA.   Moreover, our analysis of IQA requests shows that agencies have taken  from 1 month to more than 1 year to produce a final decision on  substantive IQA requests and appeals, while 2 appeals made during fiscal  years 2003 and 2004 are still ongoing after 2 years or longer.  However,  evidence does not exist showing the resources allotted to those appeals  over the 2-year period in question.  The following IQA requests illustrate  the length of time it can take to address an IQA correction, regardless of  the final outcome.", "On March 10, 2004, a group of trade associations and organizations  primarily representing the residential and commercial properties sector  submitted an IQA request to EPA challenging the accuracy of an EPA  statement that water allocation (submetering) billing systems in  apartment buildings and other multifamily housing did not encourage  water conservation.  This statement was in a Federal Register notice  regarding the applicability of the Safe Drinking Water Act to submetered  properties.  The group did not consider the statement to be correct  regarding one type of allocation system in particular\u2014Ratio Utility  Billing Systems.  According to EPA documents and officials, EPA\u2019s  response to the request and subsequent appeal involved a number of  EPA staff, including senior executives, scientists, and others in the  Office of Water and other headquarters units.  The appeal itself was  reviewed by a three-member panel of senior executives.  EPA took a  total of almost 5 months (146 days) to respond to the initial correction  request, well over the 90-day goal stated in EPA\u2019s IQA guidelines, and  almost 11 months (323 days) more to decide on the appeal, over three  times longer than the 90-day appeals goal in EPA\u2019s guidelines, according  to our analysis of EPA IQA requests.  The nearly 15-month total response  time was not unusual compared to other EPA processing times for IQA  requests.  The lengthy response time was in part due to EPA waiting for  the completion of a related study\u2014under way at the time of the  correction request\u2014before making a final decision about revising its  submetering policy.  On September 28, 2005, EPA ultimately denied the  appeal and did not change its statement, citing the results of the study as  not showing that Ratio Utility Billing Systems encouraged water  conservation.", "On May 4, 2004, a nonprofit organization representing public sector  employees involved in the environment and an individual federal  employee submitted an IQA request to the Fish and Wildlife Service  about alleged errors in agency documents, including the Multi-Species  Recovery Plan and the draft Landscape Conservation Strategy, which  are intended to protect the endangered Florida panther.  The request  and subsequent appeal involved previously identified errors in peer- reviewed research associated with the definition of panther habitat, as  well as estimates of panther population and models used to determine  strategies to help the panther species survive and recover in Florida.   Fish and Wildlife Service staff who evaluated and responded to the  initial request and to the appeal included senior executives, attorneys,  field biologists, and other professional staff from a number of offices  within headquarters, including the program offices, the Solicitor\u2019s  Office, the External Affairs Office, and the Director\u2019s Office, as well as  field offices in Vero Beach and Jacksonville, Florida, and the regional  office in Atlanta.  The administrative appeals panel for the correction  request consisted of executives from Fish and Wildlife Service  headquarters and its Northwest Regional Office and Interior\u2019s U.S.  Geological Survey.  Although the service responded to the initial request  2 months after its receipt, it took more than 7-\u00bd months (over 230  calendar days) to respond to the appeal.  While the initial response was  consistent with the Service\u2019s 45-business day response time stated in the  guidelines, the appeal took over 6 months more than the guideline\u2019s 15- business day appeal time frame, according to our analysis.  The nearly  300-day total response time was not unusual compared to other Fish and  Wildlife Service processing times for IQA requests.  On March 16, 2005,  the Fish and Wildlife Service suspended the draft conservation strategy  for the panther, corrected other key documents, posted notices on the  regional and Vero Beach agency field office Web sites about these  actions, and revised and published for public comment the panther  section of the agency\u2019s recovery plan."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agencies Treated Most IQA Rulemaking-Related Requests as Comments to Proposed Rules", "paragraphs": ["According to OMB staff and agency IQA officials, IQA correction requests  have not adversely affected agency rulemaking procedures to date, partly  because agencies handled most IQA requests related to rulemaking as  public comments to proposed rules under the Administrative Procedure  Act rather than as IQA requests.  This approach, described in a number of  agencies\u2019 IQA guidelines, including EPA\u2019s and the Department of  Agriculture\u2019s, was followed to avoid duplicating the rulemaking comment  process and diverting resources away from the rulemaking process.  It  should be recognized that IQA correction requests could affect rulemaking  outside of the formal rulemaking process.  For example, IQA correction  requests that are filed before an agency\u2019s formal rulemaking process begins  could affect when or if an agency initiates a rulemaking.", "We found 16 requests for corrections submitted during fiscal years 2003  and 2004 to be related to agency rulemaking.  According to our analysis of  IQA requests, annual IQA reports sent to OMB, and OMB\u2019s own reports, and  as later confirmed by OMB, five agencies reported having received 16 IQA  requests related to rulemaking for the 2-year period.  These five agencies  were EPA, the Fish & Wildlife Service, the Department of Agriculture\u2019s  Forest Service, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax  and Trade Bureau, and DOT.  These 16 requests\u2014touching on a diverse  range of issues, such as air safety, alcohol, chemicals, and the  environment\u2014accounted for almost 1 in 5 substantive requests for the 2  years.", "The Fish and Wildlife Service received the largest number of  rulemaking-related IQA requests out of the 16 requests related to  regulations or rules during fiscal years 2003 and 2004.  Seven of the  Service\u2019s 11 requests were related to proposed rulemaking.  These 7  requests represented 44 percent of all rulemaking-related IQA requests  received by all agencies during the 2 years.", "The agencies treated 10 of the 16 requests that they received during the  2-year period as comments to proposed rules rather than processing  them as IQA requests, and the agencies so informed the IQA petitioner.   For example, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau  considered an IQA request regarding flavored malt beverages and  related proposals as comments to a proposed rule.  The bureau  informed the IQA petitioner that it was handling the request as a public  comment under the procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act,  rather than as an IQA correction request.  Agencies similarly processed  the other nine requests related to regulations or rulemaking.", "As for the other six IQA requests related to rulemaking or regulations,  agencies rejected two, are developing responses to two, and were\u2014as  of the end of March 2006\u2014awaiting additional information or court  decisions before responding to the remaining two."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["OMB\u2019s governmentwide IQA guidelines provide agencies with flexibility to  develop their own guidelines to suit their missions.

For example, it could draw from its  experience of working with cabinet and many independent agencies to put  additional agency-specific guidelines in place.  Likewise, OMB could apply  the knowledge from the lessons it and agencies have learned about posting  accessible, user-oriented information on agency Web sites.  By working  with agencies and tapping into public input, OMB could enhance agencies\u2019  and the public\u2019s involvement in promoting high-quality agency information  as well as increasing the public\u2019s access to and confidence in that  information, thereby helping to further the goal of disseminating quality  information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that all agencies covered by IQA fulfill their requirements,  including implementing IQA guidelines and helping to promote easier  public access to IQA information on agency Web sites, we recommend that  the Director of OMB take the following three actions:   work with DHS to help ensure it fulfills IQA requirements and set a  deadline for doing so;   identify other agencies that do not have IQA guidelines and work with  them to develop and implement IQA requirements; and  clarify guidance to agencies on improving the public\u2019s access to online  IQA information, including suggestions about clearer linkages to that  information, where appropriate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, the Acting Administrator of  OMB's OIRA responded to our recommendations.

In our draft report, we  had one recommendation for OMB to work with DHS and other agencies to  develop IQA guidelines.  Based on OIRA's comments, in our final report we  made two separate recommendations regarding DHS and the other  agencies developing IQA guidelines.  Further, we believe that as OIRA  continues to work with DHS\u2014which has 22 component agencies\u2014setting a  deadline for DHS to implement IQA guidelines is important.  As for the  other agencies (many of which are small) without IQA guidelines, OIRA  stated it would work with them as they develop and implement information  quality measures.  OIRA stated that in those efforts, it would consider the  resources that would be needed and the potential benefits that would be  achieved by having IQA guidelines in place.  Regarding our  recommendation about public access to online IQA information, OIRA  noted it shares GAO's interest in improving public access and will continue  to work with agencies to improve dissemination of IQA information.

We also reviewed OIRA\u2019s two reports to  Congress to validate data collected through other sources.  To the extent  the information was available online, we reviewed IQA requests on agency  Web sites.  To supplement and verify the accuracy and completeness of this  information, we interviewed agency and OMB IQA staff and officials.

We determined that  OMB and agency data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  review.  The results of our analysis differ from information in OMB\u2019s two  reports to Congress discussing IQA because of (1) differences between  report information about IQA requests and information on agency Web  sites and (2) minor report errors, including errors reported by agencies to  OMB\u2014such as IQA requests reported for calendar year 2003 instead of  fiscal year 2003\u2014that OMB repeated.
