PAEA established two categories of products: \"market dominant,\" where USPS has a monopoly, and \"competitive,\" which includes all other products, such as shipping services. NSAs, sales, and promotions are generally designed to encourage additional mail volume and revenue through temporary discounts on specific mail products. For example, USPS has offered promotions to incentivize mailers to invest in technology that may increase the value of mail for those mailers over the long-term. No NSAs, sales, or promotions followed the enactment of PAEA until regulations were issued in late 2007. The number of NSAs, sales, and promotions has increased most years since. The revenue generated from NSAs, sales, and promotions has also increased overall. The most revenue was generated by competitive NSAs. Financial results of competitive NSAs are not reported publicly. According to the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC), which exercises regulatory oversight over USPS, nearly all competitive NSAs have covered their costs. Market dominant NSAs generated little revenue, in part because few were done. Sales and promotions have also generated little revenue.", "Opportunities for increasing revenue from NSAs, sales, and promotions are primarily with competitive NSAs, though challenges may limit revenue, and it will likely not offset declines from other products. Continued growth in e-commerce is creating opportunities to generate additional revenue through competitive NSAs. Opportunities to generate additional revenue through market dominant NSAs are limited by low demand for those products. Also, it is difficult for USPS to determine whether any volume and revenue increases directly result from market dominant NSAs because it is difficult to accurately estimate mailers' future mail volume. In addition, USPS and some mailers we spoke with noted that the process for developing both market-dominant and competitive NSAs can be burdensome, hindering the development of new agreements. USPS has taken actions, though, to streamline the process for developing competitive NSAs. Opportunities for generating revenue from sales and promotions are also limited by low demand as well as limited review of the long-term financial results before implementation. USPS has noted that promotions satisfy rate requirements by, for example, helping to generate revenues for USPS. In particular, promotions are used to encourage mail volume over the long term. However, USPS does not provide data and analysis about the potential long-term financial results when submitting promotions to PRC for its approval. As a result, PRC does not assess the methodologies for evaluating the long-term financial results of promotions before implementation. Given USPS's financial situation, USPS should demonstrate how promotions may achieve positive long-term financial results, in order to help maximize the revenue generated by those postage rate discounts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that when filing for approval, USPS provide information to PRC about USPS's data collection and analysis plans for estimating the longterm financial results of promotions. GAO also recommends that PRC evaluate USPS's data collection and analysis plans for promotions as part of its review. In commenting on the report, USPS disagreed with the first recommendation, and PRC agreed with both recommendations. USPS stated it does not believe the recommendation will significantly affect the PRC's review process or improve the quality of USPS's business decisions. GAO continues to believe this recommendation has merit, as discussed in this report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For several years, the United States Postal Service (USPS) has not  generated sufficient revenues to cover its expenses, putting its mission to  provide prompt, reliable, and efficient service at risk.

As customers increasingly turn to digital communications and  online payment methods, total mail volume has decreased precipitously,  falling 25 percent from its peak in fiscal year 2006 to fiscal year 2012. As  a result, USPS\u2019s revenue has declined substantially. In 2012, USPS  reached its $15-billion borrowing limit and incurred a $15.9-billion net  loss. USPS expects that its expenses will exceed revenue and that mail  volume will continue to decline each year through fiscal year 2020.", "Among USPS\u2019s activities to enhance its revenue are negotiated service  agreements (NSA), sales, and promotions designed to increase or  sustain mail volume and revenue through temporary discounts on specific  mail products. In 2010, we reported on various options to generate  additional revenue, including the use of NSAs, as part of a broader report  on options to facilitate USPS\u2019s progress toward financial sustainability.  Since that time, USPS has developed dozens more NSAs, sales, and  promotions, which you asked us to review. We examined (1) the NSAs,  sales, and promotions USPS has developed and their reported financial  results, and (2) any opportunities to generate additional revenue from  NSAs, sales, and promotions and any challenges that could hinder their  development and implementation.", "To describe the NSAs, sales, and promotions that USPS has developed,  as well as their reported financial results, we reviewed public and non- public documents. To summarize the financial results of NSAs, we  examined non-public versions of USPS\u2019s Cost and Revenue Analysis  reports as well as other non-public USPS documents that included the  volume, cost, and revenue of individual NSAs. We also reviewed USPS  data collection reports for market dominant NSAs. To summarize the  number of, and results from, USPS sales and promotions, we reviewed  USPS documents requesting approval for sales and promotions and  obtained additional data from USPS on the estimated results of sales and  promotions. We assessed the reliability of these data sources by  interviewing USPS officials, and determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for our reporting purposes.

The goal of these agreements is generally to  encourage additional mail volume and revenue. For example, an NSA  may provide a postage rate discount, paid to the mailer as a rebate at the  end of a fiscal year, for all mail volume above a specific threshold.", "The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) authorized  USPS to create NSAs for two discrete categories of mail products, market  dominant and competitive, as outlined in table 1. The market dominant  category includes products for which USPS has a monopoly or would be  able to exercise substantial market power, such as First-Class Mail and  Standard Mail. Competitive products are all other types of mail, and  include primarily shipping services such as Priority Mail, Express Mail,  and Parcel Select.", "The legal requirements for NSAs differ based on whether the postal  products are market dominant or competitive. PAEA requires market  dominant NSAs to improve the net financial position or enhance the  performance of operational functions of USPS so long as the agreement  does not cause unreasonable harm to the marketplace. Also, market  dominant product NSAs must be made available to \u201csimilarly situated  mailers.\u201d PAEA requires competitive NSAs, as well as competitive  products in general, to cover their attributable costs, meaning they must  generate more revenue than the costs attributable to delivery of the  products, such as the labor involved in handling that mail. Further,  competitive products overall, including NSAs, must contribute at least 5.5  percent of USPS\u2019s institutional costs\u2014that is, overhead costs not directly  related to the delivery of products.", "As directed by PAEA, PRC issued final regulations in 2007 that  established procedures for its reviews of competitive and market  dominant NSAs, as summarized in table 1. As with all postal rate  changes, USPS must obtain approval from PRC prior to implementing  NSAs. PRC has approved all NSAs proposed by USPS through fiscal  year 2012. PRC also reviews NSAs after implementation for compliance  with regulatory criteria, in its Annual Compliance Determination Report.", "To increase or sustain mail volume and revenue, USPS has also provided  short-term discounts, called sales or promotions, on specific mail  products for groups of mailers, in contrast to NSAs, which are  agreements with individual mailers for longer periods. Sales\u2014often called  price incentive programs\u2014have sought to increase, or curb the decline of,  mail volume by temporarily offering a discount (paid through a rebate) to  mailers whose mail volume exceeds a predetermined volume threshold  during a specific period. Some sales were offered in the summer, when  USPS stated it had excess capacity in its system. These sales were  designed to generate revenue during the sale period and not necessarily  to have long-term benefits. After 2010, USPS began offering promotions  instead of sales, which also provide temporary discounts, but seek to  increase the long-term value of mail by, for example, integrating mobile  technology into mailers\u2019 advertising campaigns. As with all postal rate  changes, USPS must obtain approval from PRC prior to implementing  sales and promotions.

Starting in fiscal year 2011, USPS  began using \u201cumbrella\u201d products that allow multiple mailers to agree to  similar NSAs. As a result, the total number of NSA-product requests for  approval in the table below appears to decline in 2011 and 2012, when in  fact the total number of individual contracts with mailers has continued to  grow.", "The first sales were offered in fiscal year 2009, in part as a response to  the decline in mail volume resulting from the recession, and USPS has  since offered a variety of promotions (see table 3 below).", "USPS data show that revenue generated from NSAs, sales, and  promotions has generally increased each year since the enactment of  PAEA, with most of the revenue generated by competitive product NSAs.  We cannot report the specific revenue generated by competitive NSAs  because of the proprietary nature of data related to competitive products.  However, the total revenue generated as part of all NSAs increased over  240 percent from fiscal year 2009 to 2012, though it remains a small  portion of USPS\u2019s total revenue (see fig. 1). Market dominant NSAs  generated a relatively small portion of this revenue, partly because there  have been few such agreements. Beyond NSAs, sales and promotions  have also generated limited revenue since the first sale in 2009. As  discussed below, it is not clear how much net revenue USPS has  generated from market dominant NSAs or sales and promotions.", "Since the enactment of PAEA, the number of competitive NSAs has  grown substantially. PRC has approved 327 domestic and international  competitive NSA product requests through fiscal year 2012. A number of  these NSA requests are actually \u201cumbrella\u201d products that include  numerous individual contracts, all with similar terms. Counting these  individual contracts separately illustrates the substantial number of NSAs,  with 446 domestic and international competitive NSAs active in fiscal year  2012 alone.", "According to USPS officials and a mailer we spoke with, the increased  number of competitive NSAs was due mainly to increased experience  with NSA contracts and product enhancements. For example, according  to these officials, USPS and PRC processes associated with developing  competitive NSAs have become more efficient as a result of improved  costing techniques and additional experience developing contracts with  mailers. USPS and PRC also worked together to develop umbrella  products that allow multiple mailers to agree to similar discounts for  related mail products. Product enhancements may have also increased  USPS\u2019s ability to attract more business with NSAs. For example, officials  from USPS and a mailer we spoke with noted that USPS\u2019s ability to track  packages\u2019 transit times and its delivery performance improvements for  parcels have made USPS products more attractive to customers.", "The financial results of competitive product NSAs are not reported  publicly, but according to PRC, most such agreements have covered their  costs, and according to USPS, these agreements have generally been  successful in enhancing revenue. According to PRC, all domestic  competitive NSAs have complied with the legal requirements, including  that they generate revenue that covers their attributable costs. Four  international competitive NSAs in fiscal year 2012, however, did not cover  their costs. According to PRC, the international competitive NSAs that did  not cover costs were projected to cover costs when USPS filed its  request.", "Although competitive NSAs are collectively profitable, these agreements  generate a small portion of USPS\u2019s total revenue and help cover less of  USPS\u2019s institutional costs than market dominant products. Competitive  products overall, including NSAs, generate a relatively small part of  USPS\u2019s total revenue because they generally involve much lower mail  volumes than market dominant products.

USPS has implemented few such NSAs in part because of the  decline in demand for market dominant mail products, as discussed  further below.", "Domestic, market dominant NSAs have likely generated limited, if any,  net revenue (see fig. 2). Most of these agreements were implemented  prior to the enactment of PAEA. According to USPS, all domestic market  dominant NSAs have generated net revenue of $68.5 million dollars to  date. However, PRC, using a different methodology that is discussed  below, estimates a net loss of $11.8 million for all domestic market  dominant NSAs.", "For example, the USPS and PRC estimates of net revenue for the  Discover NSA approved in fiscal year 2011 differ substantially. USPS\u2019s  estimate of net revenue assumes that all volume greater than the  projected volume is because of the rebate. USPS developed its estimates  of projected volume based on Discover\u2019s mail volume history as well as  other qualitative factors. PRC used a quantitative methodology based on  product elasticities\u2014that is, the estimated sensitivity of total product mail  volume to price changes\u2014associated with the mail product involved. As a  result, USPS estimated net revenue of about $24 million in the first year  of the NSA with Discover, while PRC estimated USPS lost over $4  million. As discussed further below, PRC has encouraged USPS to  identify a more reliable method for evaluating the impact of market  dominant NSAs.", "International market dominant NSAs implemented since the enactment of  PAEA consist mainly of agreements with foreign posts and are estimated  to have lost approximately $25 million in net revenue in fiscal year 2012,  according to USPS. However, PRC has noted that the volume sent under  the NSAs generated smaller losses than what would have occurred if the  volumes were sent under Universal Postal Union (UPU) international  postal rates. According to USPS officials, agreements with foreign posts  are governed by UPU rates, which are developed based on domestic  postal rates. The U.S. has low domestic postal rates compared to other  countries, and as a result, its UPU-established inbound mail rates do not  allow some international NSAs to cover their costs.

According to  USPS data, some sales and promotions are estimated to have generated  little to no net revenue during the program periods. However, according to  USPS officials, these incentives have generally been successful in that  they will eventually help sustain mail volume. Officials said that mailers  who have taken advantage of sales and promotions have increased their  overall mail volume, while those who have not participated in these  programs have kept their volume steady or reduced it. Further, USPS\u2019s  long-term goal for promotions is that they will enhance the value of the  mail for mailers and therefore help to keep mailers in the mail beyond the  program period. It is unclear the extent to which sales and promotions are  accomplishing this goal, as discussed below. PRC approves sales and  promotions under the requirements for setting rates and has conducted  after the fact reviews of two sales. According to PRC officials, they were  unable to evaluate the results of the other sales or promotions because  USPS did not provide sufficient data to PRC.", "USPS offered sales on First-Class Mail and Standard Mail products to  encourage additional mail volume and revenue during a historically low- volume period. For example, USPS\u2019s first sale was held during 4 months  in the summer of 2009, offering a 30 percent discount for Standard Mail  on incremental volume above a threshold volume tailored to each  participating mailer. USPS stated that it had the ability to offer a steep  discount on any mail volume sent above what the customer mailed during  the same four month period in the summer of 2009 because it had  significant excess capacity and, as a result, there was little incremental  cost for USPS to mail the additional volume. USPS conducted a similar  sale in the summer of 2010 because of the estimated profits from the first  sale, as well as continued excess capacity.", "USPS estimated maximum net revenue of $126 million for the sales it has  conducted, though PRC has estimated different results than USPS in  every case where PRC has examined the net revenue. Specifically, PRC  estimated that the 2009 sales programs\u2014Standard Mail Volume Incentive  Pricing Program and First-Class Mail Incentive Program\u2014lost money for  USPS during the time in which it offered the discount. PRC estimated a  $7 million net loss for the First-Class Mail Incentive Program, and an  approximately $37 million net loss for the Standard Mail Volume Incentive  Pricing Program. As with domestic, market dominant NSAs, PRC used a  different methodology than USPS to estimate the net revenue generated  by these sales. The different methodologies used by PRC and USPS to  evaluate discount programs for market dominant products are discussed  further below. According to PRC, they have not evaluated the results of  all sales because of corrupt or missing USPS data.", "USPS estimated a maximum net value of about $58 million for  promotions conducted to date (see table above). USPS has offered  promotions as temporary discounts on First-Class Mail and Standard Mail  products to help connect physical mail to technology, which USPS  assumed would increase the value of mail for mailers and help sustain  mail volume and revenue in the future. For example, USPS promotions  encourage retailers to print Quick Response (QR) codes on physical mail  pieces, which allow the consumer to scan the QR code with their mobile  device, directing them to the retailers\u2019 website, as illustrated in figure 3.", "USPS has used promotions to increase the value of the mail for mailers  so that they sustain their use of mail. Specifically, USPS uses promotions  as tools to develop innovative products, such as the use of discounts as  incentives for mailers to invest in technology that may increase the value  of mail over the long term. For instance, USPS implemented the 2012  holiday mobile shopping promotion for 2 weeks and gave a 2 percent  discount to First-Class Mail and Standard Mail cards, letters, and flats that  included a QR code. With this promotion, USPS sought to provide  incentives for more mailers to use mobile barcodes to direct consumers to  their websites for more information on sales. Officials told us that USPS  believed direct mail that included such barcodes is more valuable  because it makes the mail a multi-media experience. USPS noted that by  increasing the value of its mail products it can retain as much advertising  revenue as possible. An additional component of this promotion was the  potential for customers to earn an additional 1 percent discount if their  volume exceeded specified Priority Mail thresholds. Although USPS has  estimated the financial result of promotions for the program period, it has  not provided any estimates of the long-term financial results to PRC, as  discussed in more detail later in this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Opportunities for Increasing Revenue from NSAs, Sales, and Promotions Are Primarily from Competitive NSAs, though Challenges May Limit Revenue", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Opportunities Exist to Generate Additional Revenue from Competitive NSAs but Will Likely Not Offset Declines from Other Products", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Opportunities Exist Because of Continued Growth in E- Commerce", "paragraphs": ["Opportunities exist to generate additional revenue through competitive  product NSAs primarily because of merchandise shipments associated  with the continued growth in e-commerce. USPS projects that total  shipping and package volume will grow by about 33 percent by the end of  fiscal year 2017, after increasing about 7.5 percent in fiscal year 2012.  Expansion of e-commerce has been a key factor in the growth of these  products, most of which are competitive. Moreover, e-commerce  continues to grow and has not reached its full potential because of  accessibility, returns, payment, and security concerns. Companies that  can solve these shortcomings may garner additional business, and USPS  may be able to develop NSAs with these companies.", "Other factors may allow USPS to continue taking advantage of the growth  in e-commerce and generate additional revenue through competitive  product NSAs. First, even if USPS moves to a 5-day delivery schedule, it  has proposed that it would continue to deliver packages on Saturday to  maintain its advantage of delivering to every household 6 days a week  without a surcharge. Second, although USPS faces private-sector  competitors with entrenched market share of the package delivery  business, USPS has certain competitive advantages. Although FedEx  and UPS lead the high-volume business-to-business package delivery  market, it can be very expensive for them to deliver single items to  residential addresses, particularly in rural areas. Along with such \u201clast  mile\u201d delivery advantages, USPS also has special access to some large  residential buildings.", "While the growth and opportunities associated with competitive products  are substantial, additional growth is not likely to offset declines in other  products. Competitive products taken as a whole are a modest piece of  USPS\u2019s total revenue, and generate relatively low profits, compared to  the most profitable market dominant products, First-Class Mail and  Standard Mail (see fig. 4). Even with robust growth in competitive  products, including NSAs involving those products, it is extremely unlikely  that this additional revenue will offset the projected declines in First-Class  Mail and other products.", "USPS\u2019s ability to generate additional revenue from competitive product  NSAs may also face challenges because of the length of the process to  develop NSAs. The USPS Office of Inspector General (OIG) reported in  2011 that, despite improvements, the preparation and review process for  new product approvals puts USPS at a competitive disadvantage in terms  of speed to market. Three mailers we spoke with that had NSAs with  USPS said that the time it took to develop and obtain approval for NSAs  was long when compared to negotiating contracts with USPS\u2019s  competitors, and three other mailers also described the process as  lengthy (see fig. 5). Four of the mailers we spoke with that had not  developed NSAs with USPS also told us that they perceive the process of  developing NSAs as burdensome, which deters them from pursuing such  agreements.", "USPS officials said that they employ a \u201crisk-based\u201d process for evaluating  proposed NSAs, which involves differing levels of scrutiny depending on  the size of the proposed agreement. Specifically, USPS has a multi-step  internal process for developing and approving competitive NSAs. First,  the agreement is generally negotiated by sales representatives using  costing templates, which allows them to develop agreements that are  estimated to cover the costs of the particular product involved. USPS\u2019s  finance office also examines each agreement to ensure that it is projected  to cover its costs. USPS conducts a \u201cbusiness evaluation\u201d to ensure that  the agreement is likely to generate profit for USPS. USPS\u2019s Law  Department reviews an agreement throughout its development. USPS  officials noted that carrying out business evaluations can be difficult  because of the availability of the data and the ability to turn the analysis  around quickly. Competitive NSAs are also authorized by the USPS  Board of Governors, subject to internal USPS review, as well as review  by PRC. The officials said that the competitive, dynamic, nature of the  marketplace requires them to \u201cgo to market\u201d quickly, which has to be  balanced with the review process to ensure agreements generate profit  for USPS.", "USPS officials noted that the PRC review process for competitive product  NSAs offers competitors the opportunity to undercut USPS\u2019s price. In  2011, PRC noted that \u201cmailers have expressed concerns about the time  and expense associated with NSAs\u201d but concluded that \u201cxperience  suggests that the time and effort required to put an NSA into effect is due,  in greater part, to negotiating with the Postal Service and internal Postal  Service review and approval rather than to the Commission\u2019s limited  regulatory review.\u201d Two mailers we spoke with also noted that they  spent the majority of the time developing NSAs with USPS, not waiting for  a PRC review. USPS officials noted that the time and effort that they  spend on internal review and approval for international NSAs in particular  are largely a result of the PRC\u2019s Rules of Practice. If the regulatory review  were further streamlined, according to USPS, the time and effort needed  to develop NSAs would be substantially reduced. PRC officials noted that  as USPS and PRC have gained experience with competitive NSAs and  streamlined the process, the average time has steadily decreased.", "USPS has taken actions to streamline the process for developing  competitive NSAs. First, to expedite and simplify the review of some  competitive NSAs, USPS and PRC developed \u201cumbrella\u201d products. These  products allow USPS to enter into NSAs that fall within a range of prices.  A mailer may enter into such an NSA without pre-implementation review  by PRC. According to USPS officials and PRC, this structure has  facilitated the development of many NSAs, while maintaining an  appropriate level of oversight. Second, USPS officials employ risk-based  internal reviews, submitting NSAs with larger potential revenues to  greater internal scrutiny than those with more limited potential before they  are provided to PRC for review. Finally, USPS has developed costing  \u201ctemplates\u201d for its sales force. These templates include mail products\u2019  attributable costs, facilitating the sales forces\u2019 ability to offer discounts to  mailers that allow USPS to at least cover its costs with the NSA.", "To further streamline the process for developing NSAs, USPS has  advocated for \u201cafter the fact\u201d reviews of all competitive product NSAs.  These reviews could improve NSAs\u2019 speed-to-market, as is currently  done with the \u201cumbrella\u201d products discussed above.

USPS\u2019s current estimates, as well as those of  Christensen Associates on behalf of the USPS\u2019s OIG, suggest that First- Class Mail has low price elasticity. These estimates mean that First- Class Mail volume is relatively insensitive to price changes and that  recent volume declines are not related to the price of the postal products  but to other factors, such as the lower cost of electronic communication.  As a result, many mailers are not likely to respond to price decreases,  such as discounts in NSAs, with additional mail volume, or to price  increases with less volume. USPS\u2019s estimates also suggest that Standard  Mail has relatively low price elasticity.", "As a result of these price elasticities, price increases for some market  dominant products may actually generate more revenue than discounts in  market dominant NSAs. Indeed, it is likely that First-Class Mail as a whole  could weather higher prices, according to the USPS OIG. In theory, an  attractive target for price increases would be products with low price  elasticities, as modest price changes would likely have relatively minor  effects on volume. As USPS commented in 2011, it might be rational, in  some cases, to increase prices of profitable products with low  elasticities. First-Class Mail, and to a lesser extent Standard Mail, are  highly profitable for USPS and have low price elasticities. There may  therefore be additional revenue potential in the remaining First-Class Mail  and Standard Mail volume, and capturing this intrinsic value by increasing  prices is a common business practice. However, there may also be a  point at which rate increases are self-defeating, potentially triggering  large, permanent declines in mail volume. Also, market dominant  products are subject to a price cap for each class of mail, limiting the  extent to which USPS can increase the prices on, for example, First- Class Mail.", "USPS faces the difficulty of determining whether market dominant NSAs  will increase volume and revenue. To show that market dominant NSAs  improve the net financial position of USPS (i.e., create net revenue), PRC  requires USPS to provide details about the expected improvements in  USPS revenue resulting from any proposed NSA. Estimating the net  revenue generated by an NSA depends on accurately estimating how  much mailers would mail in the absence of an agreement. Accordingly,  PRC has directed that USPS provide it with details of projected mailer- specific costs, volumes, and revenues absent the NSA and as a result of  the NSA. To satisfy this requirement, USPS has generally used mail  volume data, as well as expectations of future economic conditions, to  develop projections of mailers\u2019 future volumes. However, USPS has not  described to the PRC its precise methods for using past mail volume data  and other qualitative factors used to develop these projections.", "While PRC has noted that \u201cit is incumbent upon the Postal Service to  develop a quantitative approach that incorporates the factors it is using to  estimate volumes,\u201d this approach can be challenging because of data  limitations. One possible quantitative approach, suggested by PRC, to  estimate mailer-specific volumes both in the absence of and as a result of  an NSA is an elasticity model, using mailer-specific elasticities (that is, a  measure of the mailer\u2019s sensitivity to price for a specific product). Using  mailer-specific elasticities would allow for a precise estimation of volumes  in the absence and as a result of an NSA. However, developing mailer- specific elasticities can be very difficult. According to PRC officials,  estimation of mailer-specific price elasticities depends on having many  observations of a mailer\u2019s volumes at different prices, in order to use  statistical models to isolate the effect of price from all other factors that  influence a mailer\u2019s volume. PRC has reported that when it is not possible  to develop a mailer-specific elasticity, \u201cthe system-wide average for  products will generally provide useable proxies.\u201d However, as USPS has  noted, the use of average product elasticities to estimate the results of  NSAs, rather than mailer-specific elasticities, can be problematic,  particularly when the response of individual mailers to NSAs are very  different than the average response. Further, according to a mailer we  spoke with, USPS has little choice but to evaluate the projected net value  of an NSA based on historical mail volumes and qualitative factors. The  mailer explained that the projection of future mail volumes is inherently  uncertain; even the mailer did not know how much it was going to mail in  the next year.", "In a 2010 proceeding, PRC \u201csought suggestions from interested persons  for new methods to estimate volume changes resulting from pricing- incentive programs of the Postal Service.\u201d After comments from  stakeholders, PRC concluded that \u201cit is not persuaded that the  alternatives offer a demonstrable improvement over the current  method.\u201d PRC encouraged USPS to identify a more reliable method for  evaluating the impact of NSAs, sales, and promotions and to continue  collecting data that could be used for that purpose. PRC said that the  accuracy of analysis could be improved by USPS\u2019s willingness to collect  mailer-specific, or even industry-specific, information. The lack of this  data has frustrated PRC efforts to evaluate their financial impact.  Ultimately, though, the case for pursuing NSAs must be a matter of  business judgment by USPS management, according to USPS.", "Although these data limitations may increase the risk that market  dominant NSAs will lose money for USPS, they are partially mitigated by  provisions in recent NSAs. USPS has implemented early-out clauses in  NSAs to mitigate the risk posed by unclear projections of net revenue. For  instance, the recent Discover NSA may be canceled at the end of any  contract year, by either party, should the experience prove to be at odds  with the parties\u2019 expectations. Further, when approving the Discover NSA,  PRC estimated that the NSA was unlikely to improve USPS\u2019s net financial  position but stated that \u201callowing this negotiated service agreement to  proceed will allow management to enhance its knowledge of potential  tools to slow the overall declining trend for First-Class Mail volume.\u201d  However, in the 2012 Annual Compliance Determination Report, PRC  recommended that USPS re-evaluate the benefits and costs of continuing  the NSA if it is not realizing a net benefit. As of May 2013, USPS had not  canceled the contract.", "Another challenge to generating additional revenue from market dominant  product NSAs is that the process for developing these agreements can  hinder the development of new agreements. Market dominant product  NSAs are reviewed by PRC as part of a public proceeding. According to  four mailers we spoke with, the fact that such NSAs go through a public  process is a disincentive to developing such agreements. These mailers  are sensitive about allowing any company-specific information to become  public through the PRC review process. According to a 2011 USPS OIG  report, transparency requirements, although prudent, make operating in a  competitive marketplace difficult. PRC officials told us, though, that the  transparency of these proceedings helps balance the increased pricing  flexibility granted to USPS under PAEA with the need for USPS  accountability. Further, PRC regulations allow USPS to file confidential or  proprietary information under seal, so that it remains nonpublic.", "Beyond the transparency concerns, many mailers are concerned about  the time and resources needed to obtain a market dominant NSA. Many  mailers we spoke with expressed concern about the length of time it took  to develop NSAs. Officials from Valassis told us that they spent about 2  years negotiating its recent market dominant NSA, and officials for  Discover said their negotiation lasted about a year. According to another  mailer we spoke with, such long negotiations can hinder the ability to  agree on an NSA because during these time periods the marketplace can  shift, changing the incentives for mailers. PRC review times for these  NSAs can also be substantial, though this time has decreased. For  domestic, market dominant NSAs approved since the enactment of  PAEA, the average review time was 88 days, whereas the average  review time for those NSAs prior to PAEA was 214 days.", "A major reason for the substantial time and resources needed to develop  market dominant NSAs is that many such agreements have faced  substantial opposition from mailers and stakeholders. In particular, some  mailers and mailer industry associations have claimed that some  proposed market dominant NSAs would harm the marketplace. By  statute, market dominant NSAs \u201cmay not cause unreasonable harm to the  marketplace.\u201d In the proceeding for the most recent such NSA, with  Valassis, a majority of commenters opposed the agreement because they  claimed it would create an unfair competitive advantage for Valassis and  harm the marketplace. Commenters said that the agreement would  prevent other direct mail companies from competing on a level playing  field, since Valassis would have a discount on its mail as part of the  agreement. Some commenters also expressed concern that the NSA  could negatively affect local newspapers by replacing the Sunday or  weekend newspaper\u2019s preprinted advertising package\u2014a crucial source  of income, according to newspapers\u2014with stand-alone direct mail from  Valassis. Despite such opposition, though, PRC has approved both  market dominant NSAs proposed since enactment of PAEA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Opportunities for Generating Net Revenue from Sales and Promotions Are Limited by Mail Use Changes and Limited Analysis of Long-term Impact", "paragraphs": ["Opportunities to generate substantial additional revenue through sales  and promotions are limited because of changes in the use of mail. Sales  and promotions have been used for the market dominant products First- Class Mail and Standard Mail. As noted above, though, estimates indicate  that demand for these market dominant products is low, and the volume  for these products continues to decline. Further, the small scale of sales  and promotions\u2014often with short time frames and relatively small  discounts\u2014limit their impact for large mailers, since they may be unlikely  to change their mailing patterns in response to a relatively small incentive.  Two mailers we spoke with maintained that USPS\u2019s sales and promotions  are most effective for small and medium sized mailers.", "USPS has noted that by encouraging additional mail volume and  revenue, sales and promotions provide pricing flexibility to mailers and  help assure adequate revenues for USPS. By statute, sales and  promotions must \u201chelp achieve\u201d several objectives, such as assuring  adequate revenues, to maintain financial stability. Additionally, the  system for regulating rates must take into account several factors, such  as the requirement that each class of mail bear the direct and indirect  costs attributable to that class of mail. (See app. II for a list of all  objectives and factors.)", "In support of sales and promotions when filing for approval with PRC,  USPS has provided estimates of the financial result during the program  time period. A few of these estimates for recent promotions have  projected USPS to lose money during the program period. For example,  USPS estimated that its 2011 mobile barcode promotion would reduce  revenue by as much as $4.63 million. USPS has maintained, though, that  promotions in particular can have value after the program period ends, so  evaluating the financial effect based solely on mailer performance during  the program period does not accurately reflect the true value of these  programs. Indeed, USPS has stated that the long-term goal of promotions  is to enhance the value of the mail for mailers, thereby helping sustain  mail volume. USPS continues to implement a variety of such promotions,  with six new domestic promotions planned for calendar year 2013.", "According to USPS, it continues to refine the methodologies used to  measure the long-term financial effects of sales and promotions, including  tracking mailer behavior and surveying customers, but further data  collection and analysis can be difficult. For example, without knowledge of  mailers\u2019 planned mail volumes, USPS cannot precisely measure volume  that would have been sent by mailers absent the sale or promotion.  Further, attempts to gather data to estimate mailers\u2019 planned mail  volumes can be difficult, as with market dominant NSAs. Nevertheless,  USPS monitors the performance of promotion participants after the  promotion period, and benchmarks their performance (i.e., mail volume)  against their past performance, expected performance, and non-program  participant performance.", "Although not required to when filing for approval, USPS has not provided  details to PRC on the long-term goals, the information it plans to collect in  support of those goals, and the analysis it plans to perform to assess  whether the long-term financial results of promotions met the intended  goals. As a result, PRC has not assessed USPS methodologies for  evaluating the long-term financial results of promotions. As USPS has  noted, its financial challenge leaves little margin for error. Providing  detailed data collection and analysis plans to PRC before implementation  of promotions would allow USPS to better justify how these incentives  help assure adequate revenues. PRC\u2019s assessment of these plans, as  part of its approval decisions for promotions, would also help ensure that  USPS promotions have positive financial results."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["To achieve financial sustainability, USPS has been working to generate  additional revenue to cover its costs.

It is very unlikely, though, that additional net revenue  created by NSAs will offset the revenue declines in other product areas.  Additionally, the benefits, including long-term financial results, of  promotions are not well understood by PRC and other postal  stakeholders because USPS does not provide detailed information on its  data collection and analysis plans to PRC before implementation. As a  result, PRC has not had an opportunity to evaluate USPS\u2019s long-term  goals and analysis plans for promotions.

Promotions for market dominant products must comply with  several statutory objectives and factors, including that they help assure  adequate revenues. When filing for approval, USPS has provided  information to PRC estimating that some promotions may lose money  during the program period. However, as USPS has noted, promotions are  designed to increase the long-term value of mail, thereby helping to  sustain mail volume and revenue. Given its dire financial situation, USPS  should be commended for using its pricing flexibility to try and enhance its  revenue. However, USPS has not provided information to PRC  demonstrating how promotions could achieve these long-term goals.

We have revised the relevant text throughout this  report to better distinguish between the different goals of sales and  promotions.", "In USPS\u2019s letter, USPS also notes that some of the costs for recent  promotions have been recovered through the creation of additional  price cap authority, mitigating the risk of financial losses from the most  recent promotions. USPS is to be commended for seeking ways to  mitigate the financial risks of any postage rate discount, as it has done  with early-out clauses in market dominant NSAs. However, in a recent  decision approving a promotion, PRC did not accept the price cap  treatment proposed by USPS.", "In its letter, USPS also requested that we characterize the data  provided by USPS to PRC on some sales not as \u201ccorrupt\u201d but  \u201cincomplete\u201d or \u201cinsufficient.\u201d The term \u201ccorrupt\u201d is not meant to imply  that USPS intended to make data provided to PRC unusable.

We did not modify the report related to this issue.", "USPS also disagreed with the statement in the report that many mailers  are not likely to respond to price decreases, such as discounts in market  dominant NSAs, with additional mail volume. USPS stated that market  dominant NSAs can provide promising opportunities to increase mail  volumes and revenues in the future. Our conclusion about market  dominant NSAs is based primarily on USPS\u2019s estimates indicating that  market dominant mail products have low elasticities. These estimates are  a measure of the degree to which mailers respond to price changes and  alter their demand for products and services. However, these estimates  are product-wide averages. To the extent individual mailers have  elasticities different from the average, it may be possible to incentivize  additional mail volume from those mailers through price decreases. Few  mailers, though, are likely to have an elasticity different enough from the  average to warrant such an agreement.", "PRC also clarified two points in the report related to market dominant  NSAs.
