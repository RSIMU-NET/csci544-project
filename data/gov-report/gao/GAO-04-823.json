All of the CIOs had responsibility for five areas, including enterprise architecture and IT investment management. However, two of these areas--information disclosure and statistics--were outside the purview of more than half of the officers. Although the CIOs generally did not think placing responsibility for some areas in separate units presented a problem, having these responsibilities performed by multiple officials could make the integration of various information and technology management areas, as envisioned by law, more difficult to achieve. Given these results, it may be time to revisit whether the current statutory framework of responsibilities reflects the most effective assignment of information and technology management responsibilities. The law also generally requires that CIOs report directly to their agency heads, and 19 of the 27 said that they did. However, views were mixed among current and former officers on whether such a direct reporting relationship was important. Agency CIOs come from a wide variety of professional and educational backgrounds, but they almost always have IT or IT-related work or educational experience. Since enactment of the Clinger-Cohen Act, the median tenure of a federal CIO has been about 2 years; in contrast, both current CIOs and former agency IT executives most commonly cited 3 to 5 years as the time they needed to become effective. According to some current CIOs, high turnover is a problem because it can limit CIOs' ability to put their agendas in place. Various mechanisms, such as human capital flexibilities, are available for agencies to use to help them try to reduce CIO turnover or mitigate its effect."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Our work and that of others has shown that the federal government has had  long-standing information and technology management problems.

The 1980 Act focused primarily on centralizing  governmentwide responsibilities in the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB). The law gave OMB specific policy-setting and oversight duties  regarding individual IRM areas\u2014for example: records management,  privacy, and the acquisition and use of automatic data processing and  telecommunications equipment (which was later renamed information  technology). The law also gave agencies a more general responsibility to  carry out their IRM activities in an efficient, effective, and economical  manner and to comply with OMB policies and guidelines. To assist in this  effort, the law required that each agency head designate a senior official  who would report directly to the agency head to carry out the  responsibilities of the agency under the law.", "Together these requirements were intended to provide for a coordinated  approach to managing federal agencies\u2019 information resources. The  requirements addressed the entire information life cycle, from collection  through disposition, in order to reduce information collection burdens on  the public and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government.", "Amendments to the PRA in 1986 and in 1995 were designed to strengthen  agency and OMB implementation of the law. Most particularly, the PRA of  1995 provided detailed agency requirements for each IRM area, to match  the specific OMB provisions.

Two of these areas\u2014 enterprise architecture and capital planning\u2014were mentioned by several  CIOs as the mechanisms they use for integrating responsibilities across  some of the other areas, because, for example they can provide a  checkpoint where the CIO has the opportunity to review proposals and  investments before they are funded. The governance processes used in  implementing enterprise architecture and capital planning can also provide  the opportunity to ascertain that other responsibilities are being executed  as required. For example, these processes can require that plans for new  systems meet security or records management standards before they are  allowed to progress to the next stage of development or funding.", "The next six areas of responsibility shown on the chart\u2014systems  acquisition, major electronic government (e-gov) initiatives, information  collection/paperwork reduction, records management, information  dissemination, and privacy\u2014were assigned to CIOs at between 17 and 25  agencies. Although these responsibilities were formally assigned to the  CIO, it was not uncommon for CIOs to report that multiple units  contributed to carrying out the activities associated with these  responsibilities. For example,   in the management of e-gov initiatives, several CIOs said that they  managed the overall effort and share responsibility with the functional  unit;  in systems acquisition, several agencies reported that responsibility is  shared among the CIO and other officials, such as a procurement  executive or program executive. In addition, many CIOs mentioned that  they provided metrics and measures of ongoing work, while the  procurement or program executive managed the contractor  relationship;   for records management, several CIOs described execution of  responsibilities as a cooperative effort with administrative or program  employees to collect, aggregate, and store the volumes of records;   responsibility for information dissemination at a few agencies was  described as being coordinated with the public affairs office, as this unit  performs quality reviews and the CIO provides technical support; and   responsibility for privacy at a few agencies was described as being  coordinated with the general counsel, as these officials provide high  level guidance and the CIO implements it.", "Finally, information disclosure/Freedom of Information Act and statistical  policy, both statutory responsibilities of the CIO, are the areas least often  assigned to the CIO. In these areas, fewer than 10 of the CIOs hold  responsibility as specified by the PRA. Disclosure is a responsibility that  has frequently been assigned to offices such as general counsel and public  affairs in the agencies we reviewed, while statistical policy is often the  responsibility of separate offices that are responsible for agency data  analysis, particularly in agencies that contain Principal Statistical  Agencies.", "Even for those areas of responsibility that were not assigned to them,  several CIOs reported that they contributed to the successful execution of  agency responsibility. For example, a few mentioned that they provide  technical support for the responsible units, such as assisting with Web  services for information dissemination or maintaining electronic archives  for electronic records management. In addition, five CIOs mentioned that  they supported the unit responsible for records management by providing,  for example, specific support for the design of systems compatible with  electronic records management or by serving in an oversight or  coordination role.", "Most CIOs told us they were comfortable with the existing assignment of  responsibilities, although only five CIOs at the 27 major departments and  agencies were responsible or shared responsibility for all 13 information  and technology management areas. In fact, one of the panels of former  agency IT executives suggested that not all 13 areas were equally important  to CIOs. A few of the former agency IT executives even called some of the  areas relating to information management distractions from the CIO\u2019s  primary responsibilities. However, this is not consistent with the law, which  envisioned that having a single official responsible for the various  information and technology functions would provide integrated  management. Specifically, one purpose of the PRA is to coordinate,  integrate, and\u2014to the extent practicable and appropriate\u2014make federal  information resources management policies and practices uniform as a  means to improve the productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness of  government programs by, for example, reducing information collection  burdens on the public and improving service delivery to the public.

Examples of such integrating mechanisms included IRM plans, enterprise  architecture processes, and IT capital planning processes. We agree that  such mechanisms can provide elements of integration, but we have  repeatedly reported that agencies have not effectively implemented such  activities. For example, in January 2004, we reported that agencies IRM  plans often did not address information functions such as information  collection, records management, and privacy or their coordinated  management. Accordingly, we recommended that OMB develop and  disseminate to agencies additional guidance on developing their strategic  IRM plans.", "In addition to specifying areas of responsibility for the CIOs of major  departments and agencies, the Clinger-Cohen Act calls for certain CIOs to  have IRM as their primary duty. All but a few of the agencies complied  with this requirement. The other significant duties reported by some CIOs  generally related to other administrative or management areas, such as  procurement and human capital. We and Members of Congress have  previously expressed concern about agency CIOs having responsibilities  beyond information and technology management and have questioned  whether split duties allow a CIO to deal effectively with an agency\u2019s IT  challenges. For example, we previously recommended that one agency,  which had a CIO who was also the chief financial officer, appoint a CIO with full-time responsibilities for IRM.

Seventeen CIOs had worked in some  combination of two or more of these sectors. Further, virtually all of them  had work experience and/or educational backgrounds in IT or IT-related  fields. For example, 12 current agency CIOs had previously served in a CIO  or deputy CIO capacity. Those who did not have an IT or IT-related  professional or educational background had significant non-IRM  responsibilities, and their backgrounds were more specific to their other  roles (e.g., human capital management). Moreover, most of the CIOs had  business knowledge related to their agencies because they had previously  worked at the agency or had worked in an area related to the agency\u2019s  mission.

Moreover,  between February 10, 1996, and March 1, 2004, only about 35 percent of the  permanent CIOs who had completed their time in office reportedly stayed  in office for a minimum of 3 years. This is consistent with the views of  many agency CIOs, who believed that the turnover rate was high. A high  turnover rate is a problem, according to some current CIOs, because it can  negatively impact their effectiveness. For example, CIOs may not have time  to put their agenda in place or form close working relationships with  agency leadership. Echoing this view, one former agency IT executive  stated that with too much turnover nothing really substantial is  accomplished by a CIO.", "Among the reasons cited for a high turnover rate were the challenges that  CIOs face, the political environment, and the pay differentials between the  public and private sectors. For example, among the challenges cited by  current CIOs were being perceived as an adversary by others in the agency,  the complexity of the issues, and the high-stress nature and long hours  typical of the position. Another factor affecting the turnover rate is the  number of CIOs who were political appointees; they stayed about 13  months less than those in career civil service positions. Specifically, the  median time in position for career CIOs who had completed their time in  office was about 32 months, while the median for political appointees was  about 19 months. Nevertheless, there was a lack of consensus among the  current CIOs and former agency IT executives about whether CIOs should  be political appointees or not. For example, some believed that political  CIOs could be more effective because they might have more access to, and  influence with, the agency head. Others believed that CIOs in career  positions could be more effective because, for example, they would be  more likely to understand the agency, including its culture and work  environment.", "A number of mechanisms could be used to ensure continuity in the face of  frequent CIO changes in agencies. For example, we have previously  reported that results-oriented performance agreements can help to  maintain a consistent focus on a set of broad programmatic priorities  during changes in leadership. This can help to reduce significant  discontinuities in objectives as new CIOs step in. One mechanism that  came to our attention through our interviews is the establishment of a  deputy CIO position. A deputy CIO can help to ensure continued attention  to ongoing objectives when there is a hiatus between one CIO and the next.  A deputy CIO can also increase the effectiveness of the CIO organization by  providing skills and work experiences that are complementary to those of  the CIO. Moreover, the appointment of deputy CIOs was anticipated by the  Congress when the Clinger-Cohen Act was passed. The conference report  accompanying the act states \u201cthe conferees also intend that deputy chief  information officers be appointed by agency heads that have additional  experience .\u201d At the time of our review, 24  departments and agencies had deputy CIO positions, of which 22 were  filled. The establishment of this position at almost all of the agencies is  important because successful  information and technology management  rests on the skills and performance of the entire CIO organization within  the department and agency\u2014not just the CIO as an individual.", "In addition to taking action to help ensure continuity, agencies may also be  able to use human capital flexibilities\u2014which represent the policies and  practices that an agency has the authority to implement in managing its  workforce\u2014to help retain its CIOs. For example, our model on strategic  human capital management notes that recruiting bonuses, retention  allowances, and skill-based pay can attract and retain critical skills needed  for mission accomplishment. Similarly, two members of our panels of  former agency IT executives stated that the government should examine its  rewards systems and learn from the private sector\u2019s incentive programs.  Other panelists asserted that additional money is not key to attracting and  retaining CIOs; instead they cited the importance of nonmonetary  incentives, such as offering an attractive package of authorities and  responsibilities. We have previously identified six key practices for the  effective use of human capital flexibilities, including planning strategically  and making targeted investments and educating managers and employees  on the availability and use of flexibilities. In addition, we have reported  that although the Office of Personnel Management has taken several  actions to assist agencies in the identification and use of human capital  flexibilities, additional actions by this agency could further facilitate the  use of flexibilities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Major Challenges Facing Agency CIOs", "paragraphs": ["Current CIOs reported that they faced major challenges in fulfilling their  duties (see fig. 2).

For example, one agency CIO cited a challenge of  increasing the security maturity of his agency while dealing with  increased security risks and threats; another discussed institutionalizing  information security policies in the management, planning, and  operation of over 200 systems. We have previously issued guidance  addressing security best practices to help agencies with their  information security challenges.", "Fifteen CIOs discussed challenges associated with IT investment  management, including strengthening an agency\u2019s process to help  ensure that investments are in line with its mission, business needs, and  enterprise architecture and implementing appropriate IT performance  measures. For example, one CIO reported a challenge in developing a  capital planning process that will ensure that the agency\u2019s IT  investments are selected, resourced, and acquired to optimize mission  accomplishment. This individual further elaborated that the agency\u2019s  capital planning process was unwieldy and, therefore, not a good fit in  an IT environment that requires agility to deal with a rapid rate of  change. Another CIO reported problems with performance  measurement\u2014such as a lack of baseline data\u2014and planned to  introduce a balanced scorecard approach and a portfolio management  tool to address this challenge. We have previously issued guidance  related to IT investment management including, most recently, a new version of our framework, which offers organizations a road map for  improving their IT investment management processes in a systematic  and organized manner.", "Eleven agency CIOs emphasized the building and enforcement of an  enterprise architecture as challenging. For example, one CIO noted that  keeping the agency\u2019s enterprise architecture up-to-date was a challenge  in light of evolving federal enterprise architecture guidelines. In April  2003, we issued a framework that provides agencies with a common  benchmarking tool for planning and measuring their efforts to improve  their enterprise architecture management.", "Seven CIOs mentioned that they faced challenges related to  implementing e-government; two of them citing addressing the e- government element of the President\u2019s Management Agenda as a  challenge. Other challenges associated with e-government included (1)  meeting the requirements of the E-Government Act of 2002 (P.L. 107- 347), (2) needing more comprehensive modernization and/or migration  plans that incorporate governmentwide solutions, and (3) balancing and  integrating rapidly evolving e-government initiatives with the need to  provide responsive ongoing operational support.", "In addition to managing IT, agency CIOs also reported challenges  associated with specific technological solutions.

Virtually all agency CIOs  cited resources, both in dollars and staff, as major challenges. The funding  issues cited generally concerned the development and implementation of  agency IT budgets and whether certain IT projects, programs, or operations  were being adequately funded. We have previously reported that the way  agency initiatives are originated can create funding challenges that are not  found in the private sector. For example, certain information systems may  be mandated or legislated, so the agency does not have the flexibility to  decide whether or not to pursue them. Additionally, there is a great deal of  uncertainty over the funding levels that may be available from year to year.  The multitude of players in the budget process can also lead to unexpected  changes in funding. The CIOs cited similar challenges. They observed some  specific budgetary or funding challenges such as (1) technology moving  faster than the budget process, (2) systems requirements not always  accompanied by funding, (3) ensuring adequate and stable funding to  support Office of CIO operations, and (4) difficulty prioritizing IT initiatives  within the budget to ensure that the agency meets Presidential and  Secretarial priorities and mission.", "The government also faces long-standing and widely recognized challenges  in maintaining a high-quality IT workforce. In 1994 and again in 2001, we  reported the importance that leading organizations placed on making sure  they had the right skill mix in their IT workforce. About 70 percent of the  agency CIOs reported on a number of substantial IT human capital  challenges, including, in some cases, the need for additional staff.  Examples of specific comments follow.", "Recruiting. Seven CIOs named recruiting as a challenge. For example,  one CIO stated that the hiring process takes too long and that good  candidates are no longer available by the time the hiring process is  completed. Another CIO noted that turnover in technical positions is  high and that that government cannot fill openings as fast as they occur.", "Training and development. Seven CIOs listed training and development  as a challenge. One CIO noted that training funds were inadequate. In  addition, several CIOs pointed to project management as a particular  area in need of enhancement.", "Retention. Four CIOs listed retention of high quality skilled staff as a  challenge. One CIO commented that, as staff become more skilled and  obtain certifications, they become more difficult to retain and that more  flexibility in retaining staff was needed.", "Succession planning.

As a result, in January 2001 and again in January 2003, we  designated strategic human capital management as a governmentwide  high-risk area. Moreover, in June 2004, we reported that within the  government and the private sector it has been widely recognized that the  federal government\u2019s hiring process is lengthy and cumbersome and  hampers agencies\u2019 ability to hire high-quality people.

For  example, one of the critical success factors we identified in our CIO guide  focuses on the CIO\u2019s ability to establish his or her organization as a central  player in the enterprise. Specifically, effective CIOs\u2014and their supporting  organizations\u2014seek to bridge the gap between technology and business by  networking informally, forming alliances, and building friendships that help  ensure support for information and technology management. In addition,  earlier this year we reported that to be a high-performing organization, a  federal agency must effectively manage and influence relationships with  organizations outside of its direct control.", "Ten agency CIOs reported that communication and collaboration were  challenges. For example, one CIO stated that it is a challenge for him to  deal with the sheer diversity and volume of interactions within and outside  the agency and with the need to align these organizations\u2019 agendas with his  agency\u2019s objectives. Examples of internal communication and  collaboration challenges included (1) cultivating, nurturing, and  maintaining partnerships and alliances while producing results in the best  interest of the enterprise and (2) establishing supporting governance  structures that ensure two-way communication with the agency head and  effective communication with the business part of the organization and  component entities. Other CIOs cited activities associated with  communicating and collaborating with outside entities challenging,  including sharing information with partners and influencing the Congress  and OMB. Although communication and collaboration can be problematic,  our work on the Year 2000 computing challenge demonstrated their value.  Both effective communication and partnering were cited by agencies and  others as lessons learned that contributed to the government\u2019s success in  this critical effort.

For example, one  CIO reported that there was institutional resistance to departmentwide  changes. Another noted that one of his challenges was breaking down long- standing stovepipes that make no sense in a global information  environment. Former agency IT executives also cited the need for cultural  changes as a major challenge facing CIOs. Accordingly, in order to  effectively implement change, it is important that CIOs build  understanding, commitment, and support among those who will be  affected by the change.", "In 2002, we convened a forum to identify useful practices and lessons  learned from major private and public sector organizational mergers,  acquisitions, and transformations that agencies could implement to  successfully transform their cultures.

However, views were mixed as to whether CIOs could be effective leaders  without having responsibility for each individual area.", "The success of the CIO position also hinges, at least in part, on whether the  individuals placed in this role have the background and attributes  necessary to assume an agency\u2019s IT leadership mantle and whether they  spend sufficient time in office to implement changes. Current agency CIOs  have had a wide variety of prior experiences; but they generally have work  and/or educational backgrounds in IT or IT-related fields, as well as  business knowledge related to their agencies. However, most CIOs did not  stay in office for 3 to 5 years, which was the most common response when  we asked current CIOs and former agency IT executives how long a CIO  needed to be in office to be effective. Agencies\u2019 use of various mechanisms,  such as human capital flexibilities, could help reduce the turnover rate or  mitigate its effect. Reducing turnover among CIOs is important because the  length of time CIOs are in office can affect their ability to successfully  address the major challenges they face. Some of these challenges\u2014such as  how IT projects are originated\u2014may not be wholly within their control.

In  particular, OMB and three agencies made specific comments on the report.  These comments and our analysis are summarized below:  Oral comments were provided by representatives of OMB\u2019s Office of  Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Electronic Government  and Information Technology, and Office of General Counsel.  Representatives of these offices noted that, although this report focused  on the extent to which CIOs reported that the areas of responsibility  assigned to them are consistent with 13 areas that GAO identified as  critical to effective information and technology management, they were  unclear on the correlation between or conclusions drawn about who in  the agency is responsible and whether the agency achieves intended  outcomes or results. The objective of this review was to determine  which responsibilities were assigned to current agency CIOs. We did not  attempt to draw conclusions regarding the relationship between the  assignment of specific responsibilities and an agency\u2019s success in  achieving desired outcomes in those areas. The OMB representatives  also noted that only 10 of the 13 areas surveyed by GAO are mandated  by statute, and they questioned the need to include 3 nonstatutorily- mandated areas of CIO responsibility in this report. We continue to  believe that the 3 additional responsibilities included in this report\u2014 systems acquisition, development, and integration; major e-government  initiatives; and enterprise architecture\u2014can contribute significantly to  the successful implementation of information systems and processes.  Furthermore, these responsibilities are assigned to agencies by statute  (though not to the CIO explicitly), the President\u2019s Management Agenda,  and OMB\u2019s own guidance. The importance of these three areas to CIOs  was borne out by the fact that over 90 percent of the CIOs have been  assigned responsibility for them. Finally, the representatives had no  opinion about whether these areas or the agency official designated to  be responsible for them are \u201ccritical\u201d to effective information and  technology management, and they drew no conclusions about the  adequacy or effectiveness of the current statutory framework of CIO  responsibilities.", "The Department of Defense\u2019s Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense  (Deputy CIO) agreed with the findings of the report but did not concur  with our suggestion that the Congress consider the results of our review  when it holds hearings on and introduces legislation related to  information and technology management. In particular, Defense  recommended that either we make no suggestion to the Congress or  that we suggest that the Congress consider ways to strengthen the CIOs\u2019  authority and to focus on specific responsibilities for congressional  review. We agree that strengthening the authority of CIOs can be crucial  to their success and to the effectiveness of information and technology  management in their agencies. Nevertheless, with respect to reporting  to the agency head, the participants in our review offered a number of  alternative arrangements. These alternatives included reporting to a  deputy secretary or to a chief operating officer or equally high-level  official, or maintaining a dual reporting relationship that includes the  agency head. Such reporting relationships may provide the authority  and accountability necessary for CIOs to be effective in their  organizations. Accordingly, we continue to believe that such alternatives  deserve consideration if the Congress holds hearings or introduces  legislation related to CIOs\u2019 reporting relationships. With respect to being  more specific in our suggestions for changes to CIO responsibilities, we  do not want to suggest that the Congress constrain the scope of its  deliberations should it choose to take another look at the  responsibilities of the CIO.

The Assistant Secretary also recommended that the CIO continue  to be required to report to the agency head, which is the reporting  relationship at Interior. Interior\u2019s CIO reporting relationship is  consistent with the law and potentially provides strong support for the  CIO in executing his or her responsibilities.

We agree with the Department of Defense that strengthening the  authority of CIOs in many of the areas for which they have  responsibility can be crucial to their success and to the effectiveness of  information and technology management in their agencies. However,  we do not agree that there was an overall consensus that CIOs should  report to their agency heads. The participants in our review offered a  number of alternative reporting arrangements, including reporting to a  deputy secretary or to a chief operating officer or equally high-level  official, or maintaining a dual reporting relationship that includes the  agency head. While such reporting relationships are not necessarily  directly to the agency head, they may provide the authority and  accountability necessary for CIOs to be effective in their organizations.  We believe these alternatives deserve consideration if the Congress  holds hearings or introduces legislation related to CIOs\u2019 reporting  relationships. 2. We disagree that our Matter for Congressional Consideration should be  more specific. While the two responsibilities mentioned by the  Department of Defense clearly differ from the others in the number of  CIOs reporting that they hold responsibility, the Congress has  established a coordinated approach to managing federal agencies\u2019  information resources. As the Congress considers future statutory  frameworks, this same coordinated approach may well be critical in its  deliberations. Given the broad range of the Congress\u2019s purview, we do  not want to suggest that the Congress constrain the scope of its  deliberations should it choose to take another look at the  responsibilities of the CIO. 3.
