The nation\u2019s current air traffic  control system is reaching its capacity limits as demand for air  transportation continues to grow each year. The Next Generation Air  Transportation System (NextGen) represents a transformation to a new  system that will use satellite-based technologies and state-of-the-art  procedures to handle the increasing volume of air traffic, while further  improving safety and security. Transitioning to NextGen, however, will  require the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to continue to operate  and sustain the current air traffic control system while simultaneously  acquiring and deploying the new NextGen systems on budget and on  schedule.", "In December 2000, President Clinton signed an executive order, and  Congress passed supporting legislation that, together, provided FAA with  the authority to create the performance-based Air Traffic Organization  (ATO) to administer and improve FAA\u2019s management of its current air  traffic control modernization efforts. In 2003, Congress authorized the  creation of the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO), housed  within FAA, to plan for and coordinate a transition to NextGen\u2014 envisioned as a move from largely ground-based radars to precision  satellite-based navigation and including digital, networked  communications; an integrated weather system; layered, adaptive security;  and more. In addition to FAA, JPDO operates in conjunction with multiple  federal partner agencies and with the private sector to collaboratively  conceptualize and plan the NextGen system.", "The reauthorization of FAA provides an opportunity to examine how the  agency is managing the transformation to NextGen. My testimony today  focuses on the following questions: (1) What progress is FAA making in  implementing initiatives that could provide a solid foundation for  managing the transition to NextGen? (2) What is the status of JPDO\u2019s  planning and facilitation of the transition to NextGen? and (3) What are  some key challenges that FAA and JPDO need to address in moving  toward NextGen? My statement is based on our November 2006 report  and recent testimonies as well as on-going work. We conducted this work  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "During the last few years, FAA has made significant progress in  implementing businesslike operations and procedures for acquiring and  managing air traffic control systems which have improved FAA\u2019s  management of the current system and should better position the agency  to manage the enormously complex transition to NextGen. However,  further work remains to fully address past problems in acquiring systems  and to institutionalize changes throughout the agency. By creating the Air  Traffic Organization and appointing a chief operating officer, FAA  established a new management structure and adopted more leading  practices of private sector businesses to address the cost, schedule, and  performance shortfalls that have plagued air traffic control acquisitions.  One outcome of these changes is that for the past 3 fiscal years, FAA has  reported exceeding its system acquisition goals. For fiscal year 2006, FAA  reported that its critical acquisitions were 100 percent on budget and over  97 percent on schedule. FAA has also improved its management of the air  traffic control system through increased efforts to achieve cost savings by  outsourcing and consolidating facilities. Currently, FAA is seeking savings  through outsourcing its planned nationwide deployment of a critical  NextGen surveillance technology. To help sustain progress in managing  acquisitions and address remaining program risks, FAA is working with  the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to develop goals and  milestones for FAA to meet in further reducing acquisition risks. Despite  FAA\u2019s progress, however, the FAA administrator\u2019s term ends in September  2007 and the chief operating officer left in February 2007, after serving 3  years. Thus, FAA will have lost two of its significant agents for change by  the end of September. FAA\u2019s new leaders will need to demonstrate the  same commitment to improvement as the outgoing leaders.", "JPDO has made progress in furthering its key planning documents, but  continues to face challenges in institutionalizing its collaborative  practices. JPDO is developing several key documents\u2014a Concept of  Operations, an Enterprise Architecture, and an Integrated Work Plan\u2014 that together form the foundation of NextGen planning. JPDO has missed  earlier milestones regarding the release of its Concept of Operations and  Enterprise Architecture. JPDO currently plans to release initial versions of  all three documents by July 2007. As we noted in November 2006, JPDO is  fundamentally a planning and coordinating body that lacks authority over  the key human and technological resources of its partner agencies. Thus,  institutionalizing the collaborative process between these partner agencies  will continue to be critical to JPDO\u2019s success. However, JPDO still does  not have in place a formal, long-term agreement among its partner  agencies on their roles and responsibilities in planning and facilitating the  transition to NextGen. JPDO has been working since 2005 to establish a  memorandum of understanding between the partner agencies, although as  of May 4, 2007, the memorandum had been signed by the Departments of  Transportation and Commerce and NASA; the Departments of Defense  and Homeland Security had not yet signed. It will also be important for  institutionalizing collaboration to incorporate NextGen goals and activities  into the partner agencies\u2019 key planning documents, as FAA is currently  doing with its Operational Evolution Partnership\u2014FAA\u2019s new  implementation plan for NextGen. JPDO is also working with OMB to  establish mechanisms to identify NextGen-related projects across the  partner agencies and consider NextGen as a unified, cross-agency program  for funding decisions.", "FAA and JPDO continue to face a number of challenges in moving toward  NextGen, including determining whether the organizations have the  adequate and appropriate technical and contract management expertise,  managing and sustaining the current system, identifying who will conduct  necessary research and development activities, obtaining stable  leadership, conducting needed human factors research, and ensuring the  involvement of all key stakeholders. In November 2006, we recommended  that FAA examine its strengths and weaknesses with regard to the  technical and contract management expertise that will be required to  define, implement, and integrate the numerous complex programs  inherent in the transition to NextGen. In response to our recommendation,  FAA is working with the National Academy of Public Administration to  explore these issues. JPDO recently estimated that the total federal cost  for NextGen infrastructure through 2025 will range between $15 billion  and $22 billion. However, questions remain over which entities will fund  and conduct some of the necessary research, development, and  demonstration projects that will be key to achieving certain NextGen  capabilities. According to officials at FAA and JPDO, they are currently  studying these issues and trying to assess how much research and  development FAA can assume. Of critical importance in the area of  NextGen research is human factors research given the fundamental  changes that NextGen envisions in the roles of air traffic controllers and  pilots due to automation and changes in surveillance technologies and  communications. JPDO has suffered from a lack of stable leadership and is  now functioning under its third director. This issue is exacerbated by  JPDO\u2019s senior policy committee, which has met only four times and has  not met at all as a formal body since November 2005. Finally, JPDO faces a  continuing challenge in ensuring the involvement of all key stakeholders,  such as active air traffic controllers and technicians. Our work on past air  traffic control modernization projects has shown that a lack of  stakeholder or expert involvement early and throughout a project can lead  to costly increases and delays.", "In November 2006, we recommended that the Secretary of Transportation  direct FAA to undertake a formal exploration of the agency\u2019s strengths and  weaknesses with regard to the technical expertise and contract  management expertise that will be required to define, implement, and  integrate the numerous complex programs and systems inherent in the  transition to NextGen. We recommended that the Secretary direct JPDO to  take actions to institutionalize the partner agencies\u2019 collaboration in  supporting NextGen, including action on a memorandum of understanding  among the partner agencies, actions to finalize procedures to leverage  partner agency resources, and actions to develop procedures for dispute  resolution. We also recommended that the Secretary direct JPDO to  determine whether key stakeholders and expertise are not currently  represented in JPDO planning efforts.

ATO has worked to create a flatter organization, with fewer  management layers, and has reported reducing executive staffing by 20  percent and total management by 16 percent. In addition, FAA uses a  performance management system to hold managers responsible for the  success of ATO. More specifically, to better manage its acquisitions and  address problems we have identified, FAA has    undertaken human capital initiatives to improve its acquisition workforce  culture and build towards a results-oriented, high-performing organization;   developed and applied a process improvement model to assess the  maturity of its software and systems capabilities resulting in, among other  things, enhanced productivity and greater ability to predict schedules and  resources; and reported that it has established a policy and guidance on using earned  value management (EVM) in its acquisition management system and that  19 of its major programs are currently using EVM.", "One outcome of the implementation of the changes in program  management and operations is that for the past three fiscal years, FAA has  reported exceeding system acquisition goals.

Similarly, FAA  is seeking savings through outsourcing its planned nationwide deployment  of Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), a critical  NextGen surveillance technology. FAA is planning to implement ADS-B  through a performance-based contract in which FAA will pay  \u201csubscription\u201d charges for the ADS-B services and the vendor will be  responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure. (FAA also  reports that the ADS-B rollout will allow the agency to remove 50 percent  of its current secondary radars, saving money in the program\u2019s baseline.  The remaining radars will serve as a back-up system to ADS-B.) As for  consolidating facilities, FAA is currently restructuring ATO\u2019s  administrative service areas from nine offices to three offices, which FAA  estimates will save up to $460 million over 10 years.", "We previously reported that FAA should pursue further cost control  options, such as exploring additional opportunities for contracting out  services and consolidating facilities. However, we recognize that FAA  faces challenges with consolidating facilities, an action that can be  politically sensitive. In recognition of this sensitivity, the administration\u2019s  reauthorization proposal presents an initiative in which the Secretary of  Transportation would be authorized to establish an independent, five- member Commission, known as the Realignment and Consolidation of  Aviation Facilities and Services Commission, to independently analyze  FAA\u2019s recommendations to realign facilities or services. The Commission  would then send its own recommendations to the President and Congress.

GAO acknowledged those improvements in its 2007  high risk report. In 2005, FAA submitted a plan to OMB for reducing the  risks of cost overruns, schedule slippages, and performance shortfalls with  goals and milestones for FAA to meet in further reducing acquisition risks.

We are exploring FAA\u2019s use of the most recently  approved cost and schedule baselines, which may have changed  significantly since the start of an acquisition, to measure and report on  program performance. Rebaselining acquisitions is an accepted practice  and there can be valid reasons for doing so, such as when changes in a  program\u2019s requirements fundamentally alter the acquisition and make the  originally approved schedule unrealistic.

Although an  earlier version was delayed so that stakeholder comments could be  addressed, Version 1.2 of the Concept of Operations is currently posted on  JPDO\u2019s Website for review and comment by the aviation community. This  226-page document provides written descriptions of how the NextGen  system is envisioned to operate in 2025 and beyond, including highlighting  key research and policy issues that will need to be addressed. For  example, some key policy issues are associated with automating the air  traffic control system, including the need for a backup plan in case  automation fails, the responsibilities and liabilities of different  stakeholders during an automation failure, and the level of monitoring  needed by pilots when automation is ensuring safe separation between  aircraft. Over the next few months, JPDO plans to address the public  comments it receives and issue a revised version of the Concept of  Operations.", "In addition to the Concept of Operations, JPDO is working on an  Enterprise Architecture for NextGen\u2014that is, a technical description of  the NextGen system, akin to blueprints for a building. The Enterprise  Architecture is meant to provide a common tool for planning and  understanding the complex, interrelated systems that will make up  NextGen. According to JPDO officials, the Enterprise Architecture will  provide the means for coordinating among the partner agencies and  private sector manufacturers, aligning relevant research and development  activities, and integrating equipment. JPDO plans to issue an early version  of its Enterprise Architecture next month, although three previous release  dates\u2014March 2006, June 2006, and September 2006\u2014were not met.  According to JPDO officials, until the Enterprise Architecture is released,  precise cost estimates cannot be developed and the partner agencies\u2019  research plans cannot be coordinated.", "Finally, JPDO is developing an Integrated Work Plan that will describe the  capabilities needed to transition to NextGen from the current system and  provide the research, policy and regulation, and acquisition timelines  necessary to achieve NextGen by 2025. The Integrated Work Plan is akin  to a project plan and will be critical for fiscal year 2009 partner agency  budget and program planning. According to a JPDO official, the office  intends to issue its initial draft of the Integrated Work Plan in July 2007.", "We have discussed JPDO\u2019s planning documents with JPDO officials and  examined both an earlier version of JPDO\u2019s Concept of Operations and  the current version that is out for public comment. As we previously  testified, JPDO is focusing on the right types of key documents for the  foundation of NextGen planning. As for the Concept of Operations, the  current version is improved from the prior version due to additional detail.  Nonetheless, we believe that it still does not include key elements such as  scenarios illustrating NextGen operations, a summary of NextGen\u2019s  operational impact on users and other stakeholders, and an analysis of the  benefits, alternatives, and trade-offs that were considered for NextGen. In  addition, it lacks an overall description that ties together the eight key  areas that the document covers.

We see the development of all three of JPDO\u2019s key documents as part of an  iterative and evolutionary process. Thus, it is unlikely that any of these  documents will ever be truly \u201cfinalized,\u201d but rather will continue to evolve  throughout the implementation of NextGen to reflect, for example, the  development of new technologies or problems uncovered during research  and development of planned technologies.", "Finally, while each of the three key documents has a specific purpose, the  scope and technical sophistication of these documents makes it difficult  for some stakeholders to understand the basics of the NextGen planning  effort. To address this issue, JPDO is currently drafting what the office  refers to as a \u201cblueprint\u201d for NextGen, meant to be a short, high-level, non- technical presentation of NextGen goals and capabilities. We believe that  such a document could help some stakeholders develop a better  understanding of NextGen and the planning effort to date."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Institutionalizing the Collaborative Process Will Continue to be Critical to JPDO\u2019s Facilitating NextGen", "paragraphs": ["In our November 2006 report, we noted that JPDO is fundamentally a  planning and coordinating body that lacks authority over the key human  and technological resources of its partner agencies. Consequently,  institutionalizing the collaborative process with its partner agencies will  be critical to JPDO\u2019s ability to facilitate the implementation of NextGen.  JPDO, however, has not established some practices significant to  institutionalizing its collaborative process. For example, at a fundamental  level, JPDO does not have formal, long-term agreements among its partner  agencies on their roles and responsibilities in creating NextGen. There is  no mechanism that assures that the partner agencies\u2019 commitment will  continue over the 20-year timeframe of NextGen or that ensures  accountability to JPDO. According to JPDO officials, they are working to  establish a memorandum of understanding (MOU), signed by the Secretary  or other high-ranking official from each partner agency, which will broadly  define the partner agencies\u2019 roles and responsibilities. JPDO first informed  us of the development of this MOU in August 2005; in November 2006 we  recommended that JPDO finalize the MOU and present it to JPDO\u2019s senior  policy committee for its consideration and action. Nonetheless, according  to a JPDO official, as of May 4, 2007, the MOU has been signed by the  Departments of Transportation and Commerce and NASA, but remains  unsigned by the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security.", "Another key method for institutionalizing the collaborative effort is  incorporating NextGen goals and activities into the partner agencies\u2019 key  planning documents. For example, we noted in November 2006 that NASA  and FAA had incorporated NextGen goals into their strategic plans. These  types of efforts will be critical to JPDO\u2019s ability to leverage its partner  agency resources for continued JPDO planning efforts. Even more  importantly, these efforts will be critical to helping ensure that partner  agencies\u2014given competing missions and resource demands\u2014dedicate the  resources necessary to support the implementation of NextGen research  efforts or system acquisitions.", "Recognizing that JPDO does not have authority over partner agency  resources, FAA and JPDO have initiated several efforts to institutionalize  NextGen. First, JPDO is working with FAA to refocus one of FAA\u2019s key  planning documents on the implementation of NextGen\u2014an effort that  also appears to be improving the collaboration and coordination between  JPDO and ATO. FAA has expanded and revamped its Operational  Evolution Plan (OEP)\u2014renamed the Operational Evolution Partnership\u2014 to become FAA\u2019s implementation plan for NextGen. The OEP is being  expanded to apply to all of FAA and is intended to become a  comprehensive description of how the agency will implement NextGen,  including the required technologies, procedures, and resources. (Figure 2  shows the new OEP framework.) An ATO official told us that the new OEP  is to be consistent with JPDO\u2019s key planning documents and its budget  guidance to the partner agencies. According to FAA, the new OEP will  allow it to demonstrate appropriate budget control and linkage to  NextGen plans and help ensure that FAA\u2019s research and development is  relevant to NextGen\u2019s requirements. According to FAA documents, the  agency plans to publish a new OEP in June 2007.", "In addition, to further align FAA\u2019s efforts with JPDO\u2019s plans for NextGen,  FAA has created a NextGen review board to oversee the OEP. This review  board is co-chaired by JPDO\u2019s director and ATO\u2019s vice president of  operations planning services. Initiatives, such as concept demonstrations  or research, proposed for inclusion in the OEP now need to go through the  review board for approval. These efforts are assessed for relation to  NextGen requirements, concept maturity, and risk. An ATO official told us  that the new OEP process should also help identify some smaller  programs that might be inconsistent with NextGen and which could be  discontinued. Additionally, as a further step towards integrating ATO and  JPDO, the administration\u2019s reauthorization proposal calls for the JPDO  director to be a voting member of FAA\u2019s joint resources council and ATO\u2019s  executive council.", "While progress is being made in incorporating NextGen initiatives into  FAA\u2019s strategic and planning documents, more remains to be done with  FAA and the other JPDO partner agencies. For example, one critical  activity that remains in this area will be synchronizing the NextGen  enterprise architecture\u2014once JPDO releases and further refines it\u2014with  the partner agencies\u2019 enterprise architectures. Doing so should help align  agencies\u2019 current work with NextGen while simultaneously identifying  gaps between agency plans and NextGen plans. Also, while FAA is making  significant progress toward creating an implementation plan for NextGen  with its OEP, the other partner agencies are less far along or have not  begun such efforts. JPDO\u2019s lack of authority over partner agency  resources will be minimized as a challenge if the partner agencies commit  to NextGen goals and initiatives at a structural level. By further  incorporation of NextGen efforts into strategic planning documents, the  partner agencies will better institutionalize their commitments to JPDO  and the NextGen initiative.", "Finally, JPDO has made progress in establishing mechanisms for  leveraging partner agency resources\u2014another important practice for  institutionalizing JPDO\u2019s collaborative effort. As we noted in our  November 2006 report, JPDO is working with OMB to develop a process  that would allow OMB to identify NextGen-related projects across the  partner agencies and consider NextGen as a unified, cross-agency  program. We recommended that JPDO develop written procedures that  formalize agreements with OMB regarding the leveraging of partner  agency resources and the identification of NextGen-related programs  within agency budgets. We recently met with OMB officials who said that  they felt there has been significant progress with JPDO over the last year.  JPDO is now working on an OMB Exhibit 300 form for NextGen that will  allow JPDO to present OMB a joint business case for the NextGen-related  efforts within the partner agencies and will be used as input to funding  decisions for NextGen research and acquisitions across the agencies.  This Exhibit 300 will be due to OMB in September 2007 to inform  decisions about the partner agencies\u2019 2009 budget submissions.", "Ultimately, the success of JPDO will have to be measured in the efforts of  its partner agencies to implement policies and procedures, conduct  research, and acquire systems that support NextGen. For example, JPDO  is currently working to establish a joint weather office involving FAA and  the Departments of Defense and Commerce. The goal of this joint office is  to eliminate redundancies in weather research and leverage the resources  of these partner agencies to implement a joint weather product by 2012,  according to a senior JPDO official. Similarly, JPDO has secured a  commitment from the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security  and FAA to jointly fund the developmental testing of scenarios for  network enabled operations.", "With regard to implementation of NextGen technologies, JPDO can point  to its success in collaborating with FAA to fund and speed FAA\u2019s rollout of  two systems considered cornerstone technologies for NextGen: ADS-B  and System Wide Information Management (SWIM).

In addition to technical  expertise, FAA will need contract management expertise to oversee the  systems acquisitions and integration involved in NextGen.", "Recognizing the complexity of the NextGen implementation effort and the  possibility that FAA may not have the in-house expertise to manage it  without assistance, we have identified potential approaches for  supplementing FAA\u2019s capabilities. One of these approaches is for FAA to  contract with a lead systems integrator (LSI). Generally, an LSI is a prime  contractor that would help to ensure that the discrete systems used in  NextGen will operate together and whose responsibilities may include  designing system solutions, developing requirements, and selecting major  system and subsystem contractors. The government has used LSIs before  for programs that require the integration of multiple complex systems. Our  research indicates that although LSIs have certain advantages, such as the  knowledge, understanding, skills, and ability to integrate functions across  various systems, their use also entails certain risks. For example, because  an LSI may have significantly more responsibility than a prime contractor  usually does, careful oversight is necessary to ensure that the  government\u2019s interests are protected and that conflicts of interest are  avoided. Providing the oversight that is needed, however, can be  compromised when government expertise is lacking. Consequently,  selecting, assigning responsibilities to, and managing an LSI could pose  significant challenges for JPDO and FAA.", "Another approach that we have identified involves obtaining technical  advice from federally funded research and development corporations to  help the agency oversee and manage prime contractors. These nonprofit  corporations are chartered to provide long-term technical advice to  government agencies in accordance with various statutory and regulatory  rules to ensure independence and prevent conflicts of interest.", "In November 2006, we recommended that FAA examine its strengths and  weaknesses with regard to the technical expertise and contract  management expertise that will be required to define, implement, and  integrate the numerous complex programs inherent in the transition to  NextGen. In response to our recommendation, FAA has contracted with  the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) to determine the  needed skill mix and the number of those skilled persons, such as  technical personnel and program managers, that would be necessary to  implement the new OEP and to compare those requirements with current  FAA staff resources. According to FAA, the next step in this process would  be to contract with NAPA or another organization for advice on how best  to fill any skills gaps and how to proceed with management and oversight  of the implementation of NextGen.

Investigations by FAA and the Department of  Transportation Inspector General into these incidents identified a number  of underlying issues, including the age and condition of equipment.  Nationwide, the number of scheduled and unscheduled outages of air  traffic control equipment and ancillary support systems has been  increasing. Increases in the number of unscheduled outages indicate that  systems are failing more frequently.

JPDO believes the total federal cost for NextGen infrastructure through  2025 will range between $15 billion and $22 billion. JPDO also reported  that a preliminary estimate of the corresponding cost to system users, who  will have to equip with the advanced avionics that are necessary to realize  the full benefits of some NextGen technologies, produced a range of $14  billion to $20 billion. JPDO noted that this range for avionics costs reflects  uncertainty about equipage costs for individual aircraft, the number of  very light jets that will operate in high-performance airspace, and the  amount of out-of-service time required for installation.", "FAA, in its capital investment plan for fiscal years 2008-2012, includes  estimated expenditures for 11 line items that are considered NextGen  capital programs. The total 5-year estimated expenditures for these  programs is $4.3 billion. In fiscal year 2008, only 6 of the line items are  funded for a total of roughly $174 million; funding for the remaining 5  programs would begin with the fiscal year 2009 budget.

In the  past, a significant portion of aeronautics research and development,  including intermediate technology development, has been performed by  NASA. To its credit, NASA plans to focus its research on the needs of  NextGen. However, NASA is also moving toward a focus on fundamental  research and away from developmental work and demonstration projects,  which could negatively impact NextGen if these efforts are not assumed  by others.", "In addition, JPDO will need to conduct modeling for NextGen and may  look to its partner agencies to provide modeling capabilities and support.  For example, NASA\u2019s NAS-wide modeling platform, the Airspace Concepts  Evaluation System (ACES), permits JPDO to, among other things,  evaluate alternative research ideas and assess the performance of  competing vendors. According to a JPDO official, this capability, which is  critical to NextGen research, is eroding as JPDO\u2019s investment simulation  requirements are expanding. As part of its fundamental research mission,  NASA intends to upgrade to ACES-X (a more sophisticated representation  of the national airspace system), but not for another two years. Until then,  JPDO\u2019s investment modeling capability will be constrained unless the  office or another partner agency can assume the modeling work. For  example, the Department of Defense has detailed aircraft models and the  Department of Homeland Security has detailed models of airport terminals  that are relevant for JPDO\u2019s simulations. This is an issue that needs to be  addressed in the short-term.", "JPDO faces the challenge of determining the nature and scope of the  research and technology development necessary to begin the transition to  NextGen, as well as identifying the entities that can conduct that research  and development. According to officials at FAA and JPDO, they are  currently studying these issues and trying to assess how much research  and development FAA can assume. An FAA official recently testified that  the agency proposes to increase its research and development funding by  $280 million over the next 5 years. However, a draft report by an advisory  committee to FAA stated that FAA would need at least $100 million  annually in increased funding to assume NASA\u2019s research and  development work, and establishing the necessary infrastructure within  FAA could delay the implementation of NextGen by 5 years. JPDO\u2019s  Integrated Work Plan will permit NASA and the other partner agencies to  assess the research and development needs of NextGen, determine  funding, and conduct the necessary initiatives.

As  JPDO begins its fourth year in operation, it is functioning under its third  director and operated for much of 2006 under the stewardship of an acting  director. The current director of JPDO has held the position since August  2006. The Next Generation Air Transportation System Institute (the  Institute), created to facilitate the participation of nonfederal stakeholders  in the NextGen effort, noted in its recent annual report that JPDO\u2019s  leadership turnover had made it a challenge for JPDO to move out more  aggressively on many goals and objectives, as the office waited on a full- time director. The Institute also stated that JPDO\u2019s leadership turnover  had limited the ability of the Institute\u2019s executive committee to forge a  stronger relationship with JPDO leadership and work jointly on strategic  issues and challenges. These fundamental leadership issues are  exacerbated by the lack of meetings of JPDO\u2019s senior policy committee.  Although JPDO has been functioning for just over 3 years, the senior  policy committee has met only four times, and has not met at all as a  formal body since November 2005.", "In addition to the lack of stable leadership, JPDO\u2019s management lacks the  authority to hold much of JPDO\u2019s staff accountable for their performance.  As we noted in November 2006, JPDO has staffed the various levels of its  organization with employees from its partner agencies and this practice  helps to leverage partner agency human resources. However, a drawback  of such staffing is a lack of real or perceived accountability to JPDO.  According to JPDO officials, the JPDO workforce consists largely of part- time partner agency personnel who have been detailed to JPDO and part- time private sector volunteers. Only a few permanently-assigned FAA staff  have their performance appraised by JPDO management, although the  director does provide input to the performance appraisals of some of the  managers detailed to JPDO from partner agencies.

For example, these IMC members noted that there were  stresses placed on the Institute\u2019s executive director resulting from the  need to meet the competing demands of the IMC, the IMC executive  committee, and JPDO management. Other IMC members attributed the  stresses on the executive director to the lack of clarity in the Institute\u2019s  role. These members noted that while the Institute is clearly charged with  selecting private sector participants for JPDO\u2019s work groups, the  Institute\u2019s role of conducting research for the JPDO could be viewed as  overlapping with other advisory organizations such as RTCA. Two IMC  members believed that the Institute\u2019s award of only two research contracts  in two years illustrates that the Institute is not yet functioning as intended.  Some IMC members also pointed out that a formal mechanism for  providing industry input to JPDO on NextGen concepts and issues has not  yet been fully established, even though this is one of the missions of the  Institute.
