Before Treasury invests any portion of its operating cash balance, Treasury generally targets a $5 billion balance in its Treasury General Account (TGA) which is maintained across the 12 Federal Reserve Banks. The TT&L program provides Treasury with an effective system for collecting federal tax payments while assisting the Federal Reserve in executing monetary policy, but it subjects Treasury to concentration risk and earns a return well below the market rate. The TIO program earns a greater rate of return but it also subjects Treasury to concentration risk. Both programs also present capacity concerns. Treasury began testing repos through a pilot program in 2006. Repos have earned near market rates of return, but because of the pilot's scope and the current, limited legislative authority under which it operates, the repo participants, collateral, trading terms, and trading arrangements are restricted. A permanent, expanded repo program could permit Treasury to earn a higher rate of return, expand investment capacity, and reduce concentration risk. If given authority to design such a program, Treasury would need to tailor it to meet liquidity needs and to achieve a higher rate of return while minimizing risks that are associated with the selection of program participants, collateral types, terms of trade, and trading arrangements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Growing debt and net interest costs are a result of persistent fiscal  imbalances.

Over $114.3 trillion in repo  trades involving U.S. Government Securities were reported in the first  quarter of 2007, with an average daily volume of approximately $1.8  trillion.  Repos were used by the Federal Reserve as early as 1917 and play  an important role in the conduct of monetary policy operations since the  Federal Reserve uses repos to dampen transient fluctuations in the supply  of reserves available to the banking system.  For the past 20 years, large  corporations have been shifting cash assets out of bank accounts into  instruments such as repos, which have enabled them to increase the  returns on their short-term cash assets with minimum risk to their funds.", "Electronic systems have increased the speed of repo transactions and  expanded the range of investors that can participate.

An overdraft of the TGA could occur if the anticipated receipts  for the day fall short of expectation or if there are unanticipated  disbursements. Treasury cannot risk an overdraft because the Federal  Reserve is not authorized to lend directly to Treasury, in part to preserve  the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence as the nation\u2019s central bank. Before  1988, as federal payments became larger and the volatility of Treasury\u2019s  operating cash balance increased, Treasury and the Federal Reserve  increased the TGA target balance.

See  appendix V for more detail on Treasury\u2019s modifications to the TGA target  balance since 1988.", "In the past, Treasury relied on compensating balances in depositary  institutions as a source of liquidity on rare occasions.

As shown in figure 3, in 2006 the TGA  balance deviated more than 20 percent from its $5 billion target 17 times.  In 9 of the 17 times, Treasury and the Federal Reserve had agreed in  advance to target a balance other than $5 billion.

However, the Federal Reserve told us that the amount cannot be  easily identified. The implicit return Treasury receives depends on  whether the purchases the Federal Reserve makes to offset the TGA  balance are permanent or temporary. In a stable TGA target environment,  such as exists today, the implicit return is roughly equivalent to the rate  earned by the Federal Reserve on its portfolio of Treasury securities. For  temporary increases in the TGA, the implicit return is roughly equal to the  rate the Federal Reserve earns on its overnight repos. According to the  Federal Reserve, the return cannot be isolated because it does not assign  specific portions of its investment portfolio to the TGA. The Federal  Reserve records the TGA on its balance sheet as a liability and offsets  increases in the TGA by purchasing additional assets.", "While a higher TGA target balance would provide Treasury with increased  overdraft protection and earn market rates of return, it could increase  borrowing, which is costly whenever Treasury faces a negative funding  spread. A negative funding spread occurs when the interest earned on  cash balances is insufficient to cover the cost of the increased borrowing  necessary to maintain these balances. Conversely, if the Treasury were to  face a neutral or positive funding spread, increases would not be costly.

(See table 2.) There are three categories of participation:  collectors, retainers, and investors. The majority of TT&L participants are  collectors\u2014they receive tax payments from customers and transfer the  payments to Treasury\u2019s account at the Federal Reserve. Retainers perform  the same tax collection functions but may also retain specified amounts of  the cash in an interest-bearing account until the money is called by  Treasury. Investors not only collect and retain cash, but also may accept  funds from Treasury though different investment options. In one of these  options, the depositary institution agrees to accept automatic direct  deposits from Treasury made hourly throughout the day in the event that  Treasury cash receipts are greater than anticipated. These automatic  deposits\u2014known as dynamic investments\u2014are an important part of the  TT&L program because they are currently Treasury\u2019s only option for  placing late-day cash and helping Treasury to meet its target TGA  balance.", "TT&L Participant Concentration: TT&L deposits are highly  concentrated among a few large depositary institutions. For the past  couple of years, Treasury has invested almost half of TT&L deposits with  one depositary institution. Reasons for this concentration include  consolidation in the banking industry over the last two decades and the  lack of investment caps. In 2006, the five largest TT&L participants  accounted for 66 percent of the total funds invested in TT&L accounts, up  from 62 percent in 2005. (See tables 3 and 4.) This creates not only  concentration risk but also capacity concerns. If one or two of the largest  depositary institutions were to lower their TT&L balance limits or  withdraw from the program entirely, Treasury\u2019s investment capacity  would fall far below that needed to accept the total amount of funds that  Treasury needs to invest during peak tax collection dates. In addition, the  number of depositary institutions participating in the TT&L program and  thus willing to accept Treasury cash has decreased over the past few  years. According to Treasury, at times it has been unable to place all of the  cash it wished to invest in part because of a reduction in the number of  TT&L participants.", "TT&L Rates of Return: The interest rate earned on deposits in retainer  and investor accounts is fixed at the federal funds rate minus 25 basis  points. TT&L deposits are an inexpensive source of funding relative to  market alternatives for depositary institutions, but Treasury can withdraw  certain funds on short notice and funds are subject to strict collateral  requirements. See appendix II for a discussion of TT&L collateral  requirements.", "When Treasury set the TT&L rate in 1978, it was a close approximation of  the overnight repo rate, which Treasury considered an economically  similar transaction. Treasury elected to use a proxy rate at the time  because information on the daily overnight repo rate was not widely  available. The repo market has grown considerably, and information about  repo rates is now readily available. Since 1978 the spread between the  federal funds rate and the repo rate has narrowed significantly from about  25 basis points to about 9 basis points in recent years. As a result, the  spread between the TT&L rate and the overnight repo rate has grown  larger, leaving Treasury earning a fixed rate on TT&L accounts that is well  below market rates. (See fig. 4.) In July 1999 Treasury proposed changing  the interest rate on TT&L deposits to align it with the overnight repo rate  since Treasury viewed TT&L deposits as overnight investments, similar to  repo transactions. However, financial institutions opposed the rate  change; in 2002 Treasury modified the proposal and began exploring the  short-term investment alternatives discussed later in this report,  specifically TIOs and repos."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TIO Program Earns a Better Rate of Return Than TT&L but Exposes Treasury to Similar Risks", "paragraphs": ["Treasury\u2019s TIO program, fully established in 2003, earns Treasury a higher  rate of return than the TT&L program but shares the TT&L program\u2019s  concentration risk and Treasury\u2019s capacity concerns in part because the  same depositary institutions participate in both programs. TIO  investments differ from TT&L deposits in two critical dimensions: (1) they  are auctioned rather than placed at a fixed rate and (2) they are placed for  a fixed number of days rather than being callable at will. Through the TIO  program, Treasury auctions off portions of its excess cash at a competitive  rate for a fixed number of days.

In fiscal  year 2006, TIO auction rates were on average 17 basis points higher than  TT&L rates over the same terms, increasing Treasury\u2019s gross return by  approximately $20 million. The TIO rates were also about 3 basis points  below Treasury\u2019s benchmark for a market rate, which is based on repo  rates of similar terms and collateral. There are variations among TIO  auctions regarding the length of the term and the amount of cash offered  that affect rates. According to a Federal Reserve study, TIO rates are most  competitive for TIO term lengths of 5 days or greater, and the larger the  auction size, the lower the TIO rate.", "TIO Participant Concentration: Although the TIO program has  increased Treasury\u2019s rate of return, it has not lessened its concentration  risk, in part because TIO investors must be TT&L depositaries and they  can receive up to 50 percent of funds offered by Treasury per auction. TIO  investment concentration has increased in recent years. In fiscal year 2006,  50 percent of TIO funds were awarded to two depositary institutions, up  from about 40 percent in fiscal year 2004. (See table 5.)", "TIO Collateral and Capacity: TIO collateral restrictions are similar to  those in the TT&L program, and because depositary institutions  participate in both programs, participants\u2019 total capacity is divided  between the two programs. Depositary institutions transfer collateral  between the TIO and TT&L programs in order to participate in upcoming  TIO auctions, which depletes the amount of collateral and capacity in  TT&L accounts.  According to Treasury, TT&L account capacity declined  between 2001 and 2006, but capacity has shifted from TT&L accounts to  the TIO program such that total investment capacity remained in line with  the average capacity from 2001 to 2006. This shift of capacity from TT&L  accounts to the TIO program presents challenges to using all of the  capacity when there is a sudden and significant increase in Treasury\u2019s cash  balance (e.g., if the balance spikes up for only 1 or 2 days).

The objectives  of the pilot were to (1) assess the effect of this type of investment  operation on both Treasury and Federal Reserve operations, internal  systems, and processes, and (2) explore the benefits of using repos to  expand Treasury\u2019s investment capacity and increase the return on invested  funds. Initially there was only one participant; a second participant was  added in August 2006. In the first 12 months of the repo pilot program,  Treasury conducted 235 repo transactions, and invested $645 billion  altogether. Treasury\u2019s repo investments in the second half of fiscal year  2006 made up 11 percent of its total short-term investment balance. In that  first year of the repo pilot, rates were on average 21 basis points higher  than TT&L rates and earned close to Federal Reserve repo rates.

As a result, it cannot invest with securities dealers  who play a prominent role in the repo market. The Federal Reserve  conducts all of its repos with 21 securities dealers, who are selected based  on their ability to make good markets, participate meaningfully in  Treasury auctions, and provide market intelligence that is useful to the  Federal Reserve in the formulation and implementation of monetary  policy. In 2006, the Federal Reserve had an average daily balance of $25.3  billion in repos with selected securities dealers.", "Repo Term and Frequency: The repo pilot program offers only repos  that have a term of 1 business day. Although this term comprises the  largest share of the repo market, some participants invest in repos with  longer terms. In addition, the repo pilot program conducts only a single  daily auction at 9 a.m. Other repo participants conduct transactions  throughout the day in the broader repo market, allowing them to place  cash late in the day.", "Repo Bids: Bidding for Treasury\u2019s repo pilot program is conducted by  telephone, which is consistent with market convention for repos with a  limited number of participants. Industry experts view telephone trading as  an efficient way to conduct trades for offerings with a few counterparties.  A greater number of counterparties may require an electronic trading  system in order to prevent delays between the time rate quotes are made  and accepted. Electronic trading systems also reduce trading costs and the  risk of clearing errors. In 2006 the Federal Reserve upgraded to a new  electronic trading system, FedTrade, to manage its repo trades with  primary dealers. Treasury officials told us that they were exploring the  capabilities of an electronic system similar to that used by the Federal  Reserve and its application to an expanded repo program.", "Repo Collateral: Because of its current investment authority, Treasury  only accepts Treasury securities as collateral in its repo pilot program.  Participants in the larger repo market, including the Federal Reserve,  accept a wider range of collateral types including mortgage-backed  securities and U.S. government agency securities. Although repos backed  by Treasury securities constitute the largest share of the repo market,  there are some important limitations to demand for such repos.  Most  importantly for Treasury, the demand for repos backed by Treasury  securities is lowest during times when Treasury has the most cash to  invest. This happens in April and May, when, in response to high tax  receipts, Treasury reduces the number of Treasury bills available in the  market. Additionally, the rates received on repos backed by mortgage- backed securities and U.S. agency securities are typically higher than the  rates for Treasury securities.", "Repo Clearing and Settlement: Clearing is the process of calculating  the obligations of the counterparties to make deliveries of securities or  payments of cash. Settlement is the transfer of cash and securities  between the party and counterparty. For repo transactions, clearing and  settlement are typically done through either a delivery-versus-payment  (DVP) or triparty arrangement. In a DVP arrangement, as is used in the  repo pilot program, the party and counterparty complete the clearing and  settlement processes. In a triparty agreement, an independent custodial  bank manages the clearing and settlement process.", "As illustrated in figure 5 below, in a DVP transaction, cash is transferred to  the party, and the securities are delivered to the counterparty or its fiscal  agent. The delivery of securities is done over a secure transfer system  operated by the Federal Reserve Banks, which allows the transfer of  certain types of securities such as U.S. Treasury and U.S. government  agency securities.

Three sources of recommended short-term  investment practices are the Government Finance Officers Association  (GFOA), an organization that advises state and local governments\u2019 finance  officials, the Federal Reserve Policy on Payments System Risk, and the  federal repo regulations issued by the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation. Guidance for recommended short-term investment  practices cite three primary objectives, in order of priority: (1) risk  management, (2) liquidity, and (3) yield.", "Risk Management: According to the GFOA, the preservation and safety  of principal is the foremost objective of short-term investments, which is  accomplished by minimizing certain risks that are present in repo  investments:   (a) Credit Risk: The risk that a repo party will not fulfill its  obligations to Treasury.   (b) Concentration of Credit Risk: The risk of loss attributable to  the magnitude of Treasury\u2019s investment in a single party.  (c) Custodial Risk: The risk that, in the event of a failure of a repo,  Treasury will not be able to recover the full value of collateral  securities that are in possession of outside parties.   (d) Interest Rate Risk: The risk that changes in interest rates will  adversely affect the fair value of Treasury\u2019s investment.", "In a permanent repo program, Treasury will need to establish criteria to  select counterparties to minimize exposure to credit risk, consider its  overall exposure to each party and any of its related parent companies,  and to monitor its exposure to interest rate risk. In determining with  whom Treasury would be willing to conduct repos, Treasury would need  to monitor the possibility of losses due to the high concentration of  investments with a few participants. Specifically, Treasury would need to  consider its overall exposure to each counterparty and any of its related  parent companies and subsidiaries in its investments. To reduce interest  rate risk, Treasury already requires TT&L participants to provide a greater  amount of collateral than the amount of cash received. In a permanent  repo program, Treasury will also need to monitor its exposure to  market/interest rate risk that would arise from accepting a wider variety of  collateral and investing at times for terms longer than overnight.", "Liquidity: Recommended investment practices related to liquidity are  designed to ensure availability of funds when needed. The GFOA identifies  two elements: (1) setting the term of some repo investments to mature  when cash needs are highest and (2) having some repo investments that  allow the investor to obtain cash on short notice without penalty. For  Treasury, cash needs are greatest on or near the beginning of each month.  The ability to obtain cash on short notice might be accomplished by  engaging in overnight repos that can be rolled over every day. Treasury\u2019s  optimal mix of overnight and longer-term repos would depend on the  patterns of Treasury receipts and cash available for short-term  investments and on the timing and size of expected cash needs.", "Yield: An expanded repo program has the potential to improve Treasury\u2019s  return on investments relative to TT&L rates while maintaining current  minimal risk investment policies.

In its evaluation of the repo pilot  program, Treasury raised the possibility of expanding the range of parties  to include the 21 securities dealers selected by the Federal Reserve to  conduct its monetary policy operations. Whether Treasury uses the same  criteria used by the Federal Reserve or develops its own criteria to select  an acceptable set of counterparties, expanding to securities dealers would  give Treasury greater access to the repo market and expand its investment  capacity.", "Repo Collateral: Expanding the type of collateral acceptable in a  permanent repo program could also increase Treasury\u2019s return and  investment capacity. Treasury would benefit from adopting the practice of  other participants in the repo market, including the Federal Reserve,  which accepts a wider range of collateral types, such as mortgage-backed  securities and U.S. government agency securities. For example, the  Federal Reserve selects from participant\u2019s propositions across three  different types of collateral. The rates it accepts depend on the  attractiveness of participant bids relative to current rates in the financing  market for each particular class of collateral.", "Repo Trading: Treasury should consider adopting an electronic trading  system if it expands beyond a small number of participants to ensure  transparency and fairness. Trading in Treasury\u2019s repo pilot program is  conducted by telephone, which is consistent with market convention for  repos with a limited number of participants. However, a greater number of  counterparties may require an electronic trading system in order to  prevent time delays, lower the risk of operational errors, and reduce  trading costs. According to Treasury, it is exploring the capabilities of an  electronic system similar to that used by the Federal Reserve that would  allow it to conduct repo operations with a large number of parties in a  transparent and fair manner.  The exact costs of such a system are  currently unknown.", "Clearing and Settlement: Treasury should consider the advantages and  disadvantages of adopting a triparty clearing and settlement arrangement  for an expanded repo program. A triparty arrangement would reduce  clearing and settlement costs, facilitate the expansion of collateral, and  increase investment flexibility. According to an industry expert, the  primary benefit of triparty arrangements is that the securities are held by a  commercial clearing bank, which reduces risk and administrative work for  both repo counterparties.  For Treasury, triparty arrangements would  reduce the expenses of monitoring, clearing, and settlement. Triparty  arrangements would also facilitate the use of a broader range of securities  for collateral because custodian banks can hold classes of securities that  cannot be transferred over Fedwire. In addition, triparty arrangements  would expand Treasury\u2019s processing capacity, and allow Treasury to make  additional repo investments later in the day to accommodate  unanticipated excess cash.", "Although there are certain disadvantages to triparty arrangements, there  may be options that Treasury could explore to reduce them. Unsecured  intraday exposure may exist because there is a time lag between when  cash from a repo transaction is transferred from the counterparty\u2019s  account and when the counterparty receives the collateral associated with  the transaction. In addition, with a triparty arrangement, Treasury would  not take possession of the pledged securities as its fiscal agent, the  Federal Reserve, does in a DVP arrangement.

However, a number of developments  between 1964 and 1974 brought an end to this practice. Tax receipts grew  significantly, increasing the size of TT&L accounts. Interest rates had risen  considerably, providing significantly greater earnings potential on TT&L  balances. There was a decline in the number of Treasury-related services  that banks performed. In addition, there was no correlation between the  level of service a bank provided and amount of funds it received.  As a  result, it was possible for banks that provided only a few services to  receive large TT&L deposits for which they paid no interest while other  banks that provided numerous Treasury-related services received too little  interest on TT&L deposits to offset their costs.", "In 1974 Treasury concluded that the benefits depositary institutions  received from holding TT&L funds substantially outweighed the aggregate  value of the services that these institutions provided.

There were 276  calendar days in fiscal year 2006 where the daily TT&L Main Account  balance exceeded $2 billion. For each day, we determined (1) what  Treasury actually earned from the residual balance over $2 billion by  multiplying the balance amount by the effective TT&L rate for that day,  and (2) what Treasury could have earned from the residual balance by  multiplying the balance amount by the actual or estimated Federal Reserve  overnight repo rate.  We then calculated the total dollar spread between  these two returns for all 276 days."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Comments from the Department of the Treasury", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Jose Oyola (Assistant Director),  Jessica Berkholtz, Amy Bowser, Tara Carter (Analyst-in-Charge), Richard  Krashevski, Thomas McCabe, Matthew Mohning, Nicolus Paskiewicz, and  Albert Sim made contributions to the report.
