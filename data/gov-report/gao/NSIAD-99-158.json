Until 1990, the  United States provided this \u201crule of law\u201d assistance primarily to countries  in Latin America and the Caribbean.  With the breakup of the Soviet Union,  the Congress directed that part of the U.S. assistance to Central and  Eastern Europe target the development of democratic institutions,  including an independent judiciary.  Since then, the United States has  provided rule of law and related assistance to these and other regions of  the world.", "You expressed concern that comprehensive information was not readily  available about the various U.S. rule of law assistance programs and  activities.  At your request, we examined U.S. rule of law assistance  programs and placed particular emphasis on rule of law activities in Latin  America and the Caribbean.  Specifically, we identified (1) the amount of  U.S. rule of law funding provided worldwide (by region and country) in  fiscal years 1993-98 and (2) the U.S. departments and agencies involved in  providing rule of law assistance.  As agreed with your offices, we are also  providing more detailed information about the use of rule of law assistance  in Latin America and the Caribbean.  We are reporting separately on  coordination efforts among the cognizant agencies in Washington, D.C., and on the specific U.S. rule of law efforts in five Latin American  countries.", "Data on U.S. rule of law funding was not readily available, and some  entities could not provide funding data for all the years of interest or had  other problems in compiling the information we requested.  Also, because  the departments and agencies involved did not have an agreed-upon  definition of what constitutes rule of law activities, we relied on each  agency to provide us information for those activities it considered rule of  law.  In addition, we requested obligation data but were told by agency  officials that what we received was a mix of obligated amounts and actual  expenditures.  Much of U.S. rule of law assistance supported long-term  programs\u2014sometimes over several years\u2014that were funded by the U.S.  Agency for International Development (USAID) (over 64 percent).   Obligation data better reflected the magnitude of the funding involved in  long-term and other programs because actual expenditures (or requests for  reimbursements) often are not reported until subsequent years.  However,  other rule of law assistance provided, for example by law enforcement  agencies, was relatively low-cost, short-term training or exchange  programs.  In this instance, obligations and actual expenditures were  virtually synonymous.  (See the scope and methodology section for a more  complete discussion of these limitations.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Rule of Law Funding Worldwide", "paragraphs": ["During fiscal years 1993-98, the United States funded rule of law programs  and related activities in countries throughout the world.   Over this period,  rule of law assistance totaled at least $970 million.  Figure 1 illustrates the  worldwide U.S. rule of law funding for fiscal years 1993-98.  Over the  period, the total annual rule of law funding increased from $128 million to  $218 million.  Although funding appears to have declined substantially in  1996, this may be largely explained by the fact that USAID could not readily  provide rule of law funding information for fiscal year 1996 due to  problems with its automated information system.", "On a regional basis, the Latin America and the Caribbean region received  the largest share, with about 36 percent.  Africa, Central Europe, and the  newly independent states of the former Soviet Union received about 15  percent each. (See table 1.)", "From fiscal year 1993 to 1998, rule of law funding shifted primarily from the  Latin America and the Caribbean region to other regions, mainly Central  Europe.  Funding for Central Europe grew from about $9 million in fiscal  year 1993 to over $67 million in fiscal year 1998, accounting for 31 percent  of the worldwide rule of law assistance that year.  Over the same period,  rule of law assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean declined from  about $57 million (44 percent of the worldwide total) to $42 million (19  percent).  Rule of law assistance to Africa also declined from $38 million  (30 percent of the worldwide total) in 1993 to $29 million (13 percent) in  1998.

Further complicating this effort  was the fact that the departments and agencies did not have a commonly  accepted definition of what constituted rule of law activities. Therefore,  we relied on each department and agency (and the bureaus and offices  within those entities) to provide us information on the programs and  activities it considered rule of law.  In some instances, programs with an  apparent rule of law element were not included.  For example, USAID did  not include all of its assistance for human rights, and State did not include  all of its antinarcotics assistance.", "Additionally, the funding data is a mix of obligated amounts and actual  expenditures.  For agencies (primarily USAID) that provided rule of law  assistance over several years, obligation data better reflected the  magnitude of the funding involved because actual expenditures (or  requests for reimbursement) may not be reported until subsequent years.   However, other rule of law assistance provided, for example by law  enforcement agencies, was relatively low-cost, short-term training or  exchange programs.  In this instance, obligations and actual expenditures  were virtually synonymous.  Therefore, we used actual expenditures.", "Because of the volume of data\u2014almost 4,600 program and activity  records\u2014and the lack of documentation in some agencies, we did not  independently verify the accuracy of the data provided.

The system was upgraded that year, and 1996  information was not captured in the new system nor was it available in  USAID\u2019s prior system.  At our request, USAID polled each of its missions  in Latin America and the Caribbean to obtain rule of law funding data,  including fiscal year 1996; however, because of the magnitude of the  effort, we did not request that USAID do the same for the other regions  of the world.
