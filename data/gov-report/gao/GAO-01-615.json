While NBC-Denver had restricted access  to many users who previously had broad access to critical programs,  software, and data, we found instances where the center had not  sufficiently restricted access to only legitimate users, including those  described below.", "About 400 users had access privileges to four sensitive system software  libraries that are allowed to perform sensitive system functions that can  be used to circumvent all security controls. Such access increased the  risk that users could bypass security controls to alter or delete any  computer data or programs on the system and should only be granted to  system programmers. This risk was further heightened because the  center had not established mitigating controls ,such as monitoring user  access to these sensitive libraries. The acting assistant director of NBC- Denver acknowledged that many of these users did not require access.", "About 1,000 users were given broad access privileges to a system  software resource that allows users to create and modify programs and  read and copy any data set to which such users have been granted read  access. Such access is generally used for program development and  testing. About 500 of the users were using this resource to run a set of  standard programs, a task that does not require this level of access. With  broad access privileges, users with knowledge of the security system  could create and modify computer programs and read and copy  sensitive data.", "Seventeen system maintenance staff had access that allowed them to  alter or update system software resources used to control the storage of  system and data files. This control function is an automated process that  does not require users to have this type of access. With this access, users  could move sensitive files to unprotected areas and modify or delete  financial or sensitive data or disrupt computer operations.", "About 80 application developers, both programmers and functional  specialists, had update access to payroll and personnel data. An  essential control for ensuring the integrity of a computer application is  to prevent software developers from having access to application  programs and data in the production environment. Developers with  detailed knowledge of the system\u2019s processing functions could  improperly add, alter, or delete payroll and personnel data and programs  without leaving evidence that the system had been compromised.", "One reason for NBC-Denver\u2019s user access vulnerabilities was that access  authority was not being reviewed on a periodic basis. Such reviews would  have allowed the center to identify and correct inappropriate access.", "In February 2001, the acting assistant director of NBC-Denver told us that  the center was reviewing staff access and would limit staff access to the  level required to carry out job responsibilities.

System  software controls, which limit and monitor access to the powerful  programs and sensitive files associated with computer operations, are  important in providing reasonable assurance that access controls are not  compromised and that the system will not be impaired. To protect system  software, a standard computer control practice is to (1) configure system  software to protect against security vulnerabilities, (2) periodically review  programs in sensitive software libraries to identify potential security  weaknesses, and (3) ensure that only authorized and fully tested system  software is placed in operation.", "While NBC-Denver had performed reviews of its system software  environment and corrected those security weaknesses identified, we  identified other areas where the center was not adequately controlling  system software. These system software control weaknesses could  diminish the reliability of financial and other sensitive information  maintained on this computer system. We found the following weaknesses:  A weakness in the system software configuration could allow  knowledgeable users with access privileges that permit them to execute  programs to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access to  sensitive financial and personnel information. In this case, the operating  system was set up so that programs in any of 34 libraries included in the  normal search sequence could perform sensitive system functions and  operate outside security software controls. This increases the risk that if  unauthorized programs are introduced users could bypass other access  controls and improperly access or modify financial, audit trail, or other  sensitive information maintained on the computer system.", "About 8,200 programs in sensitive software libraries, which have the  authority to perform sensitive functions that can circumvent security  controls, did not have unique program names. While multiple versions of  the same software are maintained by NBC-Denver to satisfy customer  requirements, an undetermined number of programs do not have unique  program names. Allowing more than one program in these libraries to  have the same name could lead to inadvertent or deliberate execution of  an unauthorized program that could compromise security controls.  NBC-Denver had not established a process to periodically review  programs in sensitive libraries for security weaknesses, such as  programs with duplicate names. Until NBC-Denver begins to actively  review programs in sensitive libraries, it will not have adequate  assurance that other security controls cannot be bypassed.", "Although NBC-Denver had a process for making changes to system  software, it had not established written procedures or guidance for  system software changes and had not developed guidance for testing  changes or documenting test results. An essential control in the system  software change process is that written procedures are established that  set forth requirements for requesting, authorizing, and approving these  changes. These procedures should include requirements for testing,  performing a technical review, and obtaining approval for each system  software change before implementation. During fiscal year 2000, NBC- Denver made more than 200 system software changes. Our review of a  random sample of 20 changes for this period found that changes did not  include documentation for (1) tests on 13 changes, (2) technical reviews  of 16 changes, or (3) supervisory approvals on 16 software changes.  Consequently, NBC-Denver faces increased risks of unintended  operational problems caused by programming errors or the deliberate  execution of unauthorized programs.", "In February 2001, the acting assistant director of NBC-Denver told us that  the center would implement additional policies and procedures, by  October 2001, to (1) review system configuration settings periodically for  security vulnerabilities, (2) evaluate programs in sensitive system libraries  to identify and correct security exposures, and (3) document that system  software changes are tested, technically reviewed, and approved before  implementation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Network Security Was Not Sufficient", "paragraphs": ["Network security controls are key to ensuring that only authorized  individuals can gain access to sensitive and critical agency data. These  controls include a variety of tools, such as user IDs and passwords, which  are intended to authenticate authorized users who access the network from  local and remote agency locations and through dial-in facilities. In addition,  network controls provide for safeguards to ensure that the system software  is adequately configured to prevent users from bypassing network access  controls or causing network failures.", "The risks introduced by the weaknesses that we identified in access and  system software controls were compounded by network security  weaknesses: NBC-Denver was not adequately protecting access to its  network or restricting access to the system that processes financial and  other sensitive information. Specifically, the center had not adequately  managed user IDs and passwords, controlled dial-in access, or adequately  configured all its network servers. Thus, sensitive financial information  processed on the network is at increased risk that unauthorized  modification or disclosure could occur without detection. Because of  NBC\u2019s interconnected environment, these network control weaknesses  also increase the risk of unauthorized access to financial and other  sensitive information (such as payroll, personnel, and financial  management information) maintained on the NBC-Denver mainframe  computer. For example,  The network had user ID and password management weaknesses that  an intruder could exploit to gain unauthorized access to the NBC- Denver network. For example, on one network server, we identified  easily guessed passwords and passwords that had not been used since  1998. On another network, network commands available to all users  allowed access to a listing that included password information.", "An ID and password used for dial-in access to the centralized modem  pool was easily guessed. We were able to guess a user ID and password  that provided an access path into the network. With this access we were  able to browse the internal network and collect information about the  network, which could be used to identify and exploit network  vulnerabilities. The lack of adequate dial-in access controls increases  the risk that a hacker could obtain access to the network, from which an  attack could be launched on the mainframe to gain access to critical  financial and sensitive department information. NBC-Denver staff  corrected this network vulnerability before we completed our  fieldwork.", "The network had system software configuration weaknesses that could  allow users to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access to  NBC-Denver networks or cause network system failures. For instance,  certain network systems configuration settings allowed unauthorized  users to connect to the network without entering a valid user ID and  password combination. This could allow unauthorized individuals to  obtain access to system information describing the network  environment, including user IDs and password information.", "These network security weaknesses increased the risk that someone could  gain unauthorized access to information on the network and that intruders  or authorized users with malicious intent could exploit the network  weaknesses to misuse, improperly disclose, or destroy financial and other  sensitive information.", "In February 2001, the acting assistant director of NBC-Denver told us that  all accounts that had not been used within the prior 90 days had been  deleted. Also, the acting assistant director told us that all test accounts and  other easily guessed passwords had been removed.

While the center had begun to review failed  attempts to access sensitive system resources (e.g., security software and  sensitive system software), it had not established a program to monitor  successful access to production resources, including application programs  and data. Thus, there is an increased risk that application developers with  access to production programs and data could add, alter, or delete payroll  and personnel information (for example) without being detected, since  these types of user activities were not being monitored.

For example, it had not established procedures for (1) determining  where on its network it will monitor access, (2) protecting intrusion data  from tampering, and (3) classifying, storing, analyzing, and using intrusion  data to identify agency network vulnerability patterns. Further, it had not  established procedures for following up and reporting on system anomalies  or computer misuse after initial alarms are triggered. Without procedures  for addressing these types of activities, NBC-Denver reduces its ability to  establish and maintain an effective intrusion detection program, which  reduces the risk of unauthorized access of computer resources.", "In February 2001, the acting assistant director of NBC-Denver told us that  by January 2002, the center would expand its user access monitoring  program to include all sensitive system libraries and critical application  production programs and data.

At NBC-Denver, physical access control measures (such as  locks, guards, badges, and alarms, used alone or in combination) are vital  to safeguarding critical financial and sensitive personnel information and  computer operations from internal and external threats.", "Although NBC-Denver policy requires a photo access card to gain access,  via electronically controlled doors, to the building that contains the  computer center, we observed on different occasions that several people  entered the building by merely following one person with an authorized  access card. While guards were posted at the entrance to the building, we  observed that they were not checking each person entering the building for  an appropriate NBC-Denver photo access card. Thus, individuals who did  not have NBC-Denver photo access cards could pass unchallenged through  the main entry doors and gain unauthorized access to the facility,  increasing the risk that intruders with malicious intent might obtain access  to sensitive computer resources or disrupt operations.", "Further, we identified 40 employees and contractors, including mail room,  facility support, computer support, tape librarian, local-area network  (LAN) support, and personnel/payroll staff, who had access to the  electrical room. This room contains fiber optic boxes that could be used by  a knowledgeable person to establish an unauthorized internal connection  to the center\u2019s computer system.

Once policies and job descriptions  supporting the principles of segregation of duties have been developed, it is  important to ensure that adequate supervision is provided and adequate  access controls are in place to ensure that employees perform only  compatible functions.", "Although computer duties were generally properly segregated at NBC- Denver, we identified instances where controls did not enforce segregation  of duties principles. For example, two application support staff had access  privileges that allowed them to modify financial production programs and  data as well as security-related information. These staff were assigned  responsibility for performing certain functions related to security  administration and production program maintenance. Under normal  circumstances, staff with security responsibilities should report to the  security administrator and have no programming duties. However, because  these individuals had both program and security administration access  privileges, they had the ability to change programs and data and eliminate  any evidence of their activity in the system.

Controls over  personnel activities require active supervision and review of these  activities. To aid in this oversight, all computer operator activities on the  computer system should be recorded on an automated history log; this log  should be reviewed routinely by supervisory staff and any abnormalities  investigated.

Instead, NBC-Denver relied on the IT security manager and certain  staff assigned to the network, facilities, and application functions to  perform security tasks. Although these staff had general department  guidance on information security, NBC-Denver had not developed specific  policies and procedures that clearly defined the security roles and  responsibilities of these staff and the reporting lines between the security  functions. In addition, there were no specific procedures requiring these  staff to coordinate on security-related issues, such as policy development  and implementation, risk assessment, monitoring compliance with  established policies and procedures, and reviewing the effectiveness of  controls.", "A second key aspect of computer security management is periodically  assessing risk. Regular risk assessments assist management in making  decisions on necessary controls by helping to ensure that security  resources are effectively distributed to minimize potential loss. Also, by  increasing the awareness of risks, these assessments generate support for  the adopted policies and controls, which helps ensure that the policies and  controls operate as intended.", "Although Department of the Interior policy requires that risk assessments  be performed whenever significant changes are made to a facility or its  computer systems, but at least every 5 years, NBC-Denver had not  developed a framework for assessing and managing risk when significant  changes occurred. During the past year, the center upgraded its mainframe  operating system and added servers to its network. Each of these events  was a significant change that warranted a separate risk assessment.  However, while NBC-Denver had performed risk assessments for part of  the key applications, it had not performed a risk assessment when these  significant changes occurred.", "A third key element of effective security management is having established  policies and procedures governing a complete computer security program.  Such policies and procedures should integrate all security aspects of an  organization\u2019s interconnected environment, including local area network,  wide area network, and mainframe security. The integration of network  and mainframe security is particularly important as computer systems  become more and more interconnected.", "NBC-Denver had not yet established comprehensive policies and  procedures to govern a complete computer security program. While the  center had made progress in developing policies and procedures for  specific security areas, including remote dial-in access, the network  firewall, incident response capability, and user ID and password  management, it had not developed an overall policy on computer security.  This policy would address security requirements for physical and logical  access control, segregation of duties, application change control, service  continuity, and security management covering both network and  mainframe environments. In addition, NBC-Denver had not developed  technical standards for implementing security software and maintaining  operating system integrity on either its mainframe or network systems.  Such standards would not only help ensure that appropriate computer  controls are established consistently, but would also facilitate periodic  reviews of these controls.", "A fourth key area of security program management is promoting security  awareness. Computer attacks and security breakdowns often occur  because computer users fail to take appropriate security measures. For this  reason, it is vital that employees who use computer systems in their day-to- day operations be aware of the importance and sensitivity of the  information they handle, as well as the business and legal reasons for  maintaining its confidentiality and integrity. In accepting responsibility for  security, employees should, for example, devise effective passwords,  change them frequently, and protect them from disclosure. In addition,  employees should help maintain physical security over their assigned  areas.", "NBC-Denver had established a security awareness program for all its  employees and contractors. Specifically, NBC-Denver developed a  computer-based security awareness program that all of its employees and  contractor staff are required to complete annually. Further, NBC-Denver  had established procedures to monitor compliance with this requirement.", "A final key area of an overall computer security management program is an  ongoing security oversight program. Such a program includes processes for  (1) monitoring compliance with established information system control  policies and procedures, (2) testing the effectiveness of information system  controls, and (3) improving information system controls based on the  results of these activities.", "NBC-Denver had not established a program to routinely monitor and  evaluate the effectiveness of information system controls. Such a program  would allow NBC-Denver to ensure that policies remain appropriate and  that controls accomplish their intended purpose.", "Weaknesses discussed in this report could have been identified and  corrected if the center had been monitoring compliance with established  procedures. For example, if NBC-Denver had periodically reviewed user  access authority to ensure that it was limited to the minimum required  access level based on job requirements, the center would have been able to  discover and limit the access of application development staff to sensitive  system resources. Likewise, routinely evaluating the technical  implementation of its system software would have permitted the center to  eliminate or mitigate the additional system software exposures discussed  in this report.", "A program to regularly test information system controls would also have  allowed NBC-Denver to detect additional network security weaknesses.  For example, using network analysis software designed to detect network  vulnerabilities, we identified user accounts and services that could provide  hackers with information to exploit the network and launch an attack on  NBC-Denver systems. Although NBC-Denver fixed this problem before our  fieldwork was completed, center staff could have identified and corrected  this exposure using similar network analysis software available to them.", "In February 2001, the acting assistant director of NBC-Denver told us that a  security oversight team would be established to coordinate overall security  at the center. In conjunction with this effort, he said that policies and  procedures would be developed and implemented that define the roles and  responsibilities of all NBC-Denver functions involved in security  management. These policies and procedures will include requirements for  coordinating security activities among the designated security functions.  He added that NBC-Denver will develop a framework for risk assessments,  including a policy and procedures for performing risk assessments for the  physical facility, application, and computer center environments. In  addition, the acting assistant director told us that his staff was currently  developing a comprehensive site security policy that will include technical  standards for each operating computer platform. He also said that the  center will develop a security oversight program to monitor compliance  with established information system control policies and procedures, test  the effectiveness of information system controls, and improve information  system controls based on the results of these activities. These computer  security management elements are to be implemented no later than  October 2001, according to the acting assistant director."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Information system general controls are critical to NBC-Denver\u2019s ability to  ensure the reliability of Interior\u2019s financial management information and  maintain the confidentiality of sensitive personnel and other department  information. While NBC-Denver has made progress in correcting the  computer security weaknesses that Interior\u2019s OIG identified and has taken  other steps to improve security, additional weaknesses were identified in  NBC-Denver\u2019s information system control environment. Specifically, NBC- Denver had not adequately limited users access, controlled system  software, secured network access, or established a program to  comprehensively monitor access. Also, NBC-Denver was not providing  adequate physical security, segregating computer functions, controlling  changes to application programs, or ensuring that all aspects of its service  continuity needs were addressed. These weaknesses placed sensitive NBC- Denver financial and personnel information at risk of disclosure, critical  financial operations at risk of disruption, and assets at risk of loss. These  weaknesses could also affect other agencies that depend on NBC-Denver\u2019s  computer processing services.", "A primary reason for NBC-Denver\u2019s information system control  weaknesses was that it had not yet fully developed and implemented a  comprehensive computer security planning and management program. A  comprehensive program for computer security management is essential for  achieving an effective information system general control environment.  Effective implementation of such a program provides for periodically  assessing risks, implementing effective controls for restricting access  based on job requirements and actively reviewing access activities,  communicating the established policies and controls to those who are  responsible for their implementation, and perhaps most important,  evaluating the effectiveness of policies and controls to ensure that they  remain appropriate and accomplish their intended purpose.", "The acting assistant director of NBC-Denver stated that he has recognized  the seriousness of the weaknesses we identified and at the completion of  our fieldwork provided us with a comprehensive corrective action plan to  address each of them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To establish an effective information system general control environment,  we recommend that you instruct the Director of the National Business  Center and the acting assistant director of NBC-Denver, in coordination  with the Interior Chief Information Officer (CIO), to ensure that the  following actions are completed.", "NBC-Denver corrects the information system control weaknesses  related to access authority, system software, network security, access  monitoring, physical access, segregation of duties, program changes,  and service continuity.
