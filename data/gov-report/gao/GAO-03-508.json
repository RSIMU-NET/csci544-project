To help finance their education, students and families may have received other funds from states, private groups or lenders, and/or the schools themselves.

Of these, 628,000 received an estimated $2.72 billion in such aid by obtaining non-need-based loans--which we identify as substitutable loans--that families borrow to meet their expected family contribution. Title IV allows for students and families to obtain these non-need-based loans to meet their expected family contribution. Another 104,000 federal aid recipients received an estimated $238 million in such aid as a result of receiving a combination of aid from federal and nonfederal sources. Changing the HEA to limit the receipt of aid that is greater than students' federally defined financial need is not likely to achieve significant federal savings, although, the use of substitutable loans may increase overall student indebtedness. In terms of cost implications, limiting those instances where federal aid recipients receive substitutable loans--which is the main reason why students received aid greater than their federally defined need--will not likely result in significant savings. While the government will not have to pay default claims or special allowance payments on loans it guarantees, it would forego any interest earnings on loans it makes directly. Any savings from limiting these loans would be substantially less than the total amount of the loans made--the $2.72 billion. However, the widespread use of substitutable loans may increase the average debt of borrowers and may affect Education's ability to help students and their families maintain their loan debt at manageable levels."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In the 2000-01 school year, $80.4 billion in financial aid was provided to  college students to help them finance their postsecondary education.

While students and their  families had multiple options for paying for college, during the 2000-01  school year, over half of the financial aid awarded came from the federal  government, in the form of grants to low-income students and loans to  students and their families, under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of  1965.", "Most Title IV aid is based on a student\u2019s federally defined need, which is  the difference between the student\u2019s cost of attendance and the family\u2019s  federally determined ability to pay these costs\u2014the latter is known as the  expected family contribution (EFC).

However, instead of relying on family resources to finance their EFC, Title  IV allows for students and families to obtain non-need-based loans to meet  their EFC.

In  the first situation, schools cannot reduce the amount of a Pell grant even if  it results in a student receiving aid greater than federally defined need. We  found, however, that only 17 percent of the students in this group received  Pell grants. Also, if aid greater than federally defined need is $300 or less,  campus-based assistance does not need to be reduced and subsidized  Stafford loans do not need to be reduced if the student is also receiving  federal work study. Finally, after any Stafford loan funds have been  delivered to the student, the student is allowed to receive aid from a non- Title IV source, even if that aid results in aid greater than federally defined  need. This could, for example, explain some of the 39 percent of students  in this group who received subsidized Stafford loans.", "In some cases, rules for nonfederal assistance can increase the likelihood  of students receiving aid greater than their federally defined need from  sources such as private scholarships. Benefactors of private scholarships  may sometimes prohibit schools from reducing the amount of the  scholarship even if a student\u2019s total aid package will be greater than their  federally defined need. Also, several of the schools that provided  information to us specifically cited students who receive both Pell grants  and state, merit, or athletic scholarships that are greater than their  federally defined need as cases in which they would not reduce total aid in  order to stay within their federally defined need.

These need formulas, known as institutional  methodologies, may identify a higher level of need for a student than the  federal government would. However, schools that use institutional  methodologies must still use the federal definition of need to award  federal need-based aid. By filling this higher level of need from aid sources  that are not counted towards federally defined need, the student could  receive more aid than his/her federally defined need would dictate. NPSAS  does not capture whether any nonfederal need-based aid was distributed  using these institutional methodologies.", "Under Title IV, financial aid officers have discretion to recalculate a  student\u2019s need if the family\u2019s financial circumstances change dramatically,  such as a parent\u2019s loss of employment. This discretion, known as  professional judgment, could result in an increase to a student\u2019s financial  need.

In  the case of the larger group of students and their families whose aid  greater than federally defined need is attributable to substitutable loans,  the actual cost to the government is not the face value of the loans. For  guaranteed loans, the government incurs costs\u2014primarily insurance  claims payments to lenders for defaulted loans and special allowance  payments made to lenders to ensure a guaranteed return on the loans they  make. For direct loans, interest from loan repayments offsets costs the  government incurs for defaults and interest payments to the treasury on  funds Education borrows to make loans. These interest earnings produce  savings for the government.

Assuming that most schools package loans and work study last\u20148 of the  12 schools that provided us with information said this was the typical  practice at their institutions\u2014loans and work study would most likely be  eliminated first to keep aid packages within federally defined need limits.  Any savings on loans would be derived using the same basic calculation  we described above for substitutable loans. In addition, the government  would also save the interest it pays on subsidized loans while students are  still in school. Thus, these savings would be considerably smaller than the  face value of the loan. With regard to work study, it is likely that schools  rather than the federal government would obtain most of the savings.  According to our analysis of the NPSAS data, this would occur because a  larger percentage of these students received institution-funded work study  rather than federally funded work study (29 percent versus 12 percent).", "Although changing the Higher Education Act to limit receiving aid greater  than federally defined need is not likely to result in any substantial cost  savings, continuing this practice may affect some students\u2019 loan  indebtedness.
