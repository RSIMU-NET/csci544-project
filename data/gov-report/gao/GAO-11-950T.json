In 2008, GAO reported that DOD's complex and inefficient payment processes, nonintegrated business systems, and weak internal controls impair its ability to maintain proper funds control, putting DOD at risk of overobligating or overspending its appropriations. Specifically, DOD's weak internal control environment has hindered its ability to ensure that transactions are accurately recorded, sufficiently supported, and properly executed by trained personnel subject to effective supervision. Funds control weaknesses place DOD at risk of violating the Antideficiency Act (ADA), specifically through overobligations and overexpenditures. DOD reported ADA violations from fiscal year 2007 through September 15, 2011, with a total dollar amount of $927.4 million. DOD has identified payment transactions and related accounting steps as \"problem disbursements.\" Problem disbursements include unmatched disbursements (UMD) that represent disbursements that have been paid by an accounting office but that have not been matched to the correct obligation records. DOD reports that it has reduced overaged UMDs from $666.5 million to $109.6 million between second quarter of fiscal year 2009 to the same time in fiscal year 2011. These and other weaknesses have prevented DOD from reporting reliable financial information, including budgetary information in an auditable Statement of Budgetary Resources. Although DOD has dedicated significant resources to remediate its identified weaknesses, it faces significant challenges to address those persistent weaknesses. DOD reported for fiscal year 2010 that it made an estimated $1 billion in improper payments. However, this estimate is incomplete because DOD did not include estimates from its commercial payment programs, which account for approximately one-third of the value of DOD payments. Further, both GAO and the DOD IG have reported on weaknesses in DOD's payment controls, including weaknesses in its process for assessing the risk of improper payments and reporting estimated amounts of them. DOD's problem disbursements continue to be a concern and are a contributing factor to the department's funds control issues. The department's weak controls over payments increase the risk of inaccurate cost information and improper payments. Given DOD's stated goal of achieving audit readiness on its consolidated financial statements by the end of fiscal year 2017, it will be critical that the department continue to ensure that steady progress is being made. Moreover, for DOD to move forward, it will be important that the department resolve its problems with multiple, disparate nonintegrated systems to ensure that whatever systems solutions are chosen will provide the underlying foundation for auditable financial statements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["It is a pleasure to be here today to discuss the Department of Defense\u2019s  (DOD) controls over the use of public funds and their effect on the  reliability of DOD\u2019s reported budgetary information and DOD\u2019s efforts to  account for and control improper payments.", "DOD is one of the largest and most complex organizations in the world.

DOD operations span a wide range of defense organizations, including  the military services, large defense agencies and field activities, and  various combatant and joint operational commands that are responsible  for military operations for specific geographic regions or theaters of  operation. To execute its operations, the department performs interrelated  and interdependent business functions, including financial management,  logistics management, health care management, and procurement. To  support its business functions, DOD has reported that it relies on over  2,200 business systems, including accounting, acquisition, logistics, and  personnel systems.", "Like all executive agencies of the federal government, DOD is required to  design and implement effective internal controls, including controls over  its use of public funds (\u201cfunds controls\u201d) and controls over its payment  processes (\u201cpayment controls\u201d).

While current efforts  offer some encouragement, GAO and DOD auditors continue to find  significant deficiencies in internal control that contribute to DOD\u2019s inability  to achieve effective financial management capabilities and prepare  auditable financial statements. Under the DOD Financial Improvement  and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Plan, first issued by the DOD Comptroller in  2005, DOD has begun to dedicate significant resources to remediate  identified weaknesses.", "Today, I will discuss the challenges DOD faces in its funds control and  their effect on the reliability of DOD\u2019s financial information, especially the  budgetary information in DOD\u2019s Statement of Budgetary Resources  (SBR), which the department has identified as its highest priority in  achieving auditability, as well as its ability to reduce the risk of  overobligating or overexpending resources. I will also discuss the  weaknesses in DOD\u2019s payment controls that put the department at risk of  making improper payments. My statement today is based primarily on our  prior work and includes DOD-reported information that we monitor as part  of our annual audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the U.S.  Government.

Auditors of DOD\u2019s financial statements are to  assess the effectiveness of these controls as part of the financial  statement audit. However, DOD has acknowledged that long-standing  weaknesses in its internal controls, its business systems, and its  processes have prevented auditors from determining the reliability of  DOD\u2019s financial statement information, including the budgetary  information included in DOD\u2019s SBR. Moreover, we have previously  reported that a weak overall control environment and poor internal  controls limit DOD\u2019s ability to prevent and detect fraud, waste, abuse, and  improper payments.", "Because budgetary information is widely and regularly used for  management, the DOD Comptroller designated as one of DOD\u2019s highest  priorities the improvement of its budgetary information and processes  underlying the SBR. The financial information in the SBR is predominantly  derived from an entity\u2019s budgetary accounts, which are used by agencies  to account for and track the use of public funds, in accordance with  budgetary accounting rules. The SBR is designed to provide information  on authorized budgeted spending authority and links to the Budget of the  United States Government (President\u2019s Budget), including the source and  availability of budgetary resources, and how obligated resources have  been used. According to the Office of Management and Budget, the SBR  was added as a basic federal financial statement so that the underlying  budgetary accounting information is audited and is, therefore, more  reliable for routine management use and budgetary reporting, such as the  President\u2019s Budget.", "In the FIAR Plan, DOD states that it expects to obtain five benefits from  its planned efforts to achieve an auditable SBR. According to DOD, its  efforts will  improve the visibility of budgetary transactions, ensuring a more  effective use of resources;  \uf0b7  provide operational efficiencies through more readily available and  accurate cost and financial information;  improve financial stewardship through reduced improper payments;  improve budget processes and controls, thus reducing violations of  funds control laws; and  link execution to the President\u2019s Budget, thus providing more  consistency with the financial environment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Serious DOD Funds Control Challenges", "paragraphs": ["For years, GAO and DOD IG have reported on DOD\u2019s inability to provide  effective funds control and report reliable financial information, including  budgetary information. In 2008, we reported that DOD\u2019s complex and  inefficient payment processes, nonintegrated business systems, and  weak internal controls impair its ability to maintain proper funds control,  putting DOD at risk of overobligating or overspending its appropriations.  Specifically, DOD\u2019s weak internal control environment has hindered its  ability to ensure that transactions are accurately recorded, sufficiently  supported, and properly executed by trained personnel subject to  effective supervision.

For example, we recently reported that inadequate  processes, systems controls, and controls for accounting and reporting  prevented the Marine Corps from passing an audit of its fiscal year 2010  SBR, the first SBR of a military service that DOD is attempting to  successfully audit since the SBR was first required in 1998. Although  DOD has dedicated significant resources to improving its financial  management, including addressing known weaknesses in its funds  control, neither the department nor its auditors have been able to verify  that weaknesses have been sufficiently corrected in order to pass an  audit. These weaknesses present challenges for DOD in: (1) reducing its  risk of overobligating and overexpending its appropriations in violation  of the law and making effective use of budgetary resources; (2) improving  its ability to eliminate unmatched disbursements and other significant  problem disbursements; and (3) producing reliable budgetary information."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Funds Control Weaknesses Can Place DOD at Risk of Overobligation and Overexpenditure and Violations of the Law", "paragraphs": ["We have reported that the department is at risk of overobligating and  overexpending its appropriations because of its weaknesses in identifying  and training its personnel who are responsible for funds control and  carrying out supervisory duties, its challenges in properly supporting and  accounting for its transactions, and its poor financial systems. These  weaknesses have contributed to 64 DOD-reported instances of  overobligation or overexpenditure of funds in violation of the law totaling  $927.4 million from fiscal year 2007 through September 15, 2011.  However, there may be other violations that may not be detected,  investigated, and reported because of the weaknesses in DOD\u2019s funds  control and financial management overall. According to DOD, the most  frequent causes of DOD\u2019s overobligations and overexpenditures include  inadequate internal controls and standard operating procedures, not  following prescribed internal controls and standard operating procedures,  lack of appropriate training, and inadequate supervisory involvement or  oversight. Examples of reported weaknesses in DOD\u2019s funds control  include:  Inadequately trained funds control personnel. In 2008, we reported  that DOD had not effectively identified and established training  programs for departmental personnel who carry out DOD\u2019s funds  control. According to DOD, its funds control system relies  extensively on the department\u2019s ability to (1) identify individuals who  are performing key funds control roles, such as certifying officers,  contracting officers, program managers, funds certifying officials, and  other departmental accountable officials, who incur obligations and  make disbursements and perform related duties, and (2) ensure that  those individuals have received the training necessary to fulfill their  responsibilities in compliance with the DOD Financial Management  Regulation (FMR). We made recommendations to DOD in our report  to improve its process and system of identifying and training its key  funds control personnel, which DOD agreed to implement, and last  year DOD revised the policies in its FMR on this aspect of its funds  control. We have not assessed the effectiveness of DOD\u2019s actions.  However, as I testified before this Panel in July 2011, DOD has not  completed a competency analysis of its financial management  personnel and still has significant work to do to address this challenge  to achieving its financial improvement goals.  \uf0b7  Unsupported transactions. We have reported that DOD components  have significant weaknesses in their ability to properly support  transactions in order to reliably determine whether their obligations  and disbursements are being used for authorized purposes and within  the amounts and time frames established by law. For example, we  recently reported that the auditors who attempted to audit the Marine  Corps fiscal year 2010 SBR were unable to conduct the audit  because, among other internal control deficiencies, the Marine Corps  lacked documentation to support its transactions, which put the  Marine Corps at risk of not being able to verify whether payments  were made in the appropriate amount for authorized purposes, and to  the appropriate parties. In its Agency Financial Report for Fiscal  Year 2010, DOD officials stated that one of 13 material weaknesses  that prevent an audit of its financial statements will be resolved by  2017 by implementing processes and systems that can provide  necessary transaction-level supporting documentation for its  disbursements and collections.  Inadequate recording of transactions. DOD faces challenges in  properly recording its obligations and disbursements in its accounting  and other business systems that impair its ability to track and control  the use of public funds. According to DOD\u2019s FMR, obligations and  expenditures are required to be recorded accurately and promptly,  even if the recording results in a negative amount in the appropriation,  fund, or other accounting level. Last week, we reported that the  auditors of the Marine Corps\u2019 fiscal year 2010 SBR found that the  Marine Corps inappropriately used \u201cbulk obligations\u201d to record  estimated liabilities that the Marine Corps did not match to actual  payments due to weak internal controls. As discussed below, a  similar practice by the military departments led to overobligations in  violation of the law. Further, DOD reported in its Agency Financial  Report for Fiscal Year 2010 that another of 13 material weaknesses  that prevented an audit of its financial statements relates, in part, to  the department\u2019s inability to properly record payments due from other  agencies and the public.  Ineffective business systems. In our 2008 report on DOD\u2019s funds  control, we found that DOD\u2019s nonintegrated and outdated business  systems, including its financial systems and other systems that  provide most of DOD\u2019s financial data to the financial systems, were a  key impediment to effective funds control, and we noted that DOD had  long-term plans to implement modernized, fully integrated, and  reliable business systems. However, as I stated before this panel in  July, DOD faces significant challenges in its effort to implement these  new systems over the next several years. In its Agency Financial  Report for Fiscal Year 2010 and its FIAR Plan, DOD acknowledges  the challenges related to weaknesses in DOD\u2019s financial management  systems. For example, in DOD\u2019s annual statement on the status of its  internal controls included in its Agency Financial Report, DOD  reported that the department is not in conformance with internal  control requirements because of a material weakness in its financial  management systems. DOD\u2019s FIAR Plan states that implementing  modernized, effective, and integrated business systems that reliably  support financial needs of the department are critical to achieving the  department\u2019s financial improvement and audit readiness efforts.", "DOD\u2019s ineffective funds control has resulted in overobligations and  overexpenditures in violation of the Antideficiency Act (ADA). As we  reported in 2008, weaknesses in DOD\u2019s funds control impaired its ability  to accurately detect, investigate, and report such violations. Under the  ADA, agencies are prohibited from, among other things, incurring  obligations or making expenditures in excess or in advance of  appropriations or in excess of apportionments or formal subdivisions of  those apportionments. When DOD determines that a violation of the  ADA has occurred, the department is to immediately report to the  President and Congress all relevant facts and a statement of actions  taken and submit a copy to the Comptroller General at the same time.  According to copies of ADA violation reports received by the Comptroller  General, and as shown in table 1, DOD reported 64 ADA violations from  fiscal year 2007 through September 15, 2011, with a total dollar amount  of $927.4 million. However, due to DOD\u2019s weaknesses in its funds control  process, including the weaknesses described above related to DOD\u2019s  challenges in controlling and recording obligations and disbursements  and detecting violations, this listing may not be complete because all ADA  violations may not have been identified or reported. For example, GAO  identified a violation in June 2010 involving the Army\u2019s overobligation of  its fiscal year 2008 Military Personnel\u2013Army (MPA) appropriation, as  evidenced by a $200 million transfer DOD made to the MPA account from  DOD\u2019s working capital fund, which has not yet been reported by DOD.  Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Andrews, I know that you and other  members of Congress recently sent a letter to the DOD Comptroller  asking for an explanation of why DOD has not reported this and other  potential ADA violations. Such an explanation could provide greater  transparency over the accuracy of reported numbers and amounts of  violations.", "Because the ADA prohibits, and effective funds control should prevent,  overobligations and overexpenditures of public funds, the number and  dollar amount of ADA violations are an indicator of the status of DOD\u2019s  funds control. However, the nature of reported violations can also indicate  systemic weaknesses in DOD\u2019s funds control. The following ADA  violations involved systemic breakdowns in the controls necessary to  track actual amounts of obligations incurred against amounts of available  funding:  \uf0b7  As noted above, we found in June 2010 that the Army Budget Office  lacked an adequate funds control process to provide it with ongoing  assurance that obligations and expenditures do not exceed funds  available in the fiscal year 2008 Military Personnel\u2013Army (MPA)  appropriation. We found that the Army\u2019s total obligations against the  fiscal year 2008 MPA appropriation exceeded the amount available in  the account, as evidenced by the Army\u2019s need to transfer $200 million  from the Defense Working Capital Fund, Army appropriation to cover  the shortfall. The overobligation likely stemmed, in part, from lack of  communication between the Army budget office and program  managers so that the Army budget office\u2019s accounting records  reflected estimates instead of actual amounts until it was too late to  control the incurrence of excessive obligations in violation of the act.", "Thus, at any given time in the fiscal year, the Army budget office did  not know the actual obligation and expenditure levels of the account.  The Army budget office explained that it relies on estimated  obligations\u2014despite the availability of actual data from program  managers\u2014because of inadequate financial management systems.  \uf0b7  Similarly, in 2008, Navy officials reported an ADA violation in the  Military Personnel\u2013Navy (MPN) appropriation in the amount of $183  million. The violation occurred when the Bureau of Naval Personnel  (BUPERS) overobligated the fiscal year 2008 MPN appropriation due  to its inability to accurately track the status of obligations and identify  the need for additional funding.", "To its credit, the department has issued and periodically updated policies  that address responsibilities for preventing and identifying ADA  violations. DOD\u2019s guidance also describes frequent causes of violations  within the department and explains the actions necessary to avoid them,  including emphasizing management and supervisory duties, training of  key funds control personnel, and effective systems and procedures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Efforts to Address DOD\u2019s \u201cProblem\u201d Disbursements", "paragraphs": ["Basic controls to match payments with the obligation records and account  for and reconcile payments are not effective within the department. DOD  has identified payment transactions and related accounting steps as  \u201cproblem disbursements\u201d and monitors them through management  tracking reports as it attempts to correct them. Problem disbursements  include unmatched disbursements (UMD) that represent disbursements  that have been paid by an accounting office but that have not been  matched to the correct obligation records. For example, if one or more of  the accounting line elements for each transaction, such as appropriation,  fiscal year, and program code do not match the information in the  accounting records, then the transaction is considered unmatched. For a  description of two examples of DOD\u2019s problem disbursements, see  appendix II.", "Problem disbursements increase the risk of making fraudulent or  erroneous payments without detection. In addition, problem  disbursements impair the reliability of DOD financial statements and  DOD\u2019s ability to control its disbursements, a key aspect of funds control.  According to DOD\u2019s tracking reports, the department has made progress  in addressing problem disbursements, but the department has not  achieved its goals in this area.", "As we reported in 2003, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service  (DFAS) expanded its use of existing financial management performance  metrics to include special measures for the recording of payments,  including the amount of disbursements that are not matched to the  corresponding obligations, or UMDs. DOD, in its May 2011 FIAR Plan  Status Report on the implementation of its FIAR Plan, included a metric  on UMDs. This metric tracks UMDs that are over 120 days old, which  DOD refers to as \u201coveraged UMDs.\u201d As stated in that report, DOD\u2019s  goal is to have no UMD amounts greater than 120 days old. According to the report, the benefit of reducing UMDs, especially overaged UMDs, greater accuracy of DOD components\u2019 account balances on management  reports and the SBR. Reduction of the amount of UMDs will allow DOD to  have more accurate information about the obligations that have been  liquidated, improving its budgetary accounting. The presence of UMDs  prevents the department from having accurate information about the  amount of funds available for obligation and expenditure to carry out its  mission, thus increasing the risk of possible ADA violations. The following  table appears in the May 2011 status report on the FIAR Plan for  overaged UMDs and indicates that, from the second quarter of fiscal year   is  2009 through the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, DOD is making  progress at reducing overaged UMDs:  In the results section accompanying this table, DOD officials noted Army\u2019s  UMDs reportedly increased due to systems issues with recording  obligations and lines of accounting in its Enterprise Resource Planning  (ERP) systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Funds Control Weaknesses and Problem Disbursements Impair the Reliability of DOD\u2019s Financial Information", "paragraphs": ["As we and DOD\u2019s auditors have reported, DOD\u2019s funds control and  related internal control weaknesses and problem disbursements have  impaired its ability to produce reliable financial information for reporting,  especially the reliability of the department\u2019s SBR, as well as its other  budgetary information. For example, we reported in 1999 that the  reliability of DOD\u2019s budgetary information reported in its SBR was  impaired. In 2009, the DOD Comptroller directed that the department\u2019s  components focus their efforts on budgetary information and the ability to  prepare an auditable SBR as one of two first priorities that are now being  implemented through the DOD\u2019s FIAR Plan, its FIAR Guidance, and the  components\u2019 individual financial improvement plans. As a pilot, DOD  designated the Marine Corps SBR as the first military service SBR to  undergo an audit. However, as we reported last week, the Marine Corps  was unable to undergo an audit of its fiscal year 2010 SBR due to serious  control weaknesses that prevented the auditors from performing the  audit. Although we found that the Marine Corps was able to address  some of these weaknesses, many remained unresolved. We found that  the Marine Corps did not develop an effective overall corrective action  plan to address the 70 audit findings and related 139 recommendations  that identified risks, prioritized actions, and identified required resources  needed to help ensure that actions adequately respond to  recommendations. Instead, its approach to addressing auditor findings  and recommendations for its prior and current audit efforts focuses on  short-term corrective actions necessary to support heroic efforts to  produce reliable financial reporting at year-end. Such approach may not  result in sustained improvements over the long term that would help  ensure that the Marine Corps could routinely produce sound data on a  timely basis for decision making and reporting. We also reported key  lessons learned from this pilot that, if effectively shared with the other  military services, could help them to address similar known challenges in  preparing reliable SBRs.", "The SBR is designed to provide information on budgeted spending  authority reported in the President\u2019s Budget, including budgetary  resources, availability of budgetary resources, and how obligated  resources have been used.

DOD\u2019s contract management weaknesses, such as  ineffective oversight, increase the risk that DOD will pay more than the  value of the goods delivered or services performed. Financial  management deficiencies have adversely affected the department\u2019s  ability to control costs, to ensure basic accountability, and to prevent and  detect fraud, waste, and abuse, and represent a significant obstacle to  achieving an unqualified opinion on DOD\u2019s and the U.S. government\u2019s  consolidated financial statements. In addition, the DOD IG recently  reported their assessment that DOD\u2019s risk of making improper payments  is high. This assessment was based on control deficiencies identified by  the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) as well as prior  assessments made by GAO and DOD IG.", "Our prior work and reports issued by DOD IG have highlighted the  department\u2019s long-standing and significant problems with estimating and  preventing improper payments. Specific weaknesses in DOD\u2019s payment  controls include inadequate payment processing, inadequate supporting  documentation for expenditures, financial system deficiencies, and weak  contract audit and payment controls. For example:  Inadequate payment processing. The DOD IG reported that the U.S.  Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command did not have  effective controls over the reporting and processing of baseline and  contingency funds, resulting in improper payments.  Specifically, the  DOD IG reported that the command did not have effective controls  over the recording and processing of 35,699 transactions. Of the  320 sample transactions, 245 had one or more deficiencies. In  addition, of the 29 travel vouchers with deficiencies or unsupported  expenses, the payments made on 10 vouchers were improper  payments. According to the DOD IG report, the improper payments  occurred because the certifying officers and departmental  accountable officials approved the travel vouchers with deficiencies  and unsupported expenses without thoroughly reviewing them.  Inadequate documentation. As we reported last week, we continue to  find that the Navy and Marine Corps have issues with maintaining  adequate documentation for their transactions. On the basis of the  sample of items we tested for an ongoing audit, the Navy did not  maintain adequate documentation for us to independently validate its  efforts to research and resolve differences between its Fund Balance  with Treasury balances with the records of the Department of the  Treasury, which is a process similar to reconciling a checkbook with a  bank statement. Some payments are considered improper payments  due to insufficient or missing documentation. In July 2011, the DOD  IG reported that DFAS made potentially improper payments of $4.2  million from January 2005 through December 2009 related to active  duty military personnel. According to the report, DOD did not ensure  that the Defense Joint Military Pay System\u2013Active Component  contained only valid active-duty military accounts. For example, the  DOD IG found that this system contained military personnel that  received payments after their reported date of death.  \uf0b7  Financial system deficiencies. In 2009, we reported that DOD traced  the root cause of many improper payments in its military and civilian  pay to the inaccurate or untimely reporting of entitlement data to  DOD\u2019s automated systems on such areas as time and attendance,  personnel actions, and pay allowances. We reported that DOD had  described steps to monitor and track these improper payments;  however, it was unclear whether these actions would address the root  causes of these deficiencies. In August 2011, the DOD IG reported  that the Army\u2019s controls over its Deployable Disbursing System  (DDS) payments were inadequate and resulted in, among other  things, improper payments. The DOD IG found that the Army was at  risk of improper payments because its Financial Management Centers  did not effectively review user access to DDS or oversee the payment  process. The DOD IG reported that the Army\u2019s disbursing personnel  made nine duplicate payments to vendors and did not collect on these  improper payments. Two of the duplicate payments were referred by  the DOD IG to the Defense Criminal Investigative Service because of  the suspicious and potentially fraudulent nature of the payments.  \uf0b7  Weak contract audit and payment controls. As we testified in February  2011, our 2009 audit work identified, among other weaknesses in  DOD\u2019s contract payment controls, weaknesses in contract auditing,  which increase the risk of improper payments. In 2009, we reported  on audit quality problems at Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA)  offices nationwide, including compromise of auditor independence,  insufficient audit testing, and inadequate planning and supervision.  In addition, DCAA\u2019s management environment and quality assurance  structure were based on a production-oriented mission that put DCAA  in the role of facilitating DOD contracting without also protecting the  public interest. At that time, we found serious quality problems in the  69 audits and cost-related assignments we reviewed, resulting in  DCAA rescinding over 80 audit reports and removing over 200 DOD  contractors from direct billing privileges, which allow them to submit  invoices for payment without review by the government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concerns over Incomplete DOD Reviews and Reporting on Improper Payments", "paragraphs": ["The Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA) requires DOD to  annually identify programs and activities susceptible to significant  improper payments, estimate amounts improperly paid under those  programs and activities, and report on these estimates and the actions to  reduce improper payments. In July 2009, we reported that DOD did not  conduct risk assessments on all of its payment activities, as $322 billion  in agency outlays were excluded from the amounts DOD assessed.  While DOD components conducted risk assessments for six payment  activities totaling about $493 billion in fiscal year 2007, we identified an  additional $322 billion in outlays reported in DOD\u2019s SBR that had not  been assessed. Also, the DOD IG recently reported that DOD\u2019s First  Quarter FY 2010 High Dollar Overpayments Report (Overpayments  Report) did not accurately portray the department\u2019s risk of high-dollar  overpayments. The DOD IG reported that the Overpayments Report  was incomplete because not all DOD payments were examined. DFAS  reviews for high dollar overpayments excluded approximately $167.5  billion or 55 percent of DOD\u2019s total $303.7 gross outlays. DOD\u2019s inability  to identify and reconcile total payments to its SBR affected the reliability  and completeness of its estimates for and reviews of improper payments.", "GAO-09-442. could leverage the results from its existing Recovery Auditing Act  processes identifying actual commercial under- and overpayments to  develop its statistical sampling methodology and enhance the reported  estimate.", "The DOD Comptroller testified in May 2011 that DOD had not estimated  the amount of improper payments for commercial pay because the  department uses prepayment screening, both automated and manual, to  prevent improper payments. He added that one especially important  tool to prevent commercial pay improper payments is the department\u2019s  Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) software program introduced in  August 2008. However, the DOD IG reported, among other things, that  the BAM tool had a false positive rate of more than 95 percent and that  the BAM review methodology was not standardized across payment  systems or even within the same office. The large number of payments  flagged for review (false positives) made it difficult to conduct the  appropriate research in a timely manner without delaying payment. The  IG reported that the lack of a standardized methodology could lead to  DFAS not detecting and preventing improper payments due to poor  quality review. The Comptroller stated, in his May 2011 testimony, that in  view of legislative changes and more recent OMB guidance, DOD plans  to do postpayment statistical sampling for commercial payments for those  systems not currently covered by the BAM tool to supplement its  prepayment measures."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Although DOD has dedicated significant resources under its FIAR Plan to  remediate its identified financial management weaknesses, it faces  significant challenges in addressing those persistent weaknesses. DOD\u2019s  large number of nonintegrated business systems, complex and inefficient  payment processes, and weak internal controls put the department at risk  of overobligating or overspending its appropriations. DOD has been  addressing its problem disbursements, but they are a contributing factor  to the department\u2019s funds control issues. The department\u2019s weak controls  over payments increase the risk of inaccurate cost information and  improper payments. Given DOD\u2019s stated goal of achieving audit  readiness on its consolidated financial statements by the end of fiscal  year 2017, it will be critical that the department continue to ensure that  steady progress is being made. Moreover, for DOD to move forward, it  will be important for the department to resolve its problems with multiple,  disparate nonintegrated systems and to ensure that whatever systems  solutions are chosen will provide the underlying foundation for auditable  financial statements.", "Mr. Chairman and members of the panel, this concludes my prepared  statement.

The 1950 act placed primary responsibility for establishing  and maintaining internal control squarely on the shoulders of agency  management. In 1982, Congress enacted the law commonly known as  the Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA), and the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) issued Circular No. A-123 to require  each agency to establish and maintain internal control systems that would  enable obligations and costs to be recorded in compliance with applicable  law; funds, property, and other assets to be safeguarded; and revenues  and expenditures applicable to agency operations to be properly recorded  and accounted for. Within this broad framework of internal control  required by FMFIA, the Department of Defense, like other executive- branch agencies, must also design and implement effective systems of  funds control, payment controls, and internal control over financial  reporting. Auditors of DOD\u2019s financial statements assess the  effectiveness of these four types of internal controls in varying degrees as  part of the financial statement audit. Further, one financial statement, the  Statement of Budgetary Resources, was designed for the purpose of  reporting on agencies\u2019 use of federal funds and to subject agencies\u2019 funds  control to audit.
