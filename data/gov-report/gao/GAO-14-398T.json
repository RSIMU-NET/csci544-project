This risk can be heightened when future revenues are  declining or highly uncertain, as is the case for USPS.

For USPS, this is about equity between current  and future postal ratepayers. This is in line with helping USPS align  costs with revenues. An additional consideration here is the \u201clegacy\u201d  unfunded liability that was not paid by ratepayers in prior years.", "Protecting the future viability of the enterprise by not saddling it  with bills later after employees have retired.", "Providing greater benefit security to employees, retirees, and  their beneficiaries. Prefunded benefits are more secure against the  future risks of benefit cuts or inability to pay.", "Providing security to any third party that might become  responsible in the event of the enterprise\u2019s inability to pay for  some or all of the unfunded liability.", "Prefunding decisions also involve trade-offs between USPS\u2019s current  financial condition and its long-term prospects. While reducing unfunded  liabilities protects the future viability of the organization, no prefunding  approach will be viable unless USPS can make the required payments,  but attempting to do so in the short term could further strain its finances.  USPS currently lacks liquidity and postal costs would need to decrease or  postal revenues to increase, or both, to make required prefunding  payments. To the extent prefunding payments are postponed, larger  payments will be required later, when they likely would be supported by  less First-Class Mail volume and revenue.", "In 2012, we developed projections of USPS\u2019s future levels of liability and  unfunded liability for its retiree health benefits. These projections showed  that current law would result in a significant reduction of USPS\u2019s future  unfunded liability if USPS resumed making the required payments.However, USPS has indicated that it does not expect to make any of the  remaining fixed prefunding payments, through fiscal year 2016, an  intention that means its unfunded liability would increase and its future  payments would be greater.", "From the perspective of all USPS\u2019s post-employment benefit programs,  any relaxation of funding requirements in the short term\u2014for example, by  suspending retiree health prefunding for a period of years\u2014will result in a  higher overall unfunded liability for these programs in total. Nonetheless,  Congress has to consider the balance between (1) providing USPS with  liquidity that provides breathing room in the short term in order to  restructure its operations for long-term success, and (2) protecting USPS,  its employees and retirees, and other stakeholders in the long term by  funding its liabilities for benefits that have already been earned or  accrued.", "It is also important to note that unfunded liabilities can be reduced in  either of two ways. An unfunded liability is the difference between the  liability and its supporting assets. As such, an unfunded liability can be  reduced by increasing the amount of assets (i.e., through prefunding), but  it can also be reduced by decreasing the size of the liability, such as by  decreasing benefit levels or USPS\u2019s share of such benefit costs, where  such a reduction is deemed to be feasible, fair, and appropriate. We have  reported on proposals to increase the integration of USPS\u2019s retiree health  benefits with Medicare, which would have the effect of reducing USPS\u2019s  liability but would also involve other policy considerations.", "In our prior reports, we have identified funding issues related to USPS\u2019s  unfunded liabilities that remain unresolved and have identified potential  methods for addressing these issues:", "Actuarial assumptions: We support making the most accurate  measurements possible of USPS\u2019s benefit liabilities, and support the  development and use of assumptions specific to USPS\u2019s population of  plan participants.assumptions are used, that the assumptions should continue to be  recommended by an independent body, such as OPM\u2019s Board of  Actuaries.", "We have suggested that if USPS-specific", "Fixed versus actuarially determined payments: We have reported that  the retiree health prefunding schedule established under PAEA was  significantly frontloaded, with total payment requirements through  fiscal year 2016 that were significantly in excess of what actuarially  determined amounts would be. We added that Congress needs to  modify these payments in a fiscally responsible manner. We support  proposals to replace the fixed payments with actuarially determined  amounts.", "Funding targets: We have expressed concern about proposals to  reduce the ultimate funding target for USPS\u2019s retiree health liability  from the current target of 100 percent down to 80 percent. Such a  reduction would have the effect of carrying a permanent unfunded  liability equal to roughly 20 percent of USPS\u2019s liability, which could be  a significant amount. If an 80 percent funding target were  implemented because of concerns about USPS\u2019s ability to achieve a  100 percent target level within a particular time frame, an additional  policy option to consider could include a schedule to achieve 100  percent funding in a subsequent time period after the 80 percent level  is achieved.", "FERS surplus: Under current law, USPS\u2019s payments to FERS  increase, appropriately, when USPS has an unfunded FERS liability,  but USPS realizes no financial benefit when it has a FERS surplus.  We have reported that we would support a remedy to this asymmetric  treatment, but we have reported on important trade-offs to consider  for different types of remedies. While the most recent estimate  shows a relatively small FERS surplus for USPS\u2014an estimated $0.5  billion\u2014USPS has stated that it believes its FERS surplus would have  been substantially larger if its FERS liability had been estimated using  postal-specific demographic and pay increase assumptions. A  conservative approach to permit USPS to access any FERS surplus  would be to use it to reduce USPS\u2019s annual FERS contribution by  amortizing the surplus over 30 years (which would mirror the legally  required treatment of an unfunded FERS liability). Another approach  would be to reduce USPS\u2019s annual FERS contribution by offsetting it  against the full amount of surplus each year until the surplus is used  up; this would be comparable to what occurs for private-sector  pension plans. We have previously suggested that any return of the  entire surplus all at once should be done with care, given the inherent  uncertainty of the estimated liability and the existence of USPS\u2019s other  unfunded liabilities.should be considered as a one-time exigent action and only as part of  a larger package of postal reforms and restructurings. Any provision  that would return a surplus whenever one developed would likely  eventually result in an unfunded liability.", "A one-time-only return of the entire surplus  In conclusion, we again emphasize that deferring funding liabilities in  benefit programs could increase costs for future ratepayers and increase  the possibility that USPS may not be able to pay for its benefit costs, and  that USPS should work to reduce its unfunded liabilities to the maximum  extent that its finances permit. Ultimately, however, the viability of funding  promised benefits depends on the financial viability of USPS\u2019s underlying  business model. We continue to recommend that Congress adopt a  comprehensive package of actions that will facilitate USPS\u2019s ability to  align costs with revenues based on changes in the workload and the use  of mail.", "Chairman Farenthold, Ranking Member Lynch, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
