The previous administration took a number of  actions to plan for a pandemic, including developing a national strategy  and implementation plan. However, much more needs to be done, and  many gaps in preparedness and planning still remain. At the same time,  national priorities have been shifting as a global pandemic has yet to  occur, and the nation\u2019s financial crisis and other national issues have  become more immediate and pressing.

While the responsible federal agencies have generally  agreed with our recommendations and some actions are underway to  address them, 10 recommendations have not yet been fully implemented.  While our February 2009 report made no new recommendations, we  updated the status of recommendations that had not yet been  implemented as of February 2009. Many of the recommendations that  remain unimplemented have become even more pressing in light of the  very real possibility of a more serious return of the H1N1 virus later this  year.

Our strategy  was built on a large body of work spanning two decades, including reviews  of government responses to prior disasters such as Hurricanes Andrew  and Katrina, the devastation caused by the 9/11 terror attacks, efforts to  address the Year 2000 (Y2K) computer challenges, and assessments of  public health capacities in the face of bioterrorism and emerging  infectious diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).  The strategy was built around six key themes, as shown in figure 1. While  all of these themes are interrelated, our earlier work underscored the  importance of leadership, authority, and coordination, a theme that  touches on all aspects of preparing for, responding to, and recovering from  an influenza pandemic.", "Influenza pandemic\u2014caused by a novel strain of influenza virus for which  there is little resistance and which therefore is highly transmissible among  humans\u2014continues to be a real and significant threat facing the United  States and the world. Unlike incidents that are discretely bounded in space  or time (e.g., most natural or man-made disasters), an influenza pandemic  is not a singular event, but is likely to come in waves, each lasting weeks  or months, and pass through communities of all sizes across the nation  and the world simultaneously. While the current H1N1 outbreak seems to  have been relatively mild, the history of an influenza pandemic suggests it  could return in a second wave this fall or winter in a more virulent form.  While a pandemic will not directly damage physical infrastructure such as  power lines or computer systems, it threatens the operation of critical  systems by potentially removing the essential personnel needed to operate  them from the workplace for weeks or months. In a severe pandemic,  absences attributable to illnesses, the need to care for ill family members,  and fear of infection may, according to the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC), reach a projected 40 percent during the peak  weeks of a community outbreak, with lower rates of absence during the  weeks before and after the peak. In addition, an influenza pandemic could  result in 200,000 to 2 million deaths in the United States, depending on its  severity.", "The Homeland Security Council (HSC) took an active approach to this  potential disaster by, among other things, issuing the National Strategy  for Pandemic Influenza (National Pandemic Strategy) in November 2005,  and the National Pandemic Implementation Plan in May 2006. The  National Pandemic Strategy is intended to provide a high-level overview of  the approach that the federal government will take to prepare for and  respond to an influenza pandemic. It also provides expectations for  nonfederal entities\u2014including state, local, and tribal governments; the  private sector; international partners; and individuals\u2014to prepare  themselves and their communities. The National Pandemic  Implementation Plan is intended to lay out broad implementation  requirements and responsibilities among the appropriate federal agencies  and clearly define expectations for nonfederal entities. The plan contains  324 action items related to these requirements, responsibilities, and  expectations, most of which were to be completed before or by May 2009.  HSC publicly reported on the status of the action items that were to be  completed by 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years in December 2006, July 2007,  and October 2008, respectively. HSC indicated in its October 2008 progress  report that 75 percent of the action items have been completed. At the  request of the House Homeland Security Committee, we have ongoing  work assessing the status of implementing this plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Leadership Roles and Responsibilities Need to Be Clarified and Tested, and Coordination Mechanisms Could Be Better Utilized", "paragraphs": ["Federal government leadership roles and responsibilities for pandemic  preparedness and response are evolving, and will require further testing  before the relationships among the many federal leadership positions are  well understood. Such clarity in leadership is even more crucial now, given  the change in administration and the associated transition of senior  federal officials. Most of these federal leadership roles involve shared  responsibilities between the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and it is not clear  how these would work in practice. According to the National Pandemic  Strategy and Plan, the Secretary of HHS is to lead the federal medical  response to a pandemic, and the Secretary of Homeland Security will lead  the overall domestic incident management and federal coordination. In  addition, under the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of  2006, the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA) was designated as the principal domestic emergency management  advisor to the President, the HSC, and the Secretary of Homeland Security,  adding further complexity to the leadership structure in the case of a  pandemic. To assist in planning and coordinating efforts to respond to a  pandemic, in December 2006 the Secretary of Homeland Security  predesignated a national Principal Federal Official (PFO) for influenza  pandemic and established five pandemic regions each with a regional PFO  and Federal Coordinating Officers (FCO) for influenza pandemic. PFOs  are responsible for facilitating federal domestic incident planning and  coordination, and FCOs are responsible for coordinating federal resources  support in a presidentially-declared major disaster or emergency.", "However, the relationship of these roles to each other as well as with other  leadership roles in a pandemic is unclear. Moreover, as we testified in July  2007, state and local first responders were still uncertain about the need  for both FCOs and PFOs and how they would work together in disaster  response. Accordingly, we recommended in our August 2007 report on  federal leadership roles and the National Pandemic Strategy that DHS and  HHS develop rigorous testing, training, and exercises for influenza  pandemic to ensure that federal leadership roles and responsibilities for a  pandemic are clearly defined and understood and that leaders are able to  effectively execute shared responsibilities to address emerging  challenges. In response to our recommendation, HHS and DHS officials  stated in January 2009 that several influenza pandemic exercises had been  conducted since November 2007 that involved both agencies and other  federal officials, but it is unclear whether these exercises rigorously tested  federal leadership roles in a pandemic.", "In addition to concerns about clarifying federal roles and responsibilities  for a pandemic and how shared leadership roles would work in practice,  private sector officials told us that they are unclear about the respective  roles and responsibilities of the federal and state governments during a  pandemic emergency. The National Pandemic Implementation Plan states  that in the event of an influenza pandemic, the distributed nature and  sheer burden of the disease across the nation would mean that the federal  government\u2019s support to any particular community is likely to be limited,  with the primary response to a pandemic coming from states and local  communities. Further, federal and private sector representatives we  interviewed at the time of our October 2007 report identified several key  challenges they face in coordinating federal and private sector efforts to  protect the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure in the event of an influenza  pandemic. One of these was a lack of clarity about the roles and  responsibilities of federal and state governments on issues such as state  border closures and influenza pandemic vaccine distribution.", "Coordination Mechanisms  Mechanisms and networks for collaboration and coordination on  pandemic preparedness between federal and state governments and the  private sector exist, but they could be better utilized. In some instances,  the federal and private sectors are working together through a set of  coordinating councils, including sector-specific and cross-sector councils.  To help protect the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure, DHS created these  coordinating councils as the primary means of coordinating government  and private sector efforts for industry sectors such as energy, food and  agriculture, telecommunications, transportation, and water. Our October  2007 report found that DHS has used these critical infrastructure  coordinating councils primarily to share pandemic information across  sectors and government levels rather than to address many of the  challenges identified by sector representatives, such as clarifying the roles  and responsibilities between federal and state governments. We  recommended in the October 2007 report that DHS encourage the councils  to consider and address the range of coordination challenges in a potential  influenza pandemic between the public and private sectors for critical  infrastructure. DHS concurred with our recommendation and DHS  officials informed us at the time of our February 2009 report that the  department was working on initiatives to address it, such as developing  pandemic contingency plan guidance tailored to each of the critical  infrastructure sectors, and holding a series of \u201cwebinars\u201d with a number of  the sectors.", "Federal executive boards (FEB) bring together federal agency and  community leaders in major metropolitan areas outside of Washington,  D.C., to discuss issues of common interest, including an influenza  pandemic. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which provides  direction to the FEBs, and the FEBs have designated emergency  preparedness, security, and safety as an FEB core function. The FEBs\u2019  emergency support role with its regional focus may make the boards a  valuable asset in pandemic preparedness and response. As a natural  outgrowth of their general civic activities and through activities such as  hosting emergency preparedness training, some of the boards have  established relationships with, for example, federal, state, and local  governments; emergency management officials; first responders; and  health officials in their communities. In a May 2007 report on the FEBs\u2019  ability to contribute to emergency operations, we found that many of the  selected FEBs included in our review were building capacity for influenza  pandemic response within their member agencies and community  organizations by hosting influenza pandemic training and exercises. We  recommended that, since FEBs are well positioned within local  communities to bring together federal agency and community leaders, the  Director of OPM work with FEMA to formally define the FEBs\u2019 role in  emergency planning and response. As a result of our recommendation,  FEBs were included in the National Response Framework (NRF) in  January 2008 as one of the regional support structures that have the  potential to contribute to development of situational awareness during an  emergency. OPM and FEMA also signed a memorandum of understanding  in August 2008 in which FEBs and FEMA agreed to work collaboratively in  carrying out their respective roles in the promotion of the national  emergency response system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Efforts Are Underway to Improve the Surveillance and Detection of Pandemic-Related Threats in Humans and Animals, but Targeting Assistance to Countries at the Greatest Risk Has Been Based on Incomplete Information", "paragraphs": ["International disease surveillance and detection efforts serve as an early  warning system that could prevent the spread of an influenza pandemic  outbreak.

In our August  2007 report on the National Pandemic Strategy and Implementation Plan,  we found that while these documents are an important first step in guiding  national preparedness, they do not fully address all six characteristics of  an effective national strategy, as identified in our work. The documents  fully address only one of the six characteristics, by reflecting a clear  description and understanding of problems to be addressed. Further, the  National Pandemic Strategy and Implementation Plan do not address one  characteristic at all; they contain no discussion of what it will cost, where  resources will be targeted to achieve the maximum benefits, and how  benefits, risks, and costs will be balanced. Moreover, the documents do  not provide a picture of priorities or how adjustments might be made in  view of resource constraints. Although the remaining four characteristics  are partially addressed, important gaps exist that could hinder the ability  of key stakeholders to effectively execute their responsibilities. For  example, state and local jurisdictions that will play crucial roles in  preparing for and responding to a pandemic were not directly involved in  developing the National Pandemic Implementation Plan, even though it  relies on these stakeholders\u2019 efforts. Stakeholder involvement during the  planning process is important to ensure that the federal government\u2019s and  nonfederal entities\u2019 responsibilities are clearly understood and agreed  upon. Further, relationships and priorities among actions were not clearly  described, performance measures were not always linked to results, and  insufficient information was provided about how the documents are  integrated with other response-related plans, such as the NRF.

All of the 10 localities that we reviewed in depth  had also developed plans and conducted exercises, and had incorporated  lessons learned from pandemic exercises into their planning. However,  an HHS-led interagency assessment of states\u2019 plans found on average that  states had \u201cmany major gaps\u201d in their influenza pandemic plans in 16 of 22  priority areas, such as school closure policies and community  containment, which are community-level interventions designed to reduce  the transmission of a pandemic virus. The remaining six priority areas  were rated as having \u201ca few major gaps.\u201d Subsequently, HHS led another  interagency assessment of state influenza pandemic plans and reported in  January 2009 that although they had made important progress, most states  still had major gaps in their pandemic plans.", "As we had reported in June 2008, HHS, in coordination with DHS and  other federal agencies, had convened a series of regional workshops for  states in five influenza pandemic regions across the country. Because  these workshops could be a useful model for sharing information and  building relationships, we recommended that HHS and DHS, in  coordination with other federal agencies, convene additional meetings  with states to address the gaps in the states\u2019 pandemic plans. As reported  in February 2009, HHS and DHS generally concurred with our  recommendation, but have not yet held these additional meetings. HHS  and DHS indicated at the time of our February 2009 report that while no  additional meetings had been planned, states will have to continuously  update their pandemic plans and submit them for review.", "We have also reported on the need for more guidance from the federal  government to help states and localities in their planning. In June 2008, we  reported that although the federal government has provided a variety of  guidance, officials of the states and localities we reviewed told us that they  would welcome additional guidance from the federal government in a  number of areas, such as community containment, to help them to better  plan and exercise for an influenza pandemic. Other state and local officials  have identified similar concerns. According to the National Governors  Association\u2019s (NGA) September 2008 issue brief on states\u2019 pandemic  preparedness, states are concerned about a wide range of school-related  issues, including when to close schools or dismiss students, how to  maintain curriculum continuity during closures, and how to identify the  appropriate time at which classes could resume. NGA also reported that  states generally have very little awareness of the status of disease  outbreaks, either in real time or in near real time, to allow them to know  precisely when to recommend a school closure or reopening in a  particular area. NGA reported that states wanted more guidance in the  following areas: (1) workforce policies for the health care, public safety,  and private sectors; (2) schools; (3) situational awareness such as  information on the arrival or departure of a disease in a particular state,  county, or community; (4) public involvement; and (5) public-private  sector engagement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Private Sector Pandemic Planning", "paragraphs": ["The private sector has also been planning for an influenza pandemic, but  many challenges remain.

However, federal and private sector  representatives have acknowledged that sustaining preparedness and  readiness efforts for an influenza pandemic is a major challenge, primarily  because of the uncertainty associated with a pandemic, limited financial  and human resources, and the need to balance pandemic preparedness  with other, more immediate, priorities, such as responding to outbreaks of  foodborne illnesses in the food sector and, now, the effects of the financial  crisis.", "In our March 2007 report on preparedness for an influenza pandemic in  one of these critical infrastructure sectors\u2014financial markets\u2014we found  that despite significant progress in preparing markets to withstand  potential disease pandemics, securities and banking regulators could take  additional steps to improve the readiness of the securities markets. The  seven organizations that we reviewed\u2014which included exchanges,  clearing organizations, and payment-system processors\u2014were working on  planning and preparation efforts to reduce the likelihood that a worldwide  influenza pandemic would disrupt their critical operations. However, only  one of the seven had completed a formal plan. To increase the likelihood  that the securities markets will be able to function during a pandemic, we  recommended that the Chairman, Federal Reserve; the Comptroller of the  Currency; and the Chairman, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC);  consider taking additional actions to ensure that market participants  adequately prepare for a pandemic outbreak. In response to our  recommendation, the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of  the Currency, in conjunction with the Federal Financial Institutions  Examination Council and the SEC, directed all banking organizations  under their supervision to ensure that the pandemic plans the financial  institutions have in place are adequate to maintain critical operations  during a severe outbreak.

HHS officials informed  us that they are drafting the guidance on  pre-pandemic influenza vaccination.", "The Secretaries of HHS and Homeland  Security should, in coordination with other  federal agencies, convene additional  meetings of the states in the five federal  influenza pandemic regions to help them  address identified gaps in their planning.", "HHS and DHS officials indicated that while  no additional meetings are planned at this  time, states will have to continuously  update their pandemic plans and submit  them for review.", "The Secretary of Homeland Security should  work with sector-specific agencies and lead  efforts to encourage the government and  private sector members of the councils to  consider and help address the challenges  that will require coordination between the  federal and private sectors involved with  critical infrastructure and within the various  sectors, in advance of, as well as during, a  pandemic.", "DHS officials informed us that the  department is working on initiatives, such  as developing pandemic contingency plan  guidance tailored to each of the critical  infrastructure sectors, and holding a series  of webinars with a number of the sectors.", "Influenza Pandemic: Further Efforts Are  Needed to Ensure Clearer Federal  Leadership Roles and an Effective National  Strategy, GAO-07-781, August 14, 2007  (1) HHS and DHS officials stated that  several influenza pandemic exercises had  been conducted since November 2007 that  involved both agencies and other federal  officials, but it is unclear whether these  exercises rigorously tested federal  leadership roles in a pandemic.", "Influenza Pandemic: Opportunities Exist to  Clarify Federal Leadership Roles and  Improve Pandemic Planning,   GAO-07-1257T, September 26, 2007  (1) The Secretaries of Homeland Security  and HHS should work together to develop  and conduct rigorous testing, training, and  exercises for an influenza pandemic to  ensure that the federal leadership roles are  clearly defined and understood and that  leaders are able to effectively execute  shared responsibilities to address emerging  challenges. Once the leadership roles have  been clarified through testing, training, and  exercising, the Secretaries of Homeland  Security and HHS should ensure that these  roles are clearly understood by state, local,  and tribal governments; the private and  nonprofit sectors; and the international  community.  (2) The Homeland Security Council (HSC)  should establish a specific process and  time frame for updating the National  Pandemic Implementation Plan. The  process should involve key nonfederal  stakeholders and incorporate lessons  learned from exercises and other sources.  The National Pandemic Implementation  Plan should also be improved by including  the following information in the next update:  (a) resources and investments needed to  complete the action items and where they  should be targeted, (b) a process and  schedule for monitoring and publicly  reporting on progress made on completing  the action items, (c) clearer linkages with  other strategies and plans, and (d) clearer  descriptions of relationships or priorities  among action items and greater use of  outcome-focused performance measures. (2) HSC did not comment on the  recommendation and has not indicated if it  plans to implement it.", "Avian Influenza: USDA Has Taken  Important Steps to Prepare for Outbreaks,  but Better Planning Could Improve  Response, GAO-07-652, June 11, 2007  (1) The Secretaries of Agriculture and  Homeland Security should develop a  memorandum of understanding that  describes how the U.S. Department of  Agriculture (USDA) and DHS will work  together in the event of a declared  presidential emergency or major disaster,  or an Incident of National Significance, and  test the effectiveness of this coordination  during exercises. (1) Both USDA and DHS officials told us  that they have taken preliminary steps to  develop additional clarity and better define  their coordination roles. For example the  two agencies meet regularly to discuss  such coordination. (2) The Secretary of Agriculture should, in  consultation with other federal agencies,  states, and the poultry industry, identify the  capabilities necessary to respond to a  probable scenario or scenarios for an  outbreak of highly pathogenic avian  influenza. The Secretary of Agriculture  should also use this information to develop  a response plan that identifies the critical  tasks for responding to the selected  outbreak scenario and, for each task,  identifies the responsible entities, the  location of resources needed, time frames,  and completion status. Finally, the  Secretary of Agriculture should test these  capabilities in ongoing exercises to identify  gaps and ways to overcome those gaps. (2) USDA officials told us that it has created  a draft preparedness and response plan  that identifies federal, state, and local  actions, timelines, and responsibilities for  responding to highly pathogenic avian  influenza, but the plan has not been issued  yet. (3) The Secretary of Agriculture should  develop standard criteria for the  components of state response plans for  highly pathogenic avian influenza, enabling  states to develop more complete plans and  enabling USDA officials to more effectively  review them. (3) USDA told us that it has drafted large  volumes of guidance documents that are  available on a secure Web site. However,  the guidance is still under review and it is  not clear what standard criteria from these  documents USDA officials and states  should apply when developing and  reviewing plans. (4) The Secretary of Agriculture should  focus additional work with states on how to  overcome potential problems associated  with unresolved issues, such as the  difficulty in locating backyard birds and  disposing of carcasses and materials  (4) USDA officials have told us that the  agency has developed online tools to help  states make effective decisions about  carcass disposal. In addition, USDA has  created a secure Internet site that contains  draft guidance for disease response,  including highly pathogenic avian influenza,  and it includes a discussion about many of  the unresolved issues. (5) The Secretary of Agriculture should  determine the amount of antiviral  medication that USDA would need in order  to protect animal health responders, given  various highly pathogenic avian influenza  scenarios. The Secretary of Agriculture  should also determine how to obtain and  provide supplies within 24 hours of an  outbreak. (5) USDA officials told us that the National  Veterinary Stockpile now contains enough  antiviral medication to protect 3,000 animal  health responders for 40 days.  However,  USDA has yet to determine the number of  individuals that would need medicine based  on a calculation of those exposed to the  virus under a specific scenario.  Further,  USDA officials told us that a contract for  additional medication for the stockpile has  not yet been secured, which would better  ensure that medications are available in the  event of an outbreak of highly pathogenic  avian influenza."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Attachment II: Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Influenza Pandemic: HHS Needs to Continue Its Actions and Finalize  Guidance for Pharmaceutical Interventions.
