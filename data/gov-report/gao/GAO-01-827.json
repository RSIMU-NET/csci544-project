In April 2001, Education issued an \u201cinterim\u201d fiscal year 2000 performance report that included some preliminary fiscal year 2002 performance plan program data but did not include any information on strategies to meet unmet performance goals. Education termed the performance report \u201cinterim\u201d because it did not issue an accompanying department-wide fiscal year 2002 performance plan. According to Education officials, the data in the interim report includes the department\u2019s final data for fiscal year 2000 and, in that respect, the report can be considered final. The interim report stated that Education planned to issue the department-wide performance plan for fiscal year 2002 by September 30, 2001. According to Education officials, the delay is due to a lack of senior leadership at the department and Education\u2019s desire to integrate key strategies from the President\u2019s education proposal and from a team of Education senior staff who have been tasked with fixing the department\u2019s management problems.", "As agreed with your office, we reviewed the interim fiscal year 2000 performance report to assess Education\u2019s progress in achieving selected key outcomes that you identified as important mission areas for the department. These are generally the same outcomes we addressed in our June 2000 review of the agencies\u2019 fiscal year 1999 performance reports and fiscal year 2001 performance plans to provide a baseline by which to measure the agencies\u2019 performance from year-to-year. These selected key outcomes are:   All students reach challenging academic standards that prepare them for responsible citizenship, further learning, and productive employment.", "All children receive a solid foundation for learning.   Greater public school choice available to students and families.   Strong, safe, disciplined, and drug-free schools.   Less fraud, waste, mismanagement, and error in student financial assistance programs.", "All students have access to high-quality postsecondary education and lifelong learning.", "As agreed, using the selected key outcomes for the Department of Education as a framework, we (1) assessed the progress Education has made in achieving these outcomes and (2) compared Education\u2019s interim fiscal year 2000 performance report with the agency\u2019s prior year performance report for these outcomes. Additionally, we agreed to analyze how Education has addressed its major management challenges, including the governmentwide high-risk areas of strategic human capital management and information security that we and Education\u2019s Office of the Inspector General identified. Appendix I provides detailed information on how Education addressed these challenges.

New and valuable information on the plans, goals, and strategies of federal agencies has been provided since federal agencies began implementing GPRA. Under GPRA, annual performance plans are to clearly inform the Congress and the public of (1) the annual performance goals for agencies\u2019 major programs and activities, (2) the measures that will be used to gauge performance, (3) the strategies and resources required to achieve the performance goals, and (4) the procedures that will be used to verify and validate performance information. These annual plans, issued soon after transmittal of the President\u2019s budget, provide a direct linkage between an agency\u2019s longer-term goals and mission contained in its strategic plan and its day-to-day activities. Annual performance reports are to subsequently report on the degree to which performance goals were met. The issuance of the agencies\u2019 performance reports, due by March 31, represents a newer and potentially more substantive phase in the implementation of GPRA\u2014 the opportunity to assess federal agencies\u2019 actual performance for the prior fiscal year and to consider what steps are needed to improve performance and reduce costs in the future.", "Education\u2019s mission is to ensure equal access to education and to promote educational excellence throughout the nation. This year\u2019s interim performance report listed the following four department-wide strategic goals: (1) help all children reach challenging academic standards so that they are prepared for responsible citizenship, further learning, and productive employment; (2) build a solid foundation for learning for all children; (3) ensure access to postsecondary education and lifelong learning; and (4) make Education a high-performance organization by focusing on results, service quality, and customer satisfaction. For each goal, Education has established various objectives, and for each objective there were indicators with which to measure its progress. Additionally, in the interim fiscal year 2000 program performance report, Education presents program data for about 180 Education programs. This program report includes some information on planned fiscal year 2002 performance (e.g., program-level targeted goals) and a section explaining how Education plans to address some of the management challenges identified by GAO and others. Where applicable, in addition to the information in the interim performance report, we used indicator data from the interim program performance report to help assess Education\u2019s progress in achieving the selected outcomes.

Education officials told us that these strategies will be included in the fiscal year 2002 department- wide performance plan scheduled to be issued by September 30, 2001. In discussing the extent to which the agency provided assurance that the performance information it is reporting is credible, we have drawn information from our prior work.", "Additionally, due to the nature of the performance information it was difficult to assess Education\u2019s progress for some outcomes. To measure success in some areas, Education relied on long-term trend data that is collected only every 2, 3, 4, or 6 years. These gaps in data make a full analysis of Education\u2019s progress difficult. In January of this year, we reported that Education needed to improve the quality and timeliness of the data on which its programs are evaluated.

Education has seven performance objectives and 35 indicators to measure progress toward achieving this outcome. Of the 35 indicators related to this outcome, fiscal year 2000 data were only available for nine indicators. Due to the lack of fiscal year 2000 data for this outcome, we limited our analysis to these nine indicators and found that Education made little progress toward this outcome.", "Specifically, Education reported that it had not met two goals related to challenging content and student performance standards\u2014goals that are directly related to the achievement of the outcome. As a first step, before all students can reach challenging standards that prepare them for responsible citizenship, further learning, and productive employment, challenging content and student performance standards must be in place. One of the 35 performance indicators, \u201cby the end of the 1997-98 school year, all states will have challenging content and student performance standards in place for two or more core subjects,\u201d focuses on this prerequisite, which had not been achieved by the end of 2000. Twenty- seven states and Puerto Rico had demonstrated to Education that they had completed the development of both content and student performance standards. Education had approved the content standards development process for the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and all states, except one. In its assessment of progress for this indicator, Education explains that rather than developing student performance standards as a template for assessments, which were not scheduled to be in place until the 2000-01 school year, many states are developing their assessment instruments first and then constructing performance standards on the basis of pilot tests of their assessments.", "In looking at the remaining seven indicators with data, Education reported that the goal was met in three instances and not met in the other four. All three of the indicators with goals met are linked to the outcome, but provide only limited information with which to judge progress. For all six indicators with unmet goals, there was minimal discussion of why the goals were not met."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Solid Foundation For Learning", "paragraphs": ["The interim report showed that little progress has been demonstrated for this outcome. Education established 18 indicators to address the goal of building a solid foundation for learning for all children. According to the interim performance report, data for fiscal year 2000 were only available for two indicators\u2014for both of which the goals were met. According to Education officials, 2000 data will be provided in the future as data become available from the states. However, these two indicators alone, \u201cnumber of tutors in the America Reads program\u201d and \u201cthat more than 35 percent of Title I schools adopt a researched-based way to improve curriculum,\u201d do not provide sufficient information with which to gauge progress toward meeting the outcome.

The interim fiscal year 2000 performance report indicated that the interim target for one of the three indicators\u2014that by 2002, there will be 3,000 charter schools in operation around the nation\u2014 was exceeded. The interim target for fiscal year 2000 relating to this indicator was 2,060 charter schools; 2,110 were actually in operation. However, the report notes that the majority of the charter schools are located in only seven states.", "According to the interim performance report, data for fiscal year 2000 are not yet available for one indicator\u2014that by 2003, 25% of all public school students in grades K-12 will attend a school that they or their parents have chosen.", "For the third indicator\u2014that by 2000, a minimum of 40 states will have charter school legislation\u2014the goal was not met. From 1991, when Minnesota became the first state to enact charter school legislation, other states joined steadily until 1999, when the list totaled 38 and remained at 38 through 2000. There was no discussion on why the goal was not met, or why only 40 states are included in the goal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strong, Safe, Disciplined, And Drug-Free Schools", "paragraphs": ["According to the interim report, there was limited progress in meeting this outcome. Education measures progress for this outcome by looking at the national trends in student drug and alcohol use, including in-school use, and national trends in student victimization and violent incidents in schools. Of the four indicators, Education expects progress in three based on national drug use and violent crime trends, and the goal was partially met for one\u2014reducing the prevalence of past-month use of illicit drugs. Specifically, we have the following comments on these indicators:   Of the four indicators, two are for measuring violent behavior and two are for drug and alcohol use. For both violent behavior indicators, data is not available for fiscal year 2000; however, Education has concluded that progress is likely. In making this determination, Education is using national statistics demonstrating that there has been a decrease in the overall juvenile crime and violence rates since the mid-1990s. The data for one indicator\u2014the level of disorder in schools\u2014tracks only physical fights on school property; no reasons were given as to why other disciplinary problems were not tracked. However, our recent report on discipline showed that fistfights are the most prevalent form of serious misconduct and, therefore, probably the best proxy measure to use when only one behavior is being tracked. According to Education, data should be available within the next few years to measure actual progress for both indicators for this outcome.", "From the indicators on drug and alcohol use, it appears that progress is mixed. Education did not meet its goal for past-month alcohol and illicit drug use for 2000; however, Education reports that alcohol use levels have remained relatively steady for years and stated that illicit drug use may have leveled off in recent years, according to national trend data. For the second indicator\u2014rates of in-school alcohol and drug use will begin to fall by 2001\u2014Education reports that progress toward this goal is likely. It based its estimation of success on the fact that the goals for both alcohol and drug use for 1999 were exceeded (even beyond the 2000 goal level) and that overall alcohol and drug use rates have remained steady for years. However, as we noted in last year\u2019s report, Education is using alcohol and marijuana use by 12th graders as a proxy for all alcohol and drug use, respectively. Education does not provide an explanation as to why only marijuana was used for this indicator. In response to our report last year, Education acknowledged that we were correct in our observation that the indicator is narrow in scope and stated that it intended to address this in its fiscal year 2002 plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fraud, Waste, Mismanagement, And Error In Student Financial Assistance Programs", "paragraphs": ["Education did not establish a fiscal year 2000 performance goal or objective to specifically address this outcome. In a section designed to address management challenges facing Education, the interim performance report does report progress towards achieving a related objective: management of department programs and services ensures financial integrity. This is presented as a department-wide objective and does not discuss progress or performance for any specific programs. The discussion of this objective lists several actions Education\u2019s Office of the Chief Financial Officer is taking to accomplish it. These actions include implementing a new general ledger software system; enhancing internal controls, reconciliation, and reporting processes; and improving acquisition systems. According to Education officials, future performance plans may include goals and measures to specifically address this outcome. Additionally, Education has revised its strategic plan to include an objective of ensuring financial integrity within the department.", "Based on the two indicators identified for the financial integrity objective, progress in achieving this objective is mixed. The first indicator, that Education will receive an unqualified opinion on its fiscal year 2000 financial statement audit, was unmet. However, because the auditors identified fewer material weaknesses and reportable conditions related to Education\u2019s internal control systems than they found in last year\u2019s audit, Education states that it is making progress. For the second indicator, Education reported that it achieved its target for increasing the use of performance contracts.", "In the management challenges section of the interim report, Education established a target to remove the student financial assistance programs from GAO\u2019s high-risk list. Education lists several actions, such as developing a corrective action plan, to address program weaknesses. There were, however, no specific goals or measures for this challenge. As we reported to you last year in our assessment of Education\u2019s fiscal year 2001 performance plan, we continue to believe the department should have a goal or objective to specifically address this outcome. The student aid programs remain on GAO\u2019s high risk-list, and we recently testified on serious internal control weaknesses we identified in a review of the department\u2019s payment practices. For example, we stated Education had poor segregation of duties for making payments because some individuals at the department could control the entire payment process\u2014leaving Education at risk for fraud. Also, we cited the need for Education to have better controls over its process for reviewing and approving purchases made with government purchase cards.", "In addition to establishing the target of getting off of GAO\u2019s high-risk list, Education created a task force\u2014or Management Improvement Team\u2014to achieve this result. Among other things, the task force is charged with (1) obtaining a clean audit opinion, (2) removing the student financial aid programs from GAO\u2019s high-risk list, (3) putting in place an effective system of internal controls to protect against waste, fraud, and abuse, and (4) continuing to modernize student aid delivery and management."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Access To A High-Quality Postsecondary Education And Lifelong Learning", "paragraphs": ["The interim report shows that Education\u2019s progress in meeting this goal was mixed. One of Education\u2019s four strategic goals is to ensure access to postsecondary education and lifelong learning. We examined the four objectives and 16 indicators for this goal to determine progress in meeting this outcome. Education used a combination of enrollment rates, amount of unmet financial need, customer satisfaction, and rates of employment to measure its progress for this goal. Of the 16 indicators, we found that Education had met or exceeded its targets for five. For the remaining 11 indicators, however, there were no fiscal year 2000 data available to measure actual progress. We have the following observations on the indicators:   Education had two objectives and nine indicators to measure progress in the areas of ensuring access to postsecondary education. Indicators include enrollment rates, rates at which parents and students request/receive information on admission standards and financial aid, and the amount of unmet financial need that exists for students. In general, the indicators present a mixed picture of Education\u2019s success in achieving this outcome. Of the nine indicators, the goal was met or exceeded for two; no data were available for the remaining seven indicators. Additionally, in looking specifically at the indicators, we found for one indicator classified as goal met\u2014participants receiving support services\u2014the data were from 1997 and the report did not discuss any planned updates for more current data.", "For Education\u2019s objective of delivering student aid in an efficient, financially sound, and customer-responsive manner, there were no unmet indicators. For this objective\u2019s three indicators, Education reported that the Office of Student Financial Assistance (OSFA) either met or exceeded its target. For example, in measuring customer satisfaction with OSFA\u2019s products and services, Education found that, not only was the indicator of improving OSFA\u2019s rating met, but the office was only one percentage point away from meeting its multi-year target of a customer satisfaction rating comparable to the private financial services sector average.", "Education used four indicators to measure its progress toward meeting the objective that all educationally disadvantaged adults can strengthen their literacy skills and improve their earning power over their lifetime through lifelong learning. No fiscal year 2000 data were available for these indicators. In addition to the lack of current data, the data for all four were limited because information is collected and reported by state and local service providers and in some instances, there is no independent verification of the data."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comparison of the Department of Education\u2019s Interim Fiscal Year 2000 Performance Report With the Prior Year Report for Selected Key Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["For the selected key outcomes, this section describes major improvements or remaining weaknesses in Education\u2019s interim fiscal year 2000 performance report in comparison with its fiscal year 1999 report.", "One prominent weakness in last year\u2019s performance report\u2014a lack of data for the reporting period\u2014continues in the interim fiscal year 2000 report. Specifically, Education did not have fiscal year 2000 performance data for over three-fourths of the goals associated with the outcomes we looked at. According to Education officials, 2000 data will be provided in the future as data become available.", "The biggest difference in the reports is the lack of a discussion on how Education plans to achieve its objectives and unmet goals. Additionally, only limited explanations were given as to why goals were unmet. Education officials told us that they did not want to pursue a planning effort\u2014including activities related to how the department plans to achieve its objectives\u2014until senior leadership has been appointed and the President\u2019s education proposal is passed into law.

In this section, Education discussed over half of the 14 major management challenges facing the department as identified by GAO and Education\u2019s OIG. According to Education officials, it decided not to report on those management challenges for which plans from the new administration might affect the strategy for addressing the challenge. More specifically, Education addressed those challenges for which the course of action would be the same regardless of the department\u2019s leadership or the contents of new education legislation. For example, one management challenge that Education addressed was to ensure financial integrity; this needed to be addressed no matter who leads the agency or what is included in the President\u2019s education proposal. Conversely, Education wanted to wait to address the management challenge to promote coordination with other federal agencies and school districts to help build a solid foundation of learning for all children. According to a departmental official, Education plans on integrating actions needed to address this challenge with actions needed to address other proposed initiatives from the new administration.", "In general, the section was helpful in that it outlined the scope of the challenges, identified some performance indicators to be used to assess progress in meeting the challenges, and detailed some strategies to address the challenges. Of the eight challenges discussed in the section, there was a range of thoroughness with which the challenges were addressed. For example, some challenges were mentioned briefly with a short discussion of the status of the challenge and no discussion of goals or measures; other challenges were discussed in-depth with comprehensive discussions of strategies and detailed goals and measures set out.

For example, Education reported on the percentage of managers who believe their staff possess adequate skills for their jobs; however, there was no broader discussion of strategic human capital management such as leadership continuity and succession planning. There was no discussion of strategic human capital management in last year\u2019s performance report or plan\u2014no specific goals, measure, or strategies. While noting that the department has addressed strategic human capital management issues to a limited extent in the agency\u2019s revised strategic plan, Education officials told us that more needs to be done by the department to address this serious issue.", "With respect to information security, we found that Education\u2019s performance report noted that the department had recently updated security plans and performed security reviews on almost all mission critical systems. Additionally, in the management challenges section of the interim program performance report, Education included management and performance goals for completing specific security activities.
