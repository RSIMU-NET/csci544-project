DOD's initial process to design NSPS was problematic; however, after a strategic reassessment, DOD adjusted its approach to reflect a more cautious, deliberate process that involved more stakeholders, including OPM. Many of the principles underlying the proposed NSPS regulations are generally consistent with proven approaches to strategic human capital management. For instance, the proposed regulations provide for (1) elements of a flexible and contemporary human resources management system--such as pay bands and pay for performance; (2) DOD to rightsize its workforce when implementing reduction-in-force orders by giving greater priority to employee performance in its retention decisions; and (3) continuing collaboration with employee representatives. (It should be noted that 10 federal labor unions have filed suit alleging that DOD failed to abide by the statutory requirements to include employee representatives in the development of DOD's new labor relations system authorized as part of NSPS.) GAO has three primary areas of concern: the proposed regulations do not (1) define the details of the implementation of the system, including such issues as adequate safeguards to help ensure fairness and guard against abuse; (2) require, as GAO believes they should, the use of core competencies to communicate to employees what is expected of them on the job; and (3) identify a process for the continuing involvement of employees in the planning, development, and implementation of NSPS. Going forward, GAO believes that (1) the development of the position of Deputy Secretary of Defense for Management, who would act as DOD's Chief Management Officer, is essential to elevate, integrate, and institutionalize responsibility for the success of DOD's overall business transformation efforts, including its new human resources management system; (2) DOD would benefit if it develops a comprehensive communications strategy that provides for ongoing, meaningful two-way communication that creates shared expectations among employees, employee representatives, and stakeholders; and (3) DOD must ensure that it has the institutional infrastructure in place to make effective use of its new authorities before they are operationalized. GAO strongly supports the concept of modernizing federal human capital policies, including providing reasonable flexibility. There is general recognition that the federal government needs a framework to guide human capital reform. Such a framework would consist of a set of values, principles, processes, and safeguards that would provide consistency across the federal government but be adaptable to agencies' diverse missions, cultures, and workforces."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to provide our preliminary  observations on the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) proposed National  Security Personnel System (NSPS) regulations, which the Secretary of  Defense and the Acting Director of the Office of Personnel Management  (OPM) jointly released for public comment last month.  The National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 gave DOD significant  authorities to redesign the rules, regulations, and processes that govern the  way that defense civilian employees are hired, compensated, promoted,  and disciplined.  The proposed regulations, which according to DOD will  ultimately affect more than 700,000 defense civilian employees, are  especially critical because of their implications for governmentwide  reform.  These implications have long been a concern to this  Subcommittee.", "NSPS represents a huge undertaking for DOD, given its massive size and  geographically and culturally diverse workforce.

In recent testimony on DOD\u2019s business transformation efforts,  we indicated that DOD is challenged in its efforts to effect fundamental  business management reform, such as NSPS, and indicated that our  ongoing work continues to raise questions about DOD\u2019s chances of  success.  There is general recognition that the government needs a  framework to guide the kind of large-scale human capital reform occurring  at DOD and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), a framework  that Congress and the administration can implement to enhance  performance, ensure accountability, and position the nation for the future.   Implementing large-scale change management initiatives is a complex  endeavor, and failure to address a wide variety of personnel and cultural  issues, in particular, has been at the heart of unsuccessful organizational  transformations.  Strategic human capital management, which we continue  to designate as a high-risk area governmentwide, can help agencies  marshal, manage, and maintain the workforce they need to accomplish  their missions.", "DOD\u2019s proposed regulations are intended to provide a broad outline of its  new human resources management system.

Many of these personnel demonstration projects  were conducted within DOD.  The experiences of these demonstration  projects provide insights into how some organizations in the federal  government are implementing pay for performance, and thus can guide  DOD as it develops and implements its own approach.  These  demonstration projects illustrate that understanding how to link pay to  performance is very much a work in progress in the federal government  and that additional work is needed to ensure that performance  management systems are tools to help agencies manage on a day-to-day  basis and achieve external results.", "When DOD first proposed its new civilian personnel reform, we strongly  supported the need to expand pay for performance in the federal  government.  Establishing a clear link between individual pay and  performance is essential for maximizing performance and ensuring the  accountability of the federal government to the American people.  As I have  stated before, how pay for performance is done, when it is done, and the  basis on which it is done can make all the difference in whether such  efforts are successful.  DOD\u2019s proposed regulations reflect a growing  understanding that the federal government needs to fundamentally rethink  its current approach to pay and better link pay to individual and  organizational performance.  To this end, the DOD proposal takes another  valuable step toward a modern performance management system as well as  a market-based, results-oriented compensation system. My comments on  specific provisions of pay and performance management follow."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Aligning Individual Performance to Organizational Goals", "paragraphs": ["Under the proposed regulations, the DOD performance management  system would, among other things, align individual performance  expectations with the department\u2019s overall mission and strategic goals,  organizational program and policy objectives, annual performance plans,  and other measures of performance.  However, the proposed regulations do  not detail how to achieve such an alignment, which is a vital issue that will  need to be addressed as DOD\u2019s efforts in designing and implementing a new  personnel system move forward.  Our work on public sector performance  management efforts in the United States and abroad has underscored the  importance of aligning daily operations and activities with organizational  results.  We have found that organizations often struggle with clearly  understanding how what they do on a day-to-day basis contributes to  overall organizational results, while high-performing organizations  demonstrate their understanding of how the products and services they  deliver contribute to results by aligning the performance expectations of  top leadership with the organization\u2019s goals and then cascading those  expectations to lower levels.", "A performance management system is critical to successful organizational  transformation.  As an organization undergoing transformation, DOD can  use its proposed performance management system as a vital tool for  aligning the organization with desired results and creating a \u201cline of sight\u201d  to show how team, unit, and individual performance can contribute to  overall organizational results.  To help federal agencies transform their  culture to be more results oriented, customer focused, and collaborative in  nature, we have reported on how a performance management system that  defines responsibility and ensures accountability for change can be key to a  successful merger and transformation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Establishing Pay Bands", "paragraphs": ["Under the proposed regulations, DOD would create pay bands for most of  its civilian workforce that would replace the 15-grade General Schedule  (GS) system now in place for most civil service employees.  Specifically,  DOD (in coordination with OPM) would establish broad occupational  career groups by grouping occupations and positions that are similar in  type of work, mission, developmental or career paths, and competencies.   Within career groups, DOD would establish pay bands.  The proposed  regulations do not provide details on the number of career groups or the  number of pay bands per career group.  The regulations also do not provide  details on the criteria that DOD will use to promote individuals from one  band to another.  These important issues will need to be addressed as DOD  moves forward.  Pay banding and movement to broader occupational  career groups can both facilitate DOD\u2019s movement to a pay-for- performance system and help DOD better define career groups, which in  turn can improve the hiring process.  In our prior work, we have reported  that the current GS system, as defined in the Classification Act of 1949, is  a key barrier to comprehensive human capital reform and that the creation  of broader occupational job clusters and pay bands would aid other  agencies as they seek to modernize their personnel systems.  The  standards and process of the current classification system are key  problems in federal hiring efforts because they are outdated and thus not  applicable to today\u2019s occupations and work.", "Under the proposed regulations, DOD could not reduce employees\u2019 basic  rate of pay when converting to pay bands.  In addition, the proposed  regulations would allow DOD to establish a \u201ccontrol point\u201d within a band  that limits increases in the rate of basic pay and may require certain criteria  to be met for increases above the control point.  The use of control points  to manage employees\u2019 progression through the bands can help to ensure  that their performance coincides with their salaries and that only the  highest performers move into the upper half of the pay band, thereby  controlling salary costs.  The OPM personnel demonstration projects at  China Lake and the Naval Sea Systems Command Warfare Center\u2019s  Dahlgren Division have incorporated checkpoints or \u201cspeed bumps\u201d in  their pay bands.  For example, when an employee\u2019s salary at China Lake  reaches the midpoint of the pay band, the employee must receive a  performance rating that is equivalent to exceeding expectations before he  or she can receive additional salary increases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Setting and Communicating Employee Performance Expectations", "paragraphs": ["Under the proposed regulations, DOD\u2019s performance management system  would promote individual accountability by setting performance  expectations and communicating them to employees, holding employees  responsible for accomplishing them, and making supervisors and managers  responsible for effectively managing the performance of employees under  their supervision.  While supervisors are supposed to involve employees,  insofar as practicable, in setting performance expectations, the final  decisions regarding performance expectations are within the sole and  exclusive discretion of management.", "Under the proposed regulations, performance expectations may take  several different forms.  These include, among others, goals or objectives  that set general or specific performance targets at the individual, team, or  organizational level; a particular work assignment, including  characteristics such as quality, quantity, accuracy, or timeliness; core  competencies that an employee is expected to demonstrate on the job; or  the contributions that an employee is expected to make.  As DOD\u2019s human  resources management system design efforts move forward, DOD will need  to define, in more detail than is currently provided, how performance  expectations will be set, including the degree to which DOD components,  managers, and supervisors will have flexibility in setting those  expectations.", "The range of expectations that DOD would consider in setting individual  employee performance expectations are generally consistent with those  used by high-performing organizations.  DOD appropriately recognizes that  given the vast diversity of work done in the department, managers and  employees need flexibility in crafting specific expectations.  However, the  experiences of high-performing organizations suggest that DOD should  require the use of core competencies as a central feature of its performance  management effort.  Based on our review of other agency efforts and our  own experience at GAO, we have found that core competencies can help  reinforce employee behaviors and actions that support the department\u2019s  mission, goals, and values, and can provide a consistent message to  employees about how they are expected to achieve results.  By including  such competencies as change management, cultural sensitivity, teamwork  and collaboration, and information sharing, DOD would create a shared  responsibility for organizational success and help ensure accountability for  the transformation process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Making Meaningful Distinctions in Employee Performance", "paragraphs": ["High-performing organizations seek to create pay, incentive, and reward  systems that clearly link employee knowledge, skills, and contributions to  organizational results.  These organizations make meaningful distinctions  between acceptable and outstanding performance of individuals and  appropriately reward those who perform at the highest level.  DOD\u2019s  proposed regulations state that supervisors and managers would be held  accountable for making meaningful distinctions among employees based  on performance and contribution, fostering and rewarding excellent  performance, and addressing poor performance.", "Under the proposed regulations, DOD is expected to have at least three  rating levels for evaluating employee performance.  We urge DOD to  consider using at least four summary rating levels to allow for greater  performance-rating and pay differentiation.  This approach is in the spirit of  the new governmentwide performance-based pay system for the Senior  Executive Service (SES), which requires at least four rating levels to  provide a clear and direct link between SES performance and pay as well as  to make meaningful distinctions based on relative performance.  Cascading  this approach to other levels of employees can help DOD recognize and  reward employee contributions and achieve the highest levels of individual  performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Providing Adequate Safeguards to Ensure Fairness and Guard Against Abuse", "paragraphs": ["Although DOD\u2019s proposed regulations provide for some safeguards to  ensure fairness and guard against abuse, additional safeguards should be  developed.  For example, as required by the authorizing legislation, the  proposed regulations indicate that DOD\u2019s performance management  system must comply with merit system principles and avoid prohibited  personnel practices; provide a means for employee involvement in the  design and implementation of the system; and, overall, be fair, credible, and  transparent.  However, the proposed regulations do not offer details on  how DOD would (1) promote consistency and provide general oversight of  the performance management system to help ensure it is administered in a  fair, credible, and transparent manner, and (2) incorporate predecisional  internal safeguards that are implemented to help achieve consistency and  equity, and ensure nondiscrimination and nonpoliticization of the  performance management process.", "In April 2003, when commenting on DOD civilian personnel reforms, we  testified that Congress should consider establishing statutory standards  that an agency must have in place before it can implement a more  performance-based pay program, and we developed an initial list of  possible safeguards to help ensure that pay-for-performance systems in the  government are fair, effective, and credible.  For example, we have noted  that agencies need to ensure reasonable transparency and provide  appropriate accountability mechanisms in connection with the results of  the performance management process.  This can be done by publishing  the overall results of performance management and individual pay  decisions while protecting individual confidentiality and by reporting  periodically on internal assessments and employee survey results relating  to the performance management system.  DOD needs to commit itself to  publishing the results of performance management decisions.  By  publishing the results in a manner that protects individual confidentiality,  DOD could provide employees with the information they need to better  understand their performance and the performance management system.", "Several of the demonstration projects have been publishing information  about performance appraisal and pay decisions, such as the average  performance rating, the average pay increase, and the average award for  the organization and for each individual unit, on internal Web sites for use  by employees.

DOD\u2019s authorizing legislation permits that DOD merely  document the basis for the severe shortage or critical hiring need and then  notify OPM of these direct-hire determinations.  Direct-hire authority  allows an agency to appoint people to positions without adherence to  certain competitive examination requirements (such as applying veterans\u2019  preference or numerically rating and ranking candidates based on their  experience, training, and education) when there is a severe shortage of  qualified candidates or a critical hiring need.  In the section containing  DOD\u2019s proposed hiring flexibilities, the proposed regulations state that the  department will adhere to veterans\u2019 preference principles as well as comply  with merit principles and the Title 5 provision dealing with prohibited  personnel practices.", "While we strongly endorse providing agencies with additional tools and  flexibilities to attract and retain needed talent, additional analysis may be  needed to ensure that any new hiring authorities are consistent with a  focus on the protection of employee rights, on merit principles\u2014and on  results.  Hiring flexibilities alone will not enable federal agencies to bring  on board the personnel that are needed to accomplish their missions.

For example, employees would be placed on a retention list in the  following order:  tenure group (i.e., permanent or temporary appointment),  veterans\u2019 preference eligibility (disabled veterans will be given additional  priority), level of performance, and length of service; under current  regulations, length of service is considered ahead of performance. I have  previously testified, prior to the enactment of NSPS, in support of revised  RIF procedures that would require much greater consideration of an  employee\u2019s performance.  Although we support greater consideration of  an employee\u2019s performance in RIF procedures, agencies must have  modern, effective, and credible performance management systems in place  to properly implement such authorities.", "An agency\u2019s approach to reductions should be oriented toward strategically  shaping the makeup of its workforce if it is to ensure the orderly transfer of  institutional knowledge and achieve mission results.  DOD\u2019s proposed  regulations include some changes that would allow the department to  rightsize the workforce more carefully through greater precision in  defining competitive areas, and by reducing the disruption associated with  RIF orders as their impact ripples through an organization.  For example,  under the current regulations, the minimum RIF competitive area is  broadly defined as an organization under separate administration in a local  commuting area.  Under the proposed regulations, DOD would be able to  establish a minimum RIF competitive area on a more targeted basis, using  one or more of the following factors:  geographical location, line of  business, product line, organizational unit, and funding line.  The proposed  regulations also provide DOD with the flexibility to develop additional  competitive groupings on the basis of career group, occupational series or  specialty, and pay band.  At present, DOD can use competitive groups  based on employees (1) in the excepted and competitive service, (2) under  different excepted service appointment authorities, (3) with different work  schedules, (4) pay schedule, or (5) trainee status.

The  proposed regulations establish a single process for both performance- based and conduct-based actions, and shorten the adverse action process  by removing the requirement for a performance improvement plan.  In  addition, the proposed regulations streamline the appeals process at the  Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) by shortening the time for filing  and processing appeals.", "Similar to DHS, DOD\u2019s proposed regulations also adopt a higher standard  of proof for adverse actions in DOD, requiring the department to meet a  \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard in place of the current  \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard.  For performance issues, while this higher  standard of evidence means that DOD would face a greater burden of proof  than most agencies to pursue these actions, DOD managers are not  required to provide employees with performance improvement periods, as  is the case for other federal employees. For conduct issues, DOD would  face the same burden of proof as most agencies.", "DOD\u2019s proposed regulations generally preserve the employee\u2019s basic right  to appeal decisions to an independent body\u2014the MSPB.  However, in  contrast to DHS\u2019s final regulations, DOD\u2019s proposed regulations permit an  internal DOD review of the initial decisions issued by MSPB adjudicating  officials.  Under this internal review, DOD can modify or reverse an initial  decision or remand the matter back to the adjudicating official for further  consideration.  Unlike other criteria for review of initial decisions, DOD  can modify or reverse an initial MSPB adjudicating official\u2019s decision where  the department determines that the decision has a direct and substantial  adverse impact on the department\u2019s national security mission.  According  to DOD, the department needs the authority to review initial MSPB  decisions and correct such decisions as appropriate, to ensure that the  MSPB interprets NSPS and the proposed regulations in a way that  recognizes the critical mission of the department and to ensure that MSPB  gives proper deference to such interpretation.  However, the proposed  regulations do not offer additional details on the department\u2019s internal  review process, such as how the review will be conducted and who will  conduct them.  An internal agency review process this important should be  addressed in the regulations rather than in an implementing directive to  ensure adequate transparency and employee confidence in the process.", "Similar to DHS\u2019s final regulations, DOD\u2019s proposed regulations would  shorten the notification period before an adverse action can become  effective and provide an accelerated MSPB adjudication process.  In  addition, MSPB would no longer be able to modify a penalty for an adverse  action that is imposed on an employee by DOD unless such penalty is so  disproportionate to the basis of the action as to be \u201cwholly without  justification.\u201d  In other words, MSPB has less latitude to modify agency- imposed penalities than under current practice. The DOD proposed  regulations also stipulate that MSPB could no longer require that parties  enter into settlement discussions, although either party may propose doing  so.  DOD, like DHS, expressed concerns that settlement should be a  completely voluntary decision made by parties on their own initiative.   However, settling cases has been an important tool in the past at MSPB,  and promotion of settlement at this stage should be encouraged.", "Similar to DHS\u2019s final regulations, DOD\u2019s proposed regulations would  permit the Secretary of Defense to identify specific offenses for which  removal is mandatory.  Employees alleged to have committed these  offenses may receive a written notice only after the Secretary of Defense\u2019s  review and approval. These employeess will have the same right to a  review by an MSPB adjudicating official as is provided to other employees  against whom appealable adverse actions are taken.  DOD\u2019s proposed  regulations only indicate that its employees will be made aware of the  mandatory removal offenses.  In contrast, the final DHS regulations  explicitly provide for publishing a list of the mandatory removal offenses in  the Federal Register.  We believe that the process for determining and  communicating which types of offenses require mandatory removal should  be explicit and transparent and involve relevant congressional  stakeholders, employees, and employee representatives.  Moreover, we  suggest that DOD exercise caution when identifying specific removable  offenses and the specific punishment.  When developing these proposed  regulations, DOD should learn from the experience of the Internal Revenue  Service\u2019s (IRS) implementation of its mandatory removal provisions.  (IRS  employees feared that they would be falsely accused by taxpayers and  investigated, and had little confidence that they would not be disciplined  for making an honest mistake.)  We reported that IRS officials believed this  provision had a negative impact on employee morale and effectiveness and  had a \u201cchilling\u201d effect on IRS frontline enforcement employees, who were  afraid to take certain appropriate enforcement actions.  Careful drafting  of each removable offense is critical to ensure that the provision does not  have unintended consequences.", "DOD\u2019s proposed regulations also would encourage the use of alternative  dispute resolution and provide that this approach be subject to collective  bargaining to the extent permitted by the proposed labor relations  regulations.  To resolve disputes in a more efficient, timely, and less  adversarial manner, federal agencies have been expanding their human  capital programs to include alternative dispute resolution approaches.   These approaches include mediation, dispute resolution boards, and  ombudsmen.  Ombudsmen typically are used to provide an informal  alternative to addressing conflicts.  We previously reported on common  approaches used in ombudsmen offices, including (1) broad responsibility  and authority to address almost any workplace issue, (2) their ability to  bring systemic issues to management\u2019s attention, and (3) the manner in  which they work with other agency offices in providing assistance to  employees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Labor-Management Relations", "paragraphs": ["The DOD proposed regulations recognize the right of employees to  organize and bargain collectively.

A  National Security Labor Relations Board would be created that would  largely replace the Federal Labor Relations Authority.  The proposed board  would have at least three members selected by the Secretary of Defense,  with one member selected from a list developed in consultation with the  Director of OPM.  The proposed board would be similar to the internal  Homeland Security Labor Relations Board established by the DHS final  regulations, except that the Secretary of Defense would not be required to  consult with the employee representatives in selecting its members.

Similar to DHS\u2019s  final regulations establishing the Homeland Security Labor Relations  Board, DOD\u2019s proposed regulations provide for board member qualification  requirements, which emphasize integrity and impartiality.  DOD\u2019s proposed  regulations, however, do not provide an avenue for any employee  representative input into the appointment of board members.  DHS  regulations do so by requiring that for the appointment of two board  members, the Secretary of Homeland Security must consider candidates  submitted by labor organizations.

At a forum we co-hosted  in April 2004 exploring the concept of a governmentwide framework for  human capital reform, which I will discuss later, participants generally  agreed that the ability to organize, bargain collectively, and participate in  labor organizations is an important principle to be retained in any  framework for reform.

None of the plans included analyses of the gaps  between critical skills and competencies (a set of behaviors that are critical  to work accomplishment) currently needed by the workforce and those that  will be needed in the future.  Without including gap analyses, DOD and the  components may not be able to effectively design strategies to hire, develop,  and retain the best possible workforce.  Furthermore, none of the plans  contained results-oriented performance measures that could provide the  data necessary to assess the outcomes of civilian human capital initiatives.", "GAO recommends that DOD and  the components include certain key elements in their civilian strategic  workforce plans to guide their  human capital efforts.  DOD  concurred with one of our  recommendations, and partially  concurred with two others because  it believes that the department has  undertaken analyses of critical  skills gaps and are using strategies  and personnel flexibilities to fill  identified skills gaps.  We cannot  verify DOD\u2019s statement because  DOD was unable to provide the gap  analyses.

DOD\u2019s proposal recognizes that,  as GAO has stated and the experiences of leading public sector organizations  here and abroad have found strategic human capital management must be the  centerpiece of any serious government transformation effort.", "DOD\u2019s proposed National Security  Personnel System (NSPS) would  provide for wide-ranging changes  in DOD\u2019s civilian personnel pay and  performance management,  collective bargaining, rightsizing,  and a variety of other human  capital areas.  The NSPS would  enable DOD to develop and  implement a consistent DOD-wide  civilian personnel system.", "More generally, from a conceptual standpoint, GAO strongly supports the need  to expand broad banding and pay for performance-based systems in the federal  government.  However, moving too quickly or prematurely at DOD or elsewhere,  can significantly raise the risk of doing it wrong.  This could also serve to  severely set back the legitimate need to move to a more performance and  results- based system for the federal government as a whole.  Thus, while it is  imperative that we take steps to better link employee pay and other personnel  decisions to performance across the federal government, how it is done, when it  is done, and the basis on which it is done, can make all the difference in whether  or not we are successful.  In our view, one key need is to modernize  performance management systems in executive agencies so that they are  capable of supporting more performance-based pay and other personnel  decisions.  Unfortunately, based on GAO\u2019s past work, most existing federal  performance appraisal systems, including a vast majority of DOD\u2019s systems, are  not currently designed to support a meaningful performance-based pay system.", "This testimony provides GAO\u2019s  preliminary observations on  aspects of DOD\u2019s legislative  proposal to make changes to its  civilian personnel system and  poses critical questions that need  to be considered.", "The critical questions to consider are: should DOD and/or other agencies be  granted broad-based exemptions from existing law, and if so, on what basis; and  whether they have the institutional infrastructure in place to make effective use  of the new authorities.  This institutional infrastructure includes, at a minimum,  a human capital planning process that integrates the agency\u2019s human capital  policies, strategies, and programs with its program goals and mission, and  desired outcomes; the capabilities to effectively develop and implement a new  human capital system; and, importantly, a set of adequate safeguards, including  reasonable transparency and appropriate accountability mechanisms to ensure  the fair, effective, and credible implementation of a new system. www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-03-717T.", "To view the full report, including the scope  and methodology, click on the link above.

Congress should also consider establishing a governmentwide fund  whereby agencies, based on a sound business case, could apply for funding to  modernize their performance management systems and ensure that those  systems have adequate safeguards to prevent abuse.  This approach would serve  as a positive step to promote high-performing organizations throughout the  federal government while avoiding fragmentation within the executive branch in  the critical human capital area.", "The Department of Defense\u2019s  (DOD) civilian employees play key  roles in such areas as defense  policy, intelligence, finance,  acquisitions, and weapon systems  maintenance.  Although downsized  38 percent between fiscal years  1989 and 2002, this workforce has  taken on greater roles as a result of  DOD\u2019s restructuring and  transformation. Responding to  congressional concerns about the  quality and quantity of, and the  strategic planning for the civilian  workforce, GAO determined the  following for DOD, the military  services, and selected defense  agencies: (1) the extent of top-level  leadership involvement in civilian  strategic planning; (2) whether  elements in civilian strategic plans  are aligned to the overall mission,  focused on results, and based on  current and future civilian  workforce data; and (3) whether  civilian and military personnel  strategic plans or sourcing  initiatives were integrated.", "Generally, civilian personnel issues appear to be an emerging priority among  top leaders in DOD and the defense components.  Although DOD began  downsizing its civilian workforce more than a decade ago, it did not take  action to strategically address challenges affecting the civilian workforce  until it issued its civilian human capital strategic plan in April 2002.    Top-level leaders in the Air Force, the Marine Corps, the Defense Contract  Management Agency, and the Defense Finance Accounting Service have  initiated planning efforts and are working in partnership with their civilian  human capital professionals to develop and implement civilian strategic  plans; such leadership, however, was increasing in the Army and not as  evident in the Navy.  Also, DOD has not provided guidance on how to  integrate the components\u2019 plans with the department-level plan.  High-level  leadership is critical to directing reforms and obtaining resources for  successful implementation.", "The human capital strategic plans GAO reviewed for the most part lacked  key elements found in fully developed plans.  Most of the civilian human  capital goals, objectives, and initiatives were not explicitly aligned with the  overarching missions of the organizations.  Consequently, DOD and the  components cannot be sure that strategic goals are properly focused on  mission achievement.  Also, none of the plans contained results-oriented  performance measures to assess the impact of their civilian human capital  initiatives (i.e., programs, policies, and processes).  Thus, DOD and the  components cannot gauge the extent to which their human capital initiatives  contribute to achieving their organizations\u2019 mission.  Finally, the plans did  not contain data on the skills and competencies needed to successfully  accomplish future missions; therefore, DOD and the components risk not  being able to put the right people, in the right place, and at the right time,  which can result in diminished accomplishment of the overall defense  mission.", "GAO recommends DOD improve  the departmentwide plan to be  mission aligned and results- oriented; provide guidance to align  component- and department-level  human capital strategic plans;  develop data on future civilian  workforce needs; and set mile- stones for integrating military and  civilian workforce plans, taking  contractors into consideration.   DOD comments were too late to  include in this report but are   included in GAO-03-690R.", "Moreover, the civilian strategic plans did not address how the civilian  workforce will be integrated with their military counterparts or sourcing  initiatives.  DOD\u2019s three human capital strategic plans-- two military and one  civilian--were prepared separately and were not integrated to form a  seamless and comprehensive strategy and did not address how DOD plans to  link its human capital initiatives with its sourcing plans, such as efforts to  outsource non-core responsibilities.  The components\u2019 civilian plans  acknowledge a need to integrate planning for civilian and military  personnel\u2014taking into consideration contractors\u2014but have not yet done so.  Without an integrated strategy, DOD may not effectively and efficiently  allocate its scarce resources for optimal readiness. www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-03-475.", "To view the full report, including the scope  and methodology, click on the link above.
