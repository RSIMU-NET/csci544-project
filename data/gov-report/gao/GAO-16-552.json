Out-of-business records are integral to the firearms  tracing process. According to ATF officials, in approximately 35 to 38  percent of trace requests, there is at least one entity in the chain of  distribution that has gone out of business. Therefore, in more than one- third of firearms trace requests, NTC analysts must consult OBRIS at  least once.

By design, the files are stored as images (with no optical  character recognition) so that they cannot be searched using text  queries. In addition, ATF sometimes receives electronic FFL out-of- business records in the forms of computer external removable drives and  hard drives. In these cases, ATF converts the data to a nonsearchable  format consistent with OBRIS records. During processing of OBRIS  records, NTC conducts a quality-assurance process, including document  sorting, scanning, and error checks on 100 percent of the records  received.

All three of the participating industry members we spoke with agreed that  A2K has been beneficial since it reduces the industry member resources  necessary to respond to trace requests. A2K also benefits NTC by  providing immediate access to industry member data at all times, thereby  allowing tracing operations to continue outside of normal business hours,  which can be crucial for urgent trace requests. According to ATF data, as  of March 17, 2016, there were 290,256,532 firearms in A2K.

An ATF agent submits firearms information to FRNP, in connection with a  specific ATF criminal investigation, to flag a particular firearm so that in  the event that it is recovered and traced at some future time, the  requesting agent will be notified.", "A request to enter a firearm into FRNP could start with an ATF agent  recovering another firearm during an undercover investigation of illegal  sales from a firearms trafficker. By searching eTrace, the agent may  discover that the recovered firearm was part of a multiple sale with three  other firearms. The ATF agent then may request that the other three  firearms be entered into FRNP because they are associated with the  firearm the agent recovered and, therefore, are likely to also be trafficked.  ATF officials stated that, in this hypothetical case, it is likely that those  three firearms, if recovered and traced in the future, would support a  potential firearms trafficking case. If the firearms are in FRNP, if and  when they are recovered and traced, NTC would notify the requesting  agent, who could then contact the agency that recovered and traced the  firearms to coordinate building such a case.", "To enter a firearm into FRNP, an ATF agent submits ATF Form 3317.1  (see app. IV) to NTC. According to ATF, no other law enforcement  agencies may submit firearms to FRNP or view information in the system;  only ATF agents and NTC staff have access. When a firearm is recovered  in a crime and is traced, NTC conducts an automated check to determine  whether the firearm description in the trace request matches a firearm  description in FRNP. If so, an analyst will validate that the entries match.  If they do, NTC generally notifies the ATF agent who submitted the  firearm for inclusion in FRNP that the firearm has been recovered and  traced. Then, the analyst completes the trace and sends the results to the  requester of the trace. Occasionally, in submitting the firearm to FRNP,  the agent directs NTC to not complete the trace on the firearm in the  event that the firearm is recovered and traced (i.e., not provide the trace  results to the law enforcement agency who requested the trace). For  example, an agent might want to prevent trace information from being  released to protect an undercover operation or other investigation.  According to ATF data, as of May 3, 2016, there were 174,928 firearms  and the names of 8,705 unique persons (e.g., criminal suspects, firearms  purchasers, associates) in FRNP, making up 41,964 total FRNP  records.

Information from inactive records is  used to assist with the tracing process, but when a trace hits on an  inactive FRNP record, NTC does not notify the ATF agent who submitted  the firearm since the associated investigation is closed and the  information would no longer be useful to the agent. According to our  review of all FRNP records, as of July 2015, about 16 percent of the  41,625 records were designated \u201cactive\u201d and about 84 percent were  designated \u201cinactive.\u201d Inactive records remain in the system for tracing  purposes.

According to ATF, these reports, when cross-referenced with  firearms trace information, serve as an important indicator in the detection  of potential firearms trafficking. They can also allow successful tracing of  older firearms that have reentered the retail market.", "MS also maintains the information from Demand Letter 3 reports. In  2011, ATF issued Demand Letter 3 to dealer and pawnbroker FFLs  located in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas.

ATF preserves the remainder of  the data, such as the firearm description, for the purpose of supporting  investigations. In contrast, if an MS record is connected to a firearms  trace, then ATF preserves the entire record, including purchaser  information, in the system. MS reports are available to any ATF staff that  has access to eTrace but not to outside law enforcement agencies with  eTrace access.

As we  reported in 1996, ATF first issued regulations in 1968 requiring FFLs that  permanently go out of business to deliver their firearms transaction  records to the federal government within 30 days. This provided a  means of accessing the records for firearms tracing purposes after an  FFL went out of business. The legislative history related to ATF\u2019s fiscal  year 1979 appropriation did not provide any indication that Congress  intended a change in ATF\u2019s existing practice.

ATF transitioned from using microfilm  images of records to scanning records into OBRIS as digital images not  searchable through character recognition, consistent with ATF\u2019s design  and use of its prior Microfilm Retrieval System. It is our view that, like its  microfilm predecessor system, OBRIS also complies with the  appropriations act restriction because OBRIS\u2019s statutory basis and  accessibility are essentially the same as the prior system.

For example, NTC personnel spend extra  time indexing the images by FFL number, and chronologically sorting FFL  records, typically by month and by year. When tracing a firearm,  according to ATF policy and verified by our observations, NTC personnel  generally identify a group of FFL records through the FFL number index,  then manually search the dates of the FFL records to narrow in on a  group of records that might contain the firearm being traced. NTC  personnel then manually skim through each record in this group until they  identify the relevant firearm information. According to NTC officials, NTC  staff sometimes search thousands of pages of records to find the record  that matches the trace request.

In other similar cases, the courts have also held that  ATF had the authority to issue the demand letter and that ATF\u2019s issuance  of the demand letter complied with the appropriations act restriction.

However, ATF\u2019s method to identify records for deletion is not  comprehensive and, therefore, 10,041 names that should have been  deleted remained in MS until May 2016. According to ATF officials,  because of MS system design limitations, analysts must write complex  queries to locate such names in MS. For example, since the information  needed to identify the correct records could exist in free-form fields, the  success of the queries in comprehensively identifying all appropriate  records depends on consistent data entry of several text phrases  throughout the history of the system. In addition, ATF\u2019s queries have  inconsistently aligned with its system design\u2014for instance, as the system  was modified and updated, the query text remained aligned with the  outdated system\u2014and therefore these queries resulted in incomplete  identification of records to be deleted. Changes to MS to address system  query limitations would require a system-wide database enhancement,  but there is currently not an operations and maintenance support contract  in place for this system.", "Moreover, even if the system could ensure that deletions capture all  required records, ATF has inconsistently adhered to the timetable of  deletions required by its policy. For example, according to ATF\u2019s deletion  log and our verification of the log, some records entered in 1997 were not  deleted until November 2009\u2014about 10 years after the required 2  years. As shown in table 1 below, ATF\u2019s timing for implementing  deletions did not adhere to ATF policy directives.", "As shown in table 1 below, the ATF deletion policy for MS has changed  over time including variations in the frequency of deletions (e.g., annually,  monthly, weekly), and pauses to the deletion policy because of, according  to ATF officials, litigation and requests from Congress. According to NTC  officials, delayed deletions occurred because deleting a large number of  records at once negatively affects the system, slowing system response  time or stopping entirely the larger related data system. However,  according to NTC\u2019s deletion log and verified by our observations of NTC  system queries, deletions were conducted in average increments of  almost 100,000 records per day\u2014representing on average a full year\u2019s  worth of records to be deleted. In addition, ATF confirmed that a single  deletion of 290,942 records on one day in January 2011 did not affect the  system. Therefore, system constraints do not seem to be the reason for  the delayed deletion. ATF did not identify further causes for the delays in  deletions.", "ATF reported that the objective for its deletion policy was primarily to  delete data that may not be useful because of its age and to safeguard  privacy concerns related to retaining firearms purchaser data. Federal  internal control standards require control activities to help ensure that  management\u2019s directives are carried out. Additionally, information  systems and related control activities should be designed to achieve  objectives and respond to risks. Specifically, an organization\u2019s  information system should be designed by considering the processes for  which the information system will be used. For example, to alleviate the  risk of not meeting the objectives established through the MS deletion  policy, ATF must ensure the policy is consistent with the design of the MS  data system and ATF must ensure that it meets the policy\u2019s timeline  requirements. In September 1996, we reported that ATF had not fully  implemented its 2-year deletion requirement. During the course of our  1996 review, ATF provided documentation that it had subsequently  deleted the required records and that it would conduct weekly deletions in  the future. Similarly, as a result of our current review, according to ATF  documentation, in May 2016, the agency deleted the 10,041 records that  should have been deleted earlier. However, given that this has been a  20-year issue, it is critical that ATF develop consistency between its  deletion policy, the design of the MS system, and the timeliness with  which deletions are carried out.

With regard to ATF policies  on maintenance of firearms records, ATF should do more to ensure that  these policies are followed and that they are clearly communicated.  Specifically, providing guidance to industry members participating in A2K  for how to submit their records when they go out of business would help  ensure they submit required records to ATF. Without this clear guidance,  ATF risks not being able to locate the first purchaser of a firearm during a  trace, and thus may not be able to fulfill part of its mission.

We compared this information to the systems  identified in our September 1996 report, and conducted searches of  publicly available information to develop a comprehensive and current list  of systems. In order to identify the systems and better understand them  and their contents, we spoke with ATF officials in headquarters and at  ATF\u2019s National Tracing Center (NTC). We also discussed these systems  with ATF investigative and regulatory officials in the Baltimore and Los  Angeles field offices, who provided varying perspectives due to  geographic factors. These actions enabled us to confirm a  comprehensive list of systems, and determine the presence of retail  purchaser information within these systems.", "We selected four systems for a more in-depth review: Out-of-Business  Records Imaging System (OBRIS), Access 2000 (A2K), Firearm  Recovery Notification Program (FRNP), and Multiple Sales (MS).  Selected systems, at a minimum, contained retail purchaser information  and contained original records\u2014as opposed to systems that transmitted  information, such as a system that only pulls data from another system in  order to print a report or fill out a form. A system was more likely to be  selected if (1) it contained data unrelated to a criminal investigation, (2) a  large percentage of system records contained retail purchaser  information, (3) the retail purchaser information was searchable, or (4)  ATF initiated the system\u2014as opposed to ATF being statutorily required to  maintain the system.

According to ATF, this was a  time-consuming and labor-intensive process, which also created storage  problems. In 1991, ATF began a major project to microfilm the out-of- business records and destroy the originals. Instead of in boxes, the out- of-business records were stored on microfilm cartridges, with the FFL  numbers assigned to them. Although this system occupied much less  space than the hard copies of the records, ATF officials said it was still  time-consuming to conduct firearms traces because employees had to  examine up to 3,000 images on each microfilm cartridge to locate a  record.

One component of ATF\u2019s criminal enforcement  mission involves the tracing of firearms used in crimes to identify the first  retail purchaser of a firearm from an FFL. To conduct a trace, the  requesting law enforcement agency must identify the manufacturer or  importer of the firearm and its type, caliber, and serial number, as well as  other information related to the recovery, crime, and possessor.  According to ATF, NTC personnel must typically use the information  provided by the law enforcement agency to contact the manufacturer or  importer to determine when and to whom the firearm in question was  sold. The manufacturer or importer may have sold the firearm to an FFL  wholesaler. In that case, NTC personnel would contact the FFL  wholesaler to determine when and to whom the firearm in question was  sold, usually to an FFL retailer. The tracing process continues until NTC  identifies the first retail purchaser who is a nonlicensee.", "The Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended, established a system  requiring FFLs to record firearms transactions, maintain that information  at their business premises, and make such records available to ATF for  inspection and search under certain prescribed circumstances. This  system was intended to permit law enforcement officials to trace firearms  involved in crimes as described above while allowing the records  themselves to be maintained by the FFLs rather than by a governmental  entity. As originally enacted, the Gun Control Act required FFLs to submit  such reports and information as the Secretary of the Treasury prescribed  by regulation and authorized the Secretary to prescribe such rules and  regulations as deemed reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions  of the act.", "In 1978, citing the general authorities contained in the Gun Control Act,  ATF proposed regulations that would have required FFLs to report most  of their firearms transactions to ATF through quarterly reports. Under the  proposed regulations, these FFL reports of sales and other dispositions  would not have identified a nonlicensed transferee, such as a retail  purchaser, by name and address. However, the proposed regulations  prompted concerns from those who believed that the reporting  requirements would lead to the establishment of a system of firearms  registration. Congress included in ATF\u2019s fiscal year 1979 appropriation for  salaries and expenses a provision prohibiting the use of funds for  administrative expenses for the consolidation or centralization of certain  FFL records, or the final issuance of the 1978 proposed regulations. The  provision continues to apply, with some modifications as described below. hat no funds appropriated herein shall be available for administrative expenses in  connection with consolidating or centralizing within the Department of the Treasury the  records of receipt and disposition of firearms maintained by Federal firearms licensees or  for issuing or carrying out any provisions of the proposed rules of the Department of the  Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, on Firearms Regulations, as  published in the Federal Register, volume 43, number 55, of March 21, 1978.", "The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF) has proposed implementation of  several new regulations regarding firearms. The proposed regulations, as published in the  Federal Register of March 21, 1978 would require:  (1) A unique serial number on each gun manufactured or imported into the United States.  (2) Reporting of all thefts and losses of guns by manufacturers, wholesalers and dealers.  (3) Reporting of all commercial transactions involving guns between manufacturers,  wholesalers and dealers.", "The Bureau would establish a centralized computer data bank to store the above  information. It is important to note that the proposed regulations would create a central  Federal computer record of commercial transactions involving all firearms\u2014whether  shotguns, rifles, or handguns. There are approximately 168,000 federally licensed  firearms dealers, manufacturers, and importers. It is estimated that the proposed  regulations would require submission of 700,000 reports annually involving 25 million to  45 million transactions.", "It is the view of the Committee that the proposed regulations go beyond the intent of  Congress when it passed the Gun Control Act of 1968. It would appear that BATF and the  Department of Treasury are attempting to exceed their statutory authority and accomplish  by regulation that which Congress has declined to legislate.", "The reference to the 1978 proposed rules was removed from the annual  provision as of the fiscal year 1994 appropriations act, but the prohibition  against using funds for administrative expenses for consolidating or  centralizing records was included in each of ATF\u2019s annual appropriations  through fiscal year 2012 in much the same form. In fiscal year 1994, the  Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act,  1994, expanded the prohibition to include the consolidation or  centralization of portions of records and to apply to the use of funds for  salaries as well as administrative expenses, stating \u201chat no funds  appropriated herein shall be available for salaries or administrative  expenses in connection with consolidating or centralizing, within the  Department of the Treasury, the records, or any portion thereof, of  acquisition and disposition of firearms maintained by Federal firearms  licensees\u201d (emphasis added). \u201chat no funds appropriated herein or hereafter shall be available for salaries or  administrative expenses in connection with consolidating or centralizing, within the  Department of Justice, the records, or any portion thereof, of acquisition and disposition of  firearms maintained by Federal firearms licensees\u201d (emphasis added).", "The conference report accompanying the act explained that the provision  had been made permanent.", "We previously considered ATF\u2019s compliance with the restriction on  consolidation or centralization in 1996 in connection with the agency\u2019s  Microfilm Retrieval System and Multiple Sales System. We stated that  the restriction did not preclude all information practices and data systems  that involved an element of consolidation or centralization, but that it had  to be interpreted in light of its purpose and in the context of other statutory  provisions governing ATF\u2019s acquisition and use of information on  firearms. In this respect, our analyses reflected the well-established  principle that statutory provisions should be construed harmoniously so  as to give them maximum effect whenever possible, avoiding the  conclusion that one statute implicitly repealed another in the absence of  clear evidence to the contrary. We found that the two systems complied  with the statutory restriction on the grounds that ATF\u2019s consolidation of  records was incident to carrying out specific responsibilities set forth in  the Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended, and that the systems did not  aggregate data on firearms transactions in a manner that went beyond  these purposes. Thus, our analysis did not turn on the presence or  absence of retail purchaser information in the system, but rather on the  extent to which the aggregation of data corresponded to a statutory  purpose. We employ a similar analytical approach, which ATF has also  adopted, in assessing the four systems under review here, taking into  account ATF\u2019s statutory authorities and the critical characteristics of each  system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "paragraphs": ["Two of the four data systems we reviewed\u2014OBRIS and MS\u2014do not  consolidate or centralize firearms in violation of the restriction contained  in the fiscal year 2012 appropriations act.

Under 18  U.S.C. \u00a7 923(g)(4), when a firearms business is discontinued and there is  no successor, the records required to be maintained by FFLs must be  delivered within 30 days to ATF.", "ATF\u2019s system for maintaining the records of out-of-business FFLs for its  statutory tracing function has evolved over time in response to logistical  challenges and technological advances. Prior to fiscal year 1991, ATF  maintained out-of-business FFLs\u2019 records in hard copy, with a file number  assigned to each FFL. During a trace, if ATF determined that a firearm  had been transferred or disposed of by an out-of-business FFL, ATF  employees manually searched the FFL\u2019s records until they found the  records corresponding to the serial number of the firearm being traced.  According to ATF, this was a time-consuming and labor-intensive  process, and the volume of records created storage problems. In 1991,  ATF began a major project to microfilm these records and destroy the  originals. For fiscal year 1992, Congress appropriated $650,000 \u201csolely  for improvement of information retrieval systems at the National Firearms  Tracing Center.\u201d In fiscal year 1992, ATF began creating a  computerized index of the microfilmed records containing the information  necessary to identify whether ATF had a record relating to a firearm being  traced. The index contained the following information: (1) the cartridge  number of the microfilm; (2) an index number; (3) the serial number of the  firearm; (4) the FFL number; and (5) the type of document on microfilm,  i.e., a Firearms Transaction Record form or acquisition and disposition  logbook pages. This information was stored on a database in ATF\u2019s  mainframe computer to allow searches. Other information, however,  including a firearms purchaser\u2019s name or other identifying information and  the manufacturer, type, and model remained stored on microfilm  cartridges and was not computerized. Therefore, this information was not  accessible to ATF personnel through a text search.", "In our 1996 report, we concluded that the Microfilm Retrieval System did  not violate the restriction on consolidation or centralization due to its  statutory underpinnings and design. ATF had initially required out-of- business FFLs to deliver their records to ATF through a 1968 regulation.  We found no indication in its legislative history that the appropriations act  restriction was intended to overturn this regulation and noted that,  historically, out-of-business records had been maintained at a central  location. We also explained that the Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act of  1986 (FOPA) had codified the ATF regulation, affirming the agency\u2019s  authority to collect this information, and that a subsequent  appropriations act had provided funding specifically for ATF\u2019s microfilming  effort. Finally, ATF\u2019s system of microfilmed records did not capture and  store certain key information, such as firearms purchaser information, in  an automated file. In this regard, we found that the system did not  aggregate information in a manner beyond that necessary to implement  the Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended by FOPA.", "Conversion of Records.\u2014The conferees recognize the need for the ATF to begin  converting tens of thousands of existing records of out-of-business Federal firearms  dealers from film to digital images at the National Tracing Center. Once the out-of- business records are fully converted, the search time for these records will be reduced to  an average of 5 minutes per search from the current average of 45 minutes per search.  This significant time saving will ultimately reduce overall costs and increase efficiency at  the National Tracing Center. Therefore, the conference agreement includes a $4,200,000  increase for the ATF to hire additional contract personnel to begin this conversion.", "Similarly, the conference report accompanying the fiscal year 2006  appropriations act reflected the conferees\u2019 support for ATF\u2019s transition of  out-of-business records to OBRIS.", "Since 2006, NTC has converted records submitted by FFLs discontinuing  their operations to digital images in OBRIS. Specifically, NTC sorts and  scans records provided by out-of-business FFLs, converting and storing  them in an image repository on an electronic server. Images stored in  OBRIS are generally indexed by FFL number. The records themselves  are stored as images without optical character recognition so that they  cannot be searched or retrieved using text queries, but must be searched  through the index, generally by FFL number. After narrowing down the  possible records through an index search, an NTC analyst must manually  scroll through digital images to identify the record of the particular firearm  in question.", "The technological changes represented by OBRIS do not compel a  different conclusion regarding ATF\u2019s compliance with the restriction on  consolidation or centralization from the one we reached in 1996 with  respect to the predecessor system. The statutory basis for OBRIS is the  same as for the Microfilm Retrieval System and OBRIS makes records  accessible to the same extent as that system, functioning in essentially  the same manner though with enhanced technology. As with the prior  microfilm system, users identify potentially relevant individual records  through manual review after searching an index using an FFL number, or  firearms information if available.

A2K provides manufacturer, importer, and wholesaler FFLs  with an automated alternative to facilitate their statutorily required  response to ATF requests. he conferees are aware that the Access 2000 program was initiated by ATF to improve  the efficiency and reduce the costs associated with firearms tracing incurred by Federal  Firearms Licensees (FFLs). ATF and FFL importers, manufacturers, and wholesalers form  a partnership in this effort. FFLs take their data from their mainframe computer and import  it into a stand-alone server provided by the ATF. The National Tracing Center is  connected to this server remotely by secure dial-up and obtains information on a firearm  that is subject to a firearms trace.

We agree. Given  the statutory underpinning and features of the system for in-business  FFLs, we conclude that ATF\u2019s use of A2K for in-business records does  not violate the restriction on the consolidation or centralization of firearms  records. ATF\u2019s use of A2K for in-business records is rooted in the specific  statutory requirement that FFLs respond promptly to ATF trace requests  in connection with criminal investigations. In addition, although the system  allows FFLs to respond to ATF\u2019s trace requests virtually, ATF obtains the  same information as it would otherwise obtain by phone, fax, or e-mail  and in similar disaggregated form, that is, through multiple servers  located at individual FFLs. Moreover, industry members retain possession  and control of their disposition records and, according to ATF officials,  may withdraw from using A2K\u2014and remove their records from the ATF- accessible servers\u2014at any time.

Specifically, when an A2K  participant went out of business, an ATF contractor remotely transferred  the data on the server to a backup disk and the industry member shipped  the backup disk with intact disposition records, as well as the blank  server, to ATF\u2019s NTC. ATF officials placed the data from the backup disk  on a single partitioned server at NTC and accessed the data for firearms  traces using the same type of interface and URL as used while the  industry member was in business. As a result, in response to an industry  member\u2013specific query using an exact firearm serial number, the A2K  out-of-business server would automatically generate the disposition  information related to that firearm serial number.", "According to ATF, records of eight industry members were placed on the  server at NTC from as early as late 2000 through mid-2012. While ATF  estimated that there were approximately 20 million records associated  with these industry members on the server, the agency did not have a  means of ascertaining the actual number of records. The number of  records on the ATF server would have been expected to grow as  additional A2K participants discontinued their operations and provided  their backup disks to ATF. However, during the course of our review, ATF  officials told us that the agency planned to move all of the A2K records  into OBRIS and that, once converted to OBRIS images, the records  would be searchable like other OBRIS records. In January 2016, ATF  officials reported that NTC was in the process of transferring all of the  records from the A2K out-of-business records server to OBRIS and a  quality-control process was under way to verify the accuracy of the  transfer. They subsequently deleted all records from the server in March  2016.", "We conclude that ATF\u2019s use of A2K with respect to out-of-business  records violated the restriction on consolidation or centralization. In  contrast to the discrete servers in the possession of the in-business  industry members, ATF combined disposition records across industry  members on the single, though partitioned, A2K server at NTC. In  addition, the records were stored on the single A2K server in a manner  that made them more easily searchable than other out-of-business  records. Unlike OBRIS, which requires the manual review of potentially  relevant records identified through an index, the A2K server within NTC  generated records automatically in response to an industry member\u2013 specific text query, that is, exact firearm serial number. In addition,  according to NTC officials, they could have modified the structure of the  NTC server to achieve further aggregation, by programming the system to  allow text searches across a broader set of data fields. As a result, ATF  could have searched for records by name or other personal identifier.", "As explained earlier, our analysis of ATF\u2019s aggregation of firearms  records turns not on the presence or absence of retail purchaser  information, but rather on the extent to which the aggregation of data  corresponds to a statutory purpose. ATF\u2019s maintenance of out-of- business industry members\u2019 disposition records on a single server at NTC  was not incident to the implementation of a specific statutory requirement.  As discussed above, A2K was designed to allow in-business industry  members to respond promptly to ATF trace requests as required by 18  U.S.C. \u00a7 923(g)(7) without having to dedicate personnel to this function.  Section 923(g)(7), however, has no applicability to FFLs once they  discontinue operations. A separate statutory provision, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7  923(g)(4), applies to FFLs that permanently discontinue their operations.  ATF has long maintained a separate system\u2014formerly the Microfilm  Retrieval System and currently OBRIS\u2014to hold the records submitted  under that provision, and the disposition records that ATF maintained on  the NTC server were among the types of records required to be submitted  under section 923(g)(4) for which ATF had created that system.  Therefore, we find no statutory underpinning for ATF\u2019s maintenance of  out-of-business A2K participants\u2019 disposition records on the server at  NTC.", "Our implementation of A2K included strict security protocols to limit ATF access to only  that information to which it is statutorily required, e.g., the next step in the distribution of  the traced firearm. That is, ATF would simply have access to the same information it could  obtain by calling the participating FFL. However, that calculus is altered when an FFL  ceases participation in A2K. At that point, that FFL\u2019s records become just like any other  FFL records and, as such, must be stored in the same manner. Otherwise, records which  were formerly accessible on a discrete basis under A2K would be readily accessible in a  database which would, in our opinion based on the 1996 GAO Report, violate the  appropriation rider. Our decision, therefore, was to ensure that A2K records have the  same character and are retrievable in the same manner as any other out-of-business  records.", "In addition to removing all data from the A2K out-of-business records  server, ATF officials reported that, going forward, the agency plans to  convert records of A2K participants that go out of business directly into  OBRIS images. However, they said, when such records are received by  out-of-business FFLs, the time frame for converting the records into  OBRIS images will depend on the backlog of electronic records awaiting  conversion.", "Similarly, ATF officials told us that they had anticipated that A2K  participants would submit acquisition and disposition records together,  consistent with the format provided for in ATF\u2019s regulations, for inclusion  in OBRIS. They had not expected that A2K participants would satisfy any  part of their statutory responsibility by providing their backup disks to the  agency. However, even if industry members\u2019 submission of disposition  data on the backup disks could be said to be in furtherance of the portion  of the statutory requirement pertaining to disposition records, given the  existence and successful functioning of OBRIS, we conclude that ATF\u2019s  maintenance of those records on the NTC server went beyond the  purposes of the Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended.", "We conclude that FRNP complies with the restriction on consolidation  and centralization of firearms records when used as a tool for ATF agents  in connection with an ATF criminal investigation.

FRNP, formerly known as the Suspect Gun  Program, was established in 1991 within the Firearms Tracing System to  provide an investigative service to ATF agents conducting criminal  investigations.

Further, ATF requires its agents to identify with specificity the  firearms relevant to the investigation. As we observed in 1996, the  restriction on consolidation or centralization does not preclude all data  systems that involve an element of consolidation.

We agree with the ATF Chief  Counsel\u2019s conclusion that its collection and maintenance of information in  connection with this program violated the restriction on the consolidation  or centralization of firearms records.", "In October 2005, the governments of the United States and Mexico  instituted a cooperative effort to address surging drug cartel\u2013driven  violence in Mexico and along the southwest border of the United States.  ATF\u2019s main role in this initiative was to develop strategies and programs  to stem the illegal trafficking of firearms from the United States to Mexico.  ATF determined that used gun sales\u2014referred to in the industry as  \u201csecondary market\u201d sales\u2014played a significant role in firearms trafficking  to Mexico, particularly for the types of firearms most sought by the  Mexican drug cartels, known as \u201cweapons of choice.\u201d Accordingly, in  June 2007, the agency developed a protocol to be used during its annual  inspections of FFLs in the region engaged primarily in the sale of used  firearms. This protocol, known as the SWBWOC Program was intended  to enhance ATF\u2019s ability to track secondary market sales. It called for ATF  investigators to record the serial number and description of all used  weapons of choice in each FFL\u2019s inventory and those sold or otherwise  disposed of during the period covered by the inspection. Under the  protocol, the investigators forwarded the information to the relevant ATF  field division, which opened a single investigative file for all submissions  from the area under its jurisdiction and determined whether any of the  weapons had been traced since their last retail sale. After review, the field  division forwarded the information to FRNP. According to ATF, the Dallas,  Houston, and Los Angeles Field Divisions began to submit records from  the SWBWOC Program to FRNP in July 2007, and the Phoenix Field  Division began to do so in October 2007.", "The SWBWOC Program was cancelled on October 2, 2009, following a  review by ATF\u2019s Office of Chief Counsel of the process by which the  secondary market weapons of choice information had been recorded and  submitted to FRNP.

It advised that information obtained from an FFL  about a firearm in and of itself and unaccompanied by purchaser  information could not be collected and consolidated absent a specific  basis in statute or regulation, or a direct nexus to discrete law  enforcement purposes such as a specific criminal investigation. The  Office of Chief Counsel found that the collection of information from FFLs  under the SWBWOC Program lacked these essential, individualized  characteristics.", "We agree with ATF\u2019s conclusion that the collection and maintenance of  firearms information from the SWBWOC Program in FRNP exceeded the  permissible scope of the appropriations act restriction. As discussed  above, our analysis of ATF\u2019s aggregation of firearms data turns not on the  presence or absence of retail purchaser information, but rather on the  extent to which the aggregation of data corresponds to a statutory  purpose. Here, ATF collected and maintained acquisition and disposition  data without a statutory foundation based on nothing more than the  characteristics of the firearms. The collection and maintenance of  information about a category of firearms, \u201cweapons of choice,\u201d from a  category of FFLs, primarily pawnbrokers, did not pertain to a specific  criminal investigation within the scope of ATF\u2019s statutory investigative  authority. Nor did it fall within the scope of ATF\u2019s authority to conduct  regulatory inspections.

Specifically, the Senate-passed version of  FOPA prohibited the Secretary of the Treasury from maintaining multiple  sales reports at a centralized location and from entering them into a  computer for storage or retrieval. This provision was not included in the  version of the bill that was ultimately passed. In light of the above, we  reach the same conclusion as we did in 1996 and find that ATF\u2019s use of  MS complies with the restriction on the consolidation or centralization of  firearms records.", "In addition, ATF has collected and maintained information on the multiple  sales of firearms under a separate authority, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 923(g)(5)(A).  Section 923(g)(5)(A) authorizes the Attorney General to require FFLs to  submit information that they are required to maintain under the Gun  Control Act of 1968, as amended. This provision was also included in  FOPA. Relying on this authority, ATF issues \u201cdemand letters\u201d requiring  FFLs to provide ATF with specific information. In 2011, ATF issued a  demand letter requiring certain FFLs in Arizona, California, New Mexico,  and Texas to submit reports of multiple sales or other dispositions of  particular types of semiautomatic rifles to non-FFLs (referred to as  \u201cDemand Letter 3\u201d reports).

According to  ATF, the information was intended to assist in its efforts to investigate and  combat the illegal movement of firearms along and across the southwest  border.", "Several FFLs challenged the legality of ATF\u2019s demand letter, asserting,  among other things, that it would create a national firearms registry in  violation of the fiscal year 2012 appropriations act restriction. In each of  the cases, the court placed ATF\u2019s initiative in its statutory context and  held that the appropriations act did not prohibit ATF\u2019s issuance of the  demand letter. Similar to our 1996 analyses of the Out-of-Business  Records and Multiple Sales Systems, the United States Court of Appeals  for the Fifth Circuit examined the enactment of ATF\u2019s authority to issue  demand letters in relation to the appropriations act restriction. The court  observed that ATF\u2019s demand letter authority was enacted as part of  FOPA and that because FOPA \u201cclearly contemplate ATF\u2019s collection of  some firearms records,\u201d the appropriations provision did not prohibit \u201cany  collection of firearms transaction records.\u201d In this regard, the court  further noted that the plain meaning of \u201cconsolidating or centralizing\u201d did  not prohibit the collection of a limited amount of information.", "Other courts also emphasized that the ATF 2011 demand letter required  FFLs to provide only a limited subset of the information that they were  required to maintain, as opposed to the substantial amount of information  that they believed would characterize a \u201cconsolidation or centralization.\u201d  For example, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit  enumerated the limitations on ATF\u2019s 2011 collection of information, noting  that it applied to (1) FFLs in four states; (2) who are licensed dealers and  pawnbrokers; (3) and who sell two or more rifles of a specific type; (4) to  the same person; (5) in a 5-business-day period. The court found that  because ATF sent the demand letter to a limited number of FFLs  nationwide and required information on only a small number of  transactions, \u201cthe . . . demand letter does not come close to creating a  \u2018national firearms registry.\u2019\u201d In light of the court decisions regarding  ATF\u2019s exercise of its statutory authority in this context, we conclude that  the Demand Letter 3 initiative does not violate the restriction on the  consolidation or centralization of firearms records."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Two of the data systems under review, OBRIS and MS, comply with the  provision in ATF\u2019s fiscal year 2012 appropriation prohibiting the use of  funds for the consolidation or centralization of firearms records. ATF  collects and maintains firearms transaction information in each system  incident to the implementation of specific statutory authority and it does  not exceed those statutory purposes. ATF\u2019s A2K system for in-business  FFLs and its maintenance of certain firearms information pertinent to  criminal investigations in FRNP are likewise consistent with the  appropriations act restriction. However, ATF\u2019s collection and maintenance  of out-of-business A2K records on the server at NTC violated the  restriction, as did its collection and maintenance of data from certain FFLs  as part of the SWBWOC Program. In both cases, ATF\u2019s aggregation of  information was not supported by any statutory purpose.", "ATF\u2019s failure to comply with the prohibition on the consolidation or  centralization of firearms records also violated the Antideficiency Act.  The Antideficiency Act prohibits making or authorizing an expenditure or  obligation that exceeds available budget authority. As a result of the  statutory prohibition, ATF had no appropriation available for the salaries  or administrative expenses of consolidating or centralizing records, or  portions of records, of the acquisition and disposition of firearms in  connection with the SWBWOC Program or A2K for out-of-business  records. The Antideficiency Act requires that the agency head \u201cshall  report immediately to the President and Congress all relevant facts and a  statement of actions taken.\u201d In addition, the agency must send a copy of  the report to the Comptroller General on the same date it transmits the  report to the President and Congress."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Dawn Locke (Assistant Director)  and Rebecca Kuhlmann Taylor (Analyst-in-Charge) managed this work.
