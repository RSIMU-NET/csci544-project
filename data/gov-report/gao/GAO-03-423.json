Even with the small amount of expenditures and workload associated with partnerships, some partnerships that GAO reviewed either improved some aspects of repair performance or showed potential for doing so. On the other hand, 19 partnerships have generated no work thus far. DOD and contractor officials have identified 14 characteristics that they believe over time will contribute to a partnership's success in achieving DOD's objective of improved depot efficiency and viability. However, DOD has a limited ability to measure the overall success of its partnering efforts because it has not yet developed measurable goals for the expected outcomes of the effort and the metrics that it has developed sometimes will not provide the data needed to fully assess the partnerships. Without initially establishing clear, measurable goals to define success in improving the efficiency and viability of its depots and metrics that provide the relevant data for the measurement, DOD has limited objective means to assess whether the partnerships are working as intended. Furthermore, DOD faces challenges in its efforts to expand its use of public-private partnerships. For example, opportunities available for DOD to expand its use of these partnerships may be limited by external factors that the services cannot replicate or create at will, such as one-time business opportunities. Also, while DOD is expecting private sector funding to support the establishment of capability for depot partnerships for new systems, the amount of private-sector investment to date is only $6.9 million, and the extent to which the private-sector will make additional investments is uncertain."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For the past several years, the Department of Defense (DOD) and the  Congress have encouraged the defense logistics support community to  pursue partnerships with the private sector.

They also stated that while the characteristics are not  currently present in all partnerships, over time, more partnerships will  evolve to include these characteristics. The officials agreed that the  characteristic of having long-term commitment should permit both  contractors and depots to better plan future workload requirements and  create a better business case for the contractor to make investments to  improve depot repair capability. The officials agreed that the characteristic  of sharing the same partnership vision and objective helps ensure that the  partners will not be working at cross-purposes. Additionally, these officials  pointed out that another of the characteristics\u2014having the right metrics\u2014 is critical to develop early in a partnership.

However, these  metrics are not tied to overarching goals for DOD\u2019s partnership initiative.  Consequently, DOD does not have a clear means for assessing the  accomplishments of its individual partnerships toward meeting its  overarching objective and therefore risks not achieving the improvements  to depot operations expected from public-private partnership efforts. For  example, investments made by the private sector in military depots to date  have been about $6.9 million in total at all DOD depots.

This is because some partnerships coincide  with changes to a weapon system program (such as adopting a new repair  approach) that may cloud the service\u2019s ability to measure whether the  partnership is responsible for any of the measured impacts. For example,  metrics for the Army\u2019s T700 helicopter engine partnership will measure  changes in an engine\u2019s reliability. However, the Army began a  recapitalization effort shortly after the start of the partnership, and  according to a program management official, the recapitalization effort will  affect the reliability of the metrics.

DOD does plan to greatly expand the use of  public-private partnerships to help achieve the partnership initiative\u2019s  objective of improving the efficiency and viability of its military depots.  However, it has neither established a baseline regarding depots\u2019 efficiency  and viability for where they are today nor developed measurable goals for  expected outcomes to define the degree of the improved depot efficiency  and viability desired. Additionally, the metrics that DOD has developed will  not, in certain circumstances, provide the relevant data needed to assess  individual partnership results. Without initially establishing both clear and  measurable goals to define success in improving the efficiency and viability  of its depots and the metrics that provide the relevant data for the  measurement, DOD has limited objective means to assess whether the  partnerships are working as intended. Furthermore, while DOD is  expecting private-sector investment in public depots to support the  creation of capability to support new systems the extent to which this  investment is likely to occur is uncertain. Absent additional planning, this  situation could result in capability shortfalls or lead to delays in  establishing needed capabilities.", "To improve DOD\u2019s management, direction, potential for success, and  assessment of its public-private partnerships, we provided DOD with a  number of recommendations in a draft of this report. In commenting on the  draft, DOD indicated that it does not plan to implement our  recommendations because it found them to be too general and thus not  actionable. However, the department\u2019s reluctance to establish overall goals  for partnerships makes it unclear as to the overall role that DOD envisions  for partnerships in its depots\u2014even though DOD\u2019s focus on partnering was  intended as one means of fostering improvements in government owned  and operated depot facilities. We have long reported on weaknesses in  DOD\u2019s processes for identifying core capabilities to be accomplished in  government-owned depot maintenance facilities, continuing deterioration  in depot facilities with inadequate recapitalization plans, and a smaller but  aging workforce with inadequate human capital plans in place to preserve  depot capabilities for the future. Such conditions place at risk the role of  these facilities in ensuring the existence of a ready and controlled source of  in-house technical competence and resources so that the military can  respond to mobilizations, national defense emergencies, and  contingencies. Clear goals for partnership arrangements are important if  they are expected to play a role in improving depot operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the management, direction, potential for success, and  assessment of its public-private partnerships, we recommend that the  Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics to  establish baseline data and overarching goals for expected outcomes of  partnership efforts, including the partnership initiative\u2019s desired  improvements to depot operations and  develop or refine metrics as needed to provide a more complete basis to  assess the results of the depot partnering arrangements as well as  ensuring that they differentiate between improvements to a weapon  system\u2019s support resulting from partnering and from other factors or  changes affecting the weapon system.", "To support the expansion of partnership arrangements for new systems, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense require the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics  to require specific assessment and planning for new capability in  military depots where partnership arrangements for new systems are  expected and  as part of this planning, assess the likelihood of private-sector  investment in new systems capability in military depots and other  alternatives as needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["To encourage the Department of Defense to more clearly identify its  long-term goals for its depot facilities and the role of public-private  partnerships in meeting those goals, the Congress should consider  requiring DOD to develop measurable goals for improving future  operations of its depot facilities to include (1) facilities recapitalization,  (2) retention of specific depot capabilities, and (3) human capital plans for  preserving a viable workforce. In doing so, the Congress should also  consider requiring DOD to establish time frames against which it will  periodically assess and report to the Congress on progress in each of  these areas, including the contribution of partnering arrangements to  those goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, the Deputy Under Secretary of  Defense for Logistics and Material Readiness agreed with the report\u2019s  information, analysis and conclusions but only partially concurred with the  report\u2019s recommendations. Overall, he expressed the view that the  recommendations were so generally drawn that they are not actionable as a  practical matter. We disagree and continue to believe that they are needed  actions. The department\u2019s comments are included in this report in  appendix VI.", "With regard to our first recommendation to establish baseline data and  overarching goals for expected outcomes of partnerships, DOD stated that  it has already established baseline data and goals. However, these baselines  and goals relate to individual partnerships rather than to the partnership  program as a whole. We agree that baseline data and goals are needed to  measure the progress of individual partnership initiatives; however, our  intent was to have the department establish overarching goals with  measurable outcomes to help gauge the success of DOD\u2019s overall  partnership initiative toward strengthening DOD\u2019s depot maintenance  operations. Such goals would be key to measuring progress toward  achieving the expectation identified in DOD\u2019s partnership policy  memorandum, which was to have partnerships \u201ccontribute to more  effective depot maintenance operations, the introduction of innovative  processes or technologies, and the economical sustainment of organic  capabilities.\u201d We do not agree that the goals stated in the policy  memorandum in and of themselves are specific enough to provide  measurable outcomes against which to assess the collective effectiveness  of the department\u2019s efforts to improve depot efficiency and viability.", "Regarding our second recommendation to develop or refine metrics as  needed to provide a more complete basis to assess the results of depot  partnering arrangements, DOD said it will be difficult, if not impossible, to  differentiate between improvements solely resulting from partnering  versus other factors. While we agree that it may be difficult, we nonetheless  believe that it will be critical in assessing the department\u2019s partnering  initiative. Unless the department develops meaningful metrics that  reasonably determine relative contributions of various factors contributing  to changed conditions in weapon system support, it will not be in a position  to determine the results of ongoing partnerships and the conditions under  which additional partnerships should be undertaken.", "Regarding our third recommendation to require specific assessment and  planning for new capability in military depots where partnership  arrangements for new systems are expected, the department stated that it  currently requires assessment and planning for new weapon systems but  agreed that more emphasis could be placed on determining the role that  public-private partnerships may play in establishing new depot capabilities.  However, it did not identify any specific action planned to do so\u2014we  believe it is important for the department to identify steps to be taken to  give this increased emphasis.", "Regarding our fourth recommendation to assess as part of planning, the  likelihood of private-sector investment in new systems capability in  military depots, the department stated that capital investment by the  private sector across the broad spectrum is unrealistic, stating that it was  never the department\u2019s intention for its public-private partnership program  to supplant the need for capital investment and funding by the services. We  did not intend to suggest that partnerships supplant service funding but  rather give visibility to a goal established by the department in its public- private partnership policy memorandum, which states that one objective of  public-private partnerships is \u201cleveraging private-sector investments such  as facilitates and equipment to contribute to re-capitalization of depot  maintenance activities.\u201d We continue to believe that the assessment called  for in our recommendation is important both to help assess the  contribution of partnerships in achieving this partnering objective as well  as to more clearly assess capital investment needs from other sources.", "Finally, we disagree with the department\u2019s statement that our  recommendations are not actionable as a practical matter. A key element  needed for the department to achieve its objective of more effective  military depot maintenance operations through public-private partnerships  is the ability to measure and assess the contribution of partnerships toward  meeting that objective. As a practical matter, without establishing clear and measurable goals for its partnering program, the department is limited in  its ability to assess whether the partnerships are working as intended to  produce positive results or, conversely, are having a negative effect on  military depot maintenance operations.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Secretaries of the Army,  the Navy, and the Air Force; the Commandant of the Marine Corps; and the  Director, Office of Management and Budget.

We also reviewed partnership data  maintained in the Joint Depot Maintenance Activities Group partnering  database. We visited 14 of DOD\u2019s 20 major military depots (see appendix II  for the depots visited and the partnerships reviewed) to examine in more  depth the partnerships associated with these depots. We selected depots  that had the greatest volume of partnership activity, also ensuring that we  included each service. Of the six depots we did not visit, four did not have  any partnerships reported in the Joint Depot Maintenance Activities Group  partnering database\u2014the Marine Corps Maintenance Center Barstow,  Barstow, California; the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division,  Crane, Indiana; the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Keyport Division,  Keyport, Washington; and the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration  Center, Tucson, Arizona\u2014the other two depots\u2014Pearl Harbor Naval  Shipyard and Letterkenny Army Depot\u2014reported two partnerships and  one partnership, respectively. We did not assess why these sites had this  low volume of partnership activity. To collect information on the  partnerships we reviewed, we developed a data collection instrument for  each depot to complete for each partnership. The information collected on  each partnership included the type of partnership, reasons why the  partnership was formed, roles and responsibilities of each partner, and the  legislative authority or basis for the partnership. We did not, however,  validate the data provided by the depots or attempt to assess whether or  not the tasks and responsibilities assumed by the contractor and military  depot partners represented the best division of work for achieving success  within the partnership.", "To calculate the growth in public-private partnerships, we used our 1998  work reviewing the use of public-private partnerships in DOD as a baseline,  tallied the number of partnerships by service, and compared these numbers  with the partnerships reported in the Joint Depot Maintenance Activities  Group partnering database as of December 4, 2002. To determine the  relative size or scale of the partnership efforts within DOD, we analyzed  fiscal year 2002 data on (1) the workload that each partnership brought to  the each depot compared with the total ongoing workload for each depot,  (2) the total workload that the partnerships brought to the depots  compared to the total combined workload for all depots visited, and (3) the  total dollar value of depot maintenance performed under the partnerships  at the depots we visited compared with the department\u2019s total depot  maintenance expenditures.", "To determine the characteristics that need to be present to achieve  effective partnerships and where DOD is in its ability to measure success,  we met with OSD logistics officials, service logistics officials, high-level  contractor officials, and officials at each depot visited. We discussed  evaluating the effectiveness of ongoing partnerships\u2014measuring success  against DOD\u2019s objective of improved depot efficiency and viability\u2014with  these officials and collected relevant data and also discussed the  characteristics of successful partnerships with the senior-level DOD and  contractor officials. To identify the characteristics of successful  partnerships, we reviewed the information collected through structured  interviews with senior-level DOD and contractor officials and grouped the  characteristics into categories based on the similarities of responses. We  also discussed the extent to which depot partnership managers expect  these characteristics to be present in current partnerships or will be  present in future partnerships. To determine whether DOD has developed a  sufficient framework for measuring success, we reviewed the metrics that  DOD has developed to gauge the performance of its partnerships and  assessed whether these metrics included measurable goals and outcomes  tying the partnerships\u2019 performance to DOD\u2019s public-private partnership  policy objective. We also assessed the relevance of the department\u2019s  metrics to DOD\u2019s public-private partnership policy objective. We did not  test or validate the accuracy of the reported performance data related to  the public-private partnerships but instead considered the structure of the  metrics to assess their relevance to DOD\u2019s partnership policy objective. To  analyze the sufficiency of data for evaluating the extent to which  partnerships improved the economy and efficiency of depot operations and  improved the viability of the depots, we compared the relative volume of  each depot\u2019s partnership workload with the ongoing workload at each  depot visited and assessed the age of the partnerships to determine if  enough data existed to make an evaluation. To determine the amount of  investments made by the private sector in military-depot plant and  equipment, we extracted information from a database on partnerships  developed by the Joint Depot Maintenance Activities Group at OSD\u2019s  request. We also used this database to identify the expected annual value of  depot work for each partnership and presented this data in appendix II.  When no annual estimate was identified in the database, we calculated an  annual work value by dividing the total expected value for the partnership  by the expected partnership life, where possible. In those instances where  this was not possible, we presented the total revenue generated by the  partnership to date. We did not perform a reliability assessment on this  Joint Depot Maintenance Activities Group database. Through discussions  with depot officials and reviews of individual partnerships, we identified  instances where the partnering efforts produced promising outcomes as  related to DOD\u2019s objective of improved depot efficiency and viability.", "To determine what future management challenges face DOD\u2019s planned  expansion of public-private partnerships, we relied on our discussions with  OSD logistics officials, service logistics officials, high-level contractor  officials, and officials at each depot visited to identify challenges that may  inhibit the department\u2019s expansion efforts. To assess the potential impact  of proposed legislative changes on limiting DOD\u2019s planned expansion of  public-private partnerships, we discussed the impact of removing title 10  provisions that currently limit the outsourcing of military depot  maintenance and repair workload with OSD maintenance policy officials,  depot officials, and contractor officials and discussed how these title 10  provisions affect contractors\u2019 and military depots\u2019 decisions to form public- private partnerships. To assess whether the opportunities for partnering  are limited, we reviewed the reasons why ongoing partnerships developed  and then discussed with these officials the services\u2019 ability to control or  create opportunities that can lead to successful partnerships. We also  discussed the relationship between the expansion of public-private  partnerships and DOD\u2019s implementation of performance-based logistics  with OSD officials and reviewed the services\u2019 performance-based logistics  implementation plans. To assess the potential impact of DOD\u2019s new policy  calling for private-sector investment in depots on establishing and funding  needed depot capabilities, we reviewed and compared the new public- private partnership policy with DOD\u2019s overarching acquisition policy, and  discussed the partnering policy\u2019s implementation with depot and OSD  officials.", "We conducted our review from February 2002 through February 2003 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Depot Maintenance Public-Private Partnerships Reviewed and Depots Visited", "paragraphs": ["Contractor sought  out depot for its  unique capabilities  and advantageous  labor rates. $2 million Direct sale/government-furnished  resources\u2014Depot performs  finishing operations, paints the  vehicle and provides production  services.

Depending on the specific circumstances surrounding  the work to be performed, the services used various arrangements\u2014such  as work share and teaming\u2014to form their partnerships. Although the  partnerships involve many logistics functions performed in various  combinations by both public- and private-sector partners, in general,  contractors perform more spare parts, engineering, and technical data  functions, while the military depots provide more repair labor, facilities,  and equipment.", "Reasons for Partnering Partnerships between military depots and contractors were formed for a  variety of reasons. Service depot officials identified nine reasons for  entering into partnerships as indicated in figure 3.", "In some instances, a combination of these reasons motivated the parties to  form a partnership. As shown by figure 3, the largest category involved  contractors seeking out a depot for its unique capabilities\u201457 times for the  partnerships we reviewed. Other reasons frequently cited were contractors  seeking out a depot for its advantageous labor rates\u201413 times, program  mangers directing work share arrangements\u201412 times, and meeting title  10 requirements that limit the outsourcing of depot maintenance\u201410  times. As discussed in the body of the report, DOD expects these title 10  requirements to increasingly become an important driver to expanding  partnerships as the department increases contractors\u2019 involvement in  logistics support for weapon systems because the contractors will often be  required to partner with depots in order to satisfy title 10 provisions that  limit the outsourcing of depot workload."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Partnership Approaches Used Vary", "paragraphs": ["The reasons for partnering discussed above and the circumstances  surrounding a depot\u2019s workload shape how the services develop the  approach used for each of their partnerships, including the selection of a  partnership type and how they divide responsibilities for the performance  of logistics functions. The depot maintenance partnerships we reviewed  used one or a combination of five partnering approaches: work share,  direct sale, lease, government-furnished resources, and teaming. Figure 4  illustrates how frequently the five partnership types were used for the  partnerships we reviewed.", "As indicated by figure 4, \u201cdirect sale\u201d was the most frequently used  approach. According to DOD officials, that approach is expected to  increase in number with the expansion of contractor-managed logistics- support arrangements for weapon systems. The five public-private  partnership approaches are described below. 1. Direct sale. An arrangement whereby military and commercial entities  enter into a contractual relationship for the use of military depot  maintenance facilities and employees to provide the private sector with  articles and/or services. Forty-eight\u201453 percent\u2014of the 90  partnerships we reviewed used the direct sale approach, making it the  most frequently used partnering arrangement. DOD expects the use of  direct sale arrangements to increase as DOD expands contractor  involvement in logistics support for weapon systems in order to comply  with title 10 provisions that limit the outsourcing of depot maintenance.  The Navy\u2019s F-18 Integrated Readiness Support Team and the Air Force\u2019s  B-2 Advanced Composite partnerships are examples of the direct sale  approach to partnering. These examples each involve one partner\u2014the  depot\u2014performing work directly for, and receiving payment from, the  other partner\u2014the contractor. (See appendix II for more detail on these  and other partnerships.) 2. Work share. An arrangement whereby a combination of military and  commercial facilities and/or employees is used to execute a program  manager\u2019s work package\u2014including tasks such as weapon systems  remanufacture, modification, or upgrade. Under the work share  arrangement, the program manager issues a work order to the military  participant and a contract to the private-sector participant. The  relationship between the participants to accomplish the work package  is usually coordinated with a memorandum of understanding or  memorandum of agreement instead of a contract. Twenty-six\u201429  percent\u2014of the 90 partnerships we reviewed used the work share  approach, and this approach was typically used to form the services\u2019  larger partnerships. The Army\u2019s M1/M1A2 Abrams Tank upgrade  partnership and the Navy\u2019s Harrier Aircraft remanufacturing  partnership are examples of work shares. These examples involve each  partner\u2019s performing its designated share of the workload directly for  the weapon system\u2019s program office and the paying of each partner by  the program manager. 3. Teaming. An arrangement whereby military and commercial entities  enter into a contractual relationship to accomplish a deliverable  stipulated in a contract. The relationship between the participants is  usually initially outlined in a teaming agreement during the proposal\u2019s  preparation and then formalized as a contractor/subcontractor  relationship subsequent to contract award. Twenty-seven\u2014or 30  percent\u2014of the 90 partnerships we reviewed used the teaming  approach. Most of the teaming arrangements occurred in the Army\u2014 19, with the Navy using the teaming approach for six of its partnerships  and the Air Force using teaming for two of its partnerships. 4. Lease. An arrangement whereby military and commercial entities enter  into a contractual relationship for the private sector\u2019s use of public  depot maintenance facilities and/or its equipment to perform work for  either the public or private sector. Twelve\u201413 percent\u2014of the 90  partnerships we reviewed used the lease approach, often in  conjunction with other partnering approaches. For example, the  upgrade partnership for the Army\u2019s Fox Nuclear, Biological, Chemical  Reconnaissance System vehicle uses a lease arrangement in  conjunction with a direct sale arrangement. The lease portion of the  Fox partnership involves the depot\u2019s providing underutilized facilities  at Anniston Army Depot and the contractor\u2019s paying for facility upkeep  and utilities. The Air Force\u2019s partnership for the F100 aircraft engine  special technologies coating facility is an example of a stand-alone  lease arrangement not involving other partnering arrangements. In this  example, the Air Force\u2019s Oklahoma City depot provides underutilized  facilities, while the contractor pays the depot for the use of the  facilities, provides facility upkeep, and pays utilities. 5. Government-furnished resources. An arrangement whereby military  and commercial entities enter into an agreement for private-sector use  of public depot maintenance facilities and/or its equipment and  employees at no cost in connection with and under the terms of a  contract. Nine\u201410 percent\u2014of the 90 partnerships we reviewed used  the government-furnished resources approach, which was also often  used in conjunction with other partnering approaches. The Air Force\u2019s  F-16 block 40 avionics software maintenance/upgrade and the Navy\u2019s  Puget Sound railway partnerships are examples of the government- furnished resources approach to partnering. Under the F-16  partnership, the government performs F-16 component software  maintenance tasks for the contractor without charge as a government- furnished resource, while the contractor performs final software  integration. In the railway partnership, the government provides the  contractor with access to a Navy-owned railway in exchange for the  contractor\u2019s performing normal maintenance on the railway.", "According to DOD and contractor officials, the type of partnership selected  is based on what approach or combination of approaches best served the  objectives of the partnership. For example, in the case of the Army\u2019s Fox  vehicle upgrade partnership, the Army contracted with General Dynamics  to upgrade its Fox vehicle. To improve the economy and efficiency of the  upgrade, the contractor elected to partner with the Army\u2019s Anniston depot  for a portion of the work and to colocate its segment of the upgrade with  Anniston\u2019s segment at the Anniston depot. Consequently, the contractor\u2019s  approach used a combination of two partnership types\u2014direct sale  and lease."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Functions Performed Vary between Public- and Private-Sector Partners", "paragraphs": ["Depot maintenance involves not only the application of labor to repair and  maintain military equipment but also several other logistics elements or  functions such as supply support, production engineering, facilities, and  equipment. For the partnerships we reviewed, these logistics elements or  functions were performed or provided by both public- and private-sector  partners in various combinations on the basis of the characteristics of the  workload and the abilities of the partners. In the case of the Navy\u2019s  auxiliary power unit repair effort, for example, the depot was repairing  power units but did not have all the spare parts needed to complete repairs  in a timely manner. To improve the availability of overhauled power units,  the Navy awarded a contract for the power unit program\u2019s overall system  support and performance. As a condition of the contract, the contractor  partnered with a Navy depot to perform depot repairs to comply with title  10 requirements that limit the outsourcing of depot maintenance. The  partnership that developed for this workload involved the depot\u2019s providing  labor, facilities, and equipment, while the contractor provides technical  data and spare parts. Figure 5 compares the frequency with which logistics  functions are performed by depots and contractors for the partnerships we  reviewed. As indicated by figure 5, the contractors\u2019 contribution to the  partnerships consisted of performing or providing more of the spare parts,  engineering, and technical data functions than the other functions; and the  depots\u2019 contribution to partnerships consisted more of providing repair  labor, facilities, and equipment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Examples of Partnerships That Are Achieving Positive Results", "paragraphs": ["Some partnerships provide promising results or good potential for results  related to improvements in parts availability, reduced repair time, reduced  back orders, or reduced support costs. These improvements align with  some of the partnership approaches included as a part of DOD\u2019s logistics  reengineering initiative\u2014more efficient business processes, better facility  utilization, workforce integration, and reduced cost of ownership\u2014and  may therefore contribute to enhancing depot efficiency and viability. The  following examples provide illustrations of some of the improvements the  partnerships achieved: T700 Engine. Corpus Christi Army Depot wanted to reduce the repair time  and improve reliability for the Army\u2019s T700 helicopter engine.  Consequently, it entered into a partnership with General Electric to achieve  these improvements. (See fig. 6 on p. 53.) Under the partnership, Corpus  Christi provides the needed facilities and equipment and repairs the engine.  General Electric provides spare parts, and technical, engineering, and  logistics services. According to depot officials, this effort has resulted in  the introduction of General Electric\u2019s best practices at the depot, which in  turn has resulted in the T700 engine repair line\u2019s realizing a 26 percent  reduction in engine turnaround time and a 40 percent increase in test cell  pass rates. Depot and contractor officials both attribute the T700 engine\u2019s  improved depot repair times to better parts availability and improvements  to the depot\u2019s repair processes, although they also recognize that the  related T700 recapitalization effort begun shortly after the formation of the  partnership may also be a factor influencing these improvements.", "Auxiliary Power Unit. Cherry Point Naval Aviation Depot was repairing  auxiliary power units for four aircraft but was experiencing production  delays owing to poor spare parts support. To improve the availability of  overhauled power units, the depot formed a partnership with Honeywell\u2014 the auxiliary power units\u2019 manufacturer. (See fig. 7 on p. 54.) Under the  partnership, the depot provides labor, facilities, and equipment, while the  contractor provides production engineering and spare parts. According to  depot officials, the number of units\u2019 awaiting depot repair because of lack  of parts went from 118 when the partnership began in July 2000 to zero in  October 2002. According to the auxiliary power units users in the fleets, the  resulting improvement in support has been outstanding. For example, the  back orders for the power units were reduced from 125 in July 2000 to 26 in  October 2002. Depot officials attribute these improvements to better parts  support and the introduction of more efficient business practices to the  repair process that include replacing rather than repairing worn  components.", "USS Enterprise. Northrop Grumman Newport News shipyard was  scheduled to overhaul the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Enterprise  in fiscal year 2002 but lacked the necessary capacity at its facility to  perform the work as scheduled. (See fig. 8 on p. 55.) Consequently,  Northrop Grumman formed a partnership with the Navy wherein the  Norfolk Naval Shipyard provided drydock space and the Navy\u2019s four  shipyards provided 108,000 man-days of labor to augment Northrop  Grumman\u2019s overhaul of the aircraft carrier, which resulted in the overhaul\u2019s  completion as scheduled. Northrop Grumman retained overall  responsibility for the overhaul and also contributed labor, equipment,  production engineering, and technical data. According to shipyard officials,  this partnership allowed the contractor and the shipyards to share their  labor resources, which along with the drydock space, increased the  Navy\u2019s maintenance ability and therefore increased its production,  making carriers available to the fleet sooner than would otherwise have  been feasible.", "AGT1500 Recuperator. The Abrams Tank Recuperator production was  formerly located at the Army\u2019s Stratford Engine Plant in Connecticut,  which was closed by BRAC in 1995. Honeywell relocated the capability to  Anniston Army Depot in 1998 and entered a partnership with the depot at  that time. (See fig. 9 on p. 57.) According to depot officials, this partnership  is an example of a \u201cpure\u201d facility lease arrangement in which production  has been colocated with its primary user\u2014Anniston\u2019s M1 tank engine  repair line. The production operation benefits from base operations  support provided by the depot. On-site production eliminates the need for a  parts manager at the depot. It also eliminates the need for the Defense  Logistics Agency to stock and issue recuperators, which means Anniston  avoids Defense Logistics Agency surcharges. The minimal supply chain  also reduces the need for raw material inventory and on-hand finished- goods inventory. Production is adjusted to meet customer demand on a  near \u201cjust-in-time\u201d basis. According to depot officials, these benefits  resulted from Honeywell\u2019s recuperator production operation\u2019s proximity to  the depot.", "LANTIRN Phase II. Lockheed Martin was under contract for the depot  maintenance and repair of the Air Force\u2019s LANTIRN system, but its  vendors were not providing timely turnaround on the repair of certain  LANTIRN components. To improve component support, Lockheed Martin  and the Air Force\u2019s Warner Robins depot negotiated a direct sale agreement  for the depot to repair various quantities of 155 LANTIRN components.  (See fig. 10 on p. 58.) According to Warner Robins officials, since the start  of partnership in August 2001, the depot\u2019s performance in repairing the  components has been very good. For example, the depot\u2019s average  component repair turnaround time of 18 days under the partnership is  much better than the average turnaround time of 93 days under Lockheed  Martin\u2019s prior vendors and also better than the negotiated turnaround time  of 45 days agreed to under the partnership. Depot officials attributed these  improvements to (1) Lockheed Martin\u2019s colocation at the depot, which  reduced the shipping time between Lockheed Martin and its vendors\u2014 some of which were overseas\u2014and (2) ongoing Warner Robins\u2019 operations  that historically were more efficient in the repair of the LANTIRN  components than were Lockheed Martin\u2019s prior vendors.", "ICBM Global Positioning System. As the Air Force\u2019s intercontinental  ballistic missile (ICBM) logistics integrator, TRW Inc. had a requirement to  arrange for the modification of ICBMs to add satellite global positioning  capability. (See fig. 11.) However, TRW\u2019s component manufacturing  subcontractor\u2019s estimate for the modification was too costly. To achieve the  required modification at less cost, TRW Inc. formed a partnership with the  Air Force\u2019s Ogden depot to replace the old tracking system with the  required global positioning system capability. Under the partnership,  Ogden provides the labor for the modification installation, while TRW Inc.  performs its integration and engineering support responsibilities. As a  result of the partnership, the depot estimates that the program will save  about $11 million in 4 years, thereby reducing the overall support cost of  ICBMs. According to depot officials, the savings will result from the depot\u2019s  ability to produce and install the guidance modification for less than the  original equipment manufacturer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fourteen Characteristics Identified by DOD and Contractor Officials Needed to Achieve Effective Partnerships", "paragraphs": ["DOD and contractor officials have identified 14 characteristics that they  believe over time will contribute to a partnership\u2019s success in achieving  DOD\u2019s objective of improved depot efficiency and viability. The following  describes these characteristics and provides examples of how some of the  partnerships we reviewed exhibited these characteristics. 1. Long-term relationship and commitment. A long-term relationship  and commitment (1) permits both contractors and depots to better plan  future workload requirements and create a better business case for the  contractor to make investments to improve depot repair capability and  (2) allows the contractor to help manage parts obsolescence. For  example, the F/A-18 partnership involves a long-term relationship  between the Navy and Boeing to provide logistics support for the F/A- 18E/F aircraft over the life cycle of the weapon system. Boeing and the  depots are projecting partnering workloads for the Navy depots for the  next 30 years, allowing the partners to create a phased plan to move  from providing maintenance and repair on limited aircraft components  to eventually encompass the entire weapon system. 2. Shared partnership vision and objectives. Having partners share the  same partnership vision and objectives helps ensure that the partners  will not be working at cross-purposes. The Navy ship depot  maintenance partnerships involving shipyard work and workforce  sharing\u2014USS Memphis, USS Enterprise, and USS John C. Stennis\u2014 exemplify this characteristic. With the downsizing of the Navy, a  corresponding decrease in the Navy and contractor shipyard  workforces occurred. To manage the resulting downsized workforces  and avoid the unnecessary duplication of skills, Navy and private  shipyard officials developed and implemented a workforce-sharing  initiative whereby shipyard workers are assigned to public or private  workloads depending on the skills needed to perform the work and the  Navy\u2019s ship maintenance priorities. The partners view the shipyards as  a shared resource that needs to be effectively managed in order to  provide the Navy with the needed overhaul capability and cost and  schedule performance while minimizing the collective workforce  requirements. 3. The right metrics and incentives. The right metrics and incentives are  needed to effectively measure that progress is being made and that the  partners are effectively motivated to achieve partnership goals and  objectives. For example, the prime reason why the Navy entered into  its auxiliary power unit partnership at its Cherry Point depot was the  shortage of power units within the fleets. To ensure that this problem  was addressed by the partnership, the metrics that the Navy uses to  evaluate the partners are the same metrics used to assess the quality of  auxiliary power unit support to the fleet\u2014e.g., depot turnaround-time,  testing acceptance rates, and system availability. 4. Early acquisition community involvement. Developing the  partnership with acquisition community involvement during the early  phases of a weapon system\u2019s acquisition helps to ensure that any  additional depot maintenance capability development needed is fully  planned and funded. The C-17 partnership efforts under way at Air  Force depots illustrate that not building the partnership concept into  the acquisition process early enough can lead to funding challenges.  Until the Air Force recently determined that a significant portion the  C-17 depot maintenance was core under 10 USC 2464 and would  involve a public-private partnership, the system acquisition strategy  was focused on contractor-provided depot maintenance. Consequently,  the acquisition community had not planned or budgeted for the  development of depot capability to support the currently planned  partnering efforts. The Air Force is exploring ways of dealing with the  potential shortfall. 5. Complementary skills and abilities. Each partner should bring  complementary skills and abilities to the partnership because if each  partner\u2019s capabilities are the same, the relationship may result in a  competitive and potentially adversarial relationship, not the  cooperative synergistic relationship hoped for in a partnership. The Air  Force\u2019s Low Altitude Navigation Targeting Infrared for Night  (LANTIRN) partnering approach provides an example in which each  partner brought complementary abilities to the effort. The contractor  managed the repair of the LANTIRN system but did not have the ability  within its supplier network to repair subcomponents in a timely  manner. The Air Force\u2019s Warner Robins depot already had an ongoing  repair line for these components and was able to easily supply the  contractor\u2019s requirements for maintaining the LANTIRN system. 6. Senior-level advocacy and support. DOD and contractor senior  management support for a partnership is necessary to ensure that the  effort receives the focus and resources needed to achieve success. The  Air Force\u2019s Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS)  partnership, for example, illustrates the value of this characteristic.  Senior Air Force and contractor leaders endorsed the partnership,  requiring their managers to be innovative in overcoming the obstacles  created by years of competitiveness and the associated tension. The  partners responded by putting the right people in place with the  mindset and leaderships skills necessary to make the partnership work. 7. Sound business case analysis. A comprehensive business case  analysis, including expected outcomes, should be conducted as part of  the decision process for entering a partnership to ensure a sound result  benefiting both the depot and the private-sector partners. The Air  Force\u2019s ICBM Automatic Test Systems partnership, for example, was  formed after the Air Force conducted an analysis to assess the cost- benefit of the effort. As a result, the Air Force documented its expected  savings of approximately $30 million over the 5-year partnership. 8. Mutual trust and shared risk. The partnership should be firmly  grounded in mutual trust, open communications, and balanced risk  among partners. For example, according to the business development  office at the Corpus Christi Army Depot, the T700 partnership involved  both parties\u2019 investing the necessary time to understand each other\u2019s  goals and develop a level of trust so that both parties were willing to  share risks in order to make their partnering effort successful. 9. Flexibility to change partnership scope. To ensure the ability to adapt  to changing circumstances or factors, the partnerships should have the  flexibility to change the partnership scope. The Air Force\u2019s F100  partnership illustrates this characteristic. For example, the partnership  currently involves two types of F100 workload\u2014the inspections of  selected engine components and engine testing\u2014but the partnership  agreement provides for adding additional F100 workloads and other  engine workloads. 10. Balanced workload. Workload should be balanced among the partners  to ensure meaningful involvement for each partner and ensure that one  partner does not receive only low-skilled work or no work at all. The  AV-8B Harrier Remanufacturing partnership demonstrates a balanced  division of workload among the partners. Both the depot and the  contractor were responsible for segments of the remanufacturing effort  that involved challenging tasks requiring highly skilled labor. For  example, the depot partner modified and rewired the aircraft wing and  rebuilt complex aircraft components, while the contractor built and  provided new aircraft components and then incorporated these  components along with the wing and components from the depot into  the remanufactured aircraft. The division of tasks helped each partner  maintain and improve its respective technical expertise. 11. Independent review and oversight. Independent review and oversight  provides an objective assessment of whether each partnership is  achieving the expected benefits and that each partner performs as  expected. Such a review also provides a basis for correcting or  redirecting partnership efforts if expectations are not being met. To this  end, OSD has begun a process to provide review and oversight of depot  maintenance partnering efforts throughout the department. For  example, OSD has directed its Joint Depot Maintenance Analysis  Group to collect and maintain data on the conduct and performance of  service partnerships. OSD plans to use these data to redirect and  improve partnering efforts toward achieving DOD\u2019s goals and objective. 12. Enforce partnership decisions and requirements. To ensure  successful partnering efforts, the partners\u2019 senior management must  provide a mechanism for enforcing compliance with partnership  decisions and requirements. The Air Force\u2019s JSTARS partnership effort,  for example, incorporates the partnership agreement and requirements  into the overarching system logistics support contract. According to  depot officials, the contract is the most effective means for compelling  partner compliance with partnership decisions and requirements. 13. Full coordination with all stakeholders. Public-private partnership  efforts should include steps to get feedback from all stakeholders on  planned efforts and adjust the partnering strategies to reflect the  legitimate concerns of these stakeholders. The Army\u2019s Multiple Launch  Rocket System Hoist Assembly partnership exemplifies full  coordination among the depot; the contractor; and the major  command\u2019s general counsel, business operations office, and acquisition  community. 14. Clearly documented objectives in partnering agreement. Once clear  mutual partnering objectives are determined, they should be  documented into a formal partnering agreement. For example, the  Army\u2019s Tobyhanna depot follows a standard procedure of documenting  all partnering arrangements with formal agreements. This  documentation typically includes a nondisclosure agreement, which  protects shared information that is proprietary or otherwise business  sensitive, and a partnering agreement that includes the partnership\u2019s  objectives, a statement of work to be performed, the partners\u2019 roles and  responsibilities, and other terms and conditions as needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Julia Denman, Larry Junek, Robert Malpass, M.
