First, regarding the inventory quantity input, GAO found that the services had not complied with DOD regulations requiring verification of each real property inventory record. Without the verifications, DOD lacked assurance that the model used accurate inventory quantities, and GAO's analysis identified inaccuracies in some quantities used by the model. Second, regarding the sustainment cost factor input, GAO identified issues concerning some cost factors used by the model. For example, an independent study reported that only 13 of 45 cost factors evaluated were deemed to be reasonably accurate and adequately supported. Until DOD improves the accuracy of these two inputs, the model's estimates of facility sustainment funding requirements will not be as reliable as possible. The military services have not met all of DOD's goals for funding facility sustainment and recapitalization at levels to prevent deterioration and ensure that facilities are restored and modernized. Service officials stated that they generally did not meet the sustainment funding goals because resources were limited and programs such as force modernization often had higher funding priority. Although the services achieved more success in meeting DOD's goal to fund recapitalization, funding remains an issue with the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force reporting recapitalization backlogs of over $50 billion at the end of fiscal year 2007. DOD has not taken actions to estimate and address its deferred facility sustainment requirements. In fiscal years 2005 through 2007, the services did not fund over $3.5 billion of their estimated annual facility sustainment requirements. The services do not have consistent estimates of their deferred sustainment requirements or plans to deal with these needs because DOD has not provided adequate guidance to clearly define deferred sustainment requirements, or direct the services to measure, track, and address these needs. As a result, DOD's plans to address facility sustainment requirements do not include all deferred sustainment requirements, which could result in continued facility deterioration and increased future recapitalization costs. DOD's progress in developing a new model to estimate funding requirements for installation services, such as airfield and port operations, has been slow. Although DOD's goal is to establish common standards and metrics for installation services by the end of 2008, the services had agreed on common definitions and standards for only 2 of 29 areas by the end of 2007. DOD officials stated that reaching agreement has been difficult for several reasons, such as differences among the services in how tasks for installation services are performed and managed. Without a reliable model, DOD cannot provide the Congress with a clear basis for making funding decisions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 1997, we have identified the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD)  management of its support infrastructure as a high-risk area because  infrastructure costs have affected the department\u2019s ability to devote funds  to other more critical programs and needs.

Further, we noted that because of these long-standing issues, DOD\u2019s  management of support infrastructure remains a high-risk area.", "We have issued several reports in recent years highlighting the long-term  challenges DOD faces in managing its portfolio of facilities and halting the  degradation of facilities. For example, in February 2003, we found that  funds designated for facilities sustainment were held back at the service  headquarters, major command, and installation levels to cover more  pressing needs or emerging requirements, which resulted in continued  facility deterioration. In May 2003, we reported that although funding for  maintaining and constructing reserve component facilities had increased  by almost 50 percent during 1998 through 2003, the reserve components  indicated the condition of about 64 percent of their facilities was  inadequate. In a June 2005 report, we found that DOD did not have a  common framework for identifying base operating support functions and  funding requirements to ensure adequate delivery of services, particularly  in a joint environment. We also found that, because of a lack of a common  terminology across the services in defining base support functions and the  lack of a mature analytic process for developing credible and consistent  requirements, the services moved hundreds of millions of operation and  maintenance dollars designated for facilities sustainment and other  purposes to pay for base operations support. While such funding  movements are permissible, we found that they were disruptive to the  orderly provision of services and contributed to the overall degradation of  facilities. In another 2005 report, we found that many of DOD\u2019s training  ranges were in deteriorated condition and lacked modernization, which  adversely affected training activities and jeopardized the safety of military  personnel."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Funding of Installation Support", "paragraphs": ["The Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and  Environment has overall responsibility for DOD\u2019s facilities and  installations, which includes about 577,000 buildings and structures at  more than 5,300 sites worldwide with a total replacement value of about  $712 billion. During fiscal year 2008, DOD plans to spend around              $55 billion to support its facilities and installations. DOD refers to this  funding as installation support, which includes five broad categories of  services, programs, and support activities\u2014facilities, installation services,  family housing, environment, and base realignment and closure.

Restoration includes repair and  replacement work needed to restore facilities degraded from several  causes, such as natural disaster, fire, accident, excessive age, or  inadequate sustainment.

According to DOD officials, in the past installation  support funding requirements were often artificially derived, such as by  basing funding needs on prior-year execution levels. DOD lacked  departmentwide standards for determining future funding needs and did  not have sufficient data to support informed decision making. DOD\u2019s  solution was to develop models that could predict future requirements  based on known inputs that were specific to a facility category type,  service, and location. The idea was to better support funding decisions by  developing models that used benchmarked and validated inputs, estimated  needs based on service levels commensurate with industry standards,  where applicable, and showed the impact if funds were not provided.  According to DOD officials, models can improve consistency, increase  credibility, establish an auditable process, and provide a tool for setting  funding goals and measuring progress towards meeting those goals. The  following is a summary status of DOD\u2019s model development for  installation support as of January 2008.", "The facilities sustainment model has been implemented and used by  the military services to estimate the annual facility sustainment funding  requirements since fiscal year 2003.

According to DOD, the model will  estimate annual funding requirements and improve upon DOD\u2019s  recapitalization metric that has been used for several years to help  assess restoration and modernization funding needs. The  recapitalization metric uses as a measure the number of years it would  take for facilities to be replaced based on the annual funding provided  for restoration and modernization. DOD\u2019s current goal is for military  services to fund facility restoration and modernization in annual  amounts that would result in facilities being replaced every 67 years.  DOD established the 67-year benchmark after an assessment of DOD\u2019s  real property inventory in the late 1990s.

DOD officials stated that sustainment costs for automobile service  facilities include hydrant and fuel truck station records, periodic  maintenance inspections, and replacement of worn parts, which are  similar to costs associated with petroleum pipelines and aircraft fueling  facilities.

However, depending on the method used to make the inflation adjustment  for those cost factors that are based on ratio analyses, the recomputation  can also result in decreased accuracy for those factors. To illustrate, for  cost factors based on ratio analyses, DOD previously made inflation  adjustments by first applying the estimated annual inflation rate to the  individual sustainment and replacement cost factors and then using a ratio  analysis to calculate the unknown sustainment cost factor. DOD did not  use this method for fiscal year 2009. Instead, DOD used the value of the  sustainment cost factor that was determined in the first year that a ratio  analysis was used and then applied actual prior year inflation to  recompute the cost factor\u2019s value for fiscal year 2009. DOD\u2019s new method  would be appropriate and result in accurate estimates under two  circumstances\u2014if the similar relationship between the two facility  categories used in the ratio analyses existed only in the first year that the  ratio analysis was used, or if the relationship between the known  sustainment and replacement cost factors used in the ratio analysis  remained the same from the original year to the current year.

The result was a sustainment cost factor of $11.57 per linear  foot. However, if DOD had used its previously used method and calculated  the cost factor using a ratio analysis after the individual costs used in the  analysis had been adjusted for actual inflation, the sustainment cost factor  would have been $21.99 per linear foot, or 90 percent more. Using the  previously used calculation method would have increased the accuracy of  the cost factor because costs would continue to be based on a current year  ratio analysis and actual prior year inflation would still be considered  because the individual costs used in the ratio analysis would have been  adjusted for actual prior year inflation.

Although each service knew the amount of its annual sustainment  requirements that was not funded, they did not know the amounts of their  deferred sustainment requirements and each service expressed a different  view of the issue. For example, Army officials stated that although the  Army does not have information documenting its cumulative deferred  sustainment requirements, deferred sustainment needs were being  addressed with the Army\u2019s current funding of its annual sustainment,  restoration, and modernization programs. However, the Army did not fund  over $735 million of its annual sustainment requirements in fiscal year  2007 and budgeted funds to pay for only 89 percent of the Army\u2019s fiscal  year 2008 sustainment requirements. Meanwhile, Navy officials stated that  it did not need to estimate deferred sustainment needs because  sustainment work that is deferred becomes a restoration and  modernization requirement. However, according to DOD definitions,  deferred sustainment does not become a restoration requirement until it  results in damaging a facility, and it could take several years before  deferred sustainment work actually damages a facility to the point that it  must undergo restoration. In contrast, officials from the Air Force stated  that deferred sustainment requirements should be estimated and added to  the annual sustainment requirements in order to see the total sustainment  funding requirement, even though the cost to fund the total requirement  would be too high to be fully funded considering other Air Force budget  priorities. Finally, Marine Corps officials stated that, based on periodic  facility inspections, it has an estimate of total facility needs that includes  all deferred sustainment, restoration, and modernization requirements.  However, this estimate does not distinguish the deferred sustainment  requirement from the restoration and modernization requirement, which  means that the Marine Corps does not know its actual deferred  sustainment requirement. The Marine Corps also stated that funding over  100 percent of the annual sustainment requirement, as it did in fiscal year  2007, would be required to reduce the size of the deferred sustainment  requirement.", "At some of the installations we visited, officials noted that deferred  sustainment requirements needed to be adequately estimated and  addressed if facilities are to be sustained at an optimum level. For  example, officials at Langley Air Force Base stated that because the  facilities sustainment model only estimated the annual sustainment  requirement and did not address deferred sustainment, deferred facility  sustainment needs at many installations would not be met even if the  installations were funded at the amounts estimated by the model. The  officials also stated that deferred sustainment requirements needed to be  specifically recognized and a plan developed to address these  requirements. At Camp Lejeune, officials noted that the facilities  sustainment model was based on facility life-cycle costs and the model\u2019s  annual funding estimates were based on the assumption that facilities  were fully sustained in the past and were in good condition. However, the  officials stated that this is not the case at many installations because years  of inadequate funding had resulted in a backlog of deferred sustainment  requirements. Fort Sam Houston officials stated that although a backlog of  deferred sustainment needs existed, it was difficult to quantify the size of  the backlog because the installation lacked the personnel required to fully  inspect all installation facilities and catalogue all of the needed  sustainment work and projects. Similarly, Randolph Air Force Base  officials stated that all deferred sustainment needs at the installation had  not been identified partly because there was little confidence that the  work would be funded even if the effort were expended to document the  requirement.", "Although Federal Real Property Council guidance requires federal  activities to know the repair needs of their facilities, DOD officials  indicated that for several reasons, determining deferred facility  sustainment needs is not an easy task. First, DOD officials noted that all  unfunded annual sustainment requirements do not become deferred  requirements. To illustrate, if a facility has an annual inspection  requirement and the inspection is not performed, the inspection cost  would not become a deferred sustainment requirement because two  annual inspections would not be required in the following year and the  facilities sustainment model would include the annual inspection cost in  the subsequent year\u2019s funding estimate. However, if a facility were  scheduled for a roof replacement and roof was not replaced, the cost of  the replacement would become a deferred requirement because it would  still be needed and the cost would not be included in the subsequent year\u2019s  funding estimate.", "Second, DOD officials also noted that the facilities sustainment model  estimates the average annual sustainment funding requirements for each  facility category but does not identify the actual sustainment work that  each installation facility needs. The officials noted that a model might be  developed that could provide reliable estimates of deferred sustainment  requirements. However, according to the officials, actual facility  sustainment needs can only be determined through facility inspections in  which actual conditions are determined, needed repair and maintenance  work is documented, and costs to complete this work are estimated. A  comparison of an installation\u2019s actual facility sustainment needs with the  installation\u2019s annual sustainment funding would provide an estimate of the  installation\u2019s deferred sustainment requirement. Of the military services,  only the Marine Corps systematically inspected its facilities and  documented needed repairs and improvements so that actual deferred  facility needs were known. However, because the documentation did not  distinguish facility sustainment needs from restoration and modernization  needs, the Marine Corps did not know its actual deferred sustainment  funding requirements. The Army used a facility inspection method that  provided an estimate of facility funding needs based on facility condition  assessments. However, the method did not document each facility\u2019s actual  needed sustainment, restoration, and modernization projects. The Navy  stopped performing facility condition inspections after fiscal year 2005  because of the high cost of the inspections. Although the Navy plans to  implement a model beginning in fiscal year 2008 designed to estimate  facility conditions and funding needs, the model will not document each  facility\u2019s actual needed sustainment, restoration, and modernization  projects. Air Force officials stated that its facilities are inspected as funds  permit and facility deficiencies, work requests, and projects are  documented. However, the officials stated that the list of needed work was  not considered all inclusive and did not categorize needed work as  sustainment, restoration, or modernization.", "Third, as noted previously, estimating deferred sustainment requirements  can be further complicated by DOD\u2019s definition of facility restoration and  the associated decisions on when deferred sustainment requirements  become restoration requirements. Specifically, DOD defines restoration as  including repair and replacement work to restore facilities damaged by  inadequate sustainment, excessive age, disaster, accident, or other causes.  Marine Corps officials noted that it can be difficult to determine when  deferred sustainment work actually damages a facility and thus should be  reclassified from a sustainment funding requirement to a restoration  funding requirement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Clear Guidance Impedes Reliable Financial Reporting of Deferred Sustainment Costs", "paragraphs": ["The military services\u2019 financial reporting of deferred facility maintenance  information is not consistent with federal financial reporting requirements  due to a lack of clear DOD reporting guidance. We found that prior to  fiscal year 2007, the services\u2019 financial statements excluded required  information concerning deferred facility sustainment requirements and  included information concerning deferred facility modernization  requirements. Including deferred facility modernization requirements is  not consistent with federal financial reporting requirements because these  requirements pertain to activities intended to expand or upgrade facility  capacity. Although DOD issued revised guidance in September 2007 in part  to address these issues, the guidance did not provide sufficient details to  ensure that future financial reporting of deferred maintenance would be  consistent with reporting requirements. Unreliable deferred maintenance  information, could further jeopardize DOD\u2019s ability to adequately provide  for its facility sustainment needs and result in continued facility  deterioration and increased future recapitalization costs.", "Federal financial accounting standards require that federal entities that  own property, plant, and equipment include information in their financial  statements disclosures related to the condition and the estimated deferred  maintenance costs of these assets. The accounting standards define  maintenance as the act of keeping fixed assets in acceptable condition,  including preventive maintenance, normal repairs, replacement of parts  and structural components, and other activities needed to preserve the  asset so that it continues to provide acceptable services and achieves its  expected life. The distinction between maintenance and deferred  maintenance is that deferred maintenance is maintenance that was not  performed when it should have been or was scheduled to be and which,  therefore, was put off or delayed for a future period. By definition, both  maintenance and deferred maintenance exclude activities aimed at  expanding the capacity of an asset or otherwise upgrading it to serve  needs different from, or significantly greater than, those originally  intended. In other words, expenditures to modernize or upgrade property,  plant, and equipment should not be reported as maintenance costs.", "According to DOD officials, prior to fiscal year 2007, the military services\u2019  financial statement reports included disclosures pertaining to only to the  annual amount of their sustainment requirements, as determined by the  facilities sustainment model, which was not funded. In addition, the  military services' financial statement disclosures for deferred maintenance  also included information on the cumulative deferred restoration and  modernization requirements as a component of the reported deferred  maintenance amounts. Reporting deferred modernization requirement  amounts is not consistent with reporting standards because modernization  includes facility work to implement new or higher facility standards,  accommodate new functions, or replace building components that have  exceeded their useful life, typically about 50 years. However, DOD  guidance did not clearly instruct the military services to exclude deferred  modernization requirement amounts from the amounts they reported for  deferred maintenance. Thus, the reporting of deferred modernization  requirements as part of deferred facility maintenance in the financial  statements results in misleading deferred maintenance disclosures and is  not consistent with what is called for by federal accounting standards.", "DOD officials further stated that while in the process of updating DOD  financial regulations in 2007, DOD recognized that the financial statements  should include the cumulative, not just the annual, deferred sustainment  amounts. To address this issue beginning with the fiscal year 2007  financial statements, an official in the Office of the Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller) stated that the military services were directed to begin  reporting deferred maintenance amounts that include cumulative deferred  sustainment requirements. However, because the military services did not  have estimates of their deferred sustainment requirements, DOD officials  stated that the military services were directed to estimate their total  deferred maintenance needs based on each service\u2019s facility quality  ratings. Facility quality ratings, prepared for each real property inventory  asset, reflect each facility\u2019s condition at a specific point in time and the  estimated cost to correct existing deficiencies to bring the facility to a fully  serviceable operating condition.", "Although DOD decided to use the facility quality ratings for estimating and  reporting deferred maintenance, DOD\u2019s guidance for determining the  quality ratings specifically excluded consideration of sustainment  requirements and specifically included all restoration and modernization  requirements, except for construction of new facility capacity. To  address this issue, DOD issued new guidance on September 5, 2007. The  new guidance directed the military services to begin including sustainment  requirements in the facility quality ratings and to exclude restoration and  modernization requirements that were related to facility conversion and  construction of new facility capacity. However, the guidance did not  provide details to the military services on how to do implement these  changes and permitted each service to decide on a method, as long as the  service validated the accuracy of the method used.", "Although the military services attempted to implement the new guidance  in reporting deferred maintenance information in their fiscal year 2007  financial statements, the reported information was still inconsistent and  incomplete. First, because the new guidance did not provide details on  how to implement the changes, each service used its own methods. Yet,  according to a May 2006 report commissioned by DOD to provide an  independent verification and validation of the services\u2019 facility quality  ratings, the services used inconsistent methods to determine facility  conditions, which resulted in inconsistent estimates of needed  maintenance costs. Second, with the new guidance being issued on  September 5, 2007, the military services had little time to make any  adjustments to their facility quality ratings prior to preparation of their  fiscal year 2007 financial statements, which were due in November 2007.  According to Navy officials, Navy facility quality ratings had not been  updated since 2005 because the Navy stopped performing facility  inspections. Third, when reporting deferred facility maintenance amounts  in its fiscal year 2007 financial statement, the Air Force included a note  stating that the use of facility quality ratings as a basis for calculating  deferred maintenance did not seem prudent because the quality of the  information used to determine the ratings was questionable. Without  guidance providing for consistent methods for measuring deferred  sustainment requirements and determining which portion of the deferred  restoration and modernization requirements to include in the financial  statements, the military services\u2019 financial reporting of deferred  maintenance information may continue to be inconsistent with financial  reporting requirements, which could further jeopardize DOD\u2019s ability to  adequately provide for its facility sustainment needs and result in  continued facility deterioration and increased future recapitalization costs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Progress in Developing an Installation Services Model Has Been Slow", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s progress in developing a model for estimating installation services  funding requirements has been slow because DOD has been unable to  overcome long-standing inconsistencies among the military services\u2019  definitions of support service functions and other obstacles that prevent  such a model from being ready for use. In an effort to ensure consistent  delivery of adequate installation services among DOD components and  provide the Congress with a clearer basis for making funding decisions,  DOD began in 2004 to develop an analytically sound model for determining  installation services funding requirements. However, progress has been  slow and it is unclear whether DOD\u2019s target for completing this work will  be met. Without a DOD-wide model, the military services have used  various methods to estimate their support services requirements subject to  their own definition of the types and levels of services deemed necessary.  On the basis of these estimates, Army, Navy, and Air Force officials have  raised concerns about the adequacy of support services funding from  fiscal years 2005 through 2007, stating that this funding was less than the  amounts needed to provide services at the levels desired and resulted in  some installations providing reduced services, which caused the quality of  life of DOD personnel in some instances to be negatively affected."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Efforts to Develop an Installation Services Model Began in 2004", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s efforts to develop a model for estimating installation services  funding requirements began in 2004, when the Office of the Deputy Under  Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment designated the  improvement of installation services management as a priority. According  to officials from this office, DOD\u2019s and the military services\u2019 ability to  forecast installation services requirements and funding needs had been  hindered by the lack of a common terminology across the military services  and the lack of common definitions had caused differing expectations for  service support when multiple military services were collocated on a  single installation. The 2004 Defense Installations Strategic Plan  articulated the need to define common standards and performance metrics  for managing installation support and established goals to implement  DOD-wide support service standards and to develop an analytical model  based on common benchmarks to accurately forecast installation services  funding requirements. The plan noted that installation services included a  large collection of diverse functions and that work towards a model would  first focus on services related to real property\u2014work that subsequently  resulted in DOD\u2019s facilities operation model\u2014and then on all other  installation services\u2014work now directed at developing the installation  services model.", "Also in 2004, in an effort to promote joint installation management, DOD  established a working group to develop policy and create a strategic  framework for delivery of installation services. The framework was to  include the establishment of common definitions, tiered performance  standards, and performance measures to assist in managing support  services resources and help ensure the common delivery of applicable  support services across all military installations. To support this effort,  service standards teams, composed of members from each military  service, were formed and charged with developing common output-level  standards, which include common definitions, performance standards,  metrics, and unit cost estimates for each installation support service. The  common output-level standards would also provide a key component  needed to develop an installation services model.", "Service standards teams were formed to develop common definitions and  standards for 29 different support services. The initial goal was for the  teams to complete their work by February 2006. According to DOD  officials, from the beginning the teams had difficulty completing their  work and obtaining agreement from all military services on the common  definitions and standards. By December 2007, the military services had  accepted the common definitions and service standards for only 2 of the  29 support services addressed by the service standards teams, and the  target date for completing the work had slipped to March 2008.

For example, each military service has its  own long-standing policies and practices on how tasks and subtasks for  each installation service are grouped, performed, managed, and funded.  Also, differences in the military services\u2019 policies, practices, and traditions  have resulted in service differences in (1) the value of and emphasis  placed on the various support services, (2) views on whether service  programs should be managed and funded centrally or not, and (3) support  service requirements based on installation location and demographic  characteristics. For example, remote installations might provide some  services that are normally provided by local communities in more  populated areas, and installations with a high percentage of young, single  personnel might provide some services not provided at installations with  different demographics.", "As one example of an installation support service that is managed  differently among the military services, DOD cited differences in the  management of chaplain services. According to DOD officials, the Navy, in  accordance with its policy, donates all funds collected during on-base  religious services to charities. The other military services, in accordance  with their policies, use funds collected during on-base religious services to  directly support the chaplain program, such as paying for program  expenses. Thus, in order to reach a common definition and service  standard for the chaplain program, this difference among the military  services must be resolved.", "Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and  Environment officials, who were overseeing the development of the  model, stated that resolving the differences in support service definitions  and service standards remains a key obstacle to completing an installation  services model that can reliably estimate the funds required to provide  services at appropriate levels across all installations. The officials also  noted that other obstacles exist and must be overcome before a model is  completed. For example, because each of the installation services is  unique, a separate model will be required for each service. Thus, the  installation services model will be a collection of many separately  developed, service-specific models. According to the officials, a few  service standards teams believe the services they studied will be difficult  to model. Further, it may also be difficult to identify adequate information  sources for estimating the standard costs for some installation services,  such as for mission-based services, including airfield and port operations,  and regulatory services, including environmental services. The problem is  that historical metrics and costs for some services are not readily available  within DOD, and private sector data sources may not be suitable for  services that are performed differently by the private sector and DOD.  Given these obstacles and the slow pace of prior progress in developing  the common definitions and standards, it is unclear whether the 2008  target in DOD\u2019s plan will be met. In addition, the plan did not establish a  milestone for when the model will be implemented for use in estimating  the military\u2019s installation services funding requirements.

On the basis of these estimates and other  information, Army, Navy, and Air Force officials stated that installation  services funding for fiscal years 2005 through 2007 was less than the  amounts needed to provide services at the levels desired. For example,  according to Army officials, installation services and facility operations  services\u2014collectively classified as base operations support in the Army\u2019s  budget\u2014were funded at about 80 percent, 82 percent, and 87 percent of  requirements in fiscal years 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively. Of the  military services, only the Marine Corps stated that its installation services  and facility operations services were adequately funded during these fiscal  years.", "Although it was beyond the scope of our review to assess the impacts that  resulted from less than full funding of installation services, we did ask the  military services for their views. Army officials stated that, because of  inadequate funding levels, installation services were reduced and provided  at lower than optimum levels at some installations, which reduced the  support provided to military personnel. Navy officials stated that effects of  inadequate funding included (1) reduced operating hours at some  installation entrance gates, which slowed base access; (2) reduced law  enforcement patrols, pier security, and surveillance detection, which  increased security risks; (3) cutbacks in facility cleaning contracts, which  caused mold and mildew growth, which could potentially create health  issues; (4) closure of some installation swimming pools and automobile  hobby shops, which affected personnel quality of life; and (5) scaled back  special events, which reduced the connection between some bases and the  local communities. Air Force officials stated that inadequate installation  services funding resulted in reduced in-house and contractual support for  day-to-day operations at some installations in areas such as installation  security, transportation, and supply. In addition, the quality of life for  service members was affected at some installations by the closure of  dining and fitness facilities and decreased library hours and other  contractual services supporting base personnel.", "Officials at some of the installations we visited also commented that  because of inadequate funding, some installation services and facility  operations services were reduced causing negative effects on the quality of  life of installation personnel. At Fort Eustis, for example, officials  estimated that custodial services were funded at about 25 percent of the  amount needed to meet normal requirements. The officials stated that  custodial services no longer provided for cleaning carpets or windows and  only provided for cleaning restrooms once a week.

In particular, the military  services had not complied with DOD guidance that requires verification of  real property inventory records and consequently the inventory records  contained inaccuracies and discrepancies, information documenting the  basis for each sustainment cost factor was not readily available, and the  fiscal year 2009 method for calculating sustainment cost factors that are  not based on independent data sources can reduce the accuracy of these  factors. Until DOD takes additional steps to improve the accuracy and  supportability of its inventory quantity and sustainment cost factor inputs  to the facilities sustainment model, the model\u2019s estimates of annual facility  sustainment funding requirements will not be as reliable as possible,  which could jeopardize DOD\u2019s ability to adequately provide for its facility  sustainment needs.", "Furthermore, because the military services do not have consistent  estimates of their deferred facility sustainment requirements, DOD lacks a  complete picture of its facility sustainment funding needs.

Further, we reviewed the military services\u2019 efforts to respond  to September 2007 DOD guidance that was intended to improve the  military services\u2019 reporting of deferred maintenance amounts.", "To determine the status of DOD's efforts to develop a funding  requirements model for installation services, we obtained and reviewed  documentation on the history of the model\u2019s development and interviewed  DOD officials concerning past progress on the model, the model\u2019s status at  the end of calendar year 2007, and future plans for completing and  implementing the model. We also documented the timeline of DOD\u2019s  efforts since DOD decided to develop the model and compared various  developmental milestones with actual progress. Further, we discussed  with DOD officials the factors that have affected progress in developing  the model and asked the officials to identify any remaining obstacles that  must be overcome before the model could be completed and used to  estimate DOD\u2019s installation services funding requirements. In the absence  of a DOD-wide model, we also interviewed officials from each of the  military services and reviewed related information to document the  methods used by each military service to determine installation services  funding needs. Further, we asked service headquarters officials and  officials at the installations we visited to explain the consequences when  installation services funding was less than required.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2007 through April 2008,  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Current Methods Used by the Military Services to Estimate Installation Support Services Funding Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The Army determines its installation services funding requirements  primarily through the Army\u2019s base operations support requirements model.  This model uses Army-defined service standards and a costing  methodology that estimates costs for 95 different installation services  across Army installations based on cost pacing measures and data unique  to each support service. Examples of cost pacing measures include  population served, facility square footage, and number of transactions  required. According to the Army, the model\u2019s process results in estimated  funding requirements for what each support service should cost based on  a predefined level of support. The Army adjusts the model\u2019s funding  estimate to include costs for some services that are not modeled and  determines the amount of funding actually budgeted based upon the  availability of resources and Army priorities. Beginning with its fiscal year  2010 budget, the Army plans to use the facilities operation model to  estimate support services funding requirements for the facility-related  services included in that model.", "The Navy determines its installation services funding requirements  primarily from the Navy\u2019s base operating support model. This model  estimates the funding required for 18 Navy service support functions,  which represent about 67 percent of all Navy support services costs.  Funding estimates for 9 other service support functions are not modeled  but are determined primarily from prior-year costs for the required level of  support. For each of the 18 modeled service support functions, the model  estimates funding requirements for four separate standard levels of service  by multiplying a unit factor, such as square feet of a building, by a unit cost  factor for each of the four levels of service that could be provided.  According to the Navy, the unit costs used by the model are established in  several ways, including Navy historical costs and commercial estimating  manuals and data sources. Each year senior Navy leadership decides  which of the four levels of service will be provided for each service  support function at naval installations. On the basis of these decisions and  information from the model, the Navy determines its installation services  funding requirement. Beginning with its fiscal year 2010 budget, the Navy  plans to use the facilities operation model to estimate support services  funding requirements for the facility-related services included in that  model.", "The Air Force used a prototype of the facilities operation model to  estimate its fiscal year 2008 funding requirements for the 10 facility-related  support services included in that model. Even though the model was not  yet at full operational capability, the Air Force decided that the model  provided a more realistic estimate of facility-related service funding  requirements than the Air Force\u2019s previously used method, which was  based on historical costs. The Air Force plans to continue to use this  model. To estimate its funding requirements for several other installation  services that are not included in the model, including security forces,  airfield operations, installation administration, food services, and lodging,  the Air Force uses a cost projection formula. The formula primarily uses  the number of personnel assigned to each installation and the value of the  installation\u2019s facilities as key inputs to determining its funding  requirements estimates. The Air Force does not use a model or formula for  some installation services, such as environmental conservation and  compliance, pollution prevention, unaccompanied personnel housing,  child development centers, and base communications and multimedia  activities. According to Air Force officials, the Air Force leadership makes  final decisions on the annual installation services budget based on Air  Force priorities and budget constraints.", "The Marine Corps currently does not use a comprehensive model to  estimate funding requirements for installation services except for utility  costs. For utilities, Marine Corps officials stated that funding requirements  are based on a model that organizes and aggregates available consumption  and cost data by utility type and predicts future costs to support budgeting  and programming needs. For all other installation support service areas,  the Marine Corps estimates funding requirements primarily by direct  review of historical program execution and future needs. During its budget  development process, the Marine Corps makes final decisions on funding  levels based on needs, resources, and priorities. Beginning with its fiscal  year 2010 budget, the Marine Corps plans to use the facilities operation  model to estimate support services funding requirements for the facility- related services included in that model."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Mark Little, Assistant  Director; Bonita Anderson; Harry Knobler; Mary Jo Lacasse; Josh  Margraf; and Gary Phillips made significant contributions to this  report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Cost Assessment Guide: Best Practices for Estimating and Managing  Program Costs.
