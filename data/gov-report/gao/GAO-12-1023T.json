Moreover, retirements and the potential loss of leadership and institutional knowledge, coupled with fiscal pressures, underscore the importance of a strategic and efficient approach to acquiring and retaining individuals with needed critical skills.", "This testimony is based on a large body of GAO work from January 2001 through September 2012 and focuses on the progress made by executive branch agencies, the CHCO Council, and OPM, and the challenges that remain in four key areas of human capital management: (1) leadership; (2) strategic human capital planning; (3) talent management; and (4) resultsoriented organizational culture."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since 2001, Congress, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and executive branch agencies have taken action to address the government's human capital challenges. For example, in 2002, Congress passed legislation creating the CHCO Council, composed of the Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCO) of 24 executive agencies and chaired by the Director of OPM. In 2004, through the Federal Workforce Flexibility Act, Congress provided agencies greater hiring flexibilities. OPM issued guidance on hiring reforms, developed the Hiring Toolkit, and launched an 80-day model to speed the hiring process.", "Leadership:", "The CHCO Council advises and coordinates the activities of member agencies on current and emerging personnel issues. Among its recent initiatives, OPM and the CHCO Council established a working group in September 2011 to identify and mitigate critical skills gaps. To date the group has taken important steps, including developing a framework and timeline for identifying and addressing government-wide and agency-specific skills gaps. However, the substantive work of addressing skills gaps remains, including defining workforce plans, implementing recruitment and retention strategies, and measuring the effects of these initiatives.", "Strategic human capital planning:", "Integrating human capital planning with broader organizational strategic planning is essential for ensuring that agencies have the talent and skill mix needed to cost-effectively execute their mission and program goals. If not carefully managed, anticipated retirements could cause skills gaps to develop further and adversely impact the ability of agencies to carry out their diverse responsibilities. GAO's work has identified skills shortages in areas government-wide, such as cybersecurity, acquisition management, and foreign language capabilities.", "Talent management:", "Ensuring that federal agencies are able to recruit, develop, and retain personnel with the necessary skills is essential to closing any skills gaps and maintaining a workforce that will meet its vital missions. Congress, OPM, and some individual agencies have taken important actions, such as providing and using flexibilities, to improve the hiring process and making investments in training and development. However, much work remains. For example, GAO recently reported that OPM can improve its guidance and assistance to agencies in establishing a process for setting and prioritizing training investments.", "Results-oriented organizational culture:", "Leading organizations have found that to successfully transform themselves they must often fundamentally change their cultures to be more results-oriented, customer-focused, and collaborative. As part of that, GAO has shown that agencies need to create clear \"lines of sight\" that align organizational and individual performance. These lines of sight help individual staff understand the connection between their daily activities and agency success."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Over the years, GAO has made numerous recommendations to agencies and OPM to improve their strategic human capital management efforts.

My remarks today will focus on the  progress made in modernizing federal human capital policies and  procedures since 2001, the year in which we first added strategic human  capital management to our list of high risk areas because of the long- standing lack of leadership on personnel matters.", "Mr. Chairman, today\u2019s session is a fitting venue to discuss the progress of  civil service reforms because so many of the improvements in the federal  government\u2019s human capital policies and practices came about as a  result of the bipartisan leadership and vision of this Subcommittee  including legislation, hearings, constructive oversight, requests for our  research, and efforts to hold agencies accountable for results.", "Congress, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and individual  agencies have all made substantial progress in addressing their human  capital challenges. For example, Congress, in 2002, created the chief  human capital officer (CHCO) position in 24 agencies to advise and assist  the head of the agency and other agency officials in their strategic human  capital efforts.advises and coordinates the activities of members\u2019 agencies, OPM, and  the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on such matters as  modernizing human resources systems and improving the quality of  human resources information. Further, in 2002 and 2004, Congress  provided agencies\u2014individually and across the federal government\u2014with  additional authorities and flexibilities to manage the federal workforce  such as the authority to offer recruitment bonuses. More recently,  Congress enacted the Telework Enhancement Act of 2010, which is  intended to provide opportunities for more federal employees to telework.", "The CHCO Council\u2014chaired by the OPM Director\u2014 It is important that the government have a top-notch workforce.  Addressing challenges in areas such as disaster response, homeland  security, economic security, and many other evolving issues requires  networks of actors across many organizations employing a wide range of  expertise and skills. For federal agencies to be effective in this  environment, they must have the capacity to work seamlessly with other  agencies, levels of government, and across sectors.", "While the government has taken on additional roles and responsibilities in  recent years, the size of the federal workforce has changed little since  1981. While there have been some fluctuations, overall the number of  federal employees has remained relatively steady at around 2 million  people, with 2.2 million civilian, non-postal employees in 2011. That said,  the federal workforce is supported by a large number of contract  employees who also need to have the right set of skills. Although the  exact size of the contractor workforce is difficult to measure, at some  agencies it is significant and can far exceed the number of federal  personnel. For example, as we pointed out in our April 2012 report, the  National Nuclear Security Administration\u2014a component of the  Department of Energy responsible for ensuring the safety and security of  the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons stockpile\u2014is composed of about 34,000  contractors and 2,400 federal employees.", "These evolving and complex challenges are occurring while agencies  confront an array of internal management capacity difficulties, such as  critical skills shortages, ongoing retirements that could lead to a further  loss of institutional knowledge, as well as fiscal pressures. is vital that agencies operate more strategically and efficiently than ever  before.", "As a result, it  The challenges confronting government demand that federal agencies  follow high-performing organizations\u2019 human capital management  practices including recruiting and retaining employees able to create,  sustain, and thrive in organizations that are flatter, results-oriented, and  externally focused; and collaborate with other entities across levels of  government and with the private and non-profit sectors.", "For more on the management capacity issues confronting agencies, see GAO-11-278.", "As requested, my remarks today will focus on executive branch agencies\u2019  and OPM\u2019s progress in addressing key aspects of strategic human capital  management including: (1) leadership commitment; (2) strategic human  capital planning; (3) talent management; and (4) building a results- oriented culture. This testimony is based on a large body of our  completed work issued from January 2001 through September 2012, and  also includes the preliminary results of an ongoing study that you  requested on addressing critical skills gaps. The work on which this  statement is based was conducted in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan  and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide  a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives.

As one example, in  September 2011, OPM and the CHCO Council, as part of ongoing  discussions between OPM, OMB, and us on progress needed to address  the federal government\u2019s human capital high risk area, established a  working group to identify and mitigate critical skills gaps. At the request of  this Subcommittee, we are reviewing the progress of the working group.  Our preliminary findings show that the working group has, to date, taken  some important steps forward, including developing a framework and  timeline for identifying and addressing both government-wide and  agency-specific skills gaps.", "Importantly, the effort is receiving the commitment and support of agency  leadership. For example, agencies\u2019 chief human capital officers and their  representatives were involved in forming the working group and  participated in its deliberations. Further, the working group\u2019s efforts were  designated a cross-agency priority goal within the Administration\u2019s fiscal  year 2013 federal budget. The working group expects to complete its  initial efforts in March 2013. We will continue to assess the working  group\u2019s progress and anticipate issuing a report to you later this year.", "In addition, OPM has demonstrated leadership in its efforts to improve the  hiring process, with an eye toward making it easier and faster for people  to apply for a federal job and strengthen the ability of agencies to  compete with the private sector for filling entry-level positions. For  example, OPM issued final regulations implementing the Pathways  Programs (Pathways) which took effect on July 10, 2012. Pathways  created two new conduits into government service: the Internship  Program for students currently in high school, college, and other  qualifying programs, and the Recent Graduates Program for individuals  who, within the previous two years, earned an associate, bachelors,  masters, professional or other qualifying degree or certificate. Pathways  also modified the existing Presidential Management Fellows Program  making it more student friendly by, among other changes, expanding the  eligibility window for applicants. Individuals in all three programs are  eligible for noncompetitive conversion to permanent positions after  meeting certain requirements. If successfully implemented, initiatives  such as the CHCO working group and Pathways could help agencies  identify and close critical skills gaps.", "Still, work is needed in other human capital areas. For example, as we  noted in our February 2012 testimony before this Subcommittee, OPM  needs to improve the paper-intensive processes and antiquated  information systems it uses to support the retirement of civilian federal  employees in part because of the volume of retirement processing  expected in the coming years given projected retirement trends."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strategic Human Capital Planning is Critical to Addressing Workforce Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Strategic human capital planning that is integrated with broader  organizational strategic planning is essential for ensuring that agencies  have the talent, skill, and experience mix they need to cost-effectively  execute their mission and program goals. Workforce planning is  especially important now because, as shown in figure 1, agencies are  facing a wave of potential retirements. Government-wide, around 30  percent of federal employees on board at the end of fiscal year 2011 will  become eligible to retire by 2016. At some agencies, however, such as  the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Small  Business Administration, at least 40 percent of those on board at the end  of fiscal year 2011 are already eligible or will become eligible to retire in  the next five years. The government\u2019s top leadership and management  ranks also face potentially high levels of retirement. About 58 percent of  senior executives and 45 percent of GS-15s who were on board at the  end of fiscal year 2011 will be eligible to retire by 2016. Likewise, certain  occupations face the potential of large numbers of retirements. Around 46  percent of air traffic controllers and 68 percent of administrative law  judges will be eligible to retire by 2016.", "Although a number of factors affect when employees actually retire, a  2008 OPM study found that the median number of years an employee  stays with the government after first becoming retirement-eligible is four  years, although nearly 25 percent remain for nine years or more. not carefully monitored and managed, as experienced employees leave,  gaps could develop in an organization\u2019s leadership and institutional  knowledge.", "OPM, An Analysis of Federal Employee Retirement Data: Predicting Future Retirements  and Examining Factors Relevant to Retiring from the Federal Service (Washington, D.C.:  March, 2008).", "GAO, Foreign Language Capabilities: Departments of Homeland Security, Defense, and  State Could Better Assess Their Foreign Language Needs and Capabilities and Address  Shortfalls, GAO-10-715T (Washington, D.C.: July 29, 2010). develop a comprehensive strategic plan with measurable goals,  objectives, milestones, and feedback mechanics that links all of State\u2019s  efforts to meet its foreign language requirements. State generally agreed  with our recommendations and in response, in March 2011, it published a  strategic plan for foreign language capabilities that links its language  incentive program to its efforts to enhance its recruitment program and  expand training, among other activities.", "Our prior work has also identified human capital planning issues at  individual agencies. For example, the Federal Emergency Management  Agency (FEMA) continues to face historical workforce planning and  training challenges that need to be addressed. In our April 2012,  assessment which we prepared for this Subcommittee and other  requesters, we reported that FEMA is in the early stages of integrating its  workforce planning and training efforts with initiatives underway by other  FEMA program offices. These efforts could help FEMA ensure that it  has a workforce of the proper size and skills to meet its mission.  However, we also noted that FEMA\u2019s workforce planning and training  efforts could benefit from quantifiable performance measures, such as  metrics to gauge the agency\u2019s progress building a comprehensive  leadership development program and integrating it with agency  succession planning. FEMA\u2019s parent agency, DHS, concurred with our  recommendations and is taking steps to implement them. For example,  FEMA\u2019s Strategic Human Capital Plan for fiscal years 2012 through 2016  will have milestones and metrics for addressing key workforce planning  efforts.", "In another example, in our July 2012 report, we found that the  Department of the Interior continues to face workforce planning  challenges following a reorganization effort to improve its oversight of oil  and gas activities in the wake of the April 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of  Mexico. In particular, we found that Interior has not developed a strategic  workforce plan that outlines specific strategies to help it address the  recruitment, retention, and training challenges it is facing, particularly for  engineers and inspectors. Interior has also not specifically determined  when it will develop such a plan. To address this, we recommended that  the relevant components of Interior develop a strategic workforce plan  that, among other actions, determines the critical skills and competencies  that will be needed to achieve current and future programmatic results  and to develop strategies to address critical skills gaps. Interior agreed  with this recommendation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Talent Management Remains a Federal Workforce Challenge", "paragraphs": ["Progress in talent management has been made on a number of fronts.

The  processes of that time failed to meet the needs of managers in filling  positions with the right talent and also failed to meet the needs of  applicants for a timely, efficient, transparent, and merit-based process.  The processes were also hampered by narrow federal classification  standards for defining federal occupations, the quality of certain applicant  assessment tools, and time-consuming processes to evaluate applicants.", "Both Congress and OPM have taken a series of important actions over  the years to improve recruiting and hiring in the federal sector. For  example, in 2004 Congress provided agencies with hiring flexibilities that  (1) permit agencies to appoint individuals to positions through a  streamlined hiring process where there is a severe shortage of qualified  candidates or a critical hiring need, and (2) allow agency managers more  latitude in selecting among qualified candidates through category rating,  an alternative to the traditional numerical rating procedure which limited  selection to the top three ranked candidates. In addition, Congress  provided agencies with enhanced authority to pay recruitment bonuses  and with the authority to credit relevant private sector experience when  computing annual leave amounts.", "In 2005, and again in 2008, OPM issued guidance on the use of hiring  authorities and flexibilities, in 2006 developed the Hiring Toolkit to assist  agency officials in determining the appropriate hiring flexibilities to use  given their specific situations, and in 2008 launched an 80-day hiring  model to help speed up the hiring process. Also in 2008, OPM  established standardized vacancy announcement templates for common  occupations, such as contract specialist and accounting technician  positions, in which agencies can insert summary information concerning  their specific jobs prior to posting for public announcement. As mentioned  earlier, in 2010, OPM launched the Pathways program in order to make it  easier to recruit and hire students and recent graduates.", "Individual agencies have also taken actions to meet their specific needs  for acquiring the necessary talent. For example, we have reported that  the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has used a  combination of techniques to recruit workers with critical skills, including  targeted recruitment activities, educational outreach programs, improved  compensation and benefits packages, professional development  programs, and streamlined hiring authorities.many challenges remain with federal recruiting and hiring, as noted  earlier in discussing critical skills gaps."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Training and Development", "paragraphs": ["Effective training and development programs are an integral part of a  learning environment that can enhance the federal government\u2019s ability to  attract and retain employees with the skills and competencies needed to  achieve results. Agency training and development programs should be  part of an overall management strategy and include processes to assess  and ensure the training\u2019s effectiveness. Our recent work has also  underscored the value of collaborative training.", "For example, in our 2010 overview of 225 professional development  activities intended to improve interagency collaboration at nine key  national security agencies (including DOD, State, and DHS), we noted  that because no single federal agency has the ability to address these  threats alone, agencies must work together in a whole-of-government  approach to protect our nation and its interests. We found that  interagency training and other professional development activities build  foundational knowledge, skills, and networks that are intended to improve  collaboration across agencies. For example, in fiscal year 2009, the  military services or combatant commands led an estimated 84 joint- military exercise programs that addressed a range of national security  matters and sought to improve the ability of participants to work across  agency lines by encouraging interagency participation. In addition, DHS  offers an introductory online course which is available to personnel across  federal, state, and local government and provides an overview of the  roles and responsibilities of various agencies and how they are supposed  to work together in different emergency situations.", "Some agencies also use interagency rotations as a type of professional  development activity that can help improve collaboration across agencies.  For example, Army\u2019s Interagency Fellowship Program is a 10- to 12- month rotation that places Army officers in intermediate-level positions at  other federal agencies and allows them to learn the culture of the host  agency, hone collaborative skills such as communication and teamwork,  and establish networks with their civilian counterparts. In a 2012 report,  we identified key policies and practices that help such interagency  personnel rotation programs achieve collaboration-related results. These  policies and practices include, for example, the importance of creating  shared goals, establishing incentives, and undertaking careful  preparation.", "Elsewhere, improvements are needed. Our work at State found that while  the department has taken many steps to incorporate the interrelated  elements of an effective training program, State\u2019s strategic approach to its  workforce training still has several key weaknesses.lacks a systematic, comprehensive training needs assessment process,  incorporating all bureaus and overseas posts. State also lacks formal  guidance for curriculum design and for data collection and analysis, and  thus cannot be assured that proper practices and procedures are  systematically and comprehensively applied. Moreover, the performance  measures for training generally do not fully address training goals, and  are generally output- rather than outcome-oriented. We made several  recommendations for State to improve strategic planning and evaluation  of its efforts to train personnel, including improvements to State\u2019s efforts  to assess training needs. State generally agreed with our  recommendations and noted that it would look for ways to enhance its  ability to assess the effectiveness of training and development efforts  across employee groups and locations. State has not yet provided us with  evidence that it has taken action to implement the report\u2019s  recommendations.", "More broadly, given current budget constraints, it is essential that  agencies identify the appropriate level of investment and establish  priorities for employee training and development, so that the most  important training needs are addressed first.

However, many CHCOs reported  that they do not set a level of investment agency-wide, do not prioritize  training agency-wide, and do not have information from component or  sub-agency leaders regarding their level of investments and priorities.  Consequently, agencies reported that they are duplicating internal training  investments and missing opportunities to leverage economies of scale  across their agencies. Officials from all four agencies we interviewed (the  Departments of Energy, the Interior, DHS, and Veterans Affairs) to obtain  additional perspective beyond our survey of 27 CHCOs reported that they  were unaware of the total amount their agencies invest in federal training  and cannot provide reliable training data to OPM, which requests these  data to address its government-wide training responsibilities.", "We found that agencies independently purchase or develop training for  the same mandated or common occupational training. Several agencies  and OPM officials reported that a website administered by OPM to  provide training for the HR community could be expanded to provide  mandatory or other common training for federal occupations, which, OPM  reported, could save millions and help standardize training. We  recommended, among other things, that OPM improve guidance and  assistance to agencies in establishing a process for setting and  prioritizing training investments; improve the reliability of agency training  investment information; and identify the best existing courses that fulfill  government-wide training requirements and offer them to all agencies  through their existing online training platform or another appropriate  platform.

Human capital flexibilities include monetary incentives such as  recruitment, relocation, and retention bonuses; special hiring authorities  such as veteran-related hiring authorities; incentive awards such as  performance-based cash and time-off awards; and work-life policies and  programs such as flexible work schedules, telework, and child care  centers and assistance.", "Our 2010 report on the use of recruitment, relocation, and retention  incentives found that these flexibilities were widely used by agencies, and  that retention incentives accounted for the majority of these incentive  costs. Our review of the steps OPM has taken to help ensure that  agencies have effective oversight of their incentive programs found that  while OPM provided oversight of such incentives through various  mechanisms, including guidance and periodic evaluations and  accountability reviews, there are opportunities for improvement. We  recommended that OPM require agencies to incorporate succession  planning efforts into the decision process for awarding retention  incentives. OPM agreed with our recommendation and stated that it will  develop future guidance on the importance of considering succession  planning in the decision process for awarding retention incentives. In  January 2011, OPM issued proposed regulations to add succession  planning to the list of factors an agency may consider before approving a  retention incentive for an employee who would be likely to leave the  federal service in the absence of the incentive. OPM has stated that  specifically listing this factor in the regulations will strengthen the  relationship between succession planning and retention incentives. OPM  expects to issue the final regulations before the end of 2012.", "To assist and guide agencies in developing and administering their  work/life programs, OPM has established working groups, sponsored  training for agency officials, promulgated regulations implementing  work/life programs, and provided guidance. In our December 2010 report  on agencies\u2019 satisfaction with OPM\u2019s assistance, we found that most  agency officials were satisfied with OPM\u2019s help, guidance, and  information sharing. At the same time, we determined that OPM is potentially missing opportunities to provide federal agencies with  additional information that may help them develop and implement  work/life programs. As such, we recommended that OPM more  systematically track data already being collected by individual federal  agencies on their work/life programs such as program usage, and share  this information with federal agencies. OPM agreed with our  recommendations and said it is exploring the use of a Web-based tool  that would provide an ability to collect data from agencies and present it  in a more meaningful and systematic manner.

OSC  said it is reviewing its procedures for compiling and reporting cost data  during the demonstration project, and is committed to making any  necessary changes to ensure the demonstration project satisfies  Congress\u2019s goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Strategic human capital management must be the centerpiece of any  serious effort to ensure federal agencies operate as high-performing  organizations. A high-quality federal workforce is especially critical now  given the complex, multi-dimensional issues facing the nation.  Achievement of this goal is challenging, especially in light of the fiscal  pressures confronting our national government.", "When we first identified strategic human capital management as a high  risk area in 2001, it was because many agencies faced challenges in key  areas including leadership; workforce planning; talent management; and  creating results-oriented organizational cultures. Since then, the federal  government has made substantial progress in beginning to address  human capital challenges and, in many ways, is taking a far more  strategic approach to managing personnel. Through a variety of  initiatives, Congress, OPM, and individual agencies have strengthened  the federal human capital infrastructure. As a result of these  improvements, in 2011 we narrowed the focus of our high risk  assessment to closing current and emerging critical skills gaps. These  challenges must be addressed for agencies to cost-effectively execute  their missions and respond to emerging challenges.", "In short, while much progress has been made over the last 11 years in  modernizing federal human capital management, the job is far from over.  Making greater progress requires agencies to continue to address their  specific personnel challenges, as well as work with OPM and through the  CHCO Council to address critical skills gaps. Central to success will be  the continued attention of top-level leadership, effective planning,  responsive implementation, and robust measurement and evaluation, as  well as continued congressional oversight to hold agencies accountable  for results.", "Chairman Akaka, Ranking Member Johnson, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
