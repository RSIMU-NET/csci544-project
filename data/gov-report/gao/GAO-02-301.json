To meet an increase in demand of 1.7 percent annually through 2010, TVA estimates that it will need to expand its current generating capacity of 30,365 megawatts by 500 megawatts annually. Building new generating capacity can produce more emissions, which raises environment concerns. To lessen the need for new capacity, TVA and other electricity suppliers promote the efficient use of electricity through \"demand-side management\" programs, which seek to reduce the amount of energy consumed or to change the time of day when it is consumed. Even though TVA intends to increase its capacity to generate electricity through 2005, it also expects to reduce its SO2 and NOx emissions during the same time period, primarily by burning lower-sulfur coal, installing devices to control emissions at its existing plants, and relying on fuels other than coal for new capacity. Although TVA's demand-side management programs have allowed customers to cut their electrical consumption, these programs have made only modest contributions to reducing peak-time demand. TVA has limited the scope of its key program to reduce peak-time consumption by residential customers because TVA believes the program is not cost-effective. TVA projects that its demand-side programs will produce nearly twice as much in savings between 2001 and 2005 as was achieved in the previous five years. Other large utilities have more fully implemented the types of programs that TVA now has in place and have also implemented a greater array of demand-side management tools.

TVA estimates that demand  for its electricity will increase about 1.7 percent annually through 2010.", "To meet its customers\u2019 demand for electricity, TVA generates electricity  not only at its 11 coal-fired plants (consisting of 59 generating units), but  also three nuclear power plants (five units), 29 hydroelectric dams  (109 units), one pumped storage site (four units), and five sites with  combustion turbines (64 units). (See fig. 1.) It also generates power from  landfill gas, solar, and wind projects, and it purchases power from others.", "From the 30,365 megawatts of generating capacity available from these  sources, TVA generated about 156 billion kilowatt-hours of power in fiscal  year 2001. It also purchased roughly 9.9 billion kilowatt-hours of power.  Of its power supply, 60 percent came from coal, 27 percent from nuclear,  6 percent each from hydropower and power purchases, and 1 percent  from combustion turbines. (See fig. 2.)", "The share of electricity generated by burning fossil fuels has implications  for the environment. Burning fossil fuels produces SO2 and NOx gases,  and the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that fossil fuel  burning from utilities accounted for 67 percent of the nation\u2019s SO2  emissions and 27 percent of its NOx emissions in 1999. Both gases can be  transported over long distances following the patterns of air movements.  SO2 emissions contribute to the production of airborne sulfate particles  that contribute to acid rain, which can harm waters, forests, and materials.  In addition, these particles can block the transmission of light, resulting in  haze in urban areas and the degradation of scenic vistas in many national  parks. NOx is also a source of acid rain and, through chemical reactions in  the atmosphere with other pollutants, leads to the formation of ground- level ozone, the principal component of smog. Smog can cause chronic  human health effects, particularly respiratory problems, as well as  harming plants.", "TVA\u2019s choices in generating power are constrained by laws, regulations,  and internal policies. For example, the Clean Air Act, as amended, limits  emissions of SO2 and NOx from coal-fired power plants. Moreover, the  Tennessee Valley Authority Act, which established TVA, provides that the  generation of power from hydroelectric units is a lower priority than  navigation and flood control. Finally, an internal TVA policy limits the time  period when TVA can draw down the lakes (reservoirs) that it manages for  flood control and in the process generate hydropower.", "To meet its customers\u2019 increasing demand for electricity, TVA can upgrade  its existing plants, construct new plants, purchase power from others, or\u2014  as an alternative to finding additional supply sources\u2014provide incentives  to its customers\u2014called \u201cdemand-side management\u201d\u2014to reduce or shift  their demand for electricity.", "The Department of Energy defines demand-side management as actions  taken on the customer\u2019s side of the meter to change the amount or timing  of energy consumption and identifies several types of programs.", "Energy efficiency programs involve the use of technologies that reduce  total energy use, during both peak and off-peak periods, such as energy- efficient lighting, appliances, and building equipment.", "Peak load reduction programs focus on reducing load during periods of  peak power consumption on a utility\u2019s system. These programs can  involve the use of technologies that smooth out the peaks (called \u201cpeak  shaving\u201d) in energy demand. Such technologies include control systems,  such as switches attached to heating, cooling, and ventilation systems that  allow the systems to be turned off during peak load times. They can also  include rate-schedule programs where utilities structure their rates to  encourage customers to modify their pattern of energy use.", "According to the Department, utility funding for demand-side management  programs in the United States declined nationally between 1994 and 1998,  due in large part to increased competition and uncertainties regarding  electricity deregulation. Funding for these programs leveled out in 1999  and slightly increased in 2000 as concerns over electric supply shortages in  California led many utilities and state regulatory agencies to increase their  emphasis on demand-side management.", "TVA can benefit from demand-side management, especially reducing peak  loads, because electricity use varies substantially within a 24-hour period.  For example, on August 17, 2000, an unusually hot day, TVA customers  used about 67 percent more electricity during the hour of highest  consumption (4 p.m.) than the hour of lowest consumption (5 a.m.). TVA  used its various energy sources in a sequenced manner to supply this  electricity. (See fig. 3.) Nuclear facilities provided power steadily  throughout the day, while coal facilities provided power fairly  consistently\u2014somewhat lower at night and higher during the day. As  demand increased during the afternoon, TVA increased the use of  hydroelectric power and it purchased power from other utilities.

(See fig. 4.) According to a TVA official, the expected  increase after 2003 is directly related to planned increases in generating  capacity at its coal plants. TVA attributes overall projected declines in SO2  emissions to the continued switching to coal with lower sulfur content at  three plants. Specifically, the lower sulfur coal is 0.5 to 0.6 percent sulfur,  about half the sulfur content of the coal that is currently burned at these  units. Moreover, according to the same official, even though SO2  emissions will increase slightly from 2003 to 2005, the average emissions  rate will remain unchanged during this period.", "Beyond 2005, TVA has committed to further reduce SO2 emissions.

TVA\u2019s emissions dropped from 2,212,000 tons in 1974 to 727,000  tons in 2000, and are expected to drop to 406,000 tons in 2010. This  represents an 82-percent decrease over the entire period.", "TVA\u2019s two primary means for reducing SO2 emissions from its coal- burning plants are (1) installing scrubbers that remove sulfur from  smokestack gases and (2) decreasing the sulfur content of the coal it burns  to generate electricity.", "Between 1974 and 1995, when TVA reduced its annual emissions from  2,212,000 tons to 876,000 tons, there were notable decreases in 1978, 1982,  1984, and 1995. These decreases reflect the installation of scrubbers at  TVA\u2019s two largest plants (Cumberland in Tennessee and Paradise in  Kentucky), as well as at Widow\u2019s Creek in Alabama, in those years.  Between 1995 and 2000, TVA further reduced its annual emissions to  727,000 tons, without adding any more scrubbers, by switching to lower- sulfur coal. Over those 5 years, TVA lowered the average sulfur content of  its coal purchases from 2.26 percent to 1.88 percent. This decrease of  about 17 percent is roughly equal to the proportional decline of SO2  emissions during that period.", "Between 2000 and 2010, TVA plans to use both strategies to further reduce  its SO2 emissions. Through 2005, TVA plans to reduce its annual emissions  to 525,000 tons, by continuing to switch to lower-sulfur coal. Beyond 2005,  TVA plans to further reduce its emissions, by installing five scrubbers on  12 units at four coal-fired plants. This will increase to 60 percent the share  of TVA\u2019s coal-fired capacity operating with scrubbers.", "According to TVA, in 2001, TVA emitted SO2 at a rate of 1.18 pounds per  million British thermal units of fuel energy. TVA expects the rate will  decline to below 0.8 pounds per million units in 2010.
