Specifically, most QHP enrollees who obtained their coverage through the exchanges reported overall satisfaction with their plans in 2014 through 2016, according to three national surveys. The surveys reported that QHP enrollees' satisfaction with their plans was either somewhat lower than or was similar to that of those enrolled in employer-sponsored health insurance in 2015 and 2016. To varying degrees, QHP enrollees expressed satisfaction with specific aspects of their plan, including their coverage and choice of providers, and plan affordability. Stakeholders\u2014including experts, state departments of insurance, and others GAO interviewed\u2014and literature GAO reviewed also revealed some concerns about QHP enrollee experiences. Some enrollees found it too expensive to pay for their out-of-pocket expenses before reaching their deductibles and have reported concerns about affording care or have been deterred from seeking care, according to experts. Some enrollees have faced difficulties understanding their QHP's coverage terminology and others have faced problems accessing care after enrollment, according to stakeholders and literature reviewed. These issues have also been identified in literature as longstanding concerns of the private health insurance market.", "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and selected states GAO reviewed have monitored enrollees' post-enrollment experiences by reviewing information reported by consumers and consumer assisters. For example, CMS uses information collected from enrollees through its Marketplace Call Center\u2014where exchange enrollees may call to request agency assistance in resolving concerns. CMS officials said that they use this information to identify trends in enrollees' post-enrollment experiences and ensure that enrollee concerns are resolved in a timely manner. They began using it in 2016 to identify issuers for compliance reviews. Similarly, officials from the five selected states' departments of insurance reported tracking consumer complaints by issuer and working to resolve all reported issues. CMS developed a survey that was administered to a sample of QHP enrollees nationwide in 2015 and 2016, to gather information about their experiences with their plans. According to CMS officials, the agency expects to use results of its 2017 and future surveys to inform its monitoring of issuers. In addition, QHP enrollees in Vermont were surveyed with respect to their satisfaction in 2015; state officials reported using the results to inform their prioritization of work. CMS and selected states also reported monitoring enrollee experiences with information received from consumer assisters\u2014including navigators\u2014who interact directly with QHP enrollees.

Through this  process, we identified and reviewed the results of five national surveys of  QHP enrollees who obtained their coverage through the exchanges; the  surveys were administered between 2014 and 2016. To assess the  reliability of the data presented from these surveys, we interviewed or  corresponded with the authors of all of the survey reports, reviewed  supporting documentation to understand what the surveys measured, and  we examined the data for apparent errors.

CMS officials told us that they work with individual issuers  to ensure that cases are resolved in a timely manner and the causes of  any casework trends are addressed. For example, CMS has a monthly  call with issuers to discuss casework trends and strategies to improve  consumer experiences, in addition to providing ongoing technical  assistance with specific casework issues, according to CMS officials.", "In addition to reviewing casework to resolve individual enrollee concerns,  CMS officials we interviewed reported reviewing casework data relevant  to their oversight responsibilities of issuers. For example, prior to  conducting any issuer compliance reviews, CMS officials told us that they  review relevant casework data, such as complaints, for the issuer.

Specifically, CMS developed a survey, which was administered to a  sample of QHP enrollees nationwide, including those in FFE and SBE  states, about their experiences with their plans in 2015 and 2016. CMS  designed the survey to capture accurate and reliable information from  consumers about their experiences with the health care and services they  had received through their QHP and to allow for effective oversight,  among other purposes. The survey, which was beta-tested in 2015, was  administered to enrollees of QHPs with more than 500 enrollees. It  included a core set of questions for enrollees on key areas of care and  service, including overall rating of their QHP, the availability of information  about their health plan and costs of care, how well they were able to get  needed care, and the accessibility of information in a needed language or  format. CMS officials told us that they ultimately expect the results of their  2017 and future surveys to, among other things, inform the agency\u2019s  monitoring of enrollee post-enrollment experiences, as well as their  monitoring of issuers beginning in 2017. For example, CMS officials told  us that they expect to use survey results to identify issues in enrollee  overall satisfaction and access to care.

Specifically, as mentioned earlier in  this report, Vermont QHP enrollees were surveyed in 2015 to assess their  satisfaction with their QHP. Officials from the state\u2019s exchange office told  us that they used the survey results to inform their prioritization of work  related to improving enrollee experiences, such as developing better  methods to educate enrollees on financial literacy and health insurance  information, and to work with issuers to ensure that consumers with  complaints are using the appropriate channels for filing them. While they  have no plans to repeat the survey, officials from the state\u2019s exchange  office told us that they plan to add questions to another statewide survey  that is conducted every two years or develop a shorter survey as an  attempt to monitor QHP enrollee experiences over time.

In  addition, post-enrollment issues are occasionally discussed during weekly  meetings that CMS officials hold with navigators to discuss their ongoing  work, according to CMS officials and navigators we interviewed.

Specifically, CMS circulates weekly newsletters to  federally funded navigator grantees that address current areas of interest  among navigators. Recent topics in these newsletters have included  conducting culturally competent outreach and the appeals process. One  navigator we interviewed told us they found these newsletters helpful  because they explained relevant issues and presented solutions.
