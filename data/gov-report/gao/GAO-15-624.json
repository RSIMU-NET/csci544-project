Agencies are required to use standard terms established by the  Comptroller General, in consultation with OMB, in providing fiscal, budget,  and program information to Congress. The Comptroller General has  established the following definition of life-cycle cost: \u201cThe overall  estimated cost, both government and contractor, for a particular program  alternative over the time period corresponding to the life of the program,  including direct and indirect initial costs plus any periodic or continuing  costs of operation and maintenance.\u201d OMB\u2019s Capital Programming  Guide applies this definition to capital assets: \u201cThe cost of a capital asset  is its full life-cycle cost, including all direct and indirect costs for planning,  procurement (purchase price and all other costs incurred to bring it to a  form and location suitable for its intended use), operations and  maintenance (including service contracts), and disposal.\u201d", "IRS did not report data that are consistent with the required definition of  \u201clife-cycle cost\u201d or offer an alternative definition.

For other  investments, these amounts represent estimated costs for the current  fiscal year and 2 future fiscal years. According to IRS officials responsible  for preparing this portion of the CJ, they did not consider how long the  investment was expected to last when deciding which estimates to report.  Instead, they reported full life-cycle cost estimates when such estimates  were available. When such estimates were not available, the officials  reported 3-year estimates. However, the CJ identifies all investments\u2019  reported life-cycle costs as representing full life-cycle costs.", "In addition, IRS did not explain the meaning of the term \u201cprojected useful  life of the current asset\u201d in the CJ.

In order for this performance  information to be useful to Congress, the metrics reported in the CJ need  to have the basic attributes of successful performance measures.

In some cases, the reported year may represent a  projection of the useful life of the investment. However, according to an  official in IRS\u2019s Information Technology office, different people are  responsible for reporting on different investments, and they may report  information according to different understandings of the meaning of the  term \u201cprojected useful life of the current asset.\u201d The years reported in the  CJ under \u201cprojected useful life of the current asset\u201d for the 20 listed major  IT investments are the following: 2017 (1 investment), 2018 (2  investments), 2019 (10 investments), 2020 (5 investments), 2021 (1  investment), and 2034 (1 investment).", "As a result of this arbitrary process for reporting projected useful life,  some of the information reported in the CJ is inconsistent with IRS\u2019s plans  for its major IT investments. For example, according to IRS Information  Technology officials, they plan to continue using the Return Review  Program after the Electronic Fraud Detection System is no longer in use.  However, the fiscal year 2016 CJ reports a \u201cprojected useful life of the  current asset\u201d of 2020 for the Return Review Program and a later date,  2021, for the Electronic Fraud Detection System. This sequence of dates  is inconsistent with the plan to stop using the Electronic Fraud Detection  System while continuing to use the Return Review Program.

The cost estimate totals  $2.72 billion (adjusted for inflation) from mid-fiscal year 2014 through  fiscal year 2026; when prior years are included, the estimate increases to  $3.43 billion from fiscal years 2010 through 2026 (adjusted for inflation).  This updated cost estimate is a significant increase from the previous  total of $1.89 billion (not adjusted for inflation) from fiscal years 2010  through 2026. According to IRS officials, this increase is due to a  change in the scope of PPACA implementation activities which resulted in  additional releases. For example, the new releases respond to regulatory  changes in the requirements for the Small Business Health Options  Program, add in the cost of sending preliminary notices to employers not  offering employee coverage, and take into account the implementation of  the excise tax on high-cost health plans that will begin in 2018.
