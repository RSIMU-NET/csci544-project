Many more contracted hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV). While these diseases have been transmitted in many fewer cases since the introduction of antibody tests and viral inactivation and removal processes, some safety concerns remain.", "One of these concerns relates to plasma donors, who are unpaid or paid. Through the volunteer sector, unpaid donors give whole blood, from which the plasma may be separated and sent for further manufacturing into plasma products. The commercial sector collects plasma from paid donors, known as source plasma, for manufacture into these same products. Some source plasma is also collected from unpaid donors. There has been a long-standing concern that the infectious disease rates among paid donors might be higher than those of volunteer donors because paid donors may have a financial incentive to conceal risk factors that would prevent them from donating. Concerns have also been raised about the number of donors to whom a recipient is exposed because the products are manufactured by pooling many donations. Further, the efficacy of viral clearance procedures used in manufacturing and the safety record of the manufacturers clearly affect the ultimate safety of the products.", "In light of these concerns, you asked us to undertake a study to (1) compare the risk of incorporating an infectious unit of plasma into further manufacturing from volunteer versus paid plasma donors for HIV, HBV, and HCV; (2) examine the impacts on frequent and infrequent plasma users when pooling large numbers of plasma donations into manufactured plasma products; (3) assess the safety of end products from plasma after they have undergone further manufacturing and inactivation steps to kill or remove viruses; and (4) examine the recent regulatory compliance history of plasma manufacturers.", "In developing our information, we interviewed representatives of the volunteer and commercial plasma sector and officials of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

We obtained data from industry representatives from which we calculated the chances of incorporating an infectious unit of plasma into further manufacturing from volunteer and paid donors. We did not independently verify data on infectious disease rates, but they are the most current and complete data available.

This process separates plasma proteins based on the inherent differences of each protein. Fractionation involves changing the conditions of the pool (for example, the temperature or the acidity) so that proteins that are normally dissolved in the plasma fluid become insoluble, forming large clumps called precipitate. The insoluble protein can be collected by spinning the solution at high speeds or through filtration. One of the most effective ways for carrying out this process is the addition of alcohol to the plasma pool while simultaneously cooling the pool. For this reason, the process is sometimes called cold alcohol fractionation or ethanol fractionation. This procedure is carried out in a series of steps so that a single pool of plasma yields several different protein products such as albumin and immune globulins.", "It is estimated that each year, as many as a million patients rely on products manufactured from human plasma: more than 400,000 are given albumin, 15,000 to 18,000 are given factor VIII, 3,000 to 5,000 receive factor IX, greater than 20,000 receive immune globulin intravenous (IGIV), and an estimated 100,000 to 500,000 receive immune globulin intramuscular (IGIM).

Donors with repeatedly reactive test results are rejected from further donations. (See app. II for more information on testing procedures.)

PCR is used to amplify the number of copies of a specific region of DNA or RNA in order to produce enough DNA or RNA to be adequately tested. This technique appears to be able to identify, with a very high probability, disease-causing viruses such as HIV, HBV, and HCV. Because PCR testing detects virus particles at the genetic level, infected donors can be identified days or even months sooner than if only traditional antibody or antigen testing is performed, thus shortening the window period.

This is due to higher HCV rates among paid donors. Units that test positive are excluded. The incidence rate of collecting infectious units from donors who are in the window period between the time they become infected and the time they test positive is much higher among paid plasma donors than among volunteer donors. However, a number of safety initiatives have been instituted by paid plasma centers that greatly reduce the likelihood of infectious units being pooled for manufacturing. Nevertheless, the final\u2014or residual\u2014risk of an infectious unit entering a plasma pool remains somewhat higher for paid donors than for volunteer donors.", "There are at least four potential ways in which viral agents go undetected during donation and may thus be transmitted through blood products.First, there exists a very rare chronic carrier state in which a clinically asymptomatic, yet infectious, donor will persistently test negative on a donation screening test. Second, a viral agent may have a large degree of genetic diversity so that laboratory screening tests fail to identify some infectious donors who harbor an atypical genetic variant. Third, laboratory error in performing screening tests may occur, allowing positive units to be made available for transfusion. Finally, the donor may have a negative laboratory test during the window period before the virus is detected by currently licensed screening tests. The majority of cases in which an infectious donation will be included in a plasma pool is a result of this last circumstance. As a result, modeling techniques have been developed to determine the risk estimates of incorporating these infectious window period units into the blood supply.", "To determine the marker rate for HIV in plasma donations, we obtained data from California\u2019s Department of Health Services (DHS), which collects information on these rates for volunteer blood donors and paid donors at plasma collection facilities.

Donations at plasma centers showed a higher rate of testing positive for HIV-1 than did donations at blood banks. Plasma centers had an HIV-1 rate of .0266 percent (26.6 per 100,000 units tested), while units collected at blood banks had a rate of .0032 percent (3.2 per 100,000 units tested). Thus, California plasma centers had over an eight-fold higher rate of HIV-1 positive donations than blood banks had among their volunteer donors.", "For both blood banks and plasma centers in California, the seroprevalence rates for HIV have decreased significantly over time. More than 7 million units were tested at California blood banks between 1990 and 1996. Over this period, HIV-1 seroprevalence among donors declined from .015 percent to .003 percent. Over 4.5 million units were tested at California plasma centers during this same time frame. The HIV-1 seroprevalence among plasma donors declined during this period from .056 percent in 1990 to .027 percent in the second half of 1996. However, while the rates of HIV are dropping in both groups, there is a consistent pattern of higher marker rates among paid donors than among volunteer donors.

One-time donors are a concern because some data show that the rates of viral infection are much higher among such donors. The individuals may either not be aware that they are infected or may be test-seeking. Donors in the window period are a concern because they may not be aware of their infection and the screening tests will not detect the infection.", "The first voluntary initiative, implemented in July 1997, eliminates the use of plasma from one-time donors. This standard requires that no units of plasma can be accepted for further processing unless the donor has successfully passed at least two health history interviews and two panels of all required screening tests within a 6-month period. Qualified donors are those who have passed through these criteria. Applicant donors, on the other hand, are individuals presenting themselves who have not been previously qualified as a donor in the past 6 months.", "This standard on first-time donors does not apply to volunteer donors. Neither the American Red Cross nor America\u2019s Blood Centers imposes such a requirement for the use of plasma recovered from whole blood donations. Because the patterns of donation are very different for volunteer whole blood donors (who can donate no more frequently than once every 8 weeks) compared with paid plasma donors (who can donate as often as twice a week), the volunteer sector does not view a restriction that would require holding plasma until a donor returns to be a practical requirement. In fact, the average interval between donations for an American Red Cross donor is about 5 months.", "A second industry initiative is an inventory hold program that holds source plasma donations for 60 days. During this time, if a donor seroconverts and subsequently tests positive\u2014or is otherwise disqualified\u2014the earlier donation can be retrieved from inventory and destroyed. This standard, however, does not establish a true quarantine program that would exclude units from donors in the window period of infection, when viral infection cannot be determined. A donor who was within the window period could return 2 days after the initial donation, pass both health history interviews and screening tests, and contribute infected units that would be used after 60 days, if the donor were not tested again at a time outside the window period. The data provided to us for estimating risks for source plasma donations take this possibility into account.", "Furthermore, the 60-day inventory hold period does not appear to be adequate for all viruses under consideration, based on published data. The window period for HIV, HBV, and HCV, using detection of seroconversion as an end point, are approximately 22 days, 59 days, and 82 days, respectively. Thus, the 60-day hold period does not encompass the window period for HCV and is barely within the limit for HBV. However, the majority of window period units would be interdicted as most of these would fall within the 60-day hold period. PCR testing would close the window period for these viruses to approximately 11 days for HIV, 34 days for HBV, and 23 days for HCV.

For example, albumin can be added during intermediate processing steps or to a final product, such as factor VIII, for use as an excipient or stabilizer. This albumin often has been derived from another plasma pool that contains donations from others that are not part of the original pool.", "As a result of the concerns raised about pool size, the four major plasma fractionators have voluntarily committed to reducing the size of plasma pools (measured by total number of donors) to 60,000 for all currently licensed U.S. plasma products, including factor VIII, factor IX, albumin, and IGIV. This measurement takes into account the composition of starting pools, the combining of intermediates from multiple pools, and the use of plasma derivatives as additives or stabilizers in the manufacturing process. However, prior production streams are still being processed and distributed; as a result, products distributed through the end of 1998 may have been produced from pools that exceeded the 60,000-donor limit.", "The American Red Cross has also chosen to voluntarily reduce the size of the plasma pools from which its products are manufactured. As a policy, the American Red Cross has a 60,000-donor limit for plasma products that are further manufactured by Baxter Healthcare.

For frequent users of plasma products (100 infusions), this same pool size of 10,000 would yield an 86 in 100 chance of exposure to that agent, based on an assumption that the products would come from different pools. This effect is not significantly decreased by reducing the number of donors in a pool. Table 10 shows the effect of manufacturing scale on risk of exposure.", "These modeling data suggest that smaller plasma pool sizes will reduce the likelihood of transmission of viral agents to infrequent users of plasma products but will not have a major effect on those who are frequent recipients of such products.", "It is also important to note that risk of exposure does not always equate with risk of infection. In fact, risk of exposure is always greater than or equal to risk of infection. For example, the recent transmission of HCV by a plasma derivative that had not undergone viral inactivation procedures showed that the risk of seroconversion of recipients of this product increased with the number of positive HCV lots infused and the quantity of HCV viral material infused. However, not all recipients were infected; the highest percentage of seroconversions seen with the highest levels of HCV virus infused did not exceed 30 percent.", "The reasons for not observing seroconversions in 100 percent of the recipients may be due to two factors: (1) the recipient\u2019s dose and (2) the reduction of infectiousness related to steps in the manufacture of the product in addition to viral removal and inactivation, such as duration of storage."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Risk of Infection Reduced Through Viral Inactivation and Removal Techniques", "paragraphs": ["Since it is possible that certain infectious units could make it through the donor screening, deferral, and testing process, manufacturers have introduced additional steps in the fractionation process to inactivate or remove viruses and bacteria that may have made their way into plasma pools.

However, they are only partially effective against nonenveloped viruses, such as HAV and human parvovirus.", "All plasma components listed in table 1 undergo viral inactivation or removal steps during the manufacturing process. To be effective, inactivation techniques must disrupt the virus, rendering it noninfectious. The two main inactivation techniques are heat treatment and solvent-detergent treatment. Heat treatment is accomplished either by exposing the freeze-dried product to dry heat or suspending it in a solution. Another technique heats the completely soluble liquid product with the addition of various stabilizers, such as sucrose and glycine. The second technique, solvent-detergent washing, exposes the product to an organic solvent to dissolve the lipid coat of viruses, rendering them inactive without destroying the plasma-derived products. The lipid membrane contains critical viral proteins needed for infection of host cells. Disrupting the viral lipid envelope renders the virus noninfectious. However, solvent-detergent inactivation is only partially effective in eliminating non-lipid-coated viruses, such as HAV or human parvovirus.", "To disable the virus without inactivating plasma derivatives, a delicate balance in these procedures must be maintained. Heat and chemicals are particularly damaging to plasma proteins. A number of potentially safer methods are in use or under investigation. These include the use of filters to remove virus particles on the basis of the size of the virus; antibodies to capture the desired protein, while the viruses and unwanted components are washed away; and irradiation to inactivate viruses. Virucidal agents that can be removed during further manufacturing and exposure to ultraviolet light may also be safer methods for disabling viruses.

It is based on the amount of virus that is killed or removed and, therefore, the extent to which these processes eliminate viruses through manufacturing. Individual manufacturing steps can be specifically designed for viral clearance or they may be intended primarily as a purification process that will also assist in killing or removing viral agents. To meet FDA approval of their particular inactivation or removal technique, manufacturers must separately validate each clearance step.", "The viral inactivation and removal steps currently in use have all been demonstrated to reduce the levels of virus and, in many cases, likely eliminate them.

While theoretically even a single virus is capable of causing infection, research has shown that infection is much more likely to occur with higher concentrations of virus.
