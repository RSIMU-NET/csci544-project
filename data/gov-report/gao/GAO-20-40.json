With regard to opioid use disorder (OUD), GAO found that six selected state Medicaid programs provide coverage of a range of services for eligible pregnant women with OUD. Specifically, the six states\u2014Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Massachusetts, South Dakota, and Texas\u2014covered OUD services, such as screening for opioid use, counseling, and medication-assisted treatment, which combines the use of medications with counseling. In the six selected states, women who are eligible for Medicaid coverage after 60 days postpartum can receive most of the same OUD services that were covered during pregnancy. Furthermore, GAO found that the six selected states also use other sources of funding, such as federal grants, to provide coverage of OUD services for postpartum women who are not eligible for Medicaid. GAO did not review how frequently the OUD services were actually provided to pregnant and postpartum women.", "GAO found that the state Medicaid programs in all six selected states cover annual screenings for substance use, which includes opioid use, for eligible children. This coverage is provided as part of Medicaid's Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment benefit, under which all states are required to cover certain screenings for eligible children under age 21.", "GAO also found that Medicaid programs in 31 states and the District of Columbia covered OUD services, including screenings, delivered through telehealth in schools. However, state Medicaid officials said they were not aware of any instances of these services being utilized through telehealth in schools. Telehealth can be used to provide clinical care remotely, such as for screening, counseling, and therapy. Such services could be provided, for example, via a video conference on a desktop computer or laptop that connects a student in school with a provider in another location. State officials and experts cited both benefits and challenges with providing OUD services through telehealth in schools. For example, benefits included addressing provider shortages, particularly in rural areas, as well as reducing the amount of time students spend outside of the classroom accessing services. Challenges included lack of needed infrastructure and provider discomfort with using telehealth. Agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have recently issued guidance emphasizing the use of telehealth for OUD services, particularly in schools."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The misuse of and addiction to prescription opioid pain relievers and illicit  opioids, such as heroin, have contributed to increases in opioid use  disorder (OUD), as well as overdose deaths, in the United States.

Low-income pregnant and postpartum women,  as well as children, are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of  OUD. Pregnant women with OUD face a high risk of poor neonatal  outcomes, such as having preterm labor or having a newborn with  neonatal abstinence syndrome, and have an increased risk of overdose  during the postpartum period.", "Medicaid, the federal-state program that finances health care coverage  for low-income and medically needy populations (including eligible  pregnant women and children), plays a key role in covering services for  the treatment of OUD.

Nevertheless, opioids caused  over half of drug overdoses among youth in 2017. According to the Office  of National Drug Control Policy, the most effective way to mitigate the  costs associated with illicit drug use is through prevention, which includes  having primary care providers screen and intervene with patients at risk  for opioid use.

Texas is using  SAMHSA grant funding to support eight youth recovery centers that  are intended to improve services and recovery supports for youth with  substance use disorder, including OUD."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Over 30 States Reported Medicaid Coverage of Opioid Use Disorder Services Delivered through Telehealth in Schools, but No Evidence Services are Being Used", "paragraphs": ["We conducted outreach to Medicaid officials from all 50 states and the  District of Columbia between February and July 2019 to inquire about  whether the state provided Medicaid coverage of OUD services delivered  via telehealth in schools as a means of increasing access to these  services for children. Officials from 31 states and the District of Columbia  reported that they provide Medicaid coverage of OUD services delivered  in schools via telehealth. Medicaid officials from some states reported  that their Medicaid policies explicitly allow for coverage of OUD services  provided in schools via telehealth, while others reported that they allow  for Medicaid coverage of these services, but their policies do not explicitly  address the issue. (See app. I for the state responses regarding Medicaid  coverage of OUD services provided in schools via telehealth.)", "Officials from the remaining 18 states reported that their Medicaid policies  do not allow for payment for OUD services delivered in schools via  telehealth. Some of these state officials reported that they did not allow  schools to serve as a location for patient services during a telehealth visit  for Medicaid payment purposes. Other state officials reported that they  allowed Medicaid payment for certain services provided in schools via  telehealth, but OUD services were not among them. For example, officials  from Texas said the state established a school-based telehealth program  for behavioral health services. However, this program does not include  services for the treatment of substance use disorder, including OUD.  Officials added that the state has a requirement that substance use  disorder services can only be delivered in certain approved facilities.", "While Medicaid officials from 31 states and the District of Columbia  reported that they provide Medicaid coverage of OUD services in schools  via telehealth, they also said they were not aware of any instances of  these services being utilized. Medicaid officials from the 31 states and the  District of Columbia reported that either these services were not being  provided based on data or other information they had, or they were  unaware if the services were being provided. Officials from seven states  responded that they either reviewed Medicaid utilization data or asked  school-based staff and determined that there was no utilization of these  services. For example, officials from one state\u2014Ohio\u2014conducted a data  query and found that in 2018 there had been two instances of substance  use disorder services billed to Medicaid that were delivered via telehealth  in a school. However, officials noted that these instances involved  treatment for substances other than opioids. While not for OUD, these  two instances were the only instances of Medicaid payment for substance  use disorder services delivered via telehealth in schools that we identified  in our review.", "As part of our outreach to states and background research, we did find  that some states or localities have taken steps to facilitate the use of  telehealth for delivery of substance use disorder services, including OUD,  in schools. For example:", "Officials from one county in Maryland said they recently began using a  telehealth smart device application to screen students in schools for  substance use disorder, including OUD, and refer them to treatment.  However, county officials said that the program was locally funded,  and they had not considered seeking Medicaid payment.", "A South Dakota tribal reservation recently implemented a new school- based telehealth program for behavioral health. According to officials,  this program could include OUD services delivered via telehealth in  schools, and these services could be billed to Medicaid if the provider  was already licensed to bill Medicaid; however, officials said that none  of these services had been provided to date.", "Massachusetts recently expanded its Medicaid telehealth policy to  allow for the payment of mental health and substance use disorder  services provided in many locations, including schools. However,  officials said the state was still building the telehealth infrastructure,  and services had not yet been provided at the time of our review.  Officials were unsure whether OUD services would be delivered via  telehealth in schools under the new policy once implementation  began.", "State officials and subject matter experts that we spoke with also reported  a range of potential benefits and challenges associated with providing  substance use disorder services, including OUD services, in schools via  telehealth. (See table 1.)", "There have also been federal efforts to emphasize the use of telehealth to  improve access to OUD services for children. For example, these efforts  include the following:  In June 2018, CMS issued guidance emphasizing the use of  telehealth as a means of improving access to OUD services and  noted that states need not necessarily submit a change to their state  plan to begin delivering covered Medicaid services through  telehealth. Similar to what we heard from experts, this guidance  suggests that leveraging technology to provide such services might  help with addressing provider shortages, particularly in rural areas.", "In July 2019, CMS and SAMHSA jointly issued guidance on  addressing mental health and substance issues in schools. The  guidance states that telehealth for mental health services in schools  has been found to be effective. This guidance also emphasizes that  telehealth can be helpful for ensuring that Medicaid services are  provided to Medicaid beneficiaries who are in rural areas or in areas  where qualified practitioners are scarce.", "HRSA officials we spoke with also described several different HRSA  programs from which funds could be used to facilitate or deliver  substance use disorder services via telehealth, including in some  school-based health centers; however, the officials were not able to  determine whether telehealth is being utilized to deliver OUD services  in school-based health centers, specifically.", "The SUPPORT Act also includes a provision for HHS to issue guidance  to states on Medicaid coverage of substance use disorder services  delivered via telehealth, including in school-based health centers, by fall  of 2019."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for review.
