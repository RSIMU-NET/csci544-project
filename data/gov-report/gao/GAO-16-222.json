GAO's previous work on overlap, duplication, and fragmentation has shown that interagency coordination on interrelated programs can help ensure efficient use of resources and effective programs. However, FCC and USDA do not coordinate to develop joint outreach and training. This could result in an inefficient use of federal resources and missed opportunities for resource leveraging between FCC and USDA.", "FCC has placed special emphasis on improving Internet access on tribal lands following the issuance of the National Broadband Plan, which called for greater efforts to make broadband available on tribal lands. However, FCC has not developed performance goals and measures for improving high-speed Internet availability to households on tribal lands. Without these goals and measures FCC cannot assess the impact of its efforts. The National Broadband Map includes data on Internet availability on tribal lands that could allow FCC to establish baseline measures for Internet availability on tribal lands. Further, FCC also lacks performance goals and measures for tribal institutions\u2014such as schools and libraries. Specifically, FCC's E-rate program provides funds to ensure that schools and libraries have affordable access to modern broadband technologies, but FCC has not set any performance goals for the program's impact on tribal institutions.

For the three Alaska Native regions, we visited villages within  each region and spoke with officials from the Regional Corporation,  regional nonprofit, Village Corporation, tribal government, and city  government.  To identify tribes to interview, we reviewed the types and  amounts of assistance provided by FCC and USDA between fiscal years  2010 and 2014 and Bureau of the Census (Census) 2013 data regarding  population and poverty rates.

The federal  government has recognized many American Indian tribes and Alaska  Native Villages as distinct, independent political communities with  inherent sovereignty. Tribal lands vary in size, demographics, and  location. The smallest are less than one square mile, and the largest, the  Navajo Nation, is more than 24,000 square miles. Most tribal lands are in  remote, rural locations, but some are located near urban areas.  There  are more than 300 Indian tribes in the continental United States and more  than 200 Alaska Native Villages that are federally recognized. The tribal  government has the option of forming entities that manage tribal affairs  including schools, housing, health, and economic enterprises.  Additionally, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 directed the  establishment of 12 regional corporations representing geographic  regions of the entire state to, among other things, resolve long-standing  aboriginal land claims and foster economic development in Alaska.   These corporations distribute land and monetary benefits to Alaska  Natives to provide a fair and just settlement of aboriginal land claims in  Alaska. The regional corporations have corresponding nonprofit  organizations that provide social services to the villages.  Figure 1 shows  tribal lands in the United States according to the 2010 Census, and the  Alaska Native regions.", "Native Americans are among the most economically distressed groups in  the United States.  According to the Census\u2019 2014 American Community  Survey (ACS), about 28.3 percent of Native Americans live in households  with incomes below the federal poverty level\u2014compared to 15.5 percent  for the U.S. population as a whole. In addition, ACS data shows that  residents of tribal lands often lack basic infrastructure, such as water and  sewer systems, and telecommunications services. We reported in 2006  that tribal officials and government agencies said that conditions on tribal  lands have made successful economic development more difficult than in  other parts of the country because the high cost and small markets  associated with investment on tribal lands deter business investment.  We  found that this was particularly true for businesses such as Internet  providers that must build out infrastructure to serve tribal lands.", "Customers generally subscribe to Internet through a fixed or mobile  device. In-home fixed Internet plans are often sold as a monthly  subscription by cable television or telephone companies. Consumers can  connect a variety of devices to in-home fixed networks through a wired or  wireless connection.  Service is provided via different types of technology.  Service from cable television companies is generally provided through the  same coaxial cables that deliver television programming. Service from  telephone companies is generally provided through traditional copper  telephone lines\u2014commonly referred to as digital subscriber line (DSL)  service\u2014or fiber-optic lines, which convert electrical signals carrying data  into light and send the light through glass fibers. In areas where none of  these wired connections exist, some carriers offer fixed wireless devices  for home use. Advances in technology, such as the use of fiber optics and  new wireless technologies have allowed providers to offer increasingly  faster high-speed Internet that supports new services and applications  such as streaming video.  Only these faster speeds attained through fiber  and other new technologies are considered high-speed Internet. In 2010,  FCC stated that every household and business in America should have  access to affordable advanced telecommunication service with a speed of  at least 4 Mbps download and at least 1 Mbps upload and that this target  should be re-set every four years.  In January 2015, FCC adopted a  speed benchmark at download speeds of at least 25 Mbps and upload  speeds of at least 3 Mbps.  Generally, only cable or fiber can deliver this  level of broadband service to consumers\u2019 homes.", "Mobile service is provided through cell tower coverage with data  transmitted over the radio spectrum.  Traditionally, mobile service  providers sold access to the Internet as an option to mobile telephone  service plans. A number of devices may connect to mobile high-speed  networks, such as smart phones, tablets, and mobile devices that enable  laptops to connect to a wireless service.", "The federal government has recognized the difficulties of providing  services on tribal lands, and has maintained several ongoing programs to  increase Internet availability and access in unserved areas.  The USDA\u2019s  Rural Utilities Service (RUS) and FCC are responsible for several  programs designed to improve the nation\u2019s telecommunications  infrastructure.  RUS\u2019s programs focus on rural telecommunications  development, while FCC\u2019s programs under the Universal Service Fund  (USF) focus on providing support for areas where the cost of providing  services is high, as well as for low-income consumers, schools, libraries,  and rural health care facilities.  All of these programs, which are  discussed in more detail later in this report, seek to expand high-speed  Internet access and can benefit tribal lands and their populations.", "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act)  authorized other, one-time federal programs such as the Broadband  Initiatives Program and the Broadband Technologies Opportunities  Program to expand high-speed Internet access in unserved areas,  including on tribal lands.  The Recovery Act also directed FCC to develop  a national broadband plan to ensure every American had access to high- speed Internet service.  In March 2010, FCC issued the National  Broadband Plan that included a centralized vision for achieving  affordability and maximizing use of high-speed Internet to advance  community development, health care delivery, education, job creation,  and other national purposes.  With regard to tribal lands, the Plan  recommended that the Commission increase its commitment to  government-to-government consultation with tribal leaders and consider  increasing tribal representation in telecommunications planning.  In July  2010, FCC announced the creation of the Office of Native Affairs and  Policy.  The office was tasked to promote the deployment and adoption of  communication services and technologies throughout tribal lands and  native communities, by, among other things, ensuring the recommended  consultation with tribal governments and native organizations.

FCC also found that  community access to Internet services is critical in facilitating job  placement, career advancement, and other uses that help to stimulate  economic activity. For example, a resident of an Alaska Native Village  operates a tour company and stated that the booking, communication,  and advertising of the business are completely reliant on a satellite  Internet connection. However, the unreliable Internet service quality  made booking customers and working with online tourism companies  challenging.", "Education: Officials from many tribes stated that high-speed Internet  access at schools supports educational success. For example, access  can allow students to conduct online testing or to watch online  lectures, according to officials from two tribes we interviewed. In  addition, officials from some tribes said that students who had access  at school, but not at home were disadvantaged compared to their  peers who had access at home.", "Health: About half of the tribes said that high-speed Internet access to  support telemedicine was important to the tribe, particularly in rural or  remote areas.", "Officials from all of the tribes we interviewed also said that Internet  service existed on at least some of their lands at varying connection  speeds, ranging from less than 1 Mbps to over 25 Mbps. Some of the  tribes we interviewed had at least some fiber optic high-speed Internet  connections while the others had slower copper lines, only mobile  service, or only satellite service. Moreover, while many of the tribal lands  where we held interviews had some level of mobile Internet service, only  a few tribal lands had 4G mobile high-speed Internet services and a few  others had no mobile service. Further, officials from about half of the  tribes we interviewed described important limitations to their Internet  services, including higher than usual costs, small data allocations, slow  download speeds, and unreliable connections. For example, officials from  the Quileute tribe said that connection problems caused by heavily  congested networks forced them to upload the required reports to federal  grant websites after regular business hours."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Tribes and Providers Said that Rugged and Remote Terrain are Barriers for Increasing Internet Access on Tribal Lands", "paragraphs": ["The interrelated barriers of rugged terrain and rural location characteristic  of many tribal lands, as well as tribal members\u2019 limited ability to pay for  high-speed Internet service were tribes\u2019 and private providers\u2019 most  commonly cited impediments to improvements in high-speed Internet  service. FCC\u2019s Office of Native Affairs and Policy reported in 2012 that  rural, remote, and rugged terrain increase the cost of installing,  maintaining, and upgrading Internet infrastructure. It also reported that  affordability of these services among tribal members is affected by often  endemic levels of poverty, as discussed later in this report.  Internet  providers said that these barriers can deter private investment in  infrastructure needed to connect remote towns and villages to a service  provider\u2019s core network\u2014known as the middle mile.  Middle-mile  infrastructure may include burying fiber optic or copper cables, stringing  cable on existing poles, or erecting towers for wireless microwave links,  which relay wireless Internet connections from tower to tower through  radio spectrum. Figure 2, below, illustrates some of the options for  middle-mile Internet service delivery deployment infrastructure.", "Many tribal officials and all six providers we interviewed listed rugged  terrain and the rural location of many tribal lands as challenges to  deploying this infrastructure to tribal lands. Tribal lands located far from  urban areas may not have middle-mile infrastructure necessary for high- speed Internet deployment to their lands. More specifically, interviewees  discussed the remoteness or distance from existing high-speed Internet  networks in urban and suburban centers; the vastness of reservation  lands; low population density; rugged terrain characteristics such as hills,  forests, mesas, and rocks; and, in some places, a lack of basic services  such as roads, addresses, and commercial power. Figure 3 from the  remote village of Beaver, Alaska, which is not connected to a road  network and is only accessible by plane, illustrates some of these  characteristics. The building shown is connected only via satellite,  because there is no fixed or wireless Internet service in Beaver.   Residents of Beaver told us that satellite Internet is a poor substitute for  land-based middle-mile infrastructure because it is slower, less reliable,  includes restrictive caps on data usage, and suffers from regular blackout  periods.", "The terrain and lack of basic services tend to increase the cost of building  and maintaining the middle-mile infrastructure, compared to costs in  urban settings. For example, the Lac du Flambeau and Menominee tribes  in Wisconsin live on reservations with dense, tall forests, and microwave  towers must be tall enough\u2014sometimes as high as 250 feet\u2014in order to  transmit the high-speed Internet signal above the tree canopy, according  to tribal officials. Additionally, Alaska\u2019s permafrost and seasonal thaw  makes it difficult to lay fiber optic cables, according to service provider  officials. Finally, one provider in the Southwest United States said it has  only been able to deploy limited service on the Navajo Nation land  because it spans more than 24,000 square miles, and many of the remote  areas are not served by commercial power."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Tribes and Providers Said that Poverty Constrains Internet Adoption on Tribal Lands", "paragraphs": ["The limited financial resources available to tribal households were also  cited by tribal officials and providers we interviewed as a barrier to high- speed Internet access. Of the 21 tribes we interviewed, many reported  poverty and affordability as drivers of low subscribership to existing  Internet services or as a barrier to broadening the availability of services.  Poverty rates among the tribes we interviewed varied, but many were well  above the 2014 national average of 15.5 percent, as is common for tribal  lands.

For the Rosebud Sioux, the poverty rate is 47 percent.  Officials from the Menominee tribe said tribal households still cannot  afford Internet service. For the Pueblo of Laguna, tribal officials reported  that residents often choose mobile Internet options because they cannot  afford separate phone and Internet service. Officials from the  Confederated Tribes of Salish and Kootenai said that when tribal  households can afford Internet, they can afford only the slowest download  speeds available.", "Some tribes we interviewed said they are served by a single provider, and  officials from five of those tribes reported their provider charging what  they described as high prices for limited service. In Bethel, Napaskiak,  and Oscarville, Alaska, residents reported that while they had Internet  access through a regional service provider, this provider\u2019s services had  low data allocations that subscribers routinely exceeded and paid  penalties as a result. Moreover, officials from Bethel said that applicants  for tribal housing assistance with outstanding debt of more than five  percent of their income from unpaid mobile Internet bills were ineligible for  this assistance. Also according to these officials, when an Internet  customer had an outstanding bill, the local provider would shut off their  phone. The customer had to pay back this outstanding balance before  they could get their phone turned back on and qualify for housing  assistance. In the housing application round for Bethel that occurred just  before our June 2015 visit, 13 of 38 applicants were rejected due to their  delinquent Internet bills, according to data provided by the tribe. Tribal  officials said that this was typical, and that it can take up to a year to pay  off these bills due to the limited income opportunities in the region.", "Two of the providers we interviewed discussed non-payment among tribal  households as a disincentive to Internet service provision. One provider  said that the customers it serves on tribal lands had non-payment rates  double that of other customer groups, and that these rates often follow  seasonal employment patterns. Officials from another Internet provider  said that high poverty had led tribal customers\u2019 accounts to fall into  delinquency and be subsequently disconnected from service.

Tribal officials  said that tribal members do not always have the bureaucratic expertise  required to apply for federal funds, which can lead to mistakes or the  need to hire consultants. Officials of the Ute tribe, for example, described  submitting application paperwork for federal funding several times before  being accepted because of multiple federal officials asking for different  edits. Some tribes reported spending resources on outside consultants to  handle the application process. For example, the Mississippi Choctaw  told us they hired a full-time grant writer to manage their E-rate  application when they had difficulty applying for E-rate on their own.   The consultant confirmed that there is a steep learning curve to the  process and not all tribes would have the money or time to have a  member overcome the learning curve while fulfilling other tribal  responsibilities. Further, according to officials, Unalakleet\u2019s regional  school district contracts out the E-rate application process to a consultant  for $22,000 annually. The district receives about $5 million in E-rate  funding annually to subsidize its schools\u2019 high-speed Internet connection.  Additionally, Lac du Flambeau officials said they spent funds on lawyers,  consultants, and engineers who they had hired to assist them in applying  for federal funding.", "Lack of technical expertise also affects tribes\u2019 ability to interact with  private-sector Internet providers.  For the seven tribes we interviewed that  either had a tribally owned provider or were in the process of establishing  one, three of them said that the lack of expertise in the tribe was a  challenge to establishing a tribally-owned telecommunications provider for  high-speed Internet deployment. In addition, Salish and Kootenai officials  recounted a meeting with several providers as part of a federal assistance  application requirement. The officials said that none of the tribal officials  understood the providers\u2019 plans and as a result were not able to represent  the tribe\u2019s best interests.

In the early 2000s, FCC held a number of Indian  Telecommunications Initiatives Regional Workshops and Roundtables. In  fiscal year 2012, the Office of Native Affairs and Policy consulted with  about 200 tribal nations, many during six separate one- to three-day  telecommunications training and consultation sessions on tribal lands.  These included the Native Learning Labs, where attendees could, for  example, learn about data the FCC has available on spectrum licensing  and USF programs, among other things.

In total, the High Cost and Connect America Fund distributed about  $20 billion in subsidies to providers between 2010 and 2014, portions  of which went to providers that serve tribal lands.", "The USF Schools and Library Support Program, also known as E- rate, provides discounts to eligible schools and libraries on  telecommunications services, Internet access, and internal  connections. In total, the E-rate program provided about $13 billion in  discounts to schools and libraries between 2010 and 2014, portions of  which went to schools and libraries on tribal lands.", "The Healthcare Connect Fund provides assistance to ensure eligible  rural health care providers have access to high-speed Internet  services and supports the formation of regional health care provider  networks.  Although the Healthcare Connect Fund does not  specifically target tribal institutions, assistance may be provided to a  service provider (or group of providers) that serve tribal lands. The  Healthcare Connect Fund started in 2014 and provided about $52  million to healthcare facilities in fiscal year 2014, a portion of which  went to tribal lands. For example, tribal officials said that the  Healthcare Connect Fund helped fund telemedicine carts that access  high-speed Internet connections to send patient data including  pictures and X-rays to regional hospitals to reduce costs, (see figure  5).", "In addition to general programs that include tribal beneficiaries, FCC has  also implemented efforts designed specifically to address concerns of  Tribal and Native Communities.  For example, in 2000 FCC began its  Tribal Lands Bidding Credit Program to provide incentives to wireless  providers to deploy wireless services on tribal lands.  FCC is authorized  to auction radiofrequency spectrum to be used for wireless services in the  United States.  Under the Tribal Lands Bidding Credit program, FCC  grants bidding credits to a winning bidder in a spectrum auction if the  bidder deploys facilities and provides telecommunications services to  qualifying tribal lands.  In total, the program has awarded credits to 53  licensees that have pledged to deploy facilities and provide  telecommunications services on 13 tribal lands.", "More recently, in 2012 when FCC made reforms to universal service, it  created the Mobility Fund under the Connect America Fund.  Phase I of  the Mobility Fund, which began in fiscal year 2012, provided $300 million  of one-time support to extend the availability of wireless voice and high- speed Internet networks in areas where they were not available, including  tribal lands.  It also established a separate, one-time Tribal Mobility fund,  which awarded $50 million in fiscal year 2014.  Phase II of the Mobility  fund will have a budget of $500 million, of which $100 million is  designated as support for tribal lands.

Further, building out the Internet service delivery  infrastructure for schools and clinics with USF support allows service  providers to begin offering household access in remote areas as well,  according to two providers we interviewed. For example, one service  provider said that Internet service would not exist in the majority of Alaska  without USF\u2019s E-rate and Healthcare Connect Fund programs.

These programs are not always well coordinated.  Our body of work has  shown that interagency coordination can help agencies with interrelated  programs ensure efficient use of resources and effective programs.   Agencies can enhance and sustain their coordinated efforts by engaging  in key practices, such as establishing compatible policies and procedures  through official agreements.  Agencies can also develop means to  operate across agency boundaries, including leveraging resources across  agencies for joint activities such as training and outreach.", "One area lacking coordination between FCC and USDA is their outreach  and technical assistance efforts when planning visits to tribes or  conference attendance. Synchronizing these activities could be a  resource-saving mechanism.  However, both FCC and USDA  independently conduct outreach and training efforts for related programs  promoting Internet access.  For example, FCC was authorized to spend  up to $300,000 on tribal consultation and training in fiscal year 2015.  While FCC officials said they invite USDA officials to FCC training  workshops and are sometimes invited to USDA training workshops, they  said that they do not coordinate to develop joint outreach or training  events.  This could result in an inefficient use of limited federal resources  and missed opportunities for resource leveraging between the two  agencies and cost-savings to the tribes attending training events. For  example, while USDA held a training event in Washington State in fiscal  year 2015, FCC hosted a training event in Oregon the same year. The  two agencies could have planned a joint training event in the Pacific  Northwest Region and each contributed towards the costs of the event  while reducing the cost burdens for tribes, who would not have had to  travel twice or choose between the two training events given limited  budgets. Officials from one tribe said that multiple federal programs  offering similar grants were confusing and that a federal one-stop-shop  for outreach and training would help them better target the right programs  for their situation. Officials from a different tribe said that the tribe benefits  from FCC programs but not USDA programs, in part, because tribal  officials did not have a strong understanding of the USDA programs that  might benefit their community\u2019s Internet access.

Availability relates to the presence of Internet Service in  an area, and adoption relates to people in the area subscribing to the  Internet service.  FCC\u2019s strategic plan for fiscal years 2015-2018 includes  a strategic goal related to Internet availability and ensuring that \u201call  Americans can take advantage of the service\u2026without artificial  impediments.\u201d  This goal has a strategic objective to \u201cmaximize the  availability of broadband Internet to all\u2014including low income Americans,  those in rural areas and tribal lands, and individuals with disabilities.\u201d  As  we reported in June 2015, this represented a change from the previous  strategic plan, which included a strategic objective to \u201cmaximize\u201d  broadband adoption with a related performance goal to \u201csupport and  facilitate\u201d broadband adoption. Noting that the change in the strategic  plan from adoption to availability made it unclear as to which was the  priority, we recommended that FCC revise its strategic plan to more  clearly state if addressing adoption is a major function of the Commission  and, if so, specify what outcomes they intend to achieve.  In response,  FCC commented that broadband adoption remains a significant focus.   However, as of December 2015, FCC has not identified the performance  goals and measures it intends to achieve for broadband availability or  adoption.", "Agency performance measurement is the ongoing monitoring and  reporting of program accomplishments, particularly towards pre- established goals.  Performance measurement allows organizations to  track progress in achieving their goals and provides information to identify  gaps in program performance and plan any needed improvements. The  GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 requires annual performance plans to  include performance measures to show the progress the agency is  making in achieving its goals. Further, we have identified best practices in  articulating goals that include (among others):", "Showing baseline and trend data for past performance and  Identifying projected target levels for performance for multi-year  goals.", "The National Broadband Map is the most detailed source of Internet  availability on tribal lands and the reliability of the data is improving.   Providers are updating information and incorporating GPS information to  correct inaccuracies, and FCC has a formal process for the public to  report complaints. Map data are widely used by FCC currently to describe  the availability of broadband nationwide.  For example, FCC uses data  gathered for the National Broadband Map in its annual Broadband  Progress report provided to Congress as required by the  Telecommunications Act of 1996.  Data supporting the National  Broadband Map could be used, for example, to establish a baseline of  high-speed Internet availability nationwide and on tribal lands.  Making  high-speed Internet, including broadband Internet, available to all  Americans is FCC\u2019s stated goal, but FCC has not set goals to  demonstrate or measure progress toward achieving it.  While the National  Broadband Map does have some weaknesses, it provides the best  current tool for setting goals and measuring progress toward increasing  the availability of high-speed Internet on tribal lands."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data Collected Does Not Allow FCC to Measure the Outcomes of its E-rate Program for Tribal Institutions", "paragraphs": ["Although Census is gathering baseline information on household internet  adoption, and the National Broadband Map provides data on high-speed  Internet availability across the country, FCC lacks information to measure  the outcomes of its E-rate program at tribal schools and libraries.  FCC\u2019s  E-rate program provides assistance to schools, school districts, and  libraries to obtain telecommunications technology, including high-speed  Internet.  E-rate does not specifically target tribal schools and libraries,  although some are eligible and receive benefits.  Since 2010, E-rate has  committed more than $13 billion in service provider customer fees to  schools and libraries, and according to data provided by FCC, and at  least $1 billion of that amount supports tribal institutions.", "FCC\u2019s strategic plan sets forth an objective for the E-rate program to  ensure that all schools and libraries have affordable access to modern  broadband technologies.  Communicating what an agency intends to  achieve and its programs for doing so are fundamental aims of  performance management.  Under the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010,  an agency is expected to communicate the outcomes of its efforts.   Specifically the act requires the agency to have outcome oriented goals  for major functions and operations and an annual performance plan  consistent with that strategic plan with measurable, quantifiable  performance goals.  Similarly, Federal Internal Control Standards state  that operational and financial data are needed to determine whether or  not an agency is meeting its strategic and annual performance goals.   However, FCC has not set any quantifiable goals and performance  measures for its E-rate efforts to extend high-speed Internet in schools  and libraries nationwide, or more specific performance measures for the  same institutions on tribal lands.", "FCC has noted the additional difficulties that tribal entities have in  securing high-speed Internet on their lands, and directed efforts to  address these difficulties in the E-rate Modernization Orders in 2014.   According to federal internal control standards, management should  ensure there are adequate means of obtaining information from external  stakeholders that may have a significant impact on the agency meeting its  goals.  FCC collects information on E-rate recipients nationwide through  questions on its application for E-rate assistance, including the type of  organization requesting funding and the types of institutions served, such  as public, private, tribal, or Head Start, among others. Several different  types of institutions on tribal lands can qualify for E-rate funding, including  schools operated by the tribe or Bureau of Indian Education, private  schools operating on a reservation, as well as public school districts that  serve the reservation.  FCC\u2019s E-rate application provides for applicants  to self-identify whether recipients of service on the application are tribal,  but in this instance, provides no definition of \"tribal.\" We found that not all  schools and libraries on tribal lands identify themselves as such during  the application process. FCC provided us with information on E-rate  recipients between 2010 and 2014 that self-identified as tribal, and the  amounts committed to those recipients.  These data may understate the  amount of funds supporting schools on tribal lands.  Specifically, we  identified more than 60 additional school districts, private schools, and  public libraries on the lands of the 21 tribes we studied that received E- rate assistance but were not included in FCC\u2019s information on tribal  recipients.  FCC officials stated that they do not provide a definition  because the increased formality might give applicants the incorrect  impression that being a \u201ctribal\u201d institution has an effect on funding  decisions.  However, because FCC does not provide a definition for tribal  in its E-rate application, it is unclear what level of tribal involvement or  participation in an institution would cause it to be considered \u201ctribal\u201d on an  application.  For example, applicants may be unsure if a public school  district, a private school, or public library that serves the general public on  a reservation should indicate it is a tribal recipient on an application even  if most students or patrons are tribal members. Further, according to FCC  officials, it would be appropriate for such institutions to identify as tribal.   Consequently, FCC does not have accurate information on the number of  federally recognized tribes or Alaska Native Villages receiving E-rate  support, or the amount being provided to them.   Without more precise  information and direction from FCC, the extent to which E-rate assistance  is provided to tribal institutions cannot be reliably determined, nor can  FCC rely on the information to develop quantifiable goals and  performance measures for improving high-speed Internet access in tribal  schools or libraries.  It is important to understand how these programs  affect tribal institutions because FCC has made improving high-speed  Internet access in tribal institutions a priority following the National  Broadband Plan, with the establishment of the Office of Native Affairs and  Policy in 2010, and its current Strategic Plan."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Access to Internet on tribal lands varies but challenges to access and  adoption remain.  The high costs of infrastructure buildout on tribal lands,  which tend to be remote and rugged terrain, work in tandem with tribal  member poverty to create a barrier to high-speed Internet expansion on  tribal lands. In addition, about half of the tribes we interviewed told us that  the lack of tribal members with sufficient bureaucratic and technical  expertise is a barrier to increasing high-speed access on tribal lands.  FCC\u2019s USF subsidy program and USDA\u2019s RUS grant and loan programs  seek to increase high-speed Internet access in underserved areas,  including tribal lands, by assisting in building infrastructure and  purchasing equipment as well as by paying for the ongoing operation of  this infrastructure and equipment. While these programs have been  important to improving high-speed Internet access on tribal lands, their  efforts to further increase high-speed Internet on tribal lands could be  limited by a lack of interagency coordination on training and outreach.  Officials from one tribe said that multiple federal programs offering similar  grants were confusing and officials from another tribe said that they  accessed FCC programs but lacked a strong understanding of the USDA  programs designed to increase Internet access. Through better  coordination where feasible on joint training efforts to build tribal  administrative and technical capacity, FCC and USDA could better  ensure that their programs are efficient and remain mutually supportive  and accessible to tribal governments.", "Despite the importance of FCC and USDA programs for expanding high- speed Internet on tribal lands, FCC has not established performance  goals and measures related to improving Internet availability.  However,  data on broadband availability is readily available through the National  Broadband Map to measure progress on efforts to improve broadband  availability.  Further, FCC\u2019s subsidy programs also seek to increase high- speed Internet access on tribal lands, but the E-rate program lacks  reliable data specific to institutions on tribal lands as well as goals and  performance measures to track the outcomes of efforts on tribal lands.   Not defining \u201ctribal\u201d in the E-rate application makes it difficult to measure  the program\u2019s impact on tribal lands as not all E-rate recipients serving  these areas self-identify as tribal.  Gathering such data is important for  FCC because The National Broadband Plan has placed a special  emphasis on improving access on tribal lands, and internal control  standards call for management to be provided with data to determine  whether or not it is meeting goals.
