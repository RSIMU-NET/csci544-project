Even with this growth, special operations military positions constituted less than 3 percent of the military services' FY14 total authorized force levels.", "Special operations\u2013specific funding has increased markedly, but the Department of Defense (DOD) has not determined the total funding used to support special operations forces (SOF). Funding provided to SOCOM for special operations\u2013specific needs has more than tripled from about $3.1 billion in FY 2001 to about $9.8 billion in FY 2014 constant dollars, including supplemental funding for contingency operations. However, these totals do not include funding provided by the services, which SOCOM estimates is more than $8 billion annually. GAO found that DOD has little visibility over total funding to support SOF, primarily because it has not established a requirement or methodology to capture and report this information. Until DOD has more complete information on total funding to support SOF, decision makers will be unable to effectively identify and assess resource needs or weigh priorities and assess budget trade-offs.", "DOD has taken some steps to manage the increased pace of special operations deployments, but opportunities may exist to better balance the workload across the joint force because activities assigned to SOF can be similar to activities assigned to conventional forces. Average weekly deployments of SOF personnel have increased from about 2,900 in FY 2001 to about 7,200 in FY 2014. SOCOM has taken steps to manage the effect of SOF deployments, but DOD reported that some portions of the force are still heavily deployed. GAO identified two factors that inhibit DOD's ability to potentially share the burden of SOF deployments with the conventional force. First, DOD has not evaluated since 2003 whether activities performed by SOF could be conducted by conventional forces. Second, DOD's current force-allocation process provides the Joint Staff with criteria to validate force requests, but does not systematically consider whether conventional forces could serve as an appropriate alternative to meet some requests for SOF. Unless the department more fully assesses whether opportunities exist to better balance demands across the joint force, the demand for SOF and the high pace of deployments that results is likely to continue."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD improve visibility in total funding to support SOF and determine whether opportunities exist to balance deployments across the joint force.

U.S.  special operations forces (SOF) have been an essential part of the  Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) global response efforts. These forces  serve not only as a crisis response and contingency force, but are  uniquely organized, trained, and equipped to conduct operations in hostile  or politically sensitive environments. Over the past decade, DOD strategy  has emphasized the importance of SOF to meet global national security  needs and has indicated that SOF will continue to play a prominent role in  support of the defense strategy. For example, the 2014 Quadrennial  Defense Review report states that the investment in SOF supports DOD\u2019s  ability to sustain operations against terrorist networks, counter other  transnational threats, and build the capacity of partner-nation security  forces. Consistent with its strategy, DOD has increased funding allocated  for SOF and the overall size of the force in the last decade. For example,  in 2006 DOD directed an increase in SOF personnel to create additional  Army Special Forces and Navy Sea, Air, Land (SEAL) units. In 2010,  DOD again directed an increase in SOF as well as certain conventional  force capabilities to support SOF, such as communications and  intelligence assets. DOD plans to maintain the size of SOF generally at  fiscal year 2014 levels, even as the department has begun to reduce the  size of conventional military forces.", "Since 2001, SOF deployments have focused on operational needs in Iraq  and Afghanistan, as well as in other areas. DOD has recognized that  these deployments have placed significant demands on SOF and it has  initiated several programs to monitor the health of the force. For example,  the department has placed an emphasis on managing time away from  home and on the well-being of forces following a deployment. In recent  posture statements and budget requests, DOD has continued to indicate  its intent to prioritize special operations activities to build partner capacity,  such as training indigenous forces in partner nations. In doing so, DOD  anticipates that SOF will be relied upon to deploy in small numbers into  politically sensitive and highly challenging operating environments.  Moreover, U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) officials stated  that as operations in Iraq and Afghanistan began to wane, subsequent  operational needs, such as DOD\u2019s response to the emergence of the  entity known as Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, have created  unexpected requirements on the force.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, section  1086, directed the Secretary of Defense to submit to the congressional  defense committees a review of the SOF organization, capabilities,  structure, and oversight. Section 1086 included a provision that we submit  to the congressional defense committees an evaluation of DOD\u2019s report.  In September 2014, we issued a report that assessed the extent to which  DOD\u2019s report addressed the mandated reporting elements. We found  that DOD\u2019s report to Congress on SOF and SOCOM addressed or  partially addressed the eight required reporting elements, but that the  report did not include additional details on the analysis that underpinned  the department\u2019s conclusions with regard to several reporting elements.  For example, DOD\u2019s report concluded that current and future special  operations\u2013peculiar requirements could be met by using current and  planned resources, but it did not specify the special operations\u2013peculiar  requirements of the geographic combatant commands and the Theater  Special Operations Commands that will be needed to meet special  operations missions.", "Section 1086 also included a provision that we review how the special  operations force structure is aligned with conventional force structures  and any other matters determined to be relevant.

For example, Marine Corps  officials noted that service-specific support to its special operations  component command is built into the service\u2019s overall plan for allocation  of resources along with all other non\u2013special operations requirements. As  a result, the military services\u2019 budget justification materials do not provide  details on the level of resources required by the military services and  other components specifically to support SOF.", "While SOCOM estimated that the military services provide about $8  billion annually to support SOF, this provides only a rough estimate of  total funding to support the force and does not include, for example, all  facilities, restoration, sustainment, and modernization funding. Because of  the lack of detailed information available from DOD and the military  services, we were also unable to comprehensively estimate the military  services\u2019 funding to support SOF. Within the three categories of service  funding to support SOF shown in table 1, we were only able to identify  some examples of funding used to support SOF, as shown below.", "Funding for pay and benefits: We estimated funding for the total  authorized special operations military positions for fiscal year 2014  using existing service documentation and the fiscal year 2014 annual  DOD composite rate. Based on these analyses, we calculated that  SOF pay totaled approximately $5.3 billion. This figure includes  funding for receipt of some bonuses and special pays, such as foreign  language proficiency, which both conventional forces and many SOF  operators receive. However, SOF operators may receive additional  SOF\u2013specific bonuses and allowances not included in these  calculations. For example, Air Force SOF operators traditionally  receive one or more special or incentive pays based on the  requirement to maintain proficiency in certain skills or deploying on  assignments with difficult duties. The Air Force has more than a  dozen special and incentive pays, including aviator pay, dive pay, and  special duty assignment pay, that can range from $125 a month to as  much as $1,000 a month.", "Funding for service-common equipment and goods: Documentation  provided by the Army noted that, in fiscal year 2014, the Army funded  approximately $138 million for 12 Gray Eagle unmanned aircraft  systems for SOF. An Army official further noted that the Army funded  approximately $1.2 billion to purchase 72 Black Hawk helicopters for  the Army\u2019s Special Operations Aviation Regiment from fiscal years  2007 through 2013. In addition, according to Navy documentation, the  service will fund eight Small Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems to  support SOF. Combining operation and maintenance; procurement;  and research, development, test and evaluation funds, the Navy  expects to provide approximately $189 million in support of SOF  through fiscal year 2019 for the systems.", "Funding for support programs and services: Documentation provided  by the Air Force noted that in fiscal year 2014, the service funded $4.8  million for utilities and rent and $6.5 million for base and headquarters  communications support for SOF. According to military service  officials, however, the SOF portion for some costs, such as base  operating support on bases where SOF reside, is difficult to quantify,  primarily because these costs are often shared with conventional  forces. These costs can include the portion of information technology  and facility services used to support SOF.", "According to SOCOM and military service officials, more complete  information on total SOF funding would be useful for senior-level DOD  and congressional decision makers, particularly as the military services  face force reductions and decreasing budgets and as the size of SOF  continues to constitute a greater portion of the total force size. According  to its charter, the nascent Special Operations Oversight Council,  established in 2014, is tasked with adjudicating SOF resource- management issues, among other areas, but it must do so with  incomplete information on the total costs to support SOF. According to  officials, in a fiscally constrained environment, having information on total  funding to support SOF would help the oversight council and others  determine whether needs are realistic and feasible within constraints. For  example, Navy officials noted that while SOCOM has been working to  provide predictability to the services in terms of capabilities that SOF  needs, the requests are evaluated, prioritized, and compete against other  Navy programs. Specifically, SOCOM requested an afloat forward staging  base as a persistent and dedicated SOF platform to support geographic  combatant command requirements. However, providing this capability  represents a significant capital investment for the Navy. Given that the  Navy is building only three multimission platforms that can also be used  as afloat forward staging bases, the service needs the platforms available  for missions other than those dedicated to support SOF. In addition, an  Army official noted that SOF requirements are not always known well  enough in advance for inclusion in Army budget estimates, but SOF is  generally considered a higher priority. As such, funding is provided to  support SOF and the Army is left to rebalance a smaller available funding  level for other needs. Ultimately, visibility into total funding to support SOF  would enable decision makers to fully determine the level of investment  needed in the force and to plan to support SOF during times of budget  uncertainty and service force reductions.", "Until DOD has more complete information on the total funding necessary  to support SOF, decision makers will be unable to effectively identify and  assess justification materials for future funding needs, or weigh priorities  and assess budget trade-offs within anticipated declining resources.  Moreover, the lack of visibility into current spending and future funding  plans impede DOD\u2019s ability to provide Congress with information needed  to facilitate oversight, and afford congressional decision makers the  opportunity to analyze changes and trends over time in the budget  provided to support SOF or to conduct a comparative analysis with other  DOD budget requirements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Not Fully Considered Opportunities to Alleviate Increased SOF Deployments", "paragraphs": ["SOF deployments have increased since fiscal year 2001 and are not  expected to abate, but DOD has not fully considered whether additional  opportunities exist to reduce the demand for SOF.

DOD expects this high pace of deployments to  continue in the near future even as focus shifts to other parts of the world.  Recognizing the need to manage the effect of repeated deployments on  the force, DOD has taken some actions to try to manage the pace of SOF  deployments by establishing a series of policies to manage deployments.

In recent years,  SOF are increasingly deploying in support of other geographic combatant  commands (see fig. 7).

In 2014, the portion of deployments in  support of U.S. Central Command decreased to 69 percent, while  deployments in support of U.S. European Command and U.S. Africa  Command increased to 6 percent and 10 percent, respectively.", "According to officials, the total weekly number of deployed SOF is not  expected to change significantly in the near future, although officials  expect that the location where SOF are deployed may continue to shift  based on emergent needs in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, and the  Pacific."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SOCOM Has Taken Steps to Manage the Effect of SOF Deployments, but Some Portions of SOF Are Still Heavily Deployed", "paragraphs": ["In a May 2014 report to Congress, DOD noted that SOF personnel have  come under significant strain in the years since September 11, 2001.  Both the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low- Intensity Conflict and the commander of SOCOM acknowledged in 2015  that SOF have sustained unprecedented levels of stress during the  preceding few years. Specifically, the SOCOM commander has testified  that as SOF continue to deploy to meet the increasing geographic  combatant command demand, the high frequency of combat  deployments, high-stake missions, and extraordinarily demanding  environments in which forces operate have placed not only SOF but also  their families under unprecedented levels of stress. According to the  SOCOM commander, the high pace of deployments has resulted in both  increased suicide incidents among the force and effects on operational  readiness and retention due to a lack of predictability. This is consistent  with our prior work, which has found that a high pace of deployments for  SOF can affect readiness, retention, and morale. The military services  have also acknowledged challenges SOF face as a result of operational  demands. For example, in 2013, Air Force officials reported that a  persistent special operations presence in Afghanistan and elsewhere,  increasing requirements in the Pacific region, and enduring global  commitments would continue to stress Air Force special operations  personnel and aircraft.", "Recognizing the significant demands and subsequent stress on SOF,  DOD and SOCOM have established a series of policies to manage  individual and unit deployments. In general, the policies have been based  on the concept of deployment-to-dwell ratios that seek to keep personnel  at home station for at least as much time as that spent while deployed.  For example, in August 2005 SOCOM issued a policy that required  active-duty SOF personnel to remain at home for at least an equal  amount of time as they were deployed for operations and training (a  deployment-to-dwell ratio of 1:1). In 2006, we reported that the service  component commands had not consistently implemented this policy, in  part because the policy lacked clear implementation guidance and  reliable data to track deployments of personnel. DOD partially concurred  with our recommendation to require SOCOM to clarify the methodology  that its service components used for enforcing the deployment policy and  to take steps to ensure that the service components had tracking systems  in place that utilized reliable data to meet the requirements of the policy.  DOD noted that SOCOM leadership and all of its service components had  implemented the command\u2019s deployment policy, but that the service  components had interpreted the intent of the policy requirements  inconsistently. Consistent with our recommendation, SOCOM  subsequently clarified the requirements of the policy in January 2007.", "In 2008, SOCOM again updated its deployment policy, reiterating that  forces shall remain at home for an amount of time at least equal to that  for which they were away from their home station for activities such as  operations and training. The policy noted that SOCOM\u2019s service  component commands should strive to go beyond this minimum ratio and  achieve a ratio that has active-duty personnel at home twice as long as  they are deployed for operations and training (a deployment-to-dwell ratio  of 1:2). The guidance outlined a long-term goal of having forces home at  a ratio of 1:3. In May 2014, SOCOM again revised its deployment  guidance, stating that units, detachments, and individuals should strive to  be in dwell for at least twice as long as they are operationally deployed (a  deployment-to-dwell ratio of 1:2). Both DOD and SOCOM policy requires  Secretary of Defense approval for the deployment of units when they will  fall below 1:1. According to officials, this policy is designed to minimize  and manage the disruptive effects of emerging requirements. SOCOM\u2019s  deployment guidance does not prescribe a system for tracking  deployment data, and officials noted that therefore the command relies on  the service component commands to report whether units are complying  with the deployment policy. Service component command officials told us  that they use a range of tools, including spreadsheets and other systems  to track unit deployment data. Officials also stated that emerging  requirements\u2014of which there were more than 100 in fiscal year 2014\u2014 exceed the already planned rotational force requirements and challenged  the commands\u2019 ability to meet goals outlined in the deployment guidance.  Officials stated that, in many cases, these emergent requests for forces  become part of the command\u2019s steady-state requirements, increasing the  annual number of deployed SOF.", "SOCOM and the service component commands could not provide precise  historical deployment data, but officials stated that certain unit types had  historically high deployment rates. For example, a U.S. Army Special  Operations Command official stated that its Civil Affairs, Military  Information Support Operations, and Army Ranger units have been  heavily stressed due to the high pace of operations. Additionally, officials  noted that some Marine Corps Special Operations Support Group forces,  which include logistics personnel, explosive ordnance disposal  technicians, and mechanics, have been unable to meet deployment  goals.", "Other types of units have been sized to better align with SOCOM\u2019s  steady-state deployment goals. For example, officials stated that Naval  Special Warfare forces, Air Force Special Tactics Squadrons, and Marine  Corps Special Operations Teams are all structured to be at home at least  twice as long as they are to be operationally deployed. However, this  deployment tempo is generally predicated on a steady-state environment  without factoring in all emergent requirements, which according to some  officials was not always realistic given the continuing demands on the  force."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Not Fully Assessed Opportunities to Reduce the Demand for SOF", "paragraphs": ["Opportunities may exist to better balance the workload across the force  because the activities assigned to SOF can be similar to the types of  activities assigned to conventional forces. Conventional forces have been  expanding their capabilities to meet the demand for missions that have  traditionally been given to SOF, such as stability operations, security  force assistance, civil security, and repairing key infrastructure necessary  to provide government services and sustain human life. For example, in  2012 we reported that the services were taking steps and investing  resources to organize and train conventional forces capable of conducting  security force assistance based on identified requirements. Recently,  DOD began establishing conventional forces, such as the Army\u2019s  regionally aligned forces with more extensive language and cultural skills  that could conduct activities previously performed primarily by SOF. The  Army reported that its regionally aligned forces helped train approximately  8,500 peacekeepers from 10 African countries in fiscal year 2014.  According to Army officials, regionally aligned forces are prepared to  meet the myriad of requirements across the range of military operations\u2014 from small teams participating in theater security cooperation with partner  nations to large formations undertaking major combat operation.  However, SOCOM officials stated that the command has not coordinated  with the Army\u2019s regionally aligned forces to determine what activities, if  any, could be transferred to or shared with those forces.", "The goal of DOD\u2019s force-allocation process is to consider all DOD  components to identify and recommend the most appropriate and  responsive force that can meet identified requirements. According to  DOD\u2019s force-allocation guidance, geographic combatant commanders are  to submit requests for forces to the Joint Staff and specify whether SOF  or conventional forces are being requested. The Joint Staff is then  responsible for validating combatant commanders\u2019 requests for forces\u2014 including both SOF and conventional forces\u2014before assigning each  request to a joint force provider. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  Manual 3130.06A outlines the validation criteria the Joint Staff applies to  force requests. These criteria focus on such factors as the availability of  funding and assuring that the request has not been previously decided or  that the capability is not already available in the operational theater. DOD  joint doctrine states that SOF are not a substitute for conventional forces  and, in order to preserve SOF capabilities, should not be employed to  conduct operations where conventional forces could be used to achieve  the same objectives. Limited resources and extensive planning require a  commander to selectively employ SOF for high-priority operations. DOD  guidance further states that the department\u2019s force-allocation process  should determine what forces are best able to meet a combatant  commander\u2019s request based on a comprehensive assessment across all  service force capabilities.", "Our work identified two factors that inhibit the department\u2019s ability to  share the burden of SOF deployments with conventional forces. First, the  department has not recently evaluated whether some activities being  conducted by SOF could be conducted by conventional forces. DOD last  studied opportunities to alleviate some SOF deployments in 2003, as  forces were beginning to heavily engage in operations in Iraq and  Afghanistan, to determine what types of special operations activities could  be transferred to or shared with conventional forces. At the time, DOD  determined that there were opportunities to share the burden of SOF  deployments with conventional forces, including for certain counterdrug  missions and foreign conventional force training. However, officials noted  that DOD has not conducted a similar formal assessment since 2003 to  determine whether the demand on SOF could be mitigated, even though  SOF have continued to perform activities that could be conducted by  other forces, such as performing noncombatant evacuation missions  typically conducted by Marine Corps conventional forces. According to  DOD officials, the department implemented its current force-allocation  process with the intent that it would validate the most appropriate military  force to meet combatant commanders\u2019 needs. During the course of our  review, however, officials from SOCOM and its service components  repeatedly expressed concerns about whether it was appropriate to  continue to deploy SOF at such high rates while admitting that they were  reluctant to turn down deployments even if they felt the need could be  met with other, conventional forces. Without conducting an evaluation of  what activities should be performed by SOF versus the conventional  force, the department cannot be assured that it is using SOF only in those  situations where conventional forces could not be used for the same  purpose.", "Second, DOD\u2019s current force-allocation process does not systematically  consider whether conventional forces could serve as an appropriate  alternative to meet requests for SOF. Our analysis found that while  DOD\u2019s force-allocation process currently provides validation criteria that  the Joint Staff is to apply to force requests, the validation criteria focus  primarily on administrative matters related to the request, such as the  current availability of funding and forces in theater. The validation criteria  do not include a requirement to determine whether the tasking of SOF is  the most appropriate means to address combatant commanders\u2019  requirements, given the broader demands on the force. As the joint force  provider for conventional forces, which involves coordinating with the  military services and combatant commanders to identify the most  appropriate conventional forces to meet force requests in the force  allocation process, the Joint Staff has visibility over the types of  conventional forces available in the department and whether these forces  could potentially be used to meet SOF requests.", "However, the Joint Staff\u2019s role in the process has been limited. This is  because, according to officials, SOCOM has worked directly with the  geographic combatant commands and theater special operations  commands to draft requests for SOF forces that are SOF\u2013specific. In the  absence of a requirement for the Joint Staff to determine whether the  tasking of SOF is the most appropriate means to address combatant  commanders\u2019 requirements, we were told that the Joint Staff passes  these requests directly to SOCOM for sourcing once they are  administratively validated. According to a Joint Staff official, SOCOM can  either source a requirement for SOF or close the requirement without  sourcing. The official noted that when identifying military forces for  combatant commanders\u2019 validated requirements, officials can consider  whether conventional forces can serve as a substitute for SOF.", "Unless the department has a requirement to more fully assess whether  opportunities exist to better balance operational demands across the joint  force, the demand for SOF\u2014and the high pace of deployments that  results\u2014is likely to continue. Officials stated that SOF leaders and  personnel want to deploy frequently, and thus they are reluctant to  decline deployments even when they are under stress. The situation is  further exacerbated by the fact that, according to officials, combatant  commanders often express a preference for SOF because they are  responsive, flexible, highly skilled, and well-funded. However, the Joint  Staff\u2019s role provides it with visibility over the capacity and capabilities of  both SOF and conventional forces and enables the Joint Staff to lead  efforts to determine whether certain combatant commander requests for  SOF could be met by conventional forces."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Since 2001, SOF have become a prominent part of U.S. military forces as  they have often been called upon for high-priority and time-sensitive  military missions that have a high degree of risk.

DOD officials point out that SOF\u2013specific funding is a relatively small  portion of DOD\u2019s overall budget, but that funding total understates the  true costs because the military services support SOF in myriad ways,  some of which are not easily quantified. DOD estimates that this  additional support is around $8 billion annually, but this rough estimate  excludes many costs. DOD cannot provide a more precise estimate  because it does not have a methodology to gather such data. Supporting  SOF is likely to remain a high priority in the future, so these largely hidden  costs to support the force could divert funding from other service  priorities, especially if supplemental funding is decreased. As budget  pressures mount, better transparency over the total costs to support SOF  will become increasingly important both to DOD decision makers and to  justify budgets to Congress.", "The average number of deployed SOF has also tripled since 2001, and  the pace of these deployments is not expected to decrease. DOD and  SOCOM and its service component commands have recognized the  strains these deployments have placed on the force, such as increased  suicide rates and effects on readiness and retention, and have set goals  to limit deployments and get better information about the length and  frequency of deployments. However, setting goals and obtaining better  information may not solve the underlying problem\u2014the high demand for  SOF. To ease the strain on SOF, the department may have to reexamine  how it is meeting operational demands. The Joint Staff is in the best  position to assess whether conventional forces could do more to alleviate  the high demands on SOF. However, DOD has not formally assessed  opportunities to transfer or share certain activities between SOF and  conventional forces since 2003, and DOD\u2019s current validation process is  largely an administrative exercise that does not validate whether some  requests for SOF could be met with conventional forces. These gaps are  not consistent with DOD doctrine, which says that SOF should be  employed for high-priority operations and not to conduct operations where  conventional forces could be used to achieve the same objectives.  Moreover, the current force-allocation process may miss opportunities to  take advantage of the growth in conventional forces with SOF-like skills.

In its comments,  DOD stated that the department maintains full visibility of service funding  to support SOF through manpower and acquisition accounts as well as  special operations\u2013specific funding. DOD noted that while there are  indirect service costs to support SOF, these costs are service  responsibilities and do not generally influence the department\u2019s decisions  on SOF capabilities or end strength. DOD further stated that it would  review the current methodology to track and report funding to support  SOF and consider any changes based on incremental costs incurred by  enhanced audit and reporting procedures balanced against potential  benefits for decision making on SOF resourcing. With respect to DOD\u2019s  first point, our report recognizes the distinction between service-provided  funding to support SOF and special operations\u2013specific funding provided  directly to SOCOM. We reported that data on funding to support SOF are  tracked and managed across multiple appropriations, programs,  functions, and/or organizations in a decentralized manner. However,  neither DOD nor the military services have systematically collected,  estimated, or reported total SOF funding needs because there is no  requirement to do so. Our report notes that SOCOM has developed an  approach for calculating service-provided funding amounts, but it provides  only a rough estimate of funding needs. In our view, these efforts do not  constitute having full visibility of total funding to support SOF. Regarding  DOD\u2019s point about potential benefits for decision making, we continue to  believe that having information on total funding to support SOF would  help officials determine whether needs are realistic and feasible within  identified budgetary constraints. More complete information on the total  funding necessary to support SOF would also enable decision makers to  more effectively identify and assess justification materials for future  funding needs or weigh priorities and assess budget trade-offs within  anticipated declining resources.", "DOD partially concurred with our second recommendation that the  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in consultation with SOCOM and  the military services, evaluate whether opportunities exist for certain types  of activities traditionally conducted by SOF to be transferred to or shared  with conventional forces.

DOD further stated that it would consider any changes to the current  decision process that could improve allocation of missions and  requirements between SOF and conventional forces as part of the  department\u2019s ongoing review of the Global Force Management process.  DOD\u2019s decision to evaluate the current decision process on the allocation  of missions and requirements between SOF and conventional forces is a  positive step. As we stated in this report, conventional forces have been  expanding their capabilities to meet the demand for missions that have  traditionally been given to SOF, but since a 2003 review, the department  has not conducted a formal assessment of whether some activities being  conducted by SOF could be conducted by conventional forces.  Furthermore, as we stated in our report, officials expressed concern  about whether it was appropriate to continue to deploy SOF at such high  rates given that some operational needs assigned through the current  force allocation process could be met with conventional forces.", "DOD partially concurred with our third recommendation that the Chairman  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in consultation with SOCOM and the military  services, revise the validation criteria outlined in Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff Manual 3130.06A to include a requirement that the Joint  Staff consider whether conventional forces could serve as an appropriate  alternative to meet requests for SOF before validating combatant  commander requests. DOD stated that it believes that the current Global  Force Management validation process considers the appropriate  allocation of missions and requirements between SOF and conventional  forces.

We obtained data and described trends in  obligations for SOCOM for fiscal years 2001 through 2014 for base and  supplemental funding. We further provided an analysis of funding trends  in base and supplemental obligations for SOCOM\u2019s service component  commands, but since historical data were unavailable in some cases, we  limited our analysis of trends for the service component commands to  fiscal years 2005 through 2014. Unless otherwise noted, we reported all  costs in this report in constant fiscal year 2014 dollars. To assess the  reliability of the data, we interviewed officials from the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and SOCOM and incorporated data- reliability questions into our data-collection instruments. We also  compared the multiple data sets received from SOCOM and its service  component commands against each other to ensure that there was  consistency in the data provided. We determined the data were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes of describing trends in funding for  SOF. We further interviewed officials from SOCOM and the military  services and obtained available information to determine other categories  of funding provided to support SOF in addition to SOCOM\u2019s special  operations\u2013specific appropriations. We obtained documentation and  interviewed officials from SOCOM to determine the methodology the  command used to identify service-provided costs to support SOF. We  also reviewed approaches used by DOD for documenting and reporting  SOF costs in light of accounting standards and guidance that outlines the  need to have information on the full cost of federal programs and a high  level of knowledge to guide decision-making efforts.", "To evaluate the extent to which DOD has taken steps to manage the  pace of SOF deployments, we obtained and reviewed data from SOCOM  on average weekly SOF deployments. Using available data maintained by  SOCOM, we calculated average weekly SOF deployments and the  distribution of SOF deployed in support of operational requirements for  fiscal years 2006 through 2014. We further calculated data on the  percentage of SOF personnel deployed in support of the geographic  combatant commands for fiscal years 2006, 2010, and 2014 to illustrate  the global distribution of forces. To present trends in SOF deployments  for fiscal years 2001 through 2005, we relied on data presented in our  prior work. To assess the reliability of the data, we reviewed available  data for inconsistencies and discussed the inconsistencies with SOCOM  officials, analyzed relevant deployment and operational demand policy  memoranda, and incorporated data-reliability questions into our data- collection instruments. We determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes of showing general trends in SOF deployments,  though deployments may be somewhat undercounted because some  service component commands do not consistently report data for the  number of personnel deployed in support of training within the continental  United States. In addition, we discussed the effect of past and planned  deployments with officials from SOCOM and its service component  commands in light of special operations deployment policies and  documentation that describe goals for SOF deployments. We obtained  and reviewed guidance on DOD\u2019s process for filling geographic  combatant commander force needs, such as related Chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff manuals and joint doctrine. We also reviewed DOD\u2019s  SOF mission analysis conducted in 2003 to determine the extent to which  the department had considered options for sharing the burden of SOF  deployments with conventional forces. We interviewed military service  and SOCOM officials to identify opportunities for potentially alleviating  some of the demand on SOF with conventional forces, such as the  establishment of the Army\u2019s regionally aligned force concept. We then  examined the Joint Staff\u2019s role in considering these alternatives in the  process of sourcing department-wide force needs.", "We contacted officials, and when appropriate obtained documentation,  from the organizations listed below:", "Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Cost Assessment and", "Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)", "Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Special Operations and  Low-Intensity Conflict)  Joint Staff", "U.S. Special Operations Command", "U.S. Army Special Operations Command", "U.S. Naval Special Warfare Command", "U.S. Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command", "U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command", "U.S. Africa Command", "U.S. Central Command", "U.S. European Command", "U.S. Northern Command", "U.S. Pacific Command", "U.S. Southern Command  Theater Special Operations Commands:", "Special Operations Command Africa", "Special Operations Command Central", "Special Operations Command Europe", "Special Operations Command North", "Special Operations Command Pacific", "Special Operations Command South", "Headquarters, Department of the Army", "Office of the Chief of Naval Operations", "Headquarters, Marine Corps", "Headquarters Air Force  We conducted this performance audit from March 2014 to July 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
