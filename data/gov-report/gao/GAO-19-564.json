These \u201cunderconnected\u201d students may seek out ways to access wireless internet outside of the home to do homework; however, these methods also pose challenges (see figure). The inequity in internet access\u2014and therefore in the ease of doing homework involving access\u2014between students of varying income levels is known as the \u201chomework gap.\u201d", "Efforts by six selected projects involving seven school districts expanding wireless access for students who may lack it at home varied. According to officials with most school district projects GAO reviewed, rules for the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) E-rate program, which allows schools to purchase discounted internet equipment, may limit schools' ability to provide wireless access off-premises. Specifically, off-premises access is not eligible for E-rate support, and schools that provide such access using existing services supported by E-rate must reduce their E-rate discounts. FCC conducted a pilot project in 2011 and 2012 to help decide whether to make wireless off-premises access eligible for E-rate support, but FCC did not determine and execute a methodology to assess the potential costs, benefits, and challenges of doing so. In 2016, FCC received two requests from school districts seeking waivers of rules to allow them to use E-rate program support to provide off-premises access, but FCC has not made a decision on the waivers. Determining and executing a methodology to analyze data about the potential benefits, costs, and challenges of easing E-rate rules on off-premises use and publishing the results could provide transparency to stakeholders such as school districts. This step could also help FCC act on pending and future waiver-of-rule requests and broader changes to rules that may help schools address the homework gap."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FCC take steps to assess and publish the potential benefits, costs, and challenges of making off-premises wireless access eligible for E-rate support.", "FCC agreed with GAO's recommendation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Internet access is crucial for communication, economic activity, and  education, including for students at the elementary and secondary school  levels.

They  may also access the internet through mobile wireless service, which is  provided through cell towers, with data transmitted over radio frequency  spectrum. Mobile service providers usually sell internet access as an  option in mobile telephone-service plans. A number of devices may  connect to mobile wireless, such as smart phones, tablets, and mobile  devices that enable laptops to connect to mobile wireless service.

Similarly, according to our analysis of  data from the November 2017 CPS: Computer and Internet Use  Supplement, among all school-age children, those in lower-income  households are less likely to use the internet at home than those in  higher-income households (see fig. 1).", "A number of factors explain the digital divide, or the varying levels of  access among different populations. For example, as we have reported in  the past, rural areas tend to have conditions such as low population  density or difficult terrain that can increase the costs for internet providers  to deploy and maintain internet networks. Furthermore, lower-income  households with access to the necessary infrastructure for internet  service may not be able to afford it. (See fig. 2.) While some in-home  fixed internet providers offer low-cost service for lower-income  households with school-age children, according to a 2016 survey, an  estimated 5 percent of households with school-age children ages 6 to 13  and incomes at or below the federal poverty guidelines had ever signed  up for such programs.", "Lower rates of internet access by lower-income households may make it  more difficult for school-age children in those households to do  homework. According to a 2018 Pew Research Center survey, a higher  percentage of surveyed teens in lower-income households said that the  lack of a dependable computer or internet connection sometimes  prevents them from finishing their homework compared to teens in higher- income households. In addition, according to the Consortium for School  Networking, the lack of in-home access makes it more difficult for parents  to support their children academically. Specifically, as much  communication between schools and parents has moved online, the lack  of access may make it difficult for parents to stay connected to teachers  and be informed about school notices, homework assignments, and other  important information.", "FCC, which regulates commercial and other nonfederal spectrum,  conducts activities that affect the ability of schools to address the  homework gap. Specifically, it plays a role in expanding internet access  by assigning licenses for Educational Broadband Service (EBS)  spectrum, which permits schools and other eligible entities to transmit  educational materials electronically. Currently, EBS license holders are  allowed to lease excess capacity to others, including commercial wireless  providers, for up to 30 years as long as the license holder has 20 hours of  educational use per week per licensed channel and reserve the right to  access 5 percent of the capacity for educational use. Schools that have  such leases may need to wait years to regain full use of their EBS  license. Furthermore, the last opportunity for school districts to apply for  new EBS licenses was in 1995, and according to FCC, EBS licenses  cover about half the geographic area of the United States, with rural  areas west of the Mississippi River generally lacking licenses. However,  FCC recently adopted a Report and Order with rules that, once effective,  will change the eligibility requirements for EBS licenses, among other  things.", "In addition, FCC supports internet investments at schools through the E- rate program, which provides discounts on telecommunications and  internet access services, internal connections, and basic maintenance of  internal connections. This program provides schools with higher  percentages of lower-income students greater discounts on these  services; for example, the most disadvantaged schools, where at least 75  percent of students are eligible for free or reduced price school lunch,  receive a 90 percent discount. All services supported by the E-rate  program must be used primarily for \u201ceducational purposes,\u201d which FCC  has defined as meaning \u201cactivities that are integral, immediate, and  proximate to the education of students.\u201d", "Education\u2019s Office of Educational Technology also plays a role related to  internet access for students by developing national educational- technology policies and providing guidance to schools and school districts  on technology use in schools. For example, in January 2017 the office  issued a letter to schools and school districts about Education grant funds  that could be used to support the use of technology to improve instruction  and student outcomes. It also issued a report in 2017 on the use of  technology in schools; the report provided guidance on how to modernize  the technology needed for digital learning, such as schools\u2019 internet  networks and internet-enabled devices.", "Education also collects, analyzes, and reports on a range of data from  schools and school districts. For example, every year from 1994 to 2005  (except 2004 due to a lack of funding according to Education officials),  the department collected data on internet access in schools and  classrooms. In 2008, Education conducted three similar surveys at the  district, school, and teacher levels on the availability and use of a range of  educational technology resources, such as networks, computers, devices  that enhance the capabilities of computers for instruction, and computer  software.

Mobile wireless may be less reliable and slower  than in-home fixed service, which can make doing homework more  challenging.

The district also plans to install wireless receiver  devices in selected students\u2019 homes through which those students will  be able to connect internet-enabled devices via Wi-Fi. Desert Sands  Unified School District in California also built out an EBS network to  provide internet access to students who lack service at home.

That official told us that this model  may not work in many other school districts, as there may not be  sufficient population density to make it economically beneficial for a  commercial provider to agree to provide such service.", "Equip school buses with Wi-Fi. The Coachella Valley Unified  School District, which covers a large geographic area in California  where many students lack in-home fixed access, equipped its fleet of  about 100 school buses with Wi-Fi in 2014, enabling students to do  homework during long bus rides. A commercial mobile-wireless  provider connected the Wi-Fi router on the bus to the district\u2019s  network. In order to access Wi-Fi on the buses, students had to use  district-issued devices that they were allowed to bring home after  school. The district also parked Wi-Fi-equipped school buses and  other district vehicles overnight in neighborhoods with a high  proportion of students who brought district-issued tablets home in  order to provide access to students who likely lacked internet at  home. However, the district stopped this initiative in 2017 due to  limited funding and is now seeking out alternative funding sources to  reactivate the program.", "While none of the projects described above used any funding from  Education, the department has identified six existing grants that schools  and districts could use under certain conditions to support internet  investments, although not necessarily wireless investments specifically.  While the purpose of each of these grant programs isn\u2019t specific to  internet investments, Education identified specific types of internet  investments that these grant funds can be used for. We did not make a  determination as to whether any of the grant funds could have supported  the efforts we reviewed. Representatives of two of the school districts we  met with stated that they would like to see additional information on  Education grants that could be used to support internet investments.  Education officials said the department has taken the first step to  developing a strategy to share information about these grants by  developing a coordinated communications strategy through its Office of  Rural Engagement. They added that the department will then continue to  build a broader strategy.", "Education is also finalizing data collection on a survey that will collect  some data regarding the homework gap. As mentioned earlier, until 2008  Education collected survey data over a number of years about information  technology and internet access in schools and classrooms. According to  Education officials, the department stopped collecting such data due to a  lack of funding. However, the department is now finalizing a survey that is  collecting nationally representative data about public school teachers\u2019 use  of computers and the internet, and their knowledge of students\u2019 access to  computers and the internet outside the classroom. The survey is  collecting data that pertain to the homework gap, including the extent to  which schools provide wireless hot-spot devices to students to take  home; the extent to which teachers think students access the internet  outside of school, such as at home, libraries, or businesses; and the  extent to which teachers think smartphones are useful for doing  homework. According to Education, the department finished administering  the survey in June 2019 and plans to release the results in April 2020.  The survey data may provide Education and others, including FCC and  Congress, with useful information that can inform policy and other  decisions related to the homework gap, such as how best to support  schools\u2019 efforts to expand wireless access for underconnected students.", "FCC had a minor role in some of the school district projects by having  previously granted EBS licenses to some districts that use EBS spectrum  to provide wireless access. However, according to FCC documentation,  many schools and school districts do not have EBS licenses\u2014such as  those in rural areas in the western United States\u2014and some that have  obtained a license now lease their capacity out on a long-term basis to  commercial providers. As a result, school districts may be limited in using  EBS to provide wireless access to students or have to take additional  steps to use EBS. Desert Sands Unified School District officials said that  the district did not have an EBS license and that the local license holder  had leased it out to a commercial provider, so the district worked with that  provider to build out its EBS network. Albemarle County Public Schools  had leased out its EBS license to a commercial provider years ago, but  because that provider was not utilizing that spectrum, the school district  was able to reclaim it.", "FCC has taken recent steps that may affect the extent to which school  districts are able to use EBS to provide wireless access. In May 2018,  FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on  proposed changes to how it manages EBS to encourage and facilitate its  efficient use. In July 2019, FCC adopted a Report and Order that makes  a number of changes to the EBS spectrum and its use.

For example, any off- premises traffic supported by existing E-rate-supported products or  services requires a reduction in the E-rate discount for those existing E- rate supported products and services. This reduction may increase costs  for school districts as they would no longer receive all their potential E- rate discounts. Officials representing all six of the school district projects  we reviewed suggested that program rules limiting eligibility for off- premises use and requiring cost-allocation may inhibit the ability of school  districts to expand off-premises wireless access, and thus address the  homework gap.", "For districts that do provide wireless access off-premises, E-rate program  restrictions may still pose challenges. For example, according to an  official with Desert Sands Unified School District, the district had to buy a  separate line of internet access to avoid having that off-premises traffic  travel through the district\u2019s existing E-rate-supported network, which  would have required cost-allocation and a reduction of the E-rate discount  for that existing E-rate supported network. According to officials with  Microsoft, Charlotte County Public Schools and Halifax County Public  Schools had to separate their off-premises unlicensed white space device  traffic from internet traffic that passed through E-rate-discounted access  in the schools. An official with Boulder Valley School District said that the  district had to terminate an earlier effort to extend access to students in a  housing development after being told that it could not provide off- premises access with program-discounted equipment without cost- allocation.", "In September 2016, FCC issued a Public Notice requesting public  comment on two petitions filed with the agency seeking to allow the  petitioning school districts to use existing E-rate-program-supported  services and equipment for off-premises access without having to cost- allocate that traffic out of their existing E-rate discounts. Cost allocating  out that traffic would result in reduced E-rate discounts for school districts,  and therefore higher costs, for existing services and equipment supported  by E-rate. FCC rules allow parties to petition for waivers of rules if they  can demonstrate that special circumstances warrant deviation from the  existing rules and doing so serves the public interest. According to FCC  officials, the petitions are pending and the agency has not yet taken  further formal action on this Public Notice. The petitions are described in  more detail below.", "In May 2016, the Boulder Valley School District filed a petition  requesting a waiver of the cost allocation rules in order to use its E- rate-program-supported network to provide internet access to  students at public housing facilities after school hours.

The petition stated that the infrastructure to provide  service to unlicensed white space devices would not be funded with  E-rate program funds, and that these districts were not well served by  commercial internet providers.

Specifically, agencies should collect data from reliable sources  in a timely manner, process these data into quality information, and use  that information to make informed decisions. Agencies should also  communicate such information to external parties that can help the  agencies achieve their objectives. Furthermore, in previous work we  identified as pilot-program design best practices: determining a methodology for gathering and evaluating data, evaluating pilot results to make conclusions on whether to integrate  pilot activities into broader efforts, and  communicating with stakeholders\u2014such as by publishing results.", "As discussed earlier, school districts we met with said that existing E-rate  program rules that require cost-allocation of off-premises access to E-rate  discounts limit their ability to address the homework gap and providing  off-premises access remains a challenge for schools and school districts.  Determining and executing a methodology for collecting and analyzing  data on the potential costs, benefits, and challenges of making schools\u2019  efforts to expand off-premises wireless access eligible for program  funding could help inform FCC decisions regarding the two pending  petitions and any future petitions. As petitions may only cover petitioning  entities, determining and executing such a methodology could also help  inform more widespread changes to E-rate rules regarding off-premises  access that would affect all E-rate program recipients. FCC could collect  such data through another pilot program or from school districts now  providing off-premises wireless access.

While school districts  have made efforts to address the homework gap, such efforts may be  inhibited by existing restrictions in FCC\u2019s E-rate program. Although FCC  explored the possibility of making wireless off-premises access an  allowable E-rate program expense in a 2011 to 2012 pilot program, FCC\u2019s  lack of an analysis of the data it collected at the time or since then means  that it may not have sufficient and relevant information to make a decision  on pending petitions from local school districts regarding off-premises  access. Determining the best way to collect and analyze data on the  potential benefits, costs, and challenges of making off-premises wireless  access eligible for E-rate program support; conducting such analysis; and  publishing the results could provide relevant information and transparency  to external stakeholders.

The Computer and Internet Use Supplement  collected household information from all eligible Current Population  Survey households, as well as personal information from household  members age 3 and older. The supplement provided data about  households\u2019 computer and internet use, and about each household  member\u2019s use of the internet from any location during the previous six  months. One member of a household was generally interviewed and  answered questions on behalf of every other member. Interviews were  conducted from November 12\u201318, 2017. The probability sample selected  to represent the universe consisted of approximately 56,000 households.", "We included variables on ages of household members to determine if the  household had one or more school-age children. We considered a  household to have school-age children if it had any children between the  ages of 6 and 17, an age range used in other analyses of internet use by  school-age children, such as analyses by NTIA and Pew Research  Center. We analyzed data on the use of in-home fixed and mobile- wireless internet, as well as of various computing devices. In our analysis  we also included variables on household income, to allow us to report  results based on different income ranges. When analyzing responses by  household income, we grouped household income into similar ranges that  NTIA publishes on its Data Explorer website, but we consolidated the top  two ranges used by NTIA into one range. To determine the reliability of  these data, we reviewed NTIA technical documentation on the survey,  interviewed NTIA officials, and compared our estimates of selected  variables with estimates presented by NTIA on its website. We found  these data were sufficiently reliable for reporting on data on internet and  computing device use by household income levels.", "In addition, we conducted a literature search to review challenges lower- income school-age children who lack in\u2013home internet face in doing  homework that involves internet access.

We reviewed the abstracts of results from the search for publications  most relevant to our work and fully reviewed publications that, based on  their abstract, were most suited to this engagement. We used relevant  publications to support findings we collected from other sources, including  interviews.", "We also conducted semi-structured interviews with a range of  stakeholders, including education industry associations, researchers, and  advocacy organizations we selected based on literature, internet  searches, and recommendations from those we interviewed. Specifically,  we interviewed eight education or technology industry associations or  advocacy organizations, one education researcher, one technology  industry researcher, and representatives of one technology company that  provides internet services and products to schools. In addition, we  interviewed officials with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)  and Department of Education (Education).", "We also reviewed a non-generalizable sample of six projects involving  seven local school districts taking steps to provide wireless internet  access outside of school for students who may lack internet at home.

From this list, we then  selected those projects that were frequently cited in the press or by others  we interviewed; that covered a variety of geographic locations, including  those in both urban and rural areas; and that included a variety of  approaches to addressing the homework gap. During these interviews,  we asked interviewees about a range of topics, including the extent to  which school-age children have access to in-home and wireless internet  and challenges faced by students who may only have mobile wireless  access. In total we interviewed 17 stakeholders, including the industry  associations, researchers, and school districts detailed above. We  analyzed the content of the interviews to identify key challenges identified  by stakeholders. These interviews did not provide a complete list of all  challenges, and the results of these interviews are not generalizable but  do provide insight into a range of issues.", "To determine what selected school districts are doing to expand wireless  internet access for their students and the federal role in such efforts, we  conducted semi-structured interviews with officials at the school districts  listed above and officials at Microsoft regarding its efforts to expand  wireless access for students who may lack internet at home.
