VA requires facilities to record and report data on primary care panel sizes to help facilities manage their workload and ensure that veterans receive timely and efficient care. VA also requires facilities to record and report data on primary care encounters and expenditures.", "GAO was asked to examine these data and VA's oversight of primary care. This report examines (1) VA's panel size data across facilities and how VA uses these data to oversee primary care, and (2) VA's encounter and expenditure data across facilities and how VA uses these data to oversee primary care. GAO analyzed fiscal year 2014 data on primary care panel size, encounters, and expenditures for all VA facilities. GAO also conducted a more in-depth, nongeneralizable analysis of data and interviewed officials from seven facilities, selected based on geographic diversity and differences in facility complexity. GAO also interviewed VA Central Office and network officials to examine their oversight of primary care, including the extent to which they verify the data and use it to monitor the management of primary care."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) data on primary care panel sizes\u2014that is, the number of patients VA providers and support staff are assigned as part of their patient portfolio\u2014are unreliable across VA's 150 medical facilities and cannot be used to monitor facilities' management of primary care. Specifically, as part of its review, GAO found missing values and other inaccuracies in VA's data. Officials from VA's Primary Care Operations Office confirmed that facilities sometimes record and self-report these data inaccurately or in a manner that does not follow VA's policy and noted that this could result in the data reliability concerns GAO identified. GAO obtained updated data from six of seven selected facilities, corrected these data for inaccuracies, and then calculated the actual panel sizes for the six facilities. GAO found that for these six facilities the actual panel size varied from 23 percent below to 11 percent above the modeled panel size, which is the number of patients for whom a provider and support staff can reasonably deliver primary care as projected by VA. Such wide variation raises questions about whether veterans are receiving access to timely care and the appropriateness of the size of provider workload at these facilities.", "Moreover, GAO found that while VA's primary care panel management policy requires facilities to ensure the reliability of their panel size data, it does not assign responsibility to VA Central Office or networks for verifying the reliability of facilities' data or require them to use the data for monitoring purposes. Federal internal control standards call for agencies to clearly define key areas of authority and responsibility, ensure that reliable information is available, and use this information to assess the quality of performance over time. Because VA's panel management policy is inconsistent with federal internal control standards, VA lacks assurance that its facilities' data are reliable and that the facilities are managing primary care panels in a manner that meets VA's goals of providing efficient, timely, and quality care to veterans.", "In contrast to VA's panel data, GAO found that primary care encounter and expenditure data reported by all VA medical facilities are reliable, although the data show wide variations across facilities. For example, in fiscal year 2014, expenditures per primary care encounter\u2014that is, a professional contact between a patient and a primary care provider\u2014ranged from a low of $150 to a high of $396 after adjusting to account for geographic differences in labor costs across facilities. Such wide variations may indicate that services are being delivered inefficiently at some facilities with relatively higher per encounter costs compared to other facilities. However, while VA verifies and uses these data for financial purposes, VA's policies governing primary care do not require the use of the data to monitor facilities' management of primary care. Federal internal control standards state that agencies need both operational and financial data to determine whether they are meeting strategic goals and should use such data to assess the quality of performance over time. Using panel size data in conjunction with encounter and expenditure data would allow VA to assess facilities' capacity to provide primary care services and the efficiency of their care delivery. By not using available encounter and expenditure data in this manner, VA is missing an opportunity to potentially improve the efficiency of primary care service delivery."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA verify facilities' panel size data, monitor and address panel sizes that are too high or too low, and review and document how to use encounter and expenditure data to help monitor facilities' management of primary care. VA agreed with GAO's recommendations and described its plans to implement them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 (VA) Veterans Health Administration  (VHA) provided care to about 6.6 million veterans in fiscal year 2014 and  spent about $58 billion for their care in that year. Primary care services  are often the entry point to the VA health care system for veterans,  including an aging veteran population and a growing number of younger  veterans returning from military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Veterans may obtain primary care services at VA\u2019s 150 medical facilities,  which include medical centers and more than 800 community based  outpatient clinics (CBOCs). Primary care services are delivered through  patient aligned care teams consisting of a primary care provider and  support staff\u2014a nurse care manager, clinical associate, and  administrative clerk. When other services are needed to meet patient  goals and needs, these teams oversee and coordinate that care. VA\u2019s  medical facilities are overseen by 21 Veterans Integrated Service  Networks\u2014called networks\u2014and by VA\u2019s Central Office, which oversees  the entire VA health care system.", "In recent years, VA has emphasized providing primary care as the way to  enhance health care delivery to meet veterans\u2019 needs. In support of this  emphasis, VA has detailed guidelines regarding how primary care is to be  provided and staffed, including a requirement that medical facilities record  and report data on primary care panel size\u2014that is, the number of  patients for whom a patient aligned care team delivers primary care  services. According to VA, panel size is an important factor in helping VA  determine the total number of patients that can be cared for in the VA  health care system; moreover, maintaining appropriate panel sizes helps  ensure that providers will be able to offer quality care in a timely manner  to a reasonable number of patients. Panel sizes that are too high may  lead to veterans experiencing delays in obtaining care among other  negative effects, and panel sizes that are too low may be associated with  inefficiency and wasted resources. Data on panel size can also help VA  facilities manage and VA Central Office and networks oversee VA\u2019s  primary care program. In addition to data on panel sizes, VA policy also  requires facilities to record and report data on primary care encounters\u2014 that is, the number and types of visits to a primary care provider\u2014and  expenditures for delivering primary care. According to VA officials, data  on encounters and expenditures may help VA oversee its primary care  program by identifying potential inefficiencies.", "GAO and others have recently reported that VA has not provided  veterans timely access to care. To address such issues, Congress  enacted the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014,  which, among other things, requires VA to submit biennial reports on  various factors related to staffing, including primary care staffing models.  Members of Congress have raised questions about the extent to which  VA has sufficient resources to provide more timely access to quality  primary care and whether these resources are being used efficiently in  the service of this goal. Members have also raised questions about how  data on primary care panel sizes, encounters, and expenditures are being  used to oversee the primary care provided across VA. We were asked to  examine what these data show and how VA uses available data to  oversee its primary care program. In this report, we examine  1.  what VA\u2019s panel size data show across facilities and how VA Central  Office and networks use these data to oversee primary care, and  2.  what VA\u2019s encounter and expenditure data show across facilities and  how VA Central Office and networks use these data to oversee  primary care.", "To examine what VA\u2019s panel size data show across facilities and how VA  Central Office and networks use these data to oversee primary care, we  reviewed VA data and policy documents and interviewed officials from  VHA\u2019s Primary Care Operations Office, within VA Central Office. We  analyzed fiscal year 2014 data from the Primary Care Operations Office  for all of VA\u2019s facilities on 1) modeled panel size, which represents the  number of patients on a primary care panel for whom a patient aligned  care team is expected to deliver primary care as projected by VA for each  facility, and 2) reported panel size, which represents the average number  of patients on a primary care panel that each facility reports to the  Primary Care Operations Office. We did not evaluate VA\u2019s model for  developing panel sizes. We also reviewed the number of patients, full- time equivalent (FTE) providers, support staff, and exam rooms that each  facility records and reports to the Primary Care Operations Office. In  addition to examining the panel size data for all VA facilities, we  conducted a more detailed examination of these data at seven facilities,  which were selected based on geographic diversity and differences in  facility complexity. The seven facilities we selected were located in  Detroit, Michigan; Dublin, Georgia; Los Angeles, California; Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania; St. Cloud, Minnesota; Temple, Texas; and Washington,  D.C.", "We conducted a data reliability assessment of the data for all of VA\u2019s  facilities. This assessment included checks for missing values and  outliers as well as interviews with VA officials knowledgeable about the  data, including officials from selected facilities, the networks responsible  for the oversight of the selected facilities, and the Primary Care  Operations Office. Our review of the data revealed concerns about  facilities\u2019 reported panel sizes and other reported data elements that were  attributable to inaccuracies in how facilities recorded the data, which  precluded us from using these data to report panel sizes across all of  VA\u2019s facilities. As a result of these data inaccuracies, we only calculated  actual panel sizes for six of the seven selected facilities where we were  able to use updated data provided by each facility and correct for  inaccuracies. We then compared the actual panel size to each facility\u2019s  modeled panel size for fiscal year 2014 and examined potential reasons  for any variations we observed. We also examined the extent to which  reported panel size and related data were being accurately recorded and  reported by the seven facilities. Our analysis is not generalizable beyond  the facilities we reviewed. In addition, we assessed oversight activities  across the networks we reviewed and for VA Central Office in the context  of federal internal control standards for control environment, information  and communication, and monitoring. Federal internal control standards  provide an overall framework for establishing and maintaining internal  control and for identifying and addressing major performance and  management challenges and areas at greatest risk of fraud, waste,  abuse, and mismanagement. Under the standards for internal control,  control environment requires that the agency\u2019s organizational structure  clearly defines key areas of authority and responsibility; information and  communication requires reliable information to determine whether an  agency is meeting its goals for accountability for effective and efficient  use of resources; and monitoring should assess the quality of  performance over time.", "To examine what VA\u2019s encounter and expenditure data show across  facilities and how VA Central Office and networks use these data to  oversee primary care, we reviewed VA data and policy documents and  interviewed officials from the seven selected facilities, the networks  responsible for the oversight of the selected facilities, and VHA\u2019s Primary  Care Operations Office and the Office of Finance. We analyzed fiscal  year 2014 primary care encounter data\u2014including the number of  encounters for both face-to-face and telephone primary care  appointments\u2014expenditure data, and data on the number of unique  primary care patients for all VA facilities. Using these data, we calculated  expenditures per encounter and expenditures per unique patient across  all of VA\u2019s medical facilities and identified cases where facilities had  expenditures per encounter that were significantly above or below the VA  average. We conducted a data reliability assessment of the data that we  used, which included checks for missing values and interviews with  officials from the Office of Finance, who were knowledgeable about the  data. Our review revealed some inconsistencies and errors in the  encounter and expenditure data reported by facilities, which we discussed  with officials from the Office of Finance. Overall, however, we found that  these inconsistencies and errors did not compromise the overall  completeness and accuracy of the encounter and expenditure data. As a  result, we determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. In addition, we assessed the oversight activities performed by  the networks that oversee the seven facilities we reviewed and by VA  Central Office in the context of the federal internal control standards for  information and communication and monitoring.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2014 to October 2015  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Officials from the Primary Care Operations Office,  whom we interviewed about the reliability of these data, agreed that  inaccuracies exist in the way facilities report data elements in PCMM,  such as the number of patients assigned to primary care panels and the  number of FTE providers, support staff, and exam rooms. Primary Care  Operations Office officials pointed out that because the data are self- reported, facilities can and sometimes do record the data inaccurately or  in a manner that does not follow VA\u2019s policy on panel management. For  example, the officials stated that some facilities may not count support  staff and exam rooms as outlined in VA\u2019s policy. These officials also  stated that PCMM has limitations that may affect the reliability of facilities\u2019  reported panel size data. For example, officials explained that the  software makes it difficult for facilities to ensure that inactive patients (i.e.,  those who have not seen their primary care provider within the preceding  two years or have died) are removed from providers\u2019 panels.", "We identified similar inaccuracies in our more in depth review of panel  size data reported by the seven selected facilities. Specifically, at three  facilities we found inaccuracies in the reported number of FTE primary  care providers and the reported number of patients, which impacted the  facilities\u2019 reported or modeled panel sizes. For example, the number of  FTE primary care providers reported by one of these facilities was too   low because the facility incorrectly recorded each FTE provider as only   90 percent of a FTE. We did not identify inaccuracies in the data  reported by the remaining four facilities. (See table 1.)", "Because some medical facilities\u2019 reported panel size data are unreliable,  VA Central Office and network officials cannot readily determine each  facility\u2019s average primary care panel size nor compare these panel sizes  to each facility\u2019s modeled panel size to help ensure that care is being  delivered in a timely manner to a reasonable number of patients.  Moreover, having unreliable data can misinform VA in other aspects as  well. For example, because VA\u2019s model is based on historical data  reported by facilities, unreliable data may result in VA\u2019s modeled panel  size being too high or too low for certain facilities. Also, if facilities are  using unreliable data to manage their primary care panels\u2014for example,  using the data to assign patients to primary care providers\u2014the facilities  may be misinformed about the available capacity on primary care  providers\u2019 panels\u2014information that is key to determining facilities\u2019 staffing  and other resource needs.", "Primary Care Operations Office officials told us that they intend to  address data reliability issues over time. Specifically, the Primary Care  Operations Office is in the process of implementing new software, called  web-PCMM, which officials believe will address some concerns about the  reliability of the data because the software features controls to help  ensure that facilities record and report the data accurately and  consistently. For example, web-PCMM will automatically remove inactive  patients from providers\u2019 panels. In preparation for the implementation of  web-PCMM, Primary Care Operations Office officials said they have been  training network and facility staff on the features and capabilities of the  new software and instructing facility staff to review and correct their panel  size data to help improve data accuracy. It is not yet known the extent to  which the new software will actually address the data reliability issues  because facilities will continue to self-report data. The Primary Care  Operations Office started piloting the new software at selected facilities in  2014 and had planned to implement it agency-wide after resolving  software interoperability issues identified during the pilot. However,  officials said that implementation is currently on hold because of a lack of  funding, and the officials could not provide an updated timeframe for its  system-wide implementation. According to these officials, VA has spent  about $8.8 million through July 2015 on the development and  implementation of web-PCMM and requires an additional $1.5 million to  implement it agency-wide."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Wide Variations Exist between Actual Panel Sizes and VA\u2019s Modeled Panel Size at Medical Facilities We Reviewed", "paragraphs": ["Because reliable data on reported panel sizes were not available for all of  VA\u2019s facilities at the time of our review, we calculated actual panel sizes  at six of the seven selected facilities using updated data from these  facilities and correcting for the inaccuracies we found at two facilities.

Although Primary Care Operations Office officials  recommend that facilities keep panel sizes 10 to 15 percent below  modeled panel sizes to accommodate growth and provider attrition, we  found that actual panel sizes ranged from 23 percent below to 11 percent  above their respective modeled panel size. This wide variation may  indicate that actual panel sizes at some facilities are too low\u2014potentially  leading to inefficiency and wasted resources\u2014or too high\u2014potentially  leading to veterans experiencing delays in obtaining care, among other  negative effects. It may also indicate that VA\u2019s modeled panel sizes are  determined incorrectly based on unreliable facility data or do not  sufficiently account for patient acuity levels and demand for primary care  services. Actual average panel sizes across the six facilities ranged from  a low of 1,000 patients per provider to a high of 1,338 patients per  provider. (See fig. 2.)", "At the three facilities where actual panel sizes were the highest of the six  for which we calculated the actual panel sizes, officials cited three key  factors that contributed to the higher panel sizes.", "Growing patient demand: Officials at all three facilities stated that the  growing number of patients seeking primary care services at their  facilities has required them to assign a larger number of patients to  each provider. Officials at one of these facilities stated that not  assigning new patients to a panel would result in a greater number of  walk-in patients seeking emergency care and a loss of continuity of  care.", "Staffing shortages: Officials at all three facilities described difficulty  recruiting primary care providers, which resulted in a shortage of  providers. At one of these facilities, about 40 percent of primary care  provider positions were vacant at the time of our review. Officials at all  three facilities attributed recruiting difficulties to the rural location of  these facilities, lack of academic affiliation of the facilities, and the  lower pay that VA offers primary care providers compared to nearby  private sector medical facilities. In addition, at one of these facilities,  officials stated that non-compete clauses limited the facility\u2019s ability to  hire providers currently working in the private sector who might  otherwise seek employment with VA.", "Exam room shortages: Officials at two of the three facilities stated that  a lack of available exam room space has limited their ability to hire  additional primary care providers\u2014and thereby reduce panel sizes.  They stated that the process for acquiring additional space\u2014whether  through building additional space or leasing it\u2014is cumbersome and  requires extensive preplanning. For example, at one of these facilities,  officials stated that expanding the facility\u2019s existing exam room space  or opening another CBOC to accommodate growing demand for  primary care typically takes 5 to 6 years. The officials told us that  while the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014  provided facilities with funds to acquire additional space, it did not  simplify the process for acquiring space.", "Officials at two of the three facilities stated that the higher actual panel  sizes have contributed to provider burnout and attrition. At one facility\u2014 where actual panel sizes were 11 percent above the modeled panel  size\u2014officials stated that the facility has been unable to hire enough  providers to make up for attrition. The officials added that providers have  expressed concerns to facility leadership that high panel sizes were  impeding their ability to provide safe and effective patient care. All three  facilities have taken measures to address higher actual panel sizes. For  example, in order to ease staffing shortages the facilities have contracted  with non-VA providers to provide care at VA facilities and have offered  evening and weekend clinic hours to fully utilize available exam room  space. However, while these measures have helped address capacity  shortages at these facilities, they do not fully address the longstanding  concerns resulting from higher panel sizes.", "In contrast, at the facility where actual panel size was the lowest of the six  we reviewed\u201423 percent below its modeled panel size\u2014officials said  they have made a concerted effort to establish lower panel sizes while  increasing the number of primary care providers. Officials stated that they  had recently lowered providers\u2019 panel sizes because they believed that  the modeled panel size did not sufficiently account for factors affecting  patients\u2019 demand for primary care services, such as high acuity levels.  These officials noted that they previously followed the modeled panel size  but found that it was too high and resulted in primary care provider  burnout and poor patient access to primary care providers. Since VA  Central Office and network staff generally do not examine differences  across medical facilities VA-wide, it is unclear whether the facility with  lower panel sizes for providers was providing primary care services in an  inefficient manner or whether VA\u2019s modeled panel size for this facility was  too high."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Central Office and Networks Do Not Have Effective Oversight Processes for Verifying and Using Facilities\u2019 Panel Size Data to Monitor Primary Care", "paragraphs": ["VA Central Office and networks do not have effective oversight processes  for verifying and using facilities\u2019 panel size data to monitor facilities\u2019  management of primary care.

Officials from another network stated  that they compared data reported by facilities to data previously  reported by the facilities to identify large variations. Officials from the  remaining three networks told us that they did not any take steps to  verify that facilities\u2019 reported panel size data were reliable.

For example, officials at one network told us that they helped a  facility recruit additional primary care providers to address high panel  sizes. In another network, officials said that they were helping a facility  secure additional exam room space to address high panel sizes.  Officials at a third network told us that they recently had to curtail  monitoring activities to address facilities\u2019 panel sizes due to staffing  shortages. In contrast, officials from the one network that does not  use panel size data to monitor facilities\u2019 management of primary care  told us that they rely on the facilities to manage their own primary care  panels and do not believe that the network should take an active role  in this process.

We also analyzed expenditures per unique primary care patient\u2014that is,  a patient with at least one primary care encounter in fiscal year 2014\u2014 and found similar variation across VA\u2019s facilities. (See app. I.) We found  that this variation remained when examining expenditures by encounter  and per unique patient for facilities within the same complexity group.", "Of the seven selected facilities, one was among the least expensive  facilities across all VA facilities and another was among the most  expensive, in terms of expenditures per primary care encounter. An  official from the facility that was among the least expensive of the seven  we reviewed, with expenditures per encounter of $158, identified an  increased use of secure messaging and telephone primary care as  primary factors that contributed to a lower expenditure per encounter.  Officials from the network that oversees the facility that was among the  most expensive of the seven we reviewed, with expenditures per  encounter of $330, identified the high cost of living in the area\u2014which  resulted in higher leasing and labor costs\u2014as the primary factor that  contributed to a higher than average cost per encounter. However, our  analysis largely accounted for the higher cost of living in that expenditure  data provided by VA were adjusted to account for geographic differences  in labor costs, which made up 71 percent of this facility\u2019s costs in fiscal  year 2014. The officials also explained that part of the reason for the high  expenditures per encounter was that the facility was not appropriately  accounting for telephone-based primary care services it provided for the  entire network. As a result, primary care encounters and expenditures for  the selected facility included encounters and expenditures for telephone  primary care services for other facilities within the network. According to  network officials, steps are being taken to ensure that the facility is  allocating these expenditures appropriately going forward."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Central Office and Networks Verify and Use Facilities\u2019 Encounter and Expenditure Data for Financial Purposes, But Not to Monitor Primary Care", "paragraphs": ["While VA Central Office and networks verify and use facilities\u2019 encounter  and expenditure data for financial purposes, VA\u2019s policies governing  primary care do not require VA Central Office and networks to use these  data to monitor facilities\u2019 management of primary care.

Similarly, chief financial officers or their designees at six of  the seven networks that oversee the facilities we reviewed routinely  examine encounter and expenditure data to identify outliers for the  purposes of ensuring data reliability and for cost accounting. However,  the Primary Care Operations Office in VA Central Office does not use  encounter and expenditure data, even though officials stated that  examining such data would likely help them monitor facilities\u2019  management of primary care. Furthermore, primary care officials at the  seven networks we examined generally do not use these data to monitor  facilities\u2019 management of primary care. Some officials told us that they do  not use encounter and expenditure data for monitoring primary care  delivery because panel sizes are the most effective means of measuring  efficiency within primary care.", "By not using encounter and expenditure data to monitor facilities\u2019  management of primary care, VA may be missing opportunities to identify  facilities\u2014such as those that experience higher than average  expenditures per encounter or significant changes in expenditures over  time\u2014that may warrant further examination and to strengthen the  efficiency and effectiveness of the primary care program.

While  VA planned to address some of the data reliability issues through new  software to help VA facilities record data more accurately, development of  this software is currently on hold, and VA could not provide any estimates  of when the software would be implemented at its facilities. Even if this  software is implemented, VA Central Office and networks will still be  relying on self-reported data on primary care panel sizes from its facilities.  By not having in place a process to verify the reliability of facilities\u2019 panel  size data or to monitor wide variations between facilities\u2019 reported and  modeled panel sizes, VA will likely continue to receive unreliable data and  miss opportunities to assess the impact of panel sizes on veterans\u2019  access to care. VA Central Office and the networks are also missing  opportunities to use readily available encounter and expenditure data to  potentially improve the efficiency of primary care service delivery.

In particular, we modified our first  recommendation in the draft report and now recommend that VA verify  each facility\u2019s panel size data in PCMM and, if the latter is available, in  web-PCMM. We made this change to reflect the continued uncertainty  over the implementation of the web-PCMM software. In addition, we  modified our second recommendation in the draft report and no longer  recommend VA incorporate into existing VA policy a requirement that the  agency and its networks use encounter and expenditure data to  strengthen the monitoring of facilities\u2019 management of primary care.

In its response, however, VA did not provide information  on how it plans to address unreliable panel size data facilities record and  report in PCMM. We would encourage VA, in the guidance it plans to  issue in 2016, to assign responsibility for verifying each facility's reported  panel size data as we recommended. To address our second  recommendation, VA stated that it will take steps to understand encounter  and expenditure data and determine how best to utilize these data to  improve patient care with a target completion date for presenting its  findings and decisions by September 2018.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 14 days from the  report date.
