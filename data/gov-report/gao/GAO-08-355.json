While FinCEN's regulations allow institutions to exempt certain customers, over 15 million CTRs were filed in 2006. Public Law 109-351 directed GAO to report on (1) the usefulness of CTRs to law enforcement; (2) depository institutions' costs of meeting CTR requirements; and (3) ways to encourage use of exemptions to avoid unnecessary CTRs. Among other things, GAO obtained data from FinCEN on CTRs and exemptions from 2004 to 2006, surveyed 115 state and local law enforcement agencies and 680 depository institutions, held structured interviews with officials of federal agencies and depository institutions, and reviewed relevant laws and regulations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to federal, state, and local law enforcement officials, CTRs provide unique and reliable information essential to a variety of efforts, and recent advances in technology have enhanced law enforcement agencies' ability to use CTR data by integrating it with other information. In addition to supporting specific investigations, CTR requirements aid law enforcement by forcing criminals attempting to avoid reportable transactions to act in ways that increase chances of detection through other methods. Linking law enforcement's use of CTRs to specific outcomes is difficult, however, because agencies do not track their use of CTRs, which are typically one of many information sources used in investigations. FinCEN does not routinely publish summary information on law enforcement uses of CTR data--as it does for other data required under the BSA--that could help depository institutions understand the value of CTRs. While fewer than 30 of the largest U.S. depository institutions accounted for over half of new CTRs filed during the period GAO examined, all of the nation's approximately 17,000 institutions incur some costs to meet CTR requirements. Institutions must have processes and staff in place to identify when and if a CTR is required, as well as the ability to aggregate same-day cash transactions by or on behalf of the same person; file CTRs correctly; and, if desired, establish and maintain exemptions for certain customers. Institutions GAO contacted were generally unable to quantify these costs, in large part because they use the same processes and staff for other purposes. While automation has made CTR tasks less difficult, almost all institutions reported that they have not completely automated all steps, such as reviews of CTRs by institution officials. GAO's work identified a number of factors that deter use of exemptions, as well as opportunities for increasing their use, thereby reducing the number of CTRs that are likely of little or no value to law enforcement efforts. As reasons for not exempting eligible customers, institutions cited uncertainty about the documentation required to demonstrate that some customers are in fact eligible, along with concern that federal banking regulators (who examine institutions for compliance with CTR requirements) would find fault. Institutions also cited as deterrents the need to meet FinCEN's regulatory requirements to (1) file an exemption form, and annually review the supporting data, particularly for hundreds of customers that are specifically exempted by statute; and (2) biennially renew eligibility for some customers--a process that as a practical matter duplicates the required annual reviews for those customers. Institution officials indicated that additional guidance from FinCEN, as well as Web-based material to help train their staff in making exemption determinations, could increase the use of exemptions. Removing regulatory deterrents and providing additional guidance and Web-based material could help depository institutions avoid filing unnecessary CTRs without harming law enforcement efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["To assist law enforcement agencies in their efforts to combat money  laundering, the financing of terrorist activities, and other crimes, financial  institutions are required to provide the federal government with  information on customers engaging in certain currency transactions under  the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). Among other things, the BSA\u2014administered  by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement  Network (FinCEN)\u2014and its implementing regulations require financial  institutions to file currency transaction reports (CTR) when their  customers make large cash transactions, currently defined by regulation as  those exceeding $10,000. In 2006, the government received about 15  million CTRs, the vast majority of which were filed by depository  institutions (banks, thrifts, and credit unions).", "To reduce the number of CTRs with limited usefulness to law enforcement  efforts, in 1994 Congress enacted provisions allowing depository  institutions to exempt two broad categories of customers that meet  specified criteria. For these exempted customers, the institutions do not  have to file CTRs, because the customers\u2019 cash transactions would likely be  of little or no value to law enforcement efforts. First, the law required  FinCEN to provide appropriate exemptions for customers that are another  depository institution; governmental entities, including state and local  governments; certain other entities exercising U.S., state, and local  governmental authority; and \u201cany business or category of business the  reports on which have little or no value for law enforcement purposes,\u201d  which FinCEN has defined through regulations to generally include  companies that are listed on any of three stock exchanges (listed  companies) and subsidiaries that are 51 percent or more owned by a listed  company. Second, the law authorized FinCEN to establish, through  regulation, exemptions for \u201cqualified business customers\u201d that maintain an  account at the depository institution, frequently engage in large cash  transactions, and meet other criteria specified by regulation. FinCEN\u2019s  regulations provide that certain qualified business customers may not  derive more than 50 percent of their gross revenue from activities or lines  of business specifically deemed ineligible, such as the purchase or sale of  automobiles or gaming of most kinds. Because FinCEN promulgated the  regulations for these two categories in separate rule-making phases, the  exemptions are commonly referred to as \u201cPhase I\u201d and \u201cPhase II\u201d  exemptions, respectively. It is up to the depository institutions as to  whether they actually exempt each of their customers who are eligible for  exemption; if they do, the institutions must file an exemption form  documenting the customer\u2019s eligibility and must review and verify  eligibility at least once each year.", "Depository institutions have expressed concerns about the cost and effort  required to meet CTR filing requirements\u2014including the steps needed to  establish and maintain exemptions for their customers\u2014as well as doubts  about the usefulness of CTRs to law enforcement agencies. They note that  they are also required, under the BSA, to file with FinCEN Suspicious  Activity Reports (SAR) in cases of certain transactions that may involve  violations of law or regulation, including money laundering. However, law  enforcement officials have maintained that the CTR requirements help  deter money laundering and that CTRs provide information that is highly  useful to their investigations. Data from CTRs are aggregated and stored  electronically in a large database accessible to law enforcement agencies  and maintained for FinCEN by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The  database also includes information about customers for which institutions  have filed exemption forms.", "The Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006 required that we  examine several aspects of CTRs, including their usefulness to law  enforcement and the burden on depository institutions filing them, and to  determine whether CTR filing rules could be modified without harming law  enforcement operations. This report discusses (1) the usefulness of CTRs  to federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies; (2) the costs to  depository institutions of meeting CTR requirements; and (3) factors that  affect depository institutions\u2019 decisions to exempt or not exempt eligible  customers, including opportunities for encouraging use of exemptions  while maintaining the usefulness of CTR data to law enforcement agencies.", "To examine the usefulness of CTRs to federal, state, and local law  enforcement agencies, we first obtained data from both FinCEN and IRS  indicating the frequency of access to the CTR database by specific  agencies. We conducted structured interviews with officials of 12 federal  agencies and organizations\u2014including those that most frequently accessed  CTR data in 2006, such as FinCEN, IRS, the Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and the U.S.  Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Immigration and Customs  Enforcement (ICE). In addition, we used a Web-based instrument to survey  all 115 state and local law enforcement agencies that had access to CTR  data as of May 2007; our overall response rate was 77 percent. We  supplemented the survey by interviewing officials of 12 state and 5 local  law enforcement agencies, selected to achieve a mix of agencies that had  accessed CTR data frequently and agencies that had not. We asked officials  at the law enforcement agencies to identify how information provided by  CTRs is useful to their efforts and how technological changes have affected  the use of CTR data. To understanding filing trends and obtain information  on depository institutions\u2019 costs to meet CTR requirements, we first  analyzed FinCEN\u2019s CTR and exemption data covering 3 calendar years\u2014 2004, 2005, and 2006\u2014to identify the numbers of CTRs and exemptions  filed by depository institutions of different sizes. For this purpose, we  established four size categories (based on the dollar value of  institutions\u2019assets) for banks and thrifts and three categories for credit  unions. To obtain specific information on the costs of meeting CTR  requirements, we conducted 35 structured interviews with officials of  depository institutions of different sizes. We asked the officials whether  they use manual or automated processes and what costs they incur to meet  CTR requirements, including the costs of filing individual CTRs and  exemption forms. Finally, to identify the factors affecting depository  institutions\u2019 exemption decisions, as well as opportunities for potentially  increasing the use of exemptions, we used a Web-based instrument to  survey 680 of the 3,880 depository institutions that filed at least 120 CTRs in  2006, stratified by asset size category. Our overall response rate was 68  percent. When presenting the survey results, all percentage estimates in  this report have 95 percent intervals of within plus or minus 8 percentage  points of the estimate, unless otherwise noted. This report does not contain  all of the results of our surveys of law enforcement agencies and depository  institutions, but the surveys and a more complete tabulation of the results  can be viewed at http://www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-08-385SP. We also  analyzed statutory and regulatory filing requirements and interviewed  officials and examiners from the five federal banking regulators to obtain  their viewpoints on the difficulties, if any, institutions might confront in  meeting the CTR and exemption filing requirements. We also obtained data  on BSA examinations conducted by each of the regulators for 2005 and  2006, particularly data on their citations of depository institutions for  noncompliance with CTR requirements. Additional details on our methods  are presented in appendix I. We conducted this performance audit from  November 2007 through February 2008 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we  plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to  provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["According to BSA\u2019s objectives, CTRs are to have a \u201chigh degree of  usefulness\u201d and their uses include criminal, tax, or regulatory  investigations or proceedings. In 2001, the USA PATRIOT Act added a  fourth purpose: the conduct of intelligence or counterintelligence  activities, including analysis, to protect against international terrorism.   CTRs are intended to provide a paper trail for federal, state, and local law  enforcement agencies in their investigations and, thus, potentially hinder  using financial institutions as intermediaries for the transfer or deposit of  money derived from criminal activity. A CTR records account cash  withdrawals and deposits, as well as currency exchanges, and wire  transfers purchased with cash, when the amount of the transaction is more  than $10,000. In addition to the dollar amount of the cash transaction, a  CTR records information about the account owner, including the owner\u2019s  occupation, and the identity of the person actually conducting the  transaction (the conductor), if not the account holder. A depository  institution must file a CTR for transactions that collectively exceed $10,000  during the course of a day if the institution has knowledge that they are for  or on behalf of the same person.", "The Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994 provided basic criteria for  establishing and maintaining exemptions and authorized Treasury to  establish further requirements. FinCEN has done so through both  regulations and \u201cinterpretative letters\u201d that supplement the regulations to  provide further guidance. Table 1 summarizes the requirements as outlined  in the statute, implementing regulations, and interpretive letters.", "Legislative proposals would alter the basis for establishing exemptions, as  well as raise the reporting threshold amount above $10,000. For example,  in January 2007, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Seasoned  Customer CTR Exemption Act of 2007 (H.R. 323), which would require the  Secretary of the Treasury to (1) prescribe regulations for exempting  \u201cqualified customers,\u201d including criteria for suspending, rejecting, or  revoking exemptions; and (2) periodically review the threshold amount and  adjust it for inflation as appropriate. H.R. 1447, the CTR Modernization Act,  introduced in March 2007, would raise the threshold amount for insured  depository institutions to $30,000.", "FinCEN\u2019s role is to oversee administration of the BSA throughout the  federal government. Pursuant to this role, FinCEN, among other things,  develops policy and provides guidance to other agencies and analyzes BSA  data for trends and patterns.

In addition to CTRs,  depository institutions are required by BSA and its implementing  regulations to make available information on their customers\u2019 transactions  in certain circumstances:  Depository institutions are required to file Suspicious Activity Reports  (SAR) with FinCEN if a transaction involves or aggregates at least  $5,000 in funds or other assets, and the institution knows, suspects, or  has reason to suspect that the transaction is designed to evade any  requirements of the BSA.", "Under Section 314(a) of the USA PATRIOT Act, federal law enforcement  agencies, through FinCEN, can reach out to financial institutions to  locate accounts and transactions of persons suspected of engaging in  terrorism or money laundering.", "FinCEN is responsible for providing these agencies with assistance in  educating institutions on their BSA responsibilities. To focus and direct  their efforts in supporting the effectiveness of BSA compliance, FinCEN\u2019s  strategic plan for fiscal years 2006-2008 outlines several goals. For  example, to assist law enforcement, the plan calls for FinCEN to reduce the  number of CTRs filed on legitimate financial transactions that are of little  or no value to law enforcement; and, to assist financial institutions, the  plan calls for FinCEN to revise its data collection forms, regulations, and  practices to ensure that FinCEN collects the information necessary to meet  its mission while minimizing reporting burdens on the financial industry. In  addition, FinCEN indicated in its plan that it would consider providing  guidance on BSA requirements through written and Web-based materials  and by means of a call center to respond to specific questions.", "FinCEN, together with the IRS, is responsible for managing and storing the  BSA data that financial institutions report. Financial institutions that  submit CTRs in paper form mail them directly to IRS\u2019s Enterprise  Computing Center in Detroit. Institutions that submit data electronically  transmit them directly to FinCEN, which in turn transmits them to the  center. The center collects and stores all BSA data in its Currency Banking  and Retrieval System (CBRS). For fiscal year 2007, the IRS estimated the  total cost of processing CTRs to be about $7 million, including about $3.5  million to convert CTRs submitted on paper to an electronic format. IRS  examiners and investigators access BSA data directly through IRS\u2019s  Intranet, while FinCEN has a direct connection to the Enterprise  Computing Center.

However, access to BSA data at the  federal, state, and local levels has improved and technological advances  have made meaningful analysis of large BSA data sets possible. Consistent  with its strategic goal of facilitating information sharing through electronic  means, FinCEN has increased access to CTR (and other BSA) data in two  ways.", "First, FinCEN began providing selected federal agencies with access to  \u201cbulk\u201d CTR data\u2014essentially all of the data resulting from CTRs. In 2004,  FinCEN first provided the FBI with bulk transfer of data, and during 2005  and 2006 FinCEN agreed to provide two federal agencies\u2014the Secret  Service and ICE\u2014and a multiagency program established by the  Department of Justice (the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task  Force, or OCDETF Fusion Center) with access to a bulk data set.   Receiving these data in bulk, rather than accessing the database remotely  and querying it for specific records, allows agencies to conduct more  sophisticated analyses by combining the BSA data with other data sets, as  can be seen in the following examples.", "The FBI has combined bulk BSA data into its Investigative Data  Warehouse, a collection of more than 50 multisource data sets that  includes counter terrorism data. According to the FBI, access to BSA  bulk data has significantly increased its usage of CTR data (the bureau  reported data that indicated approximately 194,000 CTR views from  2004 through 2006 of the downloaded data). According to FBI officials,  about 40 percent of all FBI terrorism subjects appeared on CTRs that  were filed between January 1, 2000, and June 30, 2006; further, CTR data  were the most viewed data in the warehouse.", "OCDETF\u2019s Fusion Center integrated bulk BSA data with drug, financial,  and gang-related investigative data provided by several other federal,  state, and local law enforcement agencies. According to OCDETF  officials, as of June 2007, CTR data had appeared in 61 percent of the  Fusion Center\u2019s analytical products.", "ICE has combined BSA data with import and export data for selected  countries to help identify and detect discrepancies or anomalies in  international commerce that might indicate trade-based money  laundering.", "Second, FinCEN improved Internet access to CTR data. FinCEN provides  and grants access using its \u201cGateway\u201d program, through which law  enforcement staff may access the database using a system known as  WebCBRS. With WebCBRS, users can download large volumes of CTR  data\u2014up to 20,000 CTRs on a single query\u2014and export it to a spreadsheet  application, such as Excel. This allows users to more readily conduct  proactive analyses, such as identifying transaction trends by categories.  Most of the law enforcement officials with whom we spoke, as well as  officials of state and local agencies we surveyed, confirmed that WebCBRS  is more user friendly than its predecessor and has greatly improved their  ability to search for and analyze CTR data. (More detailed information  about the technological advances enabling greater use of CTR data, along  with examples of use in specific investigations, is presented in appendix II.

For example, from 2004 through 2006,  the number of agencies that viewed CTR data through the Gateway  program increased from 109 to 136 and, as of October 2007 requests from  an additional 110 agencies for access to CTR data were pending FinCEN\u2019s  review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Value CTRs as a Source of Unique, Reliable, and Timely Data", "paragraphs": ["Officials from law enforcement agencies we interviewed emphasized that  CTRs are important because they provide information that is often  unavailable from other sources, or is more objective or up-to-date than that  obtained from other sources. They cited ways in which CTRs provide more  comprehensive or timely information about a suspect\u2019s banking  transactions than they can obtain using other provisions of law.", "More specifically, law enforcement officials frequently identified the name  of the currency transaction\u2019s conductor\u2014the person who actually carries  out a cash transaction at a financial institution, but who is not the holder of  the affected accounts\u2014as useful information that is unique to CTRs. For  example, an FBI official noted a case in which analysis of information  obtained by searching the CTR database conductor field provided the  agency with the investigative lead needed to track the banking activities of  persons who, according to the FBI official, were involved in a cocaine  distribution ring. The conductor information was useful because the main  person under investigation in the ring had associates open bank accounts  in their own names at different banks and then made large currency  transactions into these accounts, resulting in CTRs that recorded the main  person under investigation as the conductor. Further, FinCEN and other  law enforcement officials explained that because multiple individuals may  use the same account to conduct transactions, CTRs often could be used to  identify unknown persons associated with suspects, thereby expanding the  scope of investigations. For example, during a 4-year FBI investigation,  analysis of CTRs showed where suspects were banking as they opened and  closed accounts, and on which day of the week suspects typically made  their deposits, allowing the FBI to better plan its surveillance.", "Law enforcement officials also noted that CTRs provide a unique source of  information on the occupations of account holders that often proves  useful. For example, a DEA official reported that analyzing CTRs by the  information in the occupation field has allowed him to identify whether  medical companies or doctors\u2014lines of businesses that typically would not  be dealing in high volumes of cash\u2014were diverting controlled substances  for illegal use. Finally, officials from several federal law enforcement  agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and  Explosives, IRS-Criminal Investigation, ICE, and DEA, commented that  because depository institutions are required to file CTRs soon after a  reportable transaction occurs, the CTR database provides up-to-date  information on large cash transactions. Many federal, state, and local  officials we interviewed commented that CTRs provided them with ready  access to information that they could not otherwise obtain in a timely  manner.", "Officials contrasted these useful aspects of information from CTRs with  information they may be able to obtain on suspects\u2019 banking activities  under other provisions of the BSA or other laws:  Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) also provide useful information;  however, depository institutions have some discretion in determining  whether a transaction or customer is \u201csuspicious,\u201d and therefore the  institutions determine whether to file a SAR and, if so, what information  to include. Thus, a SAR might not capture the same level of information  about specific transactions that a CTR routinely would provide. Further,  criminals may use several different banks to conduct their transactions,  and a SAR would reflect the suspicious activity only within the bank  filing the SAR.", "The Section 314(a) process, under which federal law enforcement  agencies may reach out to financial institutions to locate accounts and  transactions of persons of interest, is reserved for significant money- laundering or terrorist-financing investigations, and agencies may make  such requests only upon approval by FinCEN, which limits the number  of subjects on the list. Further, according to FinCEN, the request  provides lead information only\u2014law enforcement agencies must meet  the legal standards that apply to the investigative tool that it chooses to  use to obtain documents, such as a subpoena. In addition, officials at  FinCEN and the IRS noted that the 314(a) process provides law  enforcement access only to transactions conducted within the last 6  months, or accounts held within the last 12 months, while the CTR (and  other BSA) data provide access to data going back 10 years.", "Obtaining bank records through subpoenas could take months or be  difficult. Further, in order to subpoena a specific institution, officials  would need to know that a suspect banked at that institution. A majority  (55 percent) of the state and local law enforcement officials we  surveyed noted that it would be \u201csomewhat more\u201d or \u201cmuch more\u201d  difficult to obtain information from bank records in this fashion than  from using CTRs.", "Other methods of obtaining information about a suspect\u2019s bank  accounts\u2014including \u201cmail covers\u201d (copies, obtained from the U.S.  Postal Service, of the fronts of envelopes delivered to a suspect),  subpoenas for credit reports, and surveillance\u2014are time consuming and  less likely to provide needed information about a bank account,  according to law enforcement officials. ICE and state officials from New  York and Texas noted that their agencies could wait days to obtain mail  covers, with no guarantee of receiving one bearing an address of the  suspect\u2019s financial institution. New York state law enforcement officials  said that the next best alternative would be to subpoena a suspect\u2019s  credit report, a process that could take 30 days. While the credit report  may provide useful leads\u2014for example, a suspect\u2019s mortgage  application\u2014that the agency might then subpoena, the time required  would further lengthen the investigation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Reported Using CTR Data to Support a Wide Variety of Investigative Cases", "paragraphs": ["Most officials of law enforcement agencies we contacted indicated that  they most often use CTRs reactively, and many routinely review CTRs at  the beginning of each investigation. For example, tax investigators in IRS  routinely query BSA data to identify CTRs with information that suggests  situations such as a business paying employees in cash (and thus not  withholding taxes). However, law enforcement agencies typically did not  use CTRs in isolation to develop a case; rather, they used CTR data to  identify leads for further investigation, in part by comparing CTR  information with information from other sources. As explained by law  enforcement officials, the information in CTRs is useful in corroborating  information contained in other BSA reports. For example, agencies may  compare information from the CTR database to that obtained from Reports  of International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments  (CMIR), which report currency transported into the United States, to track  how businesses dispose of cash. Agencies also consult CTR data to obtain  more detailed information after reviewing SARs. For example, officials  from a High Intensity Money Laundering and Related Financial Crimes  Areas (HIFCA) noted that they used CTR data for 105 of the 120 reports  they filed over a recent 1-year period on investigations initiated after  reviewing SARs. In this regard, many law enforcement officials, including  those from ICE, IRS, and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office, noted that raising the  CTR filing threshold of $10,000 would affect adversely their ability to deter  money laundering, because the CTR threshold corresponds to those set in  other anti-money-laundering provisions. For example, officials from the  U.S. Attorney\u2019s office indicated that the CTR threshold works in tandem  with three other statutorily mandated reporting thresholds, which are also set at $10,000: the CMIR requirement; the Form 8300 requirement;  and the bulk cash smuggling statute.", "That no CTRs have been filed on business activities that might be expected  to generate them also provides valuable leads to law enforcement. For  instance, FinCEN, ICE, and DEA conduct analyses comparing known cash  flows documented through other sources with cash flows they would  expect CTRs to document. Officials at both FinCEN and ICE reported that  a search of BSA data for information on a cash business revealing no CTRs  could alert investigators that the business was not using traditional  depository institutions and direct their focus to nonbank financial  institutions such as money services businesses or to the possibility of  currency smuggling. Similarly, the lack of CTRs relating to particular  individuals or businesses can provide investigative leads. For example,  officials from FinCEN and a Florida law enforcement agency said that the  presence of a CMIR, coupled with an absence of related CTRs, could  provide intelligence that currency transported into the country was  subsequently laundered into the financial mainstream through  \u201cstructuring\u201d (making a series of cash transactions in amounts less than  $10,000). Another law enforcement official from Florida indicated that a  lack of CTRs corroborated findings from her agency\u2019s surveillance  operations that certain laundromats, dry cleaners, and travel agencies had  laundered millions of dollars.", "As shown in figure 1, the state and local law enforcement agencies we  surveyed found CTRs to be of most use when developing leads for existing  investigations. Officials from law enforcement agencies in California, New  York, and Texas\u2014states that were among the highest users of CTR data\u2014 indicated that their investigators typically used CTRs to identify a subject\u2019s  bank account numbers and associates who might be conducting  transactions on behalf of the subject. An official from one of these agencies  indicated that no other source of information enabled investigators to  \u201cmap\u201d the financial links between members of a criminal organization as  well as the CTR.", "Regarding types of investigations involving CTR data, officials of state and  local agencies we surveyed reported that they primarily use CTRs for  money-laundering, fraud, and drug investigations (see fig. 2). State law  enforcement officials we interviewed told us that they use CTRs for a wide  variety of investigations relating to money laundering, drugs, workers  compensation fraud, Medicaid fraud, mortgage fraud, and white collar  crime.", "State and local officials also indicated that the current threshold amount of  $10,000 was important to the usefulness of CTRs.

A law  enforcement investigator from Illinois indicated that many of the CTRs that  his agency\u2019s criminal intelligence center reviewed were those that  documented total transaction amounts between $10,000 and $20,000.

FinCEN officials indicated that their  analysts routinely analyze information from CTRs in conjunction with  information from SARs or other BSA reports to develop \u201cbig picture\u201d views  of suspicious financial activity.

While criminals can use a variety of means to launder their money,  law enforcement officials we interviewed pointed to three primary  methods that criminals use to avoid the CTR filing requirement:  structuring; bulk cash smuggling, or physically moving cash across borders  via courier or secreted in cargo; and trade-based money laundering, the  process of disguising the proceeds of crime and moving value through the  use of trade transactions.", "Many federal law enforcement officials said that the CTR reporting  requirement was critical in supporting the ability of depository institutions,  as well as their own investigators, to identify suspicious activity based on  the structuring of financial transactions to avoid CTRs. The BSA makes it  illegal to structure transactions to avoid triggering otherwise applicable  reporting requirements, such as the CTR, allowing federal prosecutors to  file charges against individuals who structure their cash transactions.   The structuring in which criminals engage to avoid CTRs may cause a  depository institution to file a SAR. FinCEN analysis of SARs filed by  depository institutions from April 1, 1996, through December 31, 2006,  showed that 1.5 million SARs, or 48 percent of all SARs filed by depository  institutions during this period, were filed based on suspicious activity  related to structuring or money laundering.", "Many law enforcement agencies routinely review SARs for evidence of  structuring. For example, IRS-Criminal Investigation officials said that their  agents are required to review SARs that report structuring. Officials we  interviewed at several law enforcement organizations, including three  associated with HIFCAs, indicated that they had formed teams to review  SARs to generate leads for cases based on structuring and said that they  regarded the CTR filing requirement as essential to supporting the ability of  depository institutions to identify suspicious activity. Federal law  enforcement officials also emphasized that the $10,000 CTR threshold  played a key role, by forcing criminals to make many more and smaller  transactions than otherwise would be required\u2014thus making them more  vulnerable to being reported for structuring. Officials from IRS, ICE, FBI,  and U.S. Attorneys Offices indicated that they believed large cash  transactions have become more uncommon as consumer access to credit  and electronic payment options increased in the 30 years since the  threshold was established, making the $10,000 threshold still relevant.", "The existence of the CTR filing requirement also can force criminals into  riskier activities such as bulk cash smuggling. According to an ICE  official, smuggling illegal proceeds in bulk cash form makes criminals more  vulnerable to detection because it is easier for agents of law enforcement  to interdict bulk cash shipments. Similarly, an official associated with the  Chicago High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) reported observing  an increase in bulk cash smuggling because criminals would rather take  their chances smuggling their proceeds in bulk cash to Mexico. In  response, the HIDTA has formed a highway patrol to interdict these cash  shipments. Officials from ICE, FinCEN, and the Justice Department also  reported that the increase in recent years of bulk cash smuggling across the  U.S.-Mexican border was an indicator of CTR success in deterring  criminals from depositing cash into domestic financial institutions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Measuring Usefulness of CTRs Is Difficult", "paragraphs": ["Linking law enforcement\u2019s use of CTRs to specific outcome measures is  difficult because agencies do not track their use of CTRs, which are  typically only one of many sources of information used to support  investigations.

IRS tabulates views that occur when  agencies access the database through WebCBRS, including its own views  through its Intranet access, while FinCEN tabulates views occurring  through the Gateway program. For example, data show over 1.6 million  views of CTRs by federal, state, and local agencies in 2006 (see table 2).", "According to FinCEN data, among users who accessed the CBRS database  through the Gateway program, state and local law enforcement agencies  accounted for about 33 percent and 3 percent of the total CTR views,  respectively. These users include state bureaus of investigation and  criminal prosecuting offices, such as state offices of attorneys general and  county prosecutors\u2019 offices.

Moreover, data on views during this  period may not reflect future trends because of the changes in access to the  CTR database discussed previously. For example, the numbers of CTRs  viewed by state and local users may increase due to the expanding number  of users with access and with more understanding of how CTRs can assist their efforts. Several officials from state and local law enforcement  agencies we interviewed indicated that they believed the use of CTR data  through Gateway probably would increase as users better understand the  value of BSA data. Also, as noted, FinCEN has recently made bulk  downloads of data available to several federal agencies.", "A second difficulty in measuring the impact specifically of CTR  requirements involves the way that CTRs are used\u2014primarily to support  investigations that also draw upon many other sources of information.  Officials from the federal investigative agencies we interviewed generally  stated that outcome measures, such as indictments or convictions, cannot  be linked exclusively to CTRs because they are typically one of many leads  used to develop an investigation. Similarly, most\u2014about 82 percent\u2014of the  state and local agencies we surveyed indicated that the number of  investigative leads provided by CTRs was the best outcome measure of  their CTR use. Further, officials from several local law enforcement  agencies noted that attorneys often negotiate plea agreements with the  defendant long before a case goes to trial; thus, no matter how critical the  role played by a CTR in the investigation, there would be no trial in which  CTRs could be used as evidence. In addition, federal, state, and local law  enforcement officials reported that they were more likely to use CTRs as a  basis for obtaining subpoenas to access specific bank account records than  to use CTRs themselves as evidence in court. Officials from IRS, DEA, and  Justice said that by the time a case moves to the trial phase, the  prosecution is more likely to use bank records as evidence because those  records are generally a more convincing form of evidence of a defendant\u2019s  transactions. However, investigators would use the CTR to locate the  defendant\u2019s bank accounts and identify the correct bank records to  subpoena. Further, according to an IRS official, CTRs generally were  presented in court only when bank records were not available or could not  be made available in a timely manner.", "FinCEN officials reported that the agency does not have outcome measures  related to CTR use and analysis because many of the cases FinCEN  supported were complex and might not result in tangible success for  several years.

A teller typically inputs the  information needed to fill out the CTR form, during or immediately  following a cash transaction greater than $10,000.

Additionally, some depository institutions  reported that they had software systems that automatically fill in some  parts of the form. Also, some banks have invested in software that  processes CTRs for final reviews by their compliance office staff.", "However, the extent of automation varied widely among specific steps in  the process (see fig. 5), and no survey respondents reported a completely  automated CTR process.  For instance, 35 percent of survey respondents  said they had a mostly or fully automated process for their tellers to fill out  CTR forms, while 48 percent reported this step was largely manual and 16  percent used a mix of manual and automated steps.

While we did not obtain data showing how the extent of automation  compares with the volume of CTRs filed, our structured interviews with  officials from depository institutions suggest that institutions filing the  most CTRs (generally the larger institutions) were more likely to have  highly automated processes than smaller institutions filing fewer CTRs.  Because of the cost, many smaller banks that do not file as many CTRs may  choose not to invest in systems that could provide a greater degree of  automation.", "The extent of automation could influence the time needed to process CTRs.

While we asked institutions we spoke with to provide  estimates of costs based on categories such as personnel, training, and  technology, not all institutions were able to do so because they do not  typically account for CTR costs in this way. However, officials from  institutions we interviewed did describe general types of costs and  provided some estimates.", "In general, personnel costs associated with CTRs may include the cost of  training staff on meeting CTR requirements, as well as the cost of labor  involved in filing CTRs. They may include salary expenses for tellers,  branch managers, and BSA compliance staff. Most institutions said they  provide annual training on when and how to file CTRs, and that staff  members, including tellers, spent an average of about 1 hour each in CTR  training. At smaller institutions, fewer staff may receive training; for  example, a compliance officer at one smaller bank told us that 26 staff  members received four hours of BSA training annually, a portion of which  is dedicated to CTRs. In contrast, the BSA officer at a very large bank said  that 1 hour of CTR training is provided annually to 160,000 staff; officials  from a very large bank said it registers about 40,000 hours in CTR training  each year among its staff. Many depository institutions indicated that  training on CTR requirements was part of a larger BSA training course,  while a few said they offered training modules focused on CTRs. For  example, at a cost of $15,000, one bank has purchased access to a Web- based training program that offers courses on CTRs, as well as other areas  of BSA. Furthermore, officials at one very large institution noted that, in  particular, they had to conduct training more often for tellers because of  high rates of turnover in teller positions.", "While all institutions incur some level of costs for training their staff, our  interviews suggest that typically the higher the number of CTRs an  institution filed, the higher the number of associated personnel\u2014and  therefore presumably training costs. Similarly, the labor costs associated  with actually preparing CTRs would be expected to be larger among the  institutions that file the most CTRs\u2014though, as noted, such costs are also  affected by the type of process used, including the degree of automation.  The highest-volume CTR filers reported having staff solely dedicated to  filing CTRs and exemptions; for example, one very large bank employed  more than 190 staff at CTR operations centers, and representatives of  another very large bank reported 60 staff members who worked exclusively  on CTRs. Conversely, representatives of one midsized bank said that they  had one and a half full-time equivalent positions in their compliance office  dedicated to CTRs.", "Reflecting the range of numbers of staff that may be involved, officials  provided a wide variance of estimated personnel costs. For example, the  very large bank with more than 190 dedicated staff (which filed over 1  million CTRs in 2006) estimated the cost to be \u201cseveral\u201d million dollars.  Other large filers also reported high costs for staff salaries that ranged from  just less than $1 million to over $5 million. For example, one very large  bank that filed almost 1 million CTRs in 2006 estimated the cost at $5.4  million\u2014$3.6 million for the approximately 25,000 tellers involved and $1.8  million in personnel costs for staff dedicated to CTRs. In comparison,  officials from one large bank that filed just fewer than 5,000 CTRs in 2006  estimated that personnel costs for tellers and compliance office staff were  slightly more than $76,000 for the year. Similarly, the midsize bank that  reported one and a half full-time equivalent positions dedicated to CTRs,  and filed approximately 2,300 CTRs in 2006, estimated personnel costs of  about $31,000 for the compliance office staff but was unable to provide an  estimate for the costs associated with the tellers\u2019 time. Officials from  smaller institutions we spoke with generally estimated lower costs and  indicated that CTR filing responsibilities at their institutions were handled  by staff that had other responsibilities, as well; one estimated that staff  time for filing 65 CTRs in 2006 cost a little less than $2,000.", "As noted above, institutions have automated processes for meeting CTR  requirements to differing extents, and officials cited technology as a  significant cost. For example, one large bank was considering adding a  CTR module to its current software at a cost of between $60,000 and  $70,000; another large bank reported recently spending about $30,000 to  purchase a new software component. However, because many of the  institutions we spoke with also used these systems for other processes,  they were not able to break out the costs exclusively for CTRs. For  example, some officials told us their systems cost in the thousands of  dollars but that they used the systems for monitoring cash transactions for  suspicious activities, as well as for preparing CTRs. As a result, officials we  interviewed said that, even if CTR requirements were eliminated, their  institutions would still incur both personnel and systems costs because of  other BSA compliance activities. An official of a very large bank said that if  the CTR requirement were eliminated, the bank would be able to eliminate  or reassign 14 staff to other activities but still would need to prepare many  of the same reports, such as aggregation reports, because they are used for  other purposes, such as identifying suspicious activity.

Our discussions with examiners revealed variations  in the types of documentation they find acceptable, although our review of  data from the banking regulators showed relatively few violations  concerning exemptions compared with the number of BSA examinations  conducted. Other factors discouraging use of exemptions were the cost  and effort involved in meeting FinCEN\u2019s regulatory requirements to (1) file  an exemption form, and annually review and update the information,  particularly for certain customers that are specifically exempted by statute,  as appropriate; and (2) biennially file a form to document the continued  eligibility of customers that have been exempted under the Phase II  regulations\u2014which as a practical matter duplicates the required annual  review process for those customers. Factors the institutions indicated  might encourage use of exemptions included (1) shortening the waiting  period\u2014currently a full year under FinCEN\u2019s regulations\u2014before  exempting certain customers with a relatively large volume of cash  transactions, and (2) making Web-based material available to help train and  guide depository institutions\u2019 staff in making exemption determinations.

As shown in figure 7 below, the reasons generally were consistent for both  Phase I and Phase II exemptions.", "The primary reason cited for using the exemption process was that it  allowed institutions to file fewer CTRs. While it would be difficult for an  institution to track the number of CTRs it \u201csaved\u201d or avoided by exempting  a customer, some had; for example, a smaller institution reported that it  recently began using exemptions more extensively, and by exempting five  more Phase II eligible customers, the institution anticipated filing almost  200 fewer CTRs. (However, the effect of exempting a single customer on  the number of CTRs filed cannot be generalized; for example, an exemption  might avoid 8 CTRs or 100, depending on the volume of cash transactions  in which the customer typically engaged.) Institutions also frequently cited  the cost-effectiveness of using exemptions; while they had difficulty  estimating the cost of establishing exemptions, just as they did for the costs  of filing CTRs, some institutions regarded exempting customers as less  costly than filing CTRs. Officials at other institutions we interviewed cited  recent advances in commercial software systems that made exemptions  easier. For example, software can identify the customers potentially  eligible for the Phase II exemption due to the volume of high cash  transactions they engaged in during the year. In addition, at least one  software vendor makes available for purchase a database of companies  listed on stock exchanges that are eligible for the Phase I exemption.", "Despite the cost-effectiveness of using exemptions, institutions responding  to our survey did not exempt all of their eligible customers. For example,  while 77 percent of the institutions reported having customers eligible for  the Phase I exemption, only 45 percent reported that they always or usually  filed Phase I exemptions. Similarly, 83 percent of the institutions reported  having customers eligible for the Phase II exemption, but only 49 percent  reported that they always or usually filed Phase II exemptions (see fig. 8).", "Some institutions that file large numbers of CTRs\u2014and, therefore, might  realize the greatest savings by avoiding CTRs\u2014do not file many  exemptions. Some of the reasons for this are discussed in the following  sections. (Further details on the results of our survey, including the  percentages of institutions that cited specific factors affecting their  decisions to exempt or not exempt customers, are presented in app. IV and  in GAO-08-385SP.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Uncertainty about Documentation Needed to Demonstrate Eligibility, Accompanied by Concerns of BSA Noncompliance, Deterred Some Exemptions", "paragraphs": ["The leading reason identified by survey respondents that choose not to file  Phase II exemptions was difficulty in determining the percentage of a  customer\u2019s gross revenue derived from lines of business not eligible for  exemption. This difficulty\u2014along with other concerns, including that  federal banking regulators would deem documentation insufficient\u2014 contributed to a reluctance to exempt customers that the institutions  considered potentially eligible.", "The responses of officials of institutions we interviewed were consistent  with our survey results. Officials explained that a fair amount of research  was required on their part to determine eligibility under the Phase II  regulations\u2014for example, examining a business\u2019s tax returns or financial  statements\u2014and that it was not always clear if the customer qualified for  the exemption because it was difficult to determine which part of a  business customer\u2019s revenue was derived from which activity. The  depository institutions that chose to use the Phase II exemption used  various methods to document the portion of revenues derived from  ineligible activities. Officials of several institutions we interviewed said  they arrived at this determination after conducting what they said was  exhaustive research, which included analyzing financial statements,  searching the Internet, and reviewing available documents if the institution  had a lending relationship with the customer, or asking the customer for  documents. Officials of other institutions used less labor-intensive  methods; for example, an official of one midsize institution indicated that  the account officer simply asked customers about the source of their gross  revenue and made a notation in the customer\u2019s file. Several institutions  reported using a letter from the customer to self-certify that no more than  50 percent of their gross revenue came from activities or lines of business  ineligible for exemption.", "Officials from the federal banking regulators generally indicated that they  did not have a standardized expectation for what documentation (such as  financial statements or tax documents) an institution might use to  demonstrate the portion of revenues derived from ineligible activities. They  further noted that examiners have some flexibility in determining what  level of documentation is required, based on guidance in the BSA/AML Examination Manual. The same manual is used by each of the  five federal banking regulators and is available to depository institutions to  help guide their BSA compliance activities. However, our interviews with  officials and examiners indicated differences among them regarding the  type of documentation acceptable. For example, federal regulators and  examiners we interviewed had different views about the use of a self- certifying letter and whether depository institutions ought to provide other  documentation. While Federal Reserve and FDIC officials said the  acceptance of a self-certifying letter would depend on the circumstances,  they generally noted that examiners had flexibility in deciding what level of  documentation would be acceptable. Officials from OTS and OCC, on the  other hand, indicated that a self-certification letter alone would be  inadequate to show eligibility. Because, in this instance, the federal banking  regulators examine institutions for compliance with FinCEN\u2019s regulations,  additional guidance from FinCEN could help reduce the difficulties that  depository institutions face in making this determination and clarifying, for  both the institutions and the regulators, the types of documentation  acceptable for demonstrating eligibility.", "Officials and examiners we interviewed from all of the federal banking  regulators indicated that they have found few problems with exemptions,  and our review of available violation data for 2005 and 2006 indicated that  examiners cited relatively few violations for exemptions. We asked the  regulators to disaggregate their data on violations to distinguish those  related specifically to exemptions; only the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and  OCC were able to provide this level of detail. These three agencies are  responsible for examining about 7,800 depository institutions, including the  largest banks that likely account for the greatest numbers of CTRs. As  shown in table 3, the three agencies collectively found violations  associated with exemptions in less than 5 percent of the BSA exams they  conducted\u2014a combined total of 227 violations for exemptions in 2005 and  113 violations for exemptions in 2006.", "Similarly, we asked FinCEN for data on BSA enforcement actions it has  taken against depository institutions related to exemptions. (While FinCEN  generally coordinates with the federal banking regulators, it may  independently take enforcement actions, including imposing penalties and  fines, for BSA violations.) FinCEN data show that, over the 10-year period  1997 to 2006, it took 110 BSA enforcement actions related to exemptions, 4  of which included fines. (More detailed information on FinCEN\u2019s  enforcement actions is presented in app. IV.)", "The fairly low incidence of violations associated with exemptions may  reflect depository institutions\u2019 decisions to simply not grant exemptions,  thus avoiding potential violations. (Some examiners noted that they  sometimes encouraged depository institutions to use the exemption  process, for example, if the institution was filing many CTRs on customers  that were potentially eligible for the exemption.) However, our survey and  interviews demonstrate that a lack of clear guidance from FinCEN for  documenting eligibility, and the differing interpretations among the federal  banking regulators, have the effect of dissuading depository institutions  from more frequently using the Phase II exemption. A minority of our  survey respondents indicated that they \u201calways\u201d exempt eligible  customers\u201433 percent reported doing so for Phase I-eligible customers  and 26 percent for Phase II-eligible customers. Some depository institution  officials noted that any compliance deficiency found by BSA examiners  was a cause for concern. (About 10 percent of survey respondents reported  that they had received a CTR violation or had been fined since 2000.) An  official from the very large bank that filed more than 150,000 CTRs in 2006  said it was the bank\u2019s official policy not to exempt any new customers that  were eligible for the Phase II exemption because, among other things, the  bank faced reputation risk if it was cited for a BSA violation, and use of the  exemption process opened the bank to examiner criticism and fines. An  official from a large community bank said that the bank did not file Phase II  exemptions because of concerns about regulatory risk. Officials from  several depository institutions we interviewed specifically said it was not  clear to them what level of support was needed, and some indicated that  they would rather file CTRs than take the risk of not satisfying an examiner.", "In a 2002 report on the exemption process mandated by section 366 of the  USA PATRIOT Act, FinCEN concluded that it should work with the federal  banking regulators, as well as banks, to reduce \u201cfear of adverse regulatory  consequences from making incorrect exemption determinations.\u201d   Exemptions are addressed in the BSA/AML Examination Manual, which  was first published in 2005 and, as noted, is used by the banking regulators  and is available to depository institutions. However, 68 percent of our  survey respondents said that difficulty in determining whether companies  derive more than 50 percent of their revenues from ineligible business  activities was a \u201cvery great\u201d or \u201cgreat\u201d factor in their decision not to exempt  Phase II-eligible customers. Guidance that could help institutions make  greater use of this exemption would help avoid unnecessary CTRs that are  of little or no use to law enforcement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Biennial Renewals, Which Duplicate Annual Reviews, Discourage Use of Some Phase II Exemptions", "paragraphs": ["FinCEN\u2019s regulations require that depository institutions (1) annually\u2014at  least once a year\u2014review and verify the information supporting any  exemptions that they have filed for either Phase I or Phase II customers,  and (2) biennially file\u2014on March 15 of the second calendar year following  the initial exemption\u2014a renewal form to continue the exemption of Phase  II customers. The purpose of the annual review is to ensure that the  customers continue to qualify for exemption; according to FinCEN, the  biennial renewal provides formal notification to FinCEN that the institution  has monitored the customers\u2019 transactions as required. About 49 percent of  our survey respondents indicated that the time-consuming nature of the  biennial renewal was of great or very great importance in contributing to  their decision not to exempt customers eligible for Phase II exemptions.  An official from the very large bank that filed more than 150,000 CTRs in  2006 said it was the bank\u2019s official policy not to exempt any new customers  that were eligible for the Phase II exemption because of the costs  associated with the biennial renewals and the need to keep track of which  exemptions had to be renewed in each year. Officials from depository  institutions we interviewed, particularly those that did not exempt  customers, also said that the need to conduct this review discouraged their  use of the exemption.", "Officials of some depository institutions questioned the value added by  biennial renewals, observing that they were already conducting the annual  review as well as monitoring all of their customers for suspicious activities,  which is part of a strong anti-money-laundering program pursuant to  section 352 of the USA PATRIOT Act. Even officials of institutions that  nevertheless filed and maintained exemptions considered the requirement  to be redundant. For example, officials at one of the very large banks\u2014 which had more than 1,900 Phase II exemptions on file\u2014said they filed the  \u201cbiennial\u201d renewal form every year for every customer, because the bank  went through the same steps for the biennial renewals as it did for each  required annual review and did not want to risk failing to file a biennial  renewal form in the correct year. Further, our analysis of FinCEN data  revealed that some institutions file biennial renewal forms on Phase I  customers, although they are required only for Phase II customers (in 2006,  depository institutions filed 1,382 biennial renewals on Phase I customers).", "FinCEN established the biennial renewal requirement based on its  interpretation of the Money Laundering Suppression Act. Specifically, the  act requires the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe regulations requiring  that depository institutions review, at least annually, the qualified business  customers that they have exempted and to \u201cresubmit information about  such customers\u201d to the Secretary. According to FinCEN, the  implementing regulations provided for the information to be resubmitted  biennially, rather than annually, because the statute does not explicitly set a  time frame for the resubmission. Further, FinCEN officials believe that  the Secretary has general authority to prescribe appropriate exemptions to  requirements under the BSA, including revising the regulations to eliminate  the biennial renewals.", "FinCEN officials said that the biennial renewal form provides them with  evidence that the exempt business remains eligible for the exemption and  that the institution has been monitoring the business for suspicious activity.  In addition, they reported that FinCEN routinely analyzes biennial renewal  forms (along with other information) filed on and by specific depository  institutions that are the subjects of compliance or enforcement actions by  the federal banking regulators to determine if the institutions properly  granted exemptions to eligible customers. However, these activities  essentially duplicate those of the bank examiners who, as part of the  examination process, ascertain whether institutions properly grant  exemptions and monitor their customers for suspicious activity.  Examiners from a few of the banking regulators indicated that the biennial  renewal requirement results in depository institutions collecting the same  kinds of information that they collect as part of the annual review of  exemptions. Further, all biennial renewals must be filed on March 15,  regardless of when the exemption was filed. Officials from the Federal  Reserve noted that meeting both requirements can impose significant  compliance costs on the institutions, yet the duplication provides no  offsetting benefit for supervisory efforts. Eliminating the requirement for  biennial renewals could encourage more institutions to make use of Phase  II exemptions and reduce the burden associated with filing unnecessary  CTRs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Regulations Require Institutions to File Exemptions for Customers That Are Statutorily Exempt", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing that the cash transactions of customers that are depository  institutions or governmental entities would likely be of little or no use to  law enforcement efforts, the Money Laundering Suppression Act  specifically directed that the Secretary of the Treasury exempt depository  institutions, as appropriate, from filing CTRs on the transactions of these  customers. FinCEN did so, but its regulations require depository  institutions to file exemption forms if they choose to exempt these types of  customers\u2014and to annually review and verify the information supporting  the exemption. The statute does not mandate annual reviews for these  customers.", "In essence, the regulations treat these entities like all other customers  eligible for Phase I exemptions, including listed companies and majority- owned subsidiaries. Accordingly, if depository institutions choose to  exempt these customers, they must perform the same steps and incur costs  for annual reviews as they do for other customers they exempt. But  depository institutions and governmental entities, in contrast to other  Phase I entities such as publicly traded companies, are unlikely to change  those characteristics that initially qualified them for exemption. For  example, a governmental entity is unlikely to become a private company. In  any case, a change in the status of a governmental entity or bank would  most likely require that the exempted bank account be closed and a new  one be opened\u2014triggering a new consideration for exemption.", "Few institutions we interviewed cited difficulty in determining eligibility  for their customers that are other depository institutions or government  entities, and many said that, in these cases, they exempt all eligible  customers. However, they would have incurred some cost to file the form  and to annually review the supporting information. In response to our  survey, officials of depository institutions reported that their staff took a  median time of about 34 minutes to exempt a Phase I customer, and about  14 minutes for the annual review process. Further, some depository  institutions do not exempt these customers and continue to incur the cost  of filing CTRs. For example, our analysis of FinCEN data shows that, in  2006, almost 87,000 CTRs were filed on over 2,900 depository institutions,  and about 45,000 CTRs were filed on some 5,500 government entities.   These CTRs are unnecessary in that the cash transactions of these entities  are not likely to have a high degree of usefulness for law enforcement.", "According to FinCEN officials, the information provided on the exemption  forms for these entities is not required for analytical purposes per se but  rather serves as the basis for recording which financial institutions had  chosen to exempt specific depository institutions and governmental  agencies. However, depository institutions are separately required to keep  records of customers\u2019 transactions for BSA purposes. Federal Reserve  officials specifically noted that they believed that the automatic exemption  of domestic depository institutions from the CTR filing requirement should  be considered and that eliminating the need to file an exemption and keep  it current for these entities would make the CTR process more efficient.  Continuing to require depository institutions to file forms on these  entities\u2014and to incur the cost and effort of annually reviewing the  information supporting the exemption\u2014discourages use of the exemption,  resulting in CTRs that are likely to be of little or no value to law  enforcement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Length of Time Allowed Before Frequent Customers Can Be Exempted May Result in Unnecessary CTRs", "paragraphs": ["FinCEN\u2019s Phase II exemption regulations specify that, in order to be  eligible for exemption, among other things customers must have held an  account for at least 1 year and must have \u201cfrequently\u201d engaged in currency  transactions in excess of $10,000. In a November 2002 guidance  memorandum, FinCEN defined \u201cfrequently\u201d as at least eight large currency  transactions in a 1-year period (with an exception for seasonal  customers). Officials of several banks we surveyed said that their use of  exemptions for Phase II customers would increase if they were permitted  to exempt businesses with frequent cash transactions in less than 12  months.", "As explained by an official of one institution, a year seems to be an  unnecessarily long time if the business is by nature cash-intensive and not  suspicious, and the institution regularly files CTRs on the business. Or, as  other officials noted, a waiting period of less than 1 year would be  appropriate if the ownership of a business changed but the transaction  activity remained relatively similar to that under the previous owner, or if  known customers chose to form new businesses. We analyzed FinCEN\u2019s  data to identify the numbers and frequency of CTRs filed on customers that  were subsequently exempted. We found that, among customers that were  initially exempted in 2006, the median number of CTRs filed in the 12  months preceding the exemption was 14; the median number filed in the 8  months preceding exemption was 11; and in the preceding 6 months, it was  9. This analysis demonstrates that many customers that were later  exempted engaged in more than the 8 transactions in a 12-month period  required by FinCEN\u2014generating thousands of unnecessary CTRs.", "FinCEN promulgated its regulations establishing the 12-month requirement  before enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act. That law provided for  customer identification programs, for which FinCEN regulations require  depository institutions to collect sufficient information to verify the  identity of customers when they first open an account. Thus, depository  institutions must require new business customers to provide their name,  physical location, and taxpayer identification number, at a minimum, at  account opening. Furthermore, as noted above, BSA compliance programs  require depository institutions to monitor their customers for suspicious  activity. Thus, continuing to require a 12-month period before allowing  otherwise nonsuspicious customers with large numbers of cash  transactions to be exempted may needlessly cause depository institutions  to file CTRs that are not highly useful to law enforcement efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Material to Help Train Institutions on Requirements Could Increase Use of Exemptions", "paragraphs": ["FinCEN currently provides material on its Web site, such as answers to  frequently asked questions, rulings and guidance, and information on BSA  requirements. However, the responses to frequently asked questions and  rulings and guidance concerning exemptions are limited and dated.   Forty-eight percent of respondents to our survey indicated that the  availability of Web-based material from FinCEN would greatly or  moderately increase their use of the Phase I exemption, and 51 percent of  respondents said it would greatly or moderately increase their use of the  Phase II exemption. Such material would help train respondents\u2019 staff and  guide them in interpreting and applying the exemption requirements.  Officials of depository institutions we interviewed generally indicated that  they currently purchase training modules from vendors, hire trainers, or  have their compliance officers develop in-house training.", "Our work suggests that material to help train staff could assist depository  institutions in making some eligibility determinations under both the Phase  I and Phase II regulations and help overcome difficulties that often  dissuade institutions from greater use of the exemptions. As previously  discussed, our survey results and interviews with depository institution  officials highlighted difficulties in determining the portion of a customer\u2019s  gross revenue derived from lines of business not eligible for the exemption,  which dissuaded some institutions from using the Phase II exemption.  Similarly, about 39 percent of survey respondents indicated that difficulties  in determining eligibility was a factor of great or very great importance in  their decision not to exempt a customer eligible for the Phase I  exemption. The difficulties included determining whether customers are  \u201clisted\u201d (publicly traded) companies or are majority-owned subsidiaries of  such companies. FinCEN\u2019s regulations provide that institutions may,  among other things, rely on documents filed with the Securities and  Exchange Commission or listings of the three stock exchanges published in  newspapers or available on Web sites. However, officials we interviewed  stated that verifying the publicly traded status of customers was not always  straightforward, and it is sometimes difficult to determine ownership  structures. For example, officials from one bank explained that the bank  held a number of accounts for a large publicly traded video rental chain;  some of the stores were corporately owned while others were independent  franchises. While the company-owned stores would be part of the publicly  traded company, the franchise operations were not likely to be publicly  traded. The bank did not exempt any of these accounts, however, to avoid  the risk of exempting a customer that was not eligible for the Phase I  exemption. Further, some survey respondents stated they had difficulty  determining eligibility when a customer is a subsidiary of a listed company.  One respondent noted that his institution would not attempt to exempt  such a customer because it was too difficult to document eligibility in this  case.", "In addition, our analysis of FinCEN\u2019s data on exemptions filed from 2004  through 2006 suggests that institutions might benefit from the availability  of Web-based material from FinCEN. For example, we found that some  institutions were filing biennial renewals for Phase I exemptions, even  though FinCEN regulations require renewals only for Phase II exemptions.  Also, our interviews with examiners from the federal banking regulators  indicated that further training might encourage appropriate use of  exemptions. For example, examiners from FDIC and OCC reported that  some institutions had difficulty distinguishing between businesses eligible  for the Phase I and Phase II exemptions. Some examiners reported that  they were educating depository institution staff about the exemption  requirements, as well as credit union examiners in particular, on the use of  Phase I exemptions for correspondent banks.", "Treasury\u2019s 2002 report on the uses of CTRs noted the importance of making  the exemption system easier for bank personnel to understand. In  preparing that report, FinCEN relied in part on a contractor\u2019s survey of  depository institutions, including their exemption practices and the  reasons underlying them. The contractor concluded that FinCEN should  offer a Web-based training module on its Web site to clarify the exemption  process. Our work for this report indicates Web-based material that would  help train staff could encourage institutions to make greater use of  exemptions, thereby avoiding the filing of CTRs that are of little or no use  to law enforcement efforts. Providing such material on FinCEN\u2019s Web site  would be a cost-effective way to help ensure that all institutions have  available up-to-date information on how to meet the requirements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Since GAO reported over a decade ago that the large volume of CTR  reports had made analysis difficult, expensive, and time consuming,  developments in information technology have provided law enforcement  with the capacity to simultaneously analyze large quantities of CTR data  and link these with other data sets. These technological advancements, as  well as the advent of bulk data downloads and expanded access to CTR  data by state and local users, have provided law enforcement agencies with  greater potential to make use of CTR data in their investigations of a wide  variety of financial and related crimes. Further, in addition to supporting  specific investigations, CTR requirements aid law enforcement by forcing  criminals\u2014who attempt to avoid reportable transactions\u2014to act in ways  that increase chances of detection through other methods. Given the  multiplicity of sources that federal law enforcement officials may tap in  their investigations, and the variety of possible case outcomes, it is  understandably difficult to link the use of CTRs with specific outcomes.  However, information that law enforcement agencies could provide on how  CTRs contribute to their efforts, similar to information they provide on  their use of Suspicious Activity Reports, is not systematically provided to  depository institutions or shared with state and local law enforcement  agencies that have more recently gained access to BSA data. Many  depository institutions indicated a desire for some assurance that the  information they provide is actually useful to law enforcement efforts.  FinCEN routinely collects and makes available information on how  Suspicious Activity Reports have contributed to investigations through  publication of its SAR Activity Review. A similar approach for collecting  and publishing CTR information could provide financial institutions with  evidence that their efforts are contributing to detecting and deterring  money laundering and other crimes. While recognizing that this effort  would entail an investment of resources, we believe it would prove  beneficial by providing depository institutions with greater awareness that  CTRs are a valuable source of data for law enforcement investigations.", "With the partial exception of institutions that file the largest numbers of  CTRs and have personnel dedicated to that function, most institutions are  not able to quantify their costs of complying with CTR requirements,  largely because they use the same personnel and automated systems for a  variety of purposes. Nevertheless, depository institutions expend what  could be considered to be significant amounts of time and resources to  meet the requirements. Most depository institutions, based on over 35  years of collective experience in filing CTRs, have established processes  that have allowed the filing of most CTRs to become fairly routine. Yet,  while technology has helped them meet filing requirements more  efficiently, it is clear that most institutions\u2019 processes involve steps that  cannot be completely automated. These include reviews by compliance  officers or other officials to provide assurance that CTRs are correct and  will not unduly expose their institutions to risk of being cited for BSA  noncompliance by their examiners. Further, because all institutions are  subject to compliance with CTR requirements, all incur some costs\u2014for  example, in training their staff\u2014regardless of the numbers of CTRs they  file. While impacts could therefore vary among institutions depending on  the numbers of CTRs they currently file as well as the processes they use,  steps to reduce the number of unnecessary CTRs filed could avoid some  costs.", "Increasing use of exemptions would help depository institutions avoid  filing unnecessary CTRs, as well as reduce the government\u2019s costs to  process them. Institutions we surveyed told us they do not exempt all  customers they consider eligible. Because the transactions of exempt  customers are likely to be of little use to law enforcement efforts, steps to  encourage the use of exemptions among depository institutions would not  be harmful to law enforcement and could avoid some CTR filing costs. Our  work indicates that FinCEN can take several steps that could increase the  use of the exemption process. While some involve changes to regulations,  they are largely consistent with goals outlined in FinCEN\u2019s 2006-2008  strategic plan:  The uncertainty surrounding the level of documentation required to  demonstrate the portion of a business\u2019s gross revenue that is derived  from ineligible sources appears to unduly restrict the use of the Phase II  exemption. Institutions reported using a variety of types of  documentation, and the federal banking regulators did not have  consistent views on what is required to demonstrate eligibility. In this  regard, clearer guidance from FinCEN on acceptable documentation,  made available to depository institutions and their examiners, could  increase the use of exemptions without increasing the risk of being cited  for a violation.", "The regulatory requirement to biennially renew Phase II exemptions  causes institutions who elect to exempt their customers to undertake  steps that duplicate those required for annual reviews (also required by  regulation) in order to file a form on March 15, regardless of the date of  the original exemption. While FinCEN requires the biennial renewals to  ensure that banks are properly monitoring their customers for  suspicious activity and properly granting exemptions as required, the  federal banking regulators address both of these requirements as part of  their BSA examination process. Further, as a practical matter,  institutions must \u201cknow their customers\u201d under provisions of the USA  PATRIOT Act\u2014enacted after FinCEN promulgated the CTR exemption  regulations\u2014that require the institutions to verify the customers\u2019 identities and monitor their transactions. The biennial renewal thus  appears to provide no additional benefit, and eliminating the  requirement could encourage institutions who have not exempted  customers for this reason to do so. According to FinCEN, it has  authority under existing statutes to revise the regulations to eliminate  the biennial renewals. To the extent that its authority is not sufficient, it  could seek such authority from the Congress through legislation.", "To exempt certain customers that the Money Laundering Suppression  Act mandated be exempted, as appropriate\u2014governmental agencies  and other depository institutions\u2014FinCEN\u2019s regulations require  depository institutions to file the same form, and annually review the  supporting documentation, as it does for public companies and their  majority-owned subsidiaries. Yet, governmental agencies and other  depository institutions are not likely to undergo changes that would  affect their eligibility for exemption, and all CTRs filed on such entities  are likely to be of little or no use to law enforcement efforts. Removing  the requirement to file the form and annually review the supporting  information could encourage greater use of this exemption and avoid  unnecessary CTRs.", "While institutions can currently exempt otherwise eligible customers  with frequent cash transactions, FinCEN\u2019s regulations require that they  can do so only after the customer has had an account for 1 year. During  this time, the institution must continue filing CTRs on the customer\u2019s  transactions, even when from the institution\u2019s perspective the customer  is eligible but for the fact that the 12-month period had not elapsed.  Permitting institutions to exempt businesses with frequent cash  transactions within a time period of less than 1 year could help avoid the  need to file unnecessary CTRs.", "Finally, a significant percentage of our survey respondents indicated  that the availability of Web-based material to train and guide their staff  would increase their use of both Phase I and Phase II exemptions. Our  work shows that difficulties institutions experience in interpreting  requirements often dissuaded them from greater use of the exemptions.  In addition, institutions reported that they incur costs to train significant  numbers of staff annually, and the availability of Web-based material on  exemption requirements could help to alleviate some of these costs.

Specifically, our objectives were to determine: (1) the usefulness of CTR  requirements to federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies; (2) the  costs to depository institutions of meeting CTR requirements; and (3)  factors that affect depository institutions\u2019 decisions to exempt or not  exempt eligible customers, including opportunities for encouraging use of  exemptions while maintaining the usefulness of CTR data to law  enforcement agencies. We conducted this performance audit in  Washington, D.C., and Miami from November 2007 through February 2008  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the  evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Assessing the Usefulness of CTR Requirements to Law Enforcement", "paragraphs": ["We relied on two primary methods to obtain information: (1) structured  interviews with federal law enforcement agencies and (2) a survey of all  state and local agencies that access CTR data through FinCEN\u2019s Gateway  portal, supplemented by structured interviews.  We used structured  interviews to obtain specific information on the usefulness of CTRs, how  changes in technology have affected their usefulness, and what changes  could be made to CTR filing requirements that likely would not harm their  usefulness to law enforcement. In addition, the Financial Crimes  Enforcement Network (FinCEN), Immigration and Customs Enforcement  (ICE), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Organized Crime  Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) provided demonstrations of how  they apply their software to analyze bulk CTR data, and FinCEN provided  demonstrations of how the Gateway program can be used to access Bank  Secrecy Act (BSA) data through WebCBRS.", "We selected federal law enforcement agencies to interview largely based on  their level of CTR usage, as measured by the number of \u201cviews\u201d of CTR  records in 2006 and whether they had received access to bulk data sets (see  table 4 for a list of these agencies.)  While FinCEN and the Internal  Revenue Service (IRS) could provide the number of CTRs viewed through  the Gateway program, we also obtained data from Department of  Homeland Security for the number of CTRs viewed through the Treasury  Enforcement Communications System (TECS) and the IRS for the number  of CTRs viewed directly from WebCBRS.  While the number of times an  agency has \u201cviewed\u201d a CTR is not a measure of \u201cusefulness\u201d or \u201cutility\u201d of a  CTR, it does provide an indication of how frequently CTRs were consulted  as part of an ongoing investigation.   In addition, we interviewed officials  from Criminal Division/Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section  because this group is the focal point for money laundering and asset  forfeiture matters within the Department of Justice, as well as officials  from the OCDETF Fusion Center, which analyzes CTR data in bulk to  improve OCDETF\u2019s ability to disrupt and dismantle drug trafficking  organizations and their financial components.", "To obtain the viewpoints of state and local law enforcement agencies on  the usefulness of CTRs, we conducted a Web-based survey of all state and  local law enforcement agencies that had access to CTR data through  FinCEN\u2019s Gateway program as of May 2007. Eighty-nine of the 115  agencies we surveyed completed the questionnaire for an overall response  rate of 77 percent.  During the development of our questionnaire, we  pretested it with 7 law enforcement agencies from Florida, Maryland, New  Jersey, Virginia, and Washington, D.C, and one regulatory agency from  Kansas. We obtained the e-mail addresses and the names of contacts from  FinCEN and opened the survey on July 5, 2007. During the course of the  survey, we sent three follow-up e-mails to nonrespondents and then made  telephone follow-up calls to remaining nonrespondents to address any  problems they had and to encourage response. To learn more about  agencies\u2019 responses, and to obtain more information on other agencies to  which our surveyed agencies had provided BSA data access, we conducted  short follow-up interviews by telephone or exchanged e-mail with six  respondents. We closed the survey on August 17, 2007.", "Although this survey was conducted with all of the state and local law  enforcement agencies in our population, and therefore is not subject to  sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may  introduce other errors. For example, difficulties in interpreting a particular  question or sources of information available to respondents can introduce  unwanted variability or bias into the survey results. Nonresponse to the  interview or certain questions can also result in increased variability or  bias.  We took steps in developing the questionnaire, and collecting and  analyzing the data, to minimize such nonsampling errors.  While the  response rate of 77 percent is high, if those not responding differed  materially from those responding on any particular question we analyzed,  our analysis may not accurately represent the group surveyed. Our results  therefore best represent only those responding to our survey.", "To provide more specific information about the usefulness of CTRs than we  could obtain by survey, we also interviewed state and local law  enforcement officials.  We interviewed 14 law enforcement agencies from  California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, and Texas because  many of these agencies numbered among the highest users of CTRs and  were located in states where a higher proportion of CTRs were filed in  2006.  In addition, we interviewed 3 law enforcement agencies from  Kentucky, Minnesota, and New Mexico, states where the viewing of CTRs  was less frequent.  Finally, we interviewed officials from four High Intensity  Money Laundering and Related Financial Crimes Areas (HIFCA)\u2014Chicago,  New York, the Southwest Border, and the California Southern District\u2014to  identify whether and how CTRs were useful to law enforcement task forces  with specific money-laundering responsibilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Costs to Depository Institutions of Meeting CTR Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Overall, we used questionnaires, structured interviews, and other methods  to obtain information on the time and resources depository institutions  expend to meet CTR requirements.

We chose this period because these were the 3 most recent years for  which FinCEN had complete data.  To ensure that we only tracked CTRs  that were filed by the depository institutions within a given year, we only  analyzed CTRs that could be clearly identified as being from that year. We  excluded a total of 1,977,092 CTRs, or about 4.8 percent of the total number  of CTRs that FinCEN\u2019s data showed as being filed in 2004, 2005, and 2006.   We also separated the remaining 38,829,864 CTRs into new (37,784,310) and  amended (1,045,554) CTRs. We analyzed these data to identify the  characteristics of CTRs and exemptions filed.  For example, we identified  the number of CTRs filed for withdrawals and deposits, the number based  on aggregated rather than single transactions, and the median number of  CTRs filed by institutions of different sizes. For exemptions, among other  analyses, we identified the numbers filed for Phase I and Phase II  exemptions.", "In order to construct a population of depository institutions that file CTRs,  we needed to combine data files from several sources.

We matched  the CTR data from FinCEN and with information on depository institutions  provided by the Federal Reserve and NCUA to create a single data set.

Because the number of banks we categorized  as very large was small (27), we interviewed the top 5 filers of CTRs, who  alone accounted for 36 percent of CTRs filed.  In addition, we conducted 18  structured interviews with banks and credit unions that were categorized  as small, midsize, and large in terms of assets. To select which institutions  to interview, we conducted a random sample of small, midsize, and large  institutions included in our CTR database.

Since  institutions must file a minimum of 8 CTRs on a business over the course of  a year before the business becomes eligible for the exemption, we  excluded those institutions that filed fewer than 120 CTRs in 2006 from our  survey to minimize the number of institutions that would have relatively  fewer opportunities to file exemptions. As a result of applying this  selection criterion, about 85 percent of the smallest banks and 90 percent  of credit unions filing CTRs were excluded from our survey.  To obtain the  viewpoints of these institutions to at least some extent, we included them  in our universe used to sample institutions for structured interviews.", "We selected a stratified random sample of 680 from this study population,  where the strata were defined by a combination of asset size and type of  institution (bank or credit union).

The survey estimates included  in this report were formed by weighting the survey data to account for both  sample design and the response rates for each stratum.  In addition, the  response rate varied by question, however, since not all questions were  asked of all institutions, and institutions could skip questions.", "Since the primary focus of the survey was to obtain viewpoints on the  exemption process, most of our questions focused on institutions\u2019 use of  exemptions. To develop the questions in the questionnaire, we interviewed  representatives of depository institutions, their trade organizations, and  their regulators; and FinCEN.  The questionnaire also included proposals  on how to modify the exemption system.  To develop these proposals, we  reviewed (1) the legislative history relating to the Money Laundering  Suppression Act of 1994 and the subsequent rule-making process, (2)  reports that previously assessed opportunities to modify the exemption  process, and (3) current proposals to modify the exemption process,  including those proposed by trade groups and depository institutions that  we interviewed.

Moreover, the CTRs identified  accounts controlled by relatives of the bank customer. Consequently,  the CTRs provided probable cause to obtain and execute a search  warrant at the residence of a relative. Ultimately, investigators learned  that the scheme involved about 125 tax returns and more than $500,000  in false claims. According to IRS, the CTRs helped narrow the focus of  the investigation and saved valuable time in identifying the responsible  parties in the scheme.

However, investigators searched for CTR data and  found approximately 1,300 CTRs had been filed on the suspected  business. The volume of CTRs revealed accounts held at multiple banks.  Although most of the accounts had been closed, the CTRs provided  crucial details of the alleged illegal activity and assisted in identifying  members of the involved organization; for example, information on the  CTRs was used in an affidavit for a search warrant for the target  business and to obtain grand jury subpoenas for bank accounts. Two  principal persons allegedly involved were arrested and charged with  money laundering, alien smuggling, and conspiracy.

Concern  that examiners would find that the exemption was not done correctly was  the top concern among banks that did not exempt Phase I customers and  the second-ranked concern among banks that did not exempt Phase II  customers. Difficulty in determining eligibility was ranked second for those  not exempting Phase I customers and fifth for those not exempting Phase  II. Banks also responded that another major reason for not using the  exemption was that it was easier to file CTRs than to go through the  exemption process. Finally, those not exempting Phase I or Phase II  customers responded that the time-consuming nature of the annual reviews  was a major reason they did not use the exemption.", "Institutions that did not exempt customers that were eligible for the Phase I  exemption cited difficulty determining eligibility as a reason for not using  the Phase I exemption. More specifically, survey respondents and officials  we interviewed noted that verifying the publicly traded status of customers  could be difficult (see fig. 13). Typically, to verify this information, staff of  depository institutions would need to check the listing information from  three exchanges as well as use a search engine called EDGAR on the  Securities and Exchange Commission Web site to search for public filings  that the company made. On average, officials of institutions we surveyed  said conducting this research took about 1 hour per exemption. However,  verification of listing status and ownership represents only a portion of the  effort involved in ascertaining eligibility for an exemption. Many officials  we interviewed said that staff in the compliance office made the exemption  determinations after reviewing a customer\u2019s account history. For instance,  a respondent from a very large bank explained that it was the institution\u2019s  policy to conduct background checks on the principals of the business  being considered for exemption. Another respondent noted that the  compliance officer would send a questionnaire to the manager of the  branch where the customer held the account; the manager then had to  complete the questionnaire and provide supporting documents, including  the financial statement for the business of the customer being considered  for exemption.  In addition, respondents from one very large bank noted  that its board had to approve exemption decisions, increasing the time and  effort involved.", "As shown in Figure 14, difficulty in determining whether companies  derived more than 50 percent of their gross revenue from ineligible  business activities was the primary factor affecting Phase II exemption  decisions.", "Table 14 provides data on FinCEN\u2019s CTR-related (excluding exemptions)  and exemption-related enforcement actions over the period 1997 to 2006.
