Treasury officials stated that the goal of economic sanctions is to freeze assets of a sanctioned jurisdiction or targeted designee and prohibit U.S. persons from dealing with them. In certain cases, once the foreign policy goals of the sanctions are met, the assets are returned to a country. The Departments of Justice, State, and the Treasury, as well as intelligence and law enforcement agencies, work together in the targeting process. Identifying the location of financial assets throughout the international financial system requires the cooperation of U.S. and foreign financial institutions. The United States has procedures to freeze assets of targeted regimes located in the United States or under the control of U.S. persons. Pursuant to executive orders issued by the President under various authorities, Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issues regulations that can require assets to be frozen and transactions to be blocked and administers sanctions programs. U.S. government agencies and financial institutions involved in recovering targeted regimes' assets face a number of challenges. First, U.S. agencies may not be able to readily obtain accurate and complete information on targeted entities, such as the spelling of names, addresses, and dates of birth. Financial institutions can also lack complete identifying information on their clients. Second, the laws of some foreign governments complicate the ability of overseas branches of U.S. financial institutions to comply with OFAC regulations. In these situations, the U.S. government encourages the relevant foreign governments to allow U.S. financial institutions to freeze or transfer assets in a manner consistent with U.S. law or Treasury issues a license to allow U.S. financial institutions to comply with local laws. Third, OFAC's ability to monitor financial institutions' compliance with its regulations is limited because it relies on financial regulators to monitor financial institutions' OFAC compliance programs. The United States has used a variety of legal authorities and coordinating bodies in its recent effort to recover Iraqi assets; some of these mechanisms could be applied to future efforts. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 allowed the United States to take ownership of $1.9 billion of Iraqi assets and transfer them for use in Iraq reconstruction efforts. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483 has resulted in the transfer of about $847 million in frozen Iraqi assets to a fund for Iraq. However, factors that include existing claims against the assets and other countries' laws have slowed the transfer of an additional $2.9 billion held in other countries. In addition, some mechanisms developed to combat money laundering and terrorist financing might be applicable to recovering foreign regimes' assets. Although the U.S. government has used various legal authorities and coordinating bodies to recover foreign regimes' assets, it has yet to compile lessons learned from past efforts that could guide future efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United States has used economic and trade sanctions, including the  freezing of financial assets and blocking of transactions, to achieve various  U.S. foreign policy and national security goals.

Some foreign regimes, whose assets were  frozen by the United States, had accumulated billions of dollars in illegal  assets. For example, in March 2004, we reported that, between 1997 and  2002, Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime accumulated an estimated $10.1 billion  through oil smuggling and surcharges against oil sales and illicit  commissions from commodity suppliers.", "In light of recent efforts to recover Iraqi assets, you asked us to examine  overall U.S. efforts to recover foreign regimes\u2019 assets.

Sanctions are generally used when other  efforts, such as diplomacy, fail. Since 1979, the United States has frozen the  assets of governments, individuals, or entities associated with 12 countries  (see app. II). Each sanctions program is unique, as are the circumstances  and objectives.", "The United States and the international community have significantly  increased the number of targeted individuals and entities over the last  decade. Until the late 1990s, targeting the financial assets of governments,  persons, and entities was normally part of a broader sanctions program  aimed at cutting off most or all economic relations with a country.  However, beginning in the late 1990s, the international community  acknowledged that broader sanctions programs can take many years to  achieve their goals and can adversely affect entire populations of targeted  countries. To reduce these impacts, in recent years, the United States and  the international community have begun implementing sanctions that  target the assets of specific persons and entities.", "The United States, working with the United Nations, has urged the  adoption of U.N. Security Council resolutions to freeze the assets of both  terrorists and sanctioned foreign regimes. For example, in October 1999,  the Security Council adopted Resolution 1267, which called on all member  states to freeze the assets of the Taliban regime. In response to the attacks  of September 11, 2001, the Security Council adopted Resolution 1373 in  September 2001, requiring all U.N. member states to freeze funds and other  financial assets or economic resources of persons who commit, attempt to  commit, participate in or facilitate terrorist acts. A subsequent resolution in  January 2002 (Resolution 1390) called on all member states to freeze the  assets of Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda. Pursuant to this line of  resolutions, the United Nations has listed nearly 300 names of individuals  and entities for worldwide asset freezes. These resolutions target  governments, political leaders, individuals, or groups.", "Several U.S. laws authorize the recovery of foreign regimes\u2019 assets,  including IEEPA, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, National  Emergencies Act (NEA), Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA), and the  United Nations Participation Act (UNPA). These laws are generally  implemented by presidential executive orders and agency guidance that  provide entities, such as financial institutions, with specific lists of targets  to ensure that financial assets are blocked or frozen to prevent their  movement.

Over the  last decade, the efforts of the United States and the international  community have focused more on individuals and groups associated with  targeted regimes than entire countries. Assets can be located throughout  the international financial system; identifying their location requires the  cooperation of U.S. and foreign financial institutions.

Once a decision is made, the President  of the United States issues an executive order that gives U.S. executive  branch agencies the authority to undertake these actions.", "The mandate of OFAC, the administrator and enforcer of U.S. economic  sanctions programs, is to require all U.S. persons, including financial  institutions, to freeze targeted assets located in the United States or under  the control of a U.S. person outside of the United States. OFAC \u201ctargets\u201d an  individual, group, or entity by placing its name on the Specially Designated  Nationals (SDN) list. According to OFAC officials, OFAC works with the  Departments of Justice and State, other components within Treasury, and  intelligence and law enforcement agencies to develop adequate evidence to  place individuals or entities on the SDN list. Officials at these agencies  stated that this targeting process can be completed in weeks or months,  depending on several factors, such as the availability of accurate  information and the corroboration of intelligence collected from multiple  sources.", "The Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Division advises OFAC on the legal  sufficiency of the evidence to comply with IEEPA requirements and would  also defend the United States against any potential lawsuits that result from  a targeting decision. OFAC then places targeted names on its SDN list.  OFAC posts updated information on its public Web site and in the Federal  Register, and provides electronic notification services to financial  institutions. In addition, third party vendors provide subscription services  that track OFAC developments, and the Federal Reserve notifies U.S.  financial institutions of updates to the SDN list through Fedwire, an  electronic system that allows it to contact approximately 9,500 financial  institutions.", "OFAC also provides specific guidance to financial institutions, which are  required to comply with orders to freeze assets. In addition, OFAC officials  stated that, when appropriate, they contact some banks and firms  individually. According to OFAC officials, the office sends OFAC personnel  to the physical locations in the United States of known commercial, real, or  tangible properties of the target to serve blocking notices to secure  property. In some cases, these personnel shut down branches and  subsidiary firms controlled by the target.", "In 2003, the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security, as well as  intelligence and law enforcement agencies, became more involved in  tracking foreign assets. For example, in the case of Iraq, the Department of  Defense has been on the ground assisting efforts to locate assets of the  former Iraqi regime. Department of Homeland Security, Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI), Internal Revenue Service criminal investigators, and  intelligence agency representatives have worked in Iraq to identify leads to  the former regime\u2019s hidden assets.

Internationally, OFAC develops and  corroborates evidence collected by other countries on targets they have  identified and proposed to the United Nations for inclusion on a  designation list. State works diplomatically with other U.N. members to  obtain the international consensus needed to place all targets for which  OFAC has sufficient corroborating evidence on the U.N. lists. For example,  as of June 2004, U.N. members had achieved consensus on over 500 names  of individuals and entities associated with the Taliban, al Qaeda, and the  former Iraqi regime, and had placed them on U.N. designation lists.

For example, in 2003, the Department of Defense\u2019s  Defense Intelligence Agency provided some of the research and analysis  used to identify assets of the former Iraqi regime. However, according to  OFAC officials, if there is little reason to believe that a regime\u2019s assets will  be targeted, intelligence and law enforcement agencies are less likely to  gather the kind of information needed by financial institutions to identify a  targeted regime\u2019s assets. This situation can pose a challenge to identifying  assets in the international financial system. According to U.S. officials and  experts on the subject of asset recovery, identifying assets also requires the  expertise of lawyers and investigators from various jurisdictions to  coordinate efforts to unravel what may be complicated financial  transactions. For example, in November 2003, the Department of  Homeland Security created the Iraqi Provisional Investigations Task Force,  which Treasury participated in, to share information obtained from Iraqi  documents and to coordinate their activities with other U.S. government  agencies.

For example, in the case of  Iraq, U.S. officials stated that information provided by OFAC for many of  the targeted individuals lacked accurate or complete identifiers such as  dates of birth. In addition, Treasury and Defense Department officials  stated that intelligence agencies sometimes had to declassify key account  identifying information before providing it to financial institutions. U.S.  officials said this process could take months.", "According to OFAC officials, financial institutions may also lack complete  identifying information on their clients, such as dates of birth, which makes  it more difficult for them to quickly determine if a name on the OFAC list  matches an account at their institution. Before passage of the USA  PATRIOT Act, U.S. financial institutions were not required to collect as  much identifying information about their clients as they are now.  Regulations issued under section 326 of the act now require financial  institutions to collect certain identifying information about new clients  seeking to open an account, such as name, address, and date of birth.  OFAC officials stated that during the past 15 years, and particularly since  September 11, 2001, the banking industry has developed a heightened  awareness of the need to comply with OFAC regulations. A representative  of the securities industry stated that since September 11, 2001, the  securities industry has also developed a heightened awareness of the need  to comply with OFAC regulations.

Representatives of  these institutions stated that a large number of transactions initially  blocked by their software are \u201cfalse positives.\u201d This means that the  software has blocked transactions of entities with names similar to those  on the SDN list that should not be blocked because the entities are not  those on the SDN list. The representatives we interviewed stated that  OFAC\u2019s SDN list contains names with multiple spellings and, in some cases,  does not include identifying information such as an address or date of  birth. This situation requires the financial institution to conduct additional  research to determine if the transactions involving those entities should be  blocked. The verification process takes time, however, and may lead to  delays in processing legitimate transactions. OFAC recognizes that a lack  of identifying information is a challenge for financial institutions and has  worked to increase the amount of identifying information it provides to  financial institutions.", "An official from a trade group representing independent community banks  stated that because its members are smaller banks with fewer customers,  they generally use a manual process to comply with OFAC\u2019s regulations.  Members manually compare updates to the SDN list with lists of accounts  maintained by the banks and transactions occurring at the banks over a  specified period. Officials at the trade group noted that managers of most  independent community banks are familiar with their customers and are  thus likely to detect suspicious or unusual transactions without the use of  filtering and interdiction software. However, because OFAC is continuously  updating its SDN list, it can be difficult and time consuming to manually  screen transactions against the list. Financial institution officials stated  that an institution\u2019s decision whether to use software or a manual process  to comply with OFAC regulations is a business decision that the institution  must make based on its perceived risk of holding accounts or processing  transactions of those on the SDN list.", "Representatives of financial institutions also noted that the OFAC SDN list  does not contain the name of every individual or entity subject to OFAC  regulations. For example, the U.S. sanctions program against Iran requires  bank transactions relating to goods or services of Iranian origin or  transactions controlled by the government of Iran to be rejected. It is  difficult for financial institutions to determine if an entity is owned or  controlled by the government of Iran. Some commercial software vendors  employ staff to research data available from the State Department, Central  Intelligence Agency, and other public sources.
