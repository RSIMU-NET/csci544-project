Under this Air Force direction,  the current modernization projects would not require formal milestones,  but Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) oversight would be provided  by periodic reviews. In 2007, OSD directed the Air Force to update the    F-22A Acquisition Program Baseline to reflect the approved Increments  3.1 and 3.2; however, the Air Force believed that an acquisition strategy  report rather than a baseline would provide better insight into funding and  schedule details for the modernization increments. Not separating the  modernization program from the F-22A program baseline was consistent  with how the Air Force had handled modernization programs for prior  aircraft. However, had the Air Force initiated the program under existing  guidelines established by DOD Instruction 5000.02 for managing and  implementing major acquisition programs, oversight of the program would  have benefitted. Under these guidelines, programs are required to have  an approved minimum set of Key Performance Parameters, included in  the Capability Development Document; an approved Acquisition Strategy;   Acquisition Program Baseline; an Analysis of Alternatives; and an  Independent Cost Estimate, for a Milestone B decision that would allow  them to proceed into the Engineering and Manufacturing Development  phase.", "OSD recently reiterated its requirement for the F-22A to be consistent  with DOD policy, and in December 2011, OSD directed the Air Force to  establish increment 3.2B as a separate major defense acquisition  program.

Increment 3.1 completed follow-on operational testing in  November 2011; a significant delay of 4 years from the original plan due  to shortcomings identified with the baseline and upgraded aircraft. In  2009 and 2010, the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E)  reported significant stealth-related maintenance issues that lowered  operational availability and mission capability rates.

Test aircraft have been operating much longer than  planned and were to be replaced by new production aircraft; however,  this has not happened due to the substantial reduction in the size of the  F-22A fleet. Other risks appear lower. For example, some software for  electronic protection and combat identification capabilities has already  been developed for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.

Currently, the  MTBM achieved by the operational test aircraft with improvements is 2.47  hours.", "In April 2011, the Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved  changing the main reliability metric from MTBM to another performance  indicator, known as material availability. Officials believed the MTBM  indicator was hard to define and measure, was unrealistic, and did not  accurately reflect the fleet\u2019s readiness to perform missions. Material  availability is defined as the percentage of the fleet available to perform  assigned missions at any given time. This standard calls for the F-22A  fleet to achieve increasing levels of availability between 2011 and 2015  toward the final goal of 70.6 percent. Last year, the F-22A fleet achieved  a 55.5 percent materiel availability rate. Stealth-related maintenance,  system component reliability problems, and lack of spare engines were  factors contributing to the fleet not achieving the goal.

We reviewed documentation of  key decisions made on F-22A modernization, including acquisition  decision memoranda and Joint Requirements Oversight Council  memoranda. We reviewed F-22A cost performance report data, contract  cost data, and budgetary documents. In assessing the achievement of  cost goals by the F-22 modernization and other improvement efforts, we  compared the program cost estimate from 2004, shortly before  development began for Increment 2, with the latest available estimates.  We determined what changes in planned capabilities occurred after  modernization efforts began. In assessing the F-22A modernization\u2019s  achievement of schedule goals and delivery of planned capabilities, we  identified progress made in delivering new capabilities in accordance with  plans, and determined what factors contributed to schedule changes. We  interviewed program office officials having knowledge of factors driving  cost estimate and schedule changes over time. We also interviewed  officials from the F-22A Program Office, DOD test organizations, and Air  Combat Command to obtain their views on progress; ongoing concerns  and actions taken to address them; and future plans to complete F-22A  development procurement and operational testing. We used the latest  cost data available during the period of our review; however the F-22A  program office was preparing a new cost estimate for F-22A  modernization and the estimated costs of increments beyond Increment  3.2B had not yet been determined or added to this estimate.", "To determine what progress has been made in completing developmental  and operational testing, and resolving system deficiencies, we reviewed  DOT&E annual test report summaries and briefings to DOD oversight and  requirements officials. We reviewed summaries of recent operational test  results provided by Air Force test officials and program risk information  related to developmental and operational testing for F-22A modernization.  We reviewed documentation of program decisions, including acquisition  decision memoranda. We reviewed data from prior GAO reviews on  operations and support costs for F-22A and other stealth aircraft,  Selected Acquisition Reports, Defense Acquisition Executive Summary  reports, contract documents, and program cost estimates. In assessing  progress made in operational testing, we compared initial and current  operational test plans to determine if significant changes were made after  testing began. We identified relevant factors contributing to testing delays.  In assessing the resolution of system deficiencies, we identified the  number of successful test points flown during operational testing and  identified what changes were made in requirements after operational  testing began. We determined what key risks and issues remain that  could affect developmental and operational testing in the future. We  identified issues contributing to increased operations and sustainment  costs and to decreased aircraft availability, and actions taken by the F- 22A program to mitigate them. We interviewed officials from the F-22A  Program Office, DOD test organizations, and Air Combat Command to  obtain their views on progress, ongoing concerns and actions taken to  address them, and future plans to complete developmental and  operational testing. At the time of our review, the final follow-on  operational test and evaluation results for Increment 3.1 were not yet  available and other test information we had requested was not readily  available within the reporting period for this report due to its high  classification level. Accordingly, our analysis of actual results and data  was somewhat constrained and our reporting limited to providing  summary level observations due to the classification level of some of the  data. Notwithstanding, DOD officials gave us access to sufficient  information to make informed judgments on the matters covered in this  report.", "In performing our work, we obtained information and interviewed officials  from the F-22A Program Office, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio;  Air Combat Command, Langley Air Force Base Virginia; Office of the  Director, Operational Test & Evaluation, Office of the Secretary of  Defense, Arlington, Virginia; and the Air Force Operational Test and  Evaluation Center, Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. We assessed  the reliability of DOD and F-22A contractor data by (1) obtaining and  reviewing related information from various sources, and (2) interviewing  agency officials knowledgeable about the data. We determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We  conducted this performance audit from June 2011 to March 2012 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Bruce Fairbairn, Assistant  Director; Marvin Bonner; Sean Seales; Marie Ahearn; Ana Aviles; Laura  Greifner; Travis Masters; and Roxanna Sun made key contributions to  this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Tactical Aircraft: Comparison of F-22A and Legacy Fighter Modernization  Programs.
