Specifically, VHA uses SAIL data to  calculate and assign each medical center an annual star rating of 1  (lowest) to 5 (highest) stars as an assessment of overall quality. SAIL  documentation states that the goal of the star ratings is for low-performing  medical centers to learn from the best practices of high-performing ones,  although all medical centers have the opportunity to improve. VHA  applies a weighting and calculation methodology to each of SAIL\u2019s 27  quality measures to determine a single composite score for each medical  center. The scores are then ranked and grouped by percentile and the  associated medical centers are assigned initial star ratings based on their  relative ranking. For example, the lowest performing 10 percent of  medical centers as determined by SAIL\u2019s 27 quality measures are  assigned a 1-star rating, and the next lowest performing 20 percent of  medical centers are assigned a 2-star rating. (See fig. 1.)", "After the initial star rating is determined by SAIL measures each year,  VHA officials can make changes to the rating if a medical center meets  certain conditions. For example, SAIL documentation states that a  medical center that initially received a 5-star rating will be reduced to a 4- star rating if it has a high mortality rate. In addition, VHA officials told us  they can decide to increase a 1-star medical center\u2019s rating to a 2-star  rating if the medical center outperforms the bottom 10 percent of U.S.  hospitals in certain criteria as measured by external systems such as the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u2019 Hospital Compare website.", "We found that the percentage of medical centers that received a final 1- star rating ranged from 4 percent to 10 percent from fiscal years 2013  through 2018.

Officials told us  they use this tool to focus improvement efforts by examining specific  measures for which a medical center needs improvement.", "Geometric control charts \u2013 These charts, referred to as G-Charts,  allow officials to monitor on a daily basis what VHA considers to be  rare occurrences. For example, one G-Chart allows VHA to monitor  patient safety indicators that contain information on occurrences of  specific medical conditions, such as cardiac arrest, pneumonia, and  sepsis. Medical center officials can use these charts to examine the  occurrence of events over time, analyze patient-level data, and  quickly detect changes in the frequency of these events. Other events  that the charts allow VHA to monitor include inpatient complications  and deaths.", "Symphony action triggers \u2013 Symphony is an online tool that tracks  over 100 performance measures daily, related to medical center  access, outcomes, and productivity, and includes an early warning  system to notify network and medical center officials of results that  require attention. Officials can use Symphony to view patient-level  information to understand the details of particular events and  determine solutions.", "VHA officials also told us that they use these tools to manage medical  center performance as part of their ongoing support of lower performing  medical centers. Specifically, officials who oversee SAIL identify lower  performing medical centers using SAIL and conduct site visits as part of  VHA\u2019s Strategic Action for Transformation initiative. This initiative utilizes  a four-tiered, escalating approach based on the severity of concern at a  medical center. In order of increasing severity, the four levels are watch,  high-risk, critical, and VA receivership. One-star medical centers are  automatically placed on the high-risk list, along with some 2-star medical  centers with decreasing performance. If performance continues to  decrease, medical centers are considered critical, and can be escalated  to VA \u201creceivership,\u201d at which point VHA officials may step in to correct  ongoing problems and replace network or medical center leadership  officials. As of January 2019, VHA officials told us no medical center had  entered VA receivership since the initiative began. VHA officials told us  that they may also conduct site visits or hold calls with medical center  leadership by request, although their focus is on lower performing medical  centers.", "In addition to the SAIL tools, which report data on performance measures  across the entire medical center, VHA officials told us that they may also  use other data sources as part of medical center performance  management. For example, several program offices\u2014such as primary  care, mental health, and surgery\u2014have dashboards that track  performance and quality of care specific to those offices. In addition, VA\u2019s  Inpatient Evaluation Center focuses on mortality data, including estimates  of expected patient mortality."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VHA\u2019s Appraisal Process for Assessing Network and Medical Center Directors\u2019 Performance Relies Heavily on Medical Center Performance Information", "paragraphs": ["We found that VHA relies heavily on medical center performance  information to assess the performance of its network and medical center  directors. VA\u2019s Senior Executive Service Part V. Performance Appraisal  System handbook states that directors are assessed using five appraisal  elements established by the Office of Personnel Management: (1) Results  Driven, (2) Leading People, (3) Leading Change, (4) Business Acumen,  and (5) Building Coalitions. The five elements are included in VHA\u2019s  performance plan template, which forms the basis for network and  medical center directors\u2019 performance plans. The handbook designates a  relative weight for each element used to calculate a director\u2019s rating. (See  fig. 4.) The handbook states that a director is rated in each element on a  scale of level 1 to level 5, with 5 being the highest level. Each rating is  then multiplied by the weight for its corresponding element, and the  results are added to generate a summary score. According to the  handbook, the summary score is used to identify potential recipients of  pay increases and monetary awards.", "The most heavily weighted appraisal element in the handbook, Results  Driven, represents 40 percent of a director\u2019s overall performance and is  based entirely on medical center performance information. Specifically,  for fiscal year 2018, SAIL results comprised 25 percent of the overall  rating and included measures such as patient mortality, length of stay,  and readmissions. Other medical center performance information  comprised the remaining 15 percent of the overall rating. (See fig. 5.)", "Medical center performance information is also used when assessing  directors\u2019 performance across other appraisal elements. For example, in  VHA\u2019s fiscal year 2018 performance plan template, the Leading Change  appraisal element included the implementation of suicide prevention  initiatives, using medical center performance in the SAIL mental health  domain as criteria. In addition, the Leading People element included  performance information from VA\u2019s All Employees\u2019 Survey, which  included medical center staff.", "Although medical center performance information plays a prominent role  in the performance assessment process, VHA officials told us that there  are other considerations that may result in medical center directors  receiving a rating that is higher than that indicated by the star rating of the  medical center. For example, VHA officials told us that when calculating a  medical center director\u2019s rating for the Results Driven element, they  consider whether the medical center\u2019s overall performance improved or  deteriorated compared to the previous year\u2019s performance. These  officials also stated that they take into consideration the length of a  director\u2019s tenure, such as cases where a director started at a low- performing medical center partway through the rating year and would not  have had sufficient time to improve the medical center\u2019s performance  from the previous year.", "In our review, we also found that the release of VHA\u2019s performance plan  template is often delayed, which can limit its effectiveness as a means of  assessing directors\u2019 performance. Specifically, in fiscal years 2016, 2017,  and 2018, VHA released the performance plan template to network  directors in November or December, close to the end of the first quarter of  the performance appraisal period. Directors at two of the medical  centers in our review expressed frustration with the delay and not having  a full year to meet performance expectations, but directors at the two  other medical centers stated that they find the process clear and are able  to anticipate performance expectations. Officials from VHA\u2019s office of  Workforce Management and Consulting, which sends out the template,  told us that they have been working in recent years to shorten the  template\u2019s development and review process within VHA; however, the  delays may continue because of late changes from VA or the Office of  Personnel Management. In our December 2016 review of human  resource management practices at VHA, we also reported on delays in  the release of VHA\u2019s performance plan template. We reported that the  delay limited medical center officials\u2019 ability to use the template as a tool  to align expectations and performance, which is inconsistent with leading  practices on employee performance management. We recommended that  VHA accelerate its efforts to develop a modern, credible, and effective  performance management system, including the timely release of the  performance plan template. VA partially concurred with our  recommendation and has made limited progress in implementing it. As of  December 2018, this recommendation remains open and we reiterate the  need for VHA to implement it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VHA Has Not Assessed for Implementation Previous Recommendations Made to Ensure SAIL\u2019s Effectiveness in Assessing Medical Center Performance", "paragraphs": ["Although SAIL is used in the assessment of both medical centers\u2019 and  directors\u2019 performance, VHA officials have not assessed and  implemented as appropriate the recommendations from previous  evaluations of the SAIL system to ensure its effectiveness. This is  inconsistent with federal standards for internal control, which state that  management should remediate identified internal control deficiencies on a  timely basis. This remediation may include assessing the results of  reviews to determine appropriate actions, and, once decisions are made,  completing and documenting corrective actions on a timely basis.", "VHA officials told us that since it was established in 2012, there have  been two evaluations of SAIL:", "The first evaluation was an internal review, which VHA officials told us  was completed in February 2014 and submitted to the director of  VHA\u2019s Office of Analytics and Business Intelligence and reviewed by  the then Under Secretary for Health and Principle Deputy Under  Secretary for Health. The internal review, which had 22  recommendations, found issues related to the validity and reliability of  SAIL as a tool for measuring performance and fostering  accountability. For example, it included a recommendation that VHA  no longer use aggregate star ratings for accountability, or for  presenting medical center quality and efficiency information to  stakeholders. Rather, the recommendation called for VHA to work to  identify valid and reliable approaches for presenting this information.", "The second evaluation was an external review, which VHA officials  told us was submitted to the Office of the Principal Deputy Under  Secretary for Health in April 2015. The external review included 19  recommendations for short- and long-term improvements to SAIL,  such as a recommendation to examine the potential for misclassifying  medical centers\u2014i.e., assigning star ratings that do not reflect medical  centers\u2019 pattern of performance on the underlying measures. The  review noted two ways such misclassification could occur: (1) two  medical centers with summary scores that are close together could  receive different star ratings, or (2) two medical centers with widely  different summary scores could receive the same star rating.", "The findings of the previous SAIL evaluations are similar to concerns that  officials from the four networks and four medical centers in our review  expressed about SAIL\u2019s effectiveness, including whether the star ratings  were an accurate reflection of medical center performance. For example, officials from one medical center told us that, because the mortality  measure has a higher weight relative to other SAIL measures, it can  amplify the importance of a small difference between medical centers.  As a result, a 1-star medical center may appear to be performing  much more poorly on this measure than it is in practice; and officials from two medical centers told us that the length-of-stay  measure may not be an accurate reflection of quality of care, as there  are valid clinical reasons why some veterans need a longer length of  stay that may not be reflected in the diagnostic and procedure codes  for that stay. Therefore, the difference in performance on the length of  stay measure between two medical centers may be the result of how  data were entered into the medical record and coded, rather than  actual differences in quality of care.", "In addition, VHA officials also expressed concerns about SAIL and how it  is currently being used to assess medical center performance. For  example, VHA officials who oversee SAIL told us it was designed to be an  internal performance improvement tool, but is now also being used as a  performance accountability tool. The external review included a  recommendation that VHA consider whether the primary purpose of SAIL  is improvement or accountability, as SAIL would need to be redesigned to  do both. One VHA official told us that SAIL is being used in punitive ways  through the Strategic Action for Transformation initiative. For example, at  one medical center, officials told us that they received a letter from VHA\u2019s  Executive in Charge about the medical center\u2019s low performance only a  few months after its star level increased from 1 to 2 stars. Officials said  the letter warned them that medical center leadership could be removed if  performance does not improve. Medical center officials described this as  counterproductive for their improvement efforts, as it was demoralizing  while not identifying any specific areas for improvement.", "VHA officials confirmed that, other than their routine reviews to determine  the need for annual adjustments to SAIL measures and other minor  adjustments to the system, they have not assessed or implemented as  appropriate the recommendations from the internal and external SAIL  evaluations. In addition, although the Under Secretary for Health received  a response to the internal review\u2019s recommendations from an individual  program office, VHA officials told us no action was taken on the response  or to formally assess the recommendations from the internal review.  Officials noted that two reasons for the lack of action taken to assess  recommendations for implementation were leadership turnover and  attention diverted to other issues, such as concerns about extended wait  times for medical appointments at VHA medical facilities. In addition,  officials stated that the evaluations were not widely distributed within  VHA. As a result, officials we spoke with from several VHA offices were  unaware that SAIL had ever been evaluated. To address the federal  internal control standard for timely remediation of identified deficiencies,  federal agencies assign responsibility and authority for carrying out and  documenting corrective actions. VHA officials told us they did not  formally assign responsibility to an office to assess recommendations  from previous evaluations of SAIL. As a result, when the officials who  received both evaluations left VHA, there were no other individuals or  offices responsible for ensuring that recommendations were acted on.", "VHA officials who oversee SAIL told us that they are planning to use the  2015 external review as part of their plans to make changes to SAIL and  its measures.
