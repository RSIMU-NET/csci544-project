ECPs can be used to prevent an unintended pregnancy when contraception fails or after unprotected intercourse, including cases of sexual assault. In May 2004, the Acting Director for the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) issued a \"not-approvable\" letter for the switch application, citing safety concerns about the use of Plan B in women under 16 years of age without the supervision of a health care practitioner. Because the not-approvable decision for the Plan B OTC switch application was contrary to the recommendations of FDA's joint advisory committee and FDA review staff, questions were raised about FDA's process for arriving at this decision. GAO was asked to examine (1) how the decision was made to not approve the switch of Plan B from prescription to OTC, (2) how the Plan B decision compares to the decisions for other proposed prescription-to-OTC switches from 1994 through 2004, and (3) whether there are age-related marketing restrictions for prescription Plan B and other prescription and OTC contraceptives. To conduct this review, GAO examined FDA's actions prior to the May 6, 2004, not-approvable letter for the initial application."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["On May 6, 2004, the Acting Director of CDER rejected the recommendations of FDA's joint advisory committee and FDA review officials by signing the not-approvable letter for the Plan B switch application. While FDA followed its general procedures for considering the application, four aspects of FDA's review process were unusual. First, the directors of the offices that reviewed the application, who would normally have been responsible for signing the Plan B action letter, disagreed with the decision and did not sign the not-approvable letter for Plan B. The Director of the Office of New Drugs also disagreed and did not sign the letter. Second, FDA's high-level management was more involved in the review of Plan B than in those of other OTC switch applications. Third, there are conflicting accounts of whether the decision to not approve the application was made before the reviews were completed. Fourth, the rationale for the Acting Director's decision was novel and did not follow FDA's traditional practices. The Acting Director stated that he was concerned about the potential behavioral implications for younger adolescents of marketing Plan B OTC because of their level of cognitive development and that it was invalid to extrapolate data from older to younger adolescents. FDA review officials noted that the agency has not considered behavioral implications due to differences in cognitive development in prior OTC switch decisions and that the agency previously has considered it scientifically appropriate to extrapolate data from older to younger adolescents. The Plan B decision was not typical of the other 67 proposed prescription-to-OTC switch decisions made by FDA from 1994 through 2004. The Plan B OTC switch application was the only one during this period that was not approved after the advisory committees recommended approval. The Plan B action letter was the only one signed by someone other than the officials who would normally sign the letter. Further, there are no age-related marketing restrictions for any prescription or OTC contraceptives that FDA has approved, and FDA has not required pediatric studies for them. FDA identified no issues that would require age-related restrictions in the review of the original prescription Plan B new drug application. In its comments on a draft of this report, FDA disagreed with GAO's finding that high-level management was more involved with the Plan B OTC switch application than usual, with GAO's discussion about when the not-approvable decision was made, and with GAO's finding that the Acting Director of CDER's rationale for denying the application was novel. However, GAO found that high-level management's involvement for the Plan B decision was unusual for an OTC switch application and FDA officials gave GAO conflicting accounts about when they believed the decision was made. The Acting Director acknowledged to GAO that considering adolescents' cognitive development as a rationale for a not-approvable decision was unprecedented for an OTC application, and other FDA officials told GAO that the rationale differed from FDA's traditional practices."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In April 2003, Women\u2019s Capital Corporation (WCC) submitted an  application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requesting that  the marketing status of its emergency contraceptive pill (ECP), Plan B, be  switched from prescription to over-the-counter (OTC).

Plan B had  been approved for use as a prescription drug by FDA in 1999 and is most  effective when taken as soon as possible, but no later than 72 hours, after  intercourse. By law, FDA may approve the switch of a prescription drug to  OTC status if use of the drug is safe and effective for self-medication in  accordance with proposed labeling.

In addition, CDER can  request a joint meeting of advisory committees that it has established to  seek scientific advice about its decisions from outside experts. The joint  advisory committee meeting is conducted by the advisory committee that  has expertise in OTC drugs and the advisory committee that has relevant  expertise for the proposed OTC switch drug. After review of the OTC  switch application and advice of the joint advisory committee, the  directors of both offices of drug evaluation make a decision. If the  directors of the offices concur on the decision for the application, they  generally will both sign and issue an action letter. If the directors do not  concur with one another, the application is sent to the next level of review,  the Director of the Office of New Drugs within CDER, who then makes the  decision and signs and issues the action letter. However, the Director of  CDER can also decide on an application and sign and issue the action  letter.", "The Plan B application went to the Office of Drug Evaluation V, which  includes the Division of Over-the-Counter Drug Products, and the Office of  Drug Evaluation III, which includes the Division of Reproductive and  Urologic Drug Products, where it was reviewed.

Furthermore,  although he told us that he was \u201c90 percent sure\u201d as early as January 2004,  that the decision would be not-approvable, the Acting Director told us he  made his final decision only in the last few weeks prior to issuing the  action letter, after he had reviewed all of the documentation associated  with the application.", "The Acting Director of CDER told us that the rationale for his decision was  not fully developed until a few days before the action letter was issued on  May 6, 2004. According to internal FDA e-mails we reviewed, the Acting  Director of CDER contacted the Director of the Office of Pediatric  Therapeutics on May 2, 2004, requesting assistance on language regarding  cognitive development during early adolescence to support his decision.  According to these e-mails, the Director of the Office of Pediatric  Therapeutics responded that she would consult with another official with  a background in developmental pediatrics and would follow up with  \u201cbehavioral science information as to why one cannot extrapolate decision  making on safety issues\u201d from older to younger adolescents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Acting Director\u2019s Rationale for the Not-Approvable Decision Was Novel and Varied from FDA\u2019s Traditional Practices", "paragraphs": ["The rationale for the Acting Director of CDER\u2019s decision was novel and  did not follow FDA\u2019s traditional practices. The Acting Director was  concerned about the potential impact that the OTC marketing of Plan B  would have on the propensity for younger adolescents to engage in unsafe  sexual behaviors because of their lack of cognitive maturity. The Acting  Director further concluded that because these differences in cognitive  development made it inappropriate to extrapolate data from older to  younger adolescents in this case, there was insufficient data on the use of  Plan B among younger adolescents. FDA review officials disagreed with  the Acting Director\u2019s rationale and noted that the agency had not  considered behavioral implications resulting from differences in cognitive  development in prior OTC switch decisions.", "The Acting Director\u2019s Rationale Was Based on His Concerns about  Risk-Taking in Younger Adolescents  The Acting Director of CDER told us he signed the not-approvable letter  because of his concerns about the lack of cognitive development and the  potential for risky behaviors among younger adolescents resulting from  increased access to Plan B. For example, he noted increased access to  Plan B could potentially result in an increase in unsafe sexual activity,  particularly among younger adolescents\u2014an age group, he noted, that has  a tendency to engage in risky behaviors because of their level of cognitive  development. This change in behavior could be represented by changes in  measurable indicators, such as a decrease in condom use or an increase in  the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STD). \u201cIn making decisions about pediatric use, it is often possible to extrapolate data from one  age group to another, based on knowledge of the similarity of the condition. However, in  this case, adolescence is known to be a time of rapid and profound physical and emotional  change. . . . Because of these large developmental differences, I believe that it is very  difficult to extrapolate data on behavior from older ages to younger ages. I am  uncomfortable with our current level of knowledge about the potential differential impact  of OTC availability of Plan B on these age subsets.\u201d", "Some other officials we spoke with supported the Acting Director\u2019s  concerns about extrapolating data from older to younger adolescents. For  example, the Director of the Office of Pediatric Therapeutics told us and  noted in e-mails to the Acting Director of CDER, which we reviewed, that  the difference in cognitive development and maturity between older and  younger adolescents and the potential impact this would have on  behaviors warranted a separate analysis of this latter age group. In  addition, one of the members of the joint advisory committee we spoke  with said he was also concerned about extrapolating data from older to  younger age groups because he perceived weaknesses in the actual use  and label comprehension studies submitted by the sponsor.", "Because of these concerns, the Acting Director concluded that the Plan B  OTC switch application needed more data specific to younger adolescents.  In the not-approvable letter, the Acting Director stated there were too few  younger adolescents in the sponsor\u2019s actual use study to support the Plan  B OTC switch application. Specifically, he highlighted that only 29 of 585  participants in the study were 14 years to 16 years of age and none were  under 14 years of age. Although he acknowledged concerns about the  difficulty of including younger adolescents in actual use studies, he told us  that it was not impossible to enroll younger adolescents in studies, noting  that studies for other products have been conducted involving younger  participants, including those as young as infants. Some of the Acting  Director\u2019s concerns regarding the low number of younger adolescents  were also raised by other review staff and members of the joint advisory  committee. For example, one FDA reviewer who recommended an  approvable action on the Plan B OTC switch application noted that despite  a reanalysis of the actual use study data of subjects aged 14 years to 17  years, the sample size was too small and \u201csignificantly limit  assessment of potential risky/unsafe sexual behavior associated with OTC  accessibility of Plan B.\u201d", "Although review staff within the Offices of Drug Evaluation III and V  presented him with additional data on sexual behaviors of younger  adolescents in association with increased access to ECPs, the Acting  Director of CDER determined that these data were not adequate to  support the approval of Plan B for OTC use. He provided his reasoning in  his memorandum, stating that these studies were either \u201cnot conducted in  the general population or they provide product education assistance  beyond what adolescents would receive in an OTC situation, where no  contact with a health care professional is expected.\u201d", "The Acting Director of CDER\u2019s rationale varied from FDA\u2019s traditional  practices by considering the potential implications OTC access of Plan B  would have on the sexual behavior of younger adolescents based on their  lack of cognitive maturity and by not accepting the validity of  extrapolating data from older to younger adolescents. Although he  acknowledged to us that considering adolescents\u2019 cognitive development  as a rationale for a not-approvable decision was unprecedented, the Acting  Director also told us that FDA had recently increased its focus on pediatric  issues. He noted that pediatric issues were currently being raised in  prescription drug reviews and believed the same should occur in OTC drug  reviews.", "FDA Review Officials Disagreed with the Acting Director\u2019s  Rationale for the Not-Approvable Decision  FDA review staff, the Directors of the Offices of Drug Evaluation III and V,  and the Director of the Office of New Drugs disagreed with the Acting  Director of CDER\u2019s rationale for not approving the Plan B OTC switch  application. FDA review officials, including those from the Office of New  Drugs, noted that traditionally FDA has not considered whether younger  adolescents would use an OTC product differently than older adolescents,  and the Director of the Office of New Drugs told us that it was \u201catypical\u201d  to raise the question of maturity during a drug review. These officials also  noted that FDA does not attempt to determine how a patient arrived at the  need for a drug. Rather, drug evaluations usually begin with the need for a  potential treatment already existing.", "Review staff we spoke with acknowledged that certain behavioral  concerns and unintended consequences are examined for an OTC switch  application, such as whether making a drug OTC would delay a person  from seeking medical treatment or if the drug would potentially be abused  if it were more readily available. They told us that these issues are usually  examined during a benefit\u2013risk review, which is an analysis of potential  medical outcomes. Review staff told us they examined benefit\u2013risk issues  for Plan B, and they concluded that concerns regarding the potential for  unsafe sexual behaviors among adolescents could not be supported. In  addition, the review of the label comprehension study from the Office of  Drug Safety noted that potential users of the product would be able to  appropriately use it if the sponsor made its suggested changes to the  proposed labeling. Also, at the public meeting, members of the joint  advisory committee voted 27 to 1 that the actual use study demonstrated  that consumers could properly use Plan B as recommended by the label.  The members of the joint advisory committee also voted 28 to 0 that the  literature review of Plan B included in the actual use study did not show  that Plan B would be used as a regular form of contraception.", "Furthermore, the review of the application from the Office of Drug  Evaluation III, which included the benefit\u2013risk assessment for Plan B,  noted that having Plan B in an OTC setting would \u201cpose little risk\u201d to the  potential user and that the risk of an adverse pregnancy outcome, such as  lower birth weight babies and premature delivery, is much higher among  younger adolescents. The review concluded that OTC access to Plan B in  helping younger adolescents avoid unintended pregnancies would be \u201cof  particular value given the greater risk of an adverse pregnancy outcome in  this high risk group.\u201d This review also noted that even for a large dose of  the hormone used in Plan B, the \u201cmargin of safety appear to be high.\u201d", "In an attempt to further address the Commissioner\u2019s and Acting Director\u2019s  concerns about the potential for increased risky behavior by younger  adolescents resulting from increased access to Plan B, review staff  requested additional data from the sponsor and reviewed ongoing studies  examining these concerns. FDA\u2019s reviewers concluded that increased  access to ECPs did not result in (1) inappropriate use by adolescents as a  substitute form of contraception, (2) an increase in the number of sexual  partners or the frequency of unprotected intercourse, or (3) an increase in  the frequency of STDs.", "To reach these conclusions, review staff examined the five studies that  provided supplies of ECPs in advance to study participants to assess the  behavioral impact of OTC access. In one study, which included 2,090  women aged 15 years to 24 years, there was a decrease in unprotected sex  among all age groups and no increase in the incidence of STDs compared  to the baseline. Another study of 160 adolescent mothers included  participants aged 14 years to 20 years. Although there were limited data  available, this study concluded that there was no increase in unprotected  intercourse and no decrease in condom use among participants. A third  study of 301 adolescent women, aged 15 years to 20 years, showed similar  results, with no increase in unprotected intercourse or STDs and no  decrease in condom use.", "FDA officials, including those from the Office of New Drugs, also  disagreed with the Acting Director\u2019s determination that extrapolating data  from older populations to younger adolescents was inappropriate. In their  reviews, officials noted that data they reviewed showed that younger  adolescents had outcomes similar to those of older populations. For  example, the actual use study found that 82 percent of participants 16  years of age or under correctly took the second dose 12 hours later,  compared to 78 percent of those 17 years and older. Also, review staff  said that overall the number of participants who were younger adolescents  was adequate to draw conclusions about potential use among the  adolescent population. Review staff told us they encouraged the sponsor  to not limit enrollment or exclude adolescents from the actual use study  and felt the study included a representative population of women that  would potentially use Plan B. Some of the members of the joint advisory  committee we spoke with also said they considered the number of  younger adolescents in the actual use study as adequate.", "In addition, the Director of the Office of New Drugs told us that the agency  has not requested age-specific data often and that FDA often extrapolates  findings, including findings on behaviors, from adults to adolescents. He  added that given the agency\u2019s traditional processes and the data provided  in the Plan B OTC switch application, there was no reason to consider the  extrapolations done in the staff\u2019s reviews as inappropriate. \u201cIn my opinion, these studies provide adequate evidence that women of childbearing  potential can use Plan B safely, effectively, and appropriately for emergency contraception  in the non-prescription setting. The data submitted by the sponsor in support of non- prescription use of Plan B are fully consistent with the Agency\u2019s usual standards for  meeting the criteria for determining that a product is appropriate for such use. . . . Such a  conclusion is consistent with how the Agency has made determinations for other OTC  products, including other forms of contraception available without a prescription. Further,  I believe that greater access to this drug will have a significant positive impact on the  public health by reducing the number of unplanned pregnancies and the number of  abortions.\u201d", "In his memorandum, the Director of the Office of New Drugs also noted  that FDA has a \u201clong history\u201d of extrapolating findings from older  populations to younger adolescents. He wrote that this type of  extrapolation from older populations to younger adolescents had been  done in clinical trials for both prescription and OTC drug approvals and  that this practice was incorporated into the Pediatric Research Equity Act  (PREA)\u2014the law authorizing FDA to require pediatric studies in certain  defined circumstances. According to PREA, if the disease and the effects  of the drug are \u201csufficiently similar\u201d between adult and pediatric  populations, it can be concluded that the effectiveness can be extrapolated  from \u201cadequate and well-controlled studies in adults\u201d usually in  conjunction with supplemental studies in pediatric populations. In  addition, PREA provides that studies may not be necessary for all  pediatric age groups, if data from one age group can be extrapolated to  another.", "Members of the joint advisory committee expressed similar conclusions to  those of FDA review officials earlier at the public meeting in December  2003.

First, FDA said that the involvement of high-level management in  the Plan B decision was not as unusual as the draft report found. FDA  commented that the Director of CDER is ultimately responsible for all  decisions made within CDER, and that the Director of CDER is regularly  involved in regulatory decisions that are not routine, including those that  involve controversial issues. FDA also commented that the Director of  CDER typically discusses high-profile and controversial regulatory  decisions with officials within the Office of the Commissioner.", "While we agree with FDA that the Director of CDER and other high-level  officials generally are more likely to become directly involved in high- profile regulatory decisions and noted that in the draft of the report, we  found that this level of involvement is unusual for OTC switch  applications. The other examples of high-level management involvement  given to us by FDA officials during the course of our work involved  decisions about the marketing of prescription drugs. Also, it was unusual  for the Acting Director of CDER to inform FDA\u2019s review staff that it had  been determined that the Plan B decision would be made by high-level  management. The Acting Director did so on January 15, 2004, before the  review staff had completed their reviews of the application.", "Second, FDA took issue with what it characterized as the tone of our  discussion about when the decision was made to deny the Plan B OTC  switch application. FDA commented that discussions about alternative  regulatory actions ordinarily occur in the course of decision making within  CDER and that it is inaccurate to conclude that a decision to deny the  application was made several months before the not-approvable letter was  issued. However, the draft report did not assert that a decision was  actually made several months before the letter was issued. Rather, it  accurately noted that FDA officials gave us conflicting accounts of when  the not-approvable decision was made. The Director and Deputy Director  of the Office of New Drugs and other officials told us that they were  informed during December 2003 and January 2004 that the application  would not be approved. The Acting Director of CDER denied this, and we  reported that his rationale for the not-approvable decision was not fully  developed until early May 2004.", "Third, FDA disagreed with our finding that the Acting Director\u2019s rationale  for denying the application was novel and did not follow FDA\u2019s traditional  practices. FDA commented that the Acting Director\u2019s focus on the  potential implications to the sexual behavior of adolescent women of  approving the Plan B OTC switch application was appropriate and  consistent with FDA\u2019s treatment of other OTC switch applications.", "In response to this comment, we have revised the report to more clearly  describe the reasons for our finding. We found that the Acting Director\u2019s  rationale was novel because it explicitly considered the differing levels of  cognitive maturity of adolescents of different ages, and that because of the  Acting Director\u2019s views about these cognitive maturity differences, he  concluded that it was inappropriate to extrapolate data related to risky  sexual behavior from older to younger adolescents. In his May 6, 2004,  memorandum, the Acting Director stated that \u201cBecause of these large  developmental differences, I believe that it is very difficult to extrapolate  data on behavior from older to younger ages.\u201d The Acting Director  acknowledged that considering adolescents\u2019 cognitive development as a  rationale for a not-approvable decision was unprecedented for an OTC  switch application. In addition, other FDA officials told us that the agency  had not previously considered whether younger adolescents would use a  product differently than older adolescents. For example, the Director of  the Office of New Drugs told us that it was \u201catypical\u201d to raise the question  of maturity during a drug review and that FDA has traditionally  extrapolated findings from older to younger adolescents. Furthermore, in  his April 22, 2004, memorandum, the Director of the Office of New Drugs  said that \u201cthe Agency has a long history of extrapolating findings from  clinical trials in older patients to adolescents in both prescription and non- prescription approvals.\u201d", "In addition, FDA disagreed with our statement in the draft report that the  Directors of the Offices of Drug Evaluation III and V and the Director of  the Office of New Drugs refused to sign the not-approvable letter.

However, in its comments, FDA said that the  directors were not asked to sign the action letter because it was known  that they disagreed with the Acting Director\u2019s decision. We have revised  the report to reflect this.", "In its technical comments, FDA asked us to emphasize that safety  concerns regarding OTC use of drug would not be raised for prescription  products because of the involvement of health practitioners.
