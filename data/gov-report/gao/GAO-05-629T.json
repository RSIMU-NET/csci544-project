The combination of additional demands for national and homeland security resources, the long-term rate of growth of entitlement programs, and rising health care costs create the need to make difficult choices about the affordability and sustainability of the recent growth in defense spending. At a time when the Department of Defense (DOD) is challenged to maintain a high level of military operations while competing for resources in an increasingly fiscally constrained environment, DOD's business management weaknesses continue to result in billions in annual waste, as well as reduced efficiencies and effectiveness. Congress asked GAO to provide its views on (1) the fiscal trends that prompt real questions about the affordability and sustainability of the rate of growth of defense spending, (2) business management challenges that DOD needs to address to successfully transform its business operations, and (3) key elements for achievement of reforms. One key element would be to establish a full-time chief management official (CMO) to take the lead in DOD for the overall business transformation effort. In this regard, we support the need for legislation to create a CMO in DOD with \"good government\" responsibilities that are professional and nonpartisan in nature, coupled with an adequate term in office."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Our nation's current fiscal policy is on an imprudent and unsustainable course and the projected fiscal gap is too great to be solved by economic growth alone or by making modest changes to existing spending and tax policies. In fiscal year 2004, DOD's spending represented about 51 percent of discretionary spending, raising concerns about the affordability and sustainability of the current growth in defense spending and requiring tough choices about how to balance defense and domestic needs against available resources and reasonable tax burdens. GAO has reported that DOD continues to confront pervasive, decades-old management problems related to business operations that waste billions of dollars annually. These management weaknesses cut across all of DOD's major business areas. These areas, along with six government-wide areas that also apply to the department, mean that DOD is responsible for 14 of 25 high-risk areas. To move forward, in our view, there are three key elements that DOD must incorporate into its business transformation efforts to successfully address its systemic business management challenges. First, these efforts must include an integrated strategic plan, coupled with a well-defined blueprint--referred to as a business enterprise architecture--to guide and constrain implementation of such a plan. Second, central control of system investments is crucial for successful business transformation. Finally, a CMO is essential for providing the sustained leadership needed to achieve lasting transformation. The CMO would not assume the day-to-day management responsibilities of other DOD officials nor represent an additional hierarchical layer of management, but rather would serve as a strategic integrator who would lead DOD's overall business transformation efforts. Additionally, a 7-year term would also enable the CMO to work with DOD leadership across administrations to sustain the overall business transformation effort."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to discuss business  transformation at the Department of Defense (DOD). At the onset, I would  like to thank the Subcommittee for its continued oversight of key  government operations and management issues, including DOD\u2019s related  activities. The active involvement of this Subcommittee is essential to  ultimately assuring DOD\u2019s continued progress in business transformation,  including human capital reform, while enhancing public confidence in  DOD\u2019s stewardship of the hundreds of billions of taxpayer funds it receives  each year. Senator Voinovich and Senator Akaka, along with Senator  Ensign, I would also like to commend your leadership in sponsoring  proposed legislation to establish a position at the highest levels of DOD  that would be accountable and responsible for overall business  transformation efforts\u2014a position that we believe is critical to successfully  transforming DOD\u2019s business operations.", "In addition to external security threats, our nation is threatened from  within by growing fiscal imbalances. Over the long term, the nation\u2019s  growing fiscal imbalance stems primarily from the aging of the population  and rising health care costs. These trends are compounded by the presence  of near-term deficits arising from new discretionary and mandatory  spending as well as lower revenues as a share of the economy. If left  unchecked, these fiscal imbalances will ultimately impede economic  growth, have an adverse effect on our future standard of living, and in due  course impact our ability to address key national and homeland security  needs. These factors create the need to make choices that will only become  more difficult the longer they are postponed. Among these difficult choices  will be decisions about the affordability and sustainability of the recent  growth in defense spending. In fiscal year 2004, DOD spending represented  20 percent of federal spending and 51 percent of discretionary spending.  Therefore, it is increasingly important that DOD gets the most from every  defense dollar and helps to assure that its funds are targeted to addressing  specific needs versus a long list of unaffordable and unsustainable wants.  The Secretary of Defense has estimated that improving business operations  could save 5 percent of DOD\u2019s annual budget, which, based on the fiscal  year 2004 budget, represents a savings of about $22 billion. It is also  critically important to ensure that DOD\u2019s unmatched military capabilities  are supported by a sound management structure and systems designed to  support the warfighter in an economic, efficient, and effective manner.", "At a time when DOD is challenged to maintain a high level of military  operations while competing for resources in an increasingly fiscally  constrained environment, DOD\u2019s business management weaknesses  continue to result in reduced efficiencies and effectiveness that waste  billions of dollars every year. These business management weaknesses  touch on all of DOD\u2019s major business operations, ranging from the  department\u2019s inadequate management of overall business transformation to  decades-old financial management problems to various contracting and  selected supply chain challenges. In fact, all the business areas that I will  discuss today are on our 2005 \u201chigh-risk\u201d list of programs and activities that  need urgent attention and fundamental transformation to ensure that our  national government functions in the most economical, efficient, and  effective manner possible. In addition to human capital management, DOD  also shares responsibility for five other governmentwide high-risk areas,  such as managing federal real property.", "Senior administration leaders and advisors\u2014including the Secretary of  Defense, the nominee for Deputy Secretary of Defense, the Deputy Director  of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and members of the  Defense Business Board\u2014have demonstrated a commitment to addressing  DOD\u2019s management challenges. However, little sustainable progress has  been made to date, and, at present, no one individual at the right  organizational level with an adequate term in office is responsible for  overall business transformation efforts. Although OMB has worked closely  with a number of agencies that have high-risk issues, historically it has  been much less involved with DOD. To his credit, Clay Johnson, OMB\u2019s  Deputy Director for Management, recently reaffirmed plans to refocus on  GAO\u2019s high-risk list in order to make as much progress as possible during  the Bush Administration\u2019s second term. He also committed to placing  additional emphasis on DOD\u2019s high-risk areas, including working to help  ensure that DOD has action plans for addressing all its \u201chigh-risk\u201d areas.  Given the magnitude of DOD\u2019s problems and the stakes involved, it is  critical that OMB actively collaborate with the department to ensure it  establishes these action plans. It is also clear that, given the number and  nature of DOD\u2019s business challenges, it will take far longer than the balance  of this administration to address all of the department\u2019s high-risk areas.", "Today, I would like to provide our perspectives on (1) the fiscal trends that  prompt real questions about the affordability and sustainability of the rate  of growth in defense spending, (2) business management challenges that  DOD needs to address to successfully transform its business operations,  and (3) key elements to successfully achieve needed reforms. In particular,  I will emphasize the need for a strategic plan for business transformation  and offer suggestions that require legislative action\u2014the need for central  control of systems investment funding and the need for a chief  management official (CMO) to be dedicated full-time to leading DOD\u2019s  business transformation effort. Implementation of these two suggestions  would provide the sustained top-level leadership and accountability needed  by DOD to better permit the development and successful implementation  of the various plans necessary to successfully achieve business  transformation.", "I would like to further emphasize two points about the CMO. First, the  position divides and institutionalizes the current functions of the Deputy  Secretary of Defense into a Deputy Secretary who, as the alter ego of the  Secretary, would focus on policy-related issues such as military  transformation, and a Deputy Secretary of Defense for Management, the  CMO, who would be responsible and accountable for the overall business  transformation effort. Serving as the strategic integrator for DOD\u2019s  business transformation effort, the CMO would develop and implement a  strategic plan for business transformation. This new executive would have  sufficient clout to work with the Secretary of Defense, the Deputy  Secretary of Defense, the undersecretaries of defense, and the service  secretaries to make business transformation a reality. Second, I would also  like to emphasize what the CMO would not do. The CMO would not assume  the responsibilities of the undersecretaries of defense, the service  secretaries, or other DOD officials for the day-to-day management of  business activities. Therefore, in our view, creating a CMO would not be  adding another hierarchical layer to oversee the day-to-day management of  the department. Instead, the CMO would be responsible and accountable  for planning, integrating, and executing the overall business transformation  effort.", "My statement is based on previous GAO reports and our work was  performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Growing Fiscal Imbalance Raises Questions about the Affordability and Sustainability of Current Defense Spending", "paragraphs": ["The federal government\u2019s financial condition and long-term fiscal outlook  present enormous challenges to the nation\u2019s ability to respond to emerging  forces reshaping American society, the place of the United States in the  world, and the future role of DOD as well as the rest of the federal  government. The near-term deficits are daunting\u2014a $412 billion unified  budget deficit in fiscal year 2004 (including a $567 billion on-budget deficit  and a $155 billion off-budget surplus) and a $368 billion deficit (not  including any supplemental appropriations) forecast for fiscal year 2005 by  the CBO. If these near-term deficits represented only a short-term  phenomenon\u2014prompted by such factors as economic downturn or  national security crises\u2014there would be less cause for concern. However,  deficits have grown notwithstanding the economy recovery from the  recession in 2001, and the incremental costs of responding to homeland  security and the nation\u2019s global war against terrorism represent only a  relatively small fraction of current and projected deficits. Moreover, based  on our long-range fiscal simulations, the current fiscal condition is but a  prelude to a much more daunting long-term fiscal outlook. GAO\u2019s long-term  simulations illustrate the magnitude of the fiscal challenges associated with  an aging society and the significance of the related challenges the  government will be called upon to address. Absent significant policy  changes on the spending or revenue side of the budget, our simulations  show that growth in spending on federal retirement and health entitlements  will encumber an escalating share of the government\u2019s resources. Indeed,  when we assume that recent tax reductions are made permanent and  discretionary spending keeps pace with the economy, our long-term  simulations suggest that by 2040 federal revenues may be adequate to pay  little more than interest on the federal debt.", "In fact, the cost implications of the baby boom generation\u2019s retirement have  already become a factor in CBO\u2019s baseline projections and will only  intensify as the baby boomers age. According to CBO, total federal  spending for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is projected to grow  by about 25 percent over the next 10 years\u2014from 8.4 percent of Gross  Domestic Product in 2004 to 10.4 percent in 2015. In addition, CBO  reported that excluding supplemental funding appropriated in 2004 and  requested in 2005 (mostly for activities in Iraq and Afghanistan),  discretionary budget authority for defense programs is estimated to grow  from $394 billion in 2004 to $421 billion in 2005, a 6.8 percent increase. The  expected growth combined with the fact that DOD accounted for more  than half of all discretionary spending in fiscal year 2004 raises concerns  about the sustainability and affordability of increased defense spending.", "Despite the need to make strategic investment decisions to address these  fiscal pressures, DOD\u2019s current approach to planning often supports the  status quo and results in a mismatch between programs and budgets. As we  have reported, DOD has difficulties overcoming cultural resistance to  change and the inertia of various organizations, policies, and procedures  rooted in the Cold War era. Long-standing organizational and budgetary  programs need to be addressed, such as the existence of stovepiped or  siloed organizations, the involvement of many layers and players in  decision making, and the allocation of budgets on a proportional rather  than a strategic basis across the military services. DOD\u2019s approach to  planning does not always provide reasonable visibility to decision makers,  including Congress, over the projected cost of defense programs. As we  have reported in the past, DOD uses overly optimistic estimations of future  program costs that often lead to costs being understated. For example, in  January 2003 we reported that the estimated cost of developing eight major  weapon systems had increased from about $47 billion in fiscal year 1998 to  about $72 billion by fiscal year 2003. As a result of these inaccurate  estimates, DOD has more programs than it can support with its available  dollars, which often leads to program instability, costly program stretch- outs, and program termination.", "Increasingly limited fiscal resources across the federal government,  coupled with emerging requirements from the changing security  environment, emphasize the need for DOD to address its current inefficient  approach to planning and develop a risk-based strategic investment  framework for establishing goals, evaluating and setting priorities, and  making difficult resource decisions. In its strategic plan, the September  2001 Quadrennial Defense Review, DOD outlined a new risk management  framework consisting of four dimensions of risk\u2014force management,  operational, future challenges, and institutional\u2014to use in considering  trade-offs among defense objectives and resource constraints. We  recognize what a large undertaking developing a departmentwide risk  management framework will be and understand that DOD is still in the  process of implementing this approach. However, it remains unclear how  DOD will use the risk management framework to measure progress in  achieving business and force transformation. It also remains unclear how  the framework will be used to correct limitations we have previously  identified in DOD\u2019s strategic planning and budgeting.

However, serious inefficiencies remain. As a result, the areas of support  infrastructure management, business systems modernization, financial  management, weapon systems acquisition, contract management, and  supply chain management remain high-risk DOD business operations. We  now consider DOD\u2019s overall approach to business transformation to be a  high-risk area because (1) DOD\u2019s business improvement initiatives and  control over resources are fragmented; (2) DOD lacks a clear strategic and  integrated business transformation plan and an investment strategy,  including a well-defined enterprise architecture, to guide and constrain  implementation of such a plan; and (3) DOD has not designated a senior  management official responsible and accountable for overall business  transformation reform and related resources.", "Unless DOD makes progress in overall business transformation, we believe  it will continue to have difficulties in confronting other problems in its  business operations.

Such leadership could facilitate the overall business transformation effort  within DOD by providing the momentum needed to overcome cultural  resistance to change, military service parochialism, and stovepiped  operations, all of which have contributed significantly to the failure of  previous attempts to implement broad-based management reform at DOD.

Successful implementation of NSPS is essential  for DOD as it attempts to transform its military forces and defense business  practices in response to 21st century challenges. In addition, this new  human resources management system, if properly designed and effectively  implemented, could serve as a model for governmentwide human capital  transformation. DOD is one of several federal agencies that have been  granted the authority by Congress to design a new human capital system as  a way to address the governmentwide high-risk area of strategic human  capital management. This effort represents a huge undertaking for DOD,  given its massive size and geographically and culturally diverse workforce.  As I recently testified on DOD\u2019s proposed NSPS regulations, our ongoing  work continues to raise questions about DOD\u2019s chances of success in its  efforts to effect fundamental business management reform, such as NSPS. I  would like to acknowledge, however, that DOD\u2019s NSPS regulations take a  valuable step toward a modern performance management system as well as  a more market-based and results-oriented compensation system.", "On February 14, 2005, the Secretary of Defense and the Acting Director of  Office of Personnel Management (OPM) released the proposed NSPS  regulations for public comment. Many of the principles underlying those  regulations are generally consistent with proven approaches to strategic  human capital management. For instance, the proposed regulations  provide for (1) elements of a flexible and contemporary human resources  management system, such as pay bands and pay for performance; (2) right- sizing of DOD\u2019s workforce when implementing reduction-in-force orders by  giving greater priority to employee performance in its retention decisions;  and (3) continuing collaboration with employee representatives. (It should  be noted, however, that 10 federal labor unions have filed suit alleging that  DOD failed to abide by the statutory requirements to include employee  representatives in the development of DOD\u2019s new labor relations system  authorized as part of NSPS.)", "Despite this progress, we have three primary areas of concern about the  proposed NSPS regulations. DOD\u2019s proposed regulations do not (1) define  the details of the implementation of the system, including such issues as  adequate safeguards to help ensure fairness and guard against abuse;  (2) require, as we believe they should, the use of core competencies to  communicate to employees what is expected of them on the job; and  (3) identify a process for the continuing involvement of employees in the  planning, development, and implementation of NSPS.", "DOD also faces multiple implementation challenges once it issues its final  NSPS regulations. Given the huge undertaking NSPS represents, another  challenge is to elevate, integrate, and institutionalize leadership  responsibility for this large-scale organizational change initiative to ensure  its success. A chief management official or similar position can effectively  provide the continuing, focused leadership essential to successfully  completing these multiyear transformations. Additionally, DOD could  benefit if it develops a comprehensive communications strategy that  provides for ongoing, meaningful two-way communication to create shared  expectations among employees, employee representatives, managers,  customers, and stakeholders. Finally, appropriate institutional  infrastructure could enable DOD to make effective use of its new  authorities. At a minimum, this infrastructure includes a human capital  planning process that integrates DOD\u2019s human capital policies, strategies,  and programs with its program goals, mission, and desired outcomes; the  capabilities to effectively develop and implement a new human capital  system; and a set of adequate safeguards\u2014including reasonable  transparency and appropriate accountability mechanisms\u2014to help ensure  the fair, effective, and credible implementation and application of a new  system.", "We strongly support the need for government transformation and the  concept of modernizing federal human capital policies within both DOD  and the federal government at large.

Personnel security  clearances allow individuals to gain access to classified information. In  some cases, unauthorized disclosure of classified information could  reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to national  defense or foreign relations. DOD has approximately 2 million active  clearances as a result of worldwide deployments, contact with sensitive  equipment, and other security requirements. While our work on the  clearance process has focused on DOD, clearance delays in other federal  agencies suggest that similar impediments and their effects may extend  beyond DOD.", "Since at least the 1990s, we have documented problems with DOD\u2019s  personnel security clearance process, particularly problems related to  backlogs and the resulting delays in determining clearance eligibility.  Since fiscal year 2000, DOD has declared its personnel security clearance  investigations program to be a systemic weakness\u2014a weakness that  affects more than one DOD component and may jeopardize the  department\u2019s operations. An October 2002 House Committee on  Government Reform report also recommended including DOD\u2019s  adjudicative process as a material weakness. As of September 30, 2003  (the most recent data available), DOD could not estimate the full size of its  backlog, but we identified over 350,000 cases exceeding established time  frames for determining eligibility.", "DOD has taken steps to address the backlog\u2014such as hiring more  adjudicators and authorizing overtime for adjudicative staff\u2014but a  significant shortage of trained federal and private-sector investigative  personnel presents a major obstacle to timely completion of cases. Other  impediments to eliminating the backlog include the absence of an  integrated, comprehensive management plan for addressing a wide variety  of problems identified by us and others. In addition to matching  adjudicative staff to workloads and working with OPM to develop an  overall management plan, DOD needs to develop and use new methods for  forecasting clearance needs and monitoring backlogs; eliminate  unnecessary limitations on reciprocity (the acceptance of a clearance and  access granted by another department, agency, or military service);  determine the feasibility of implementing initiatives that could decrease the  backlog and delays; and provide better oversight for all aspects of its  personnel security clearance process. The National Defense Authorization  Act for Fiscal Year 2004 authorized the transfer of DOD\u2019s personnel  security investigative function and over 1,800 investigative employees to  OPM. This transfer took place in February 2005. While the transfer  eliminated DOD\u2019s responsibility for conducting the investigations, it did not  eliminate the shortage of trained investigative personnel needed to address  the backlog. Although DOD retained the responsibility for adjudicating  clearances, OPM is now accountable for ensuring that investigations are  completed in a timely manner.

For years,  DOD has attempted to modernize these systems, and we have provided  numerous recommendations to help guide its efforts. For example, in 2001  we provided DOD with a set of recommendations to help it develop and  implement an enterprise architecture (or modernization blueprint) and  establish effective investment management controls. Such an enterprise  architecture is essential for DOD to guide and constrain how it spends  billions of dollars annually on information technology systems. We also  made numerous project-specific and DOD-wide recommendations aimed at  getting DOD to follow proven best practices when it acquired system  solutions.

Additionally, the act requires  the development of a transition plan that includes an acquisition strategy  for new systems and a listing of the termination dates of current legacy  systems that will not be part of the corporatewide solution, as well as a  listing of legacy systems that will be modified to become part of the  corporatewide solution for addressing DOD\u2019s business management  deficiencies.", "In May 2004, we also reported that the department\u2019s approach to investing  billions of dollars annually in existing systems had not changed  significantly. As a result, DOD lacked an effective investment  management process for selecting and controlling ongoing and planned  business systems investments. While DOD issued a policy that assigns  investment management responsibilities for business systems, in May 2004  we reported that DOD had not yet defined the detailed procedures  necessary for implementing the policy, clearly defined the roles and  responsibilities of the business domain owners (now referred to as core  business mission areas), established common investment criteria, or  ensured that its business systems are consistent with the architecture.", "To address certain provisions and requirements of the Ronald W.

According to the  directive, this transfer of functions and responsibilities will allow the  OUSD(AT&L) to establish the level of activity necessary to support and  coordinate activities of the newly established Defense Business Systems  Management Committee (DBSMC).

In addition, DOD still needs to designate a person to have overall  responsibility and accountability for this effort.

The statutory requirements  enacted as part of the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization  Act for Fiscal Year 2005 further require that the DBSMC must agree with  the designated approval authorities\u2019 certification of funds exceeding $1  million for the modernization of business systems before funds can be  obligated. More important, the obligation of these funds without the  requisite approval by the DBSMC is deemed a violation of the Anti- Deficiency Act.

DOD\u2019s financial management deficiencies adversely affect the  department\u2019s ability to control costs, ensure basic accountability, anticipate  future costs and claims on the budget, measure performance, maintain  funds control, prevent fraud, and address pressing management issues. As I  testified before the House Committee on Government Reform in February  2005, and as discussed in our report on the U.S. government\u2019s  consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2004, DOD\u2019s financial  management deficiencies, taken together, represent a major impediment to  achieving an unqualified opinion on the U.S. government\u2019s consolidated  financial statements.", "Our recent reports and testimonies on Army reserve and national guard pay  issues clearly illustrate the impact deficiencies in DOD\u2019s financial  management have had on the very men and women our country is  depending on to perform our military operations. For example, in February  2005, we reported that the Army\u2019s process for extending active duty orders  for injured soldiers lacks an adequate control environment and  management controls, including (1) clear and comprehensive guidance,  (2) a system to provide visibility over injured soldiers, and (3) adequate  training and education programs. The Army also has not established user- friendly processes, including clear approval criteria and adequate  infrastructure and support services.", "Poorly defined processes for extending active duty orders for injured and  ill reserve component soldiers have caused soldiers to be inappropriately  dropped from their active duty orders. For some, this has led to significant  gaps in pay and health insurance, which have created financial hardships  for these soldiers and their families. Based on our analysis of Army  manpower data during the period from February 2004 through April 7,  2004, almost 34 percent of the 867 soldiers who applied for extension of  active duty orders because of injuries or illness lost their active duty status  before their extension requests were granted. For many soldiers, this  resulted in being removed from active duty status in the automated systems  that control pay and access to benefits such as medical care and access to a  commissary or post exchange that allows soldiers and their families to  purchase groceries and other goods at a discount. Many Army locations  have used ad hoc procedures to keep soldiers in pay status; however, these  procedures often circumvent key internal controls and put the Army at risk  of making improper and potentially fraudulent payments. Finally, the  Army\u2019s nonintegrated systems, which require extensive error-prone manual  data entry, further delay access to pay and benefits.", "The Army recently implemented the Medical Retention Processing (MRP)  program, which takes the place of the previously existing process in most  cases. The MRP program, which authorizes an automatic 179 days of pay  and benefits, may resolve the timeliness of the front-end approval process.  However, the MRP program has some of the same problems as the existing  process and may also result in overpayments to soldiers who are released  early from their MRP orders.", "DOD\u2019s senior civilian and military leaders have taken positive steps to  begin reforming the department\u2019s financial management operations.  However, to date, tangible evidence of improvement has been seen in only  a few specific areas, such as internal controls related to DOD\u2019s purchase  card and individually billed travel card programs. Further, we reported in  September 2004 that, while DOD had established a goal of obtaining a clean  opinion on its financial statements by 2007, it lacked a written and realistic  plan to make that goal a reality.

Such an overhaul of DOD\u2019s financial management  operations goes far beyond financial accounting to the very fiber of the  department\u2019s wide-ranging business operations and its management  culture. It will require (1) sustained leadership and resource control,  (2) clear lines of responsibility and accountability, (3) plans and related  results-oriented performance measures, and (4) appropriate individual and  organizational incentives and consequences. DOD is still in the very early  stages of a departmentwide overhaul that will take years to accomplish.  DOD has not yet established a framework to integrate improvement efforts  in this area with related broad-based DOD initiatives, such as human  capital reform.

While DOD\u2019s acquisition process has produced the  best weapons in the world, it also consistently yields undesirable  consequences\u2014such as cost increases, late deliveries to the warfighter,  and performance shortfalls. Such problems were highlighted, for example,  in our reviews of DOD\u2019s F/A-22 Raptor, Space-Based Infrared System,  Airborne Laser, and other programs. Problems occur because DOD\u2019s  weapon programs do not capture early on the requisite knowledge that is  needed to efficiently and effectively manage program risks. For example,  programs move forward with unrealistic program cost and schedule  estimates, lack clearly defined and stable requirements, use immature  technologies in launching product development, and fail to solidify design  and manufacturing processes at appropriate junctures in development.", "When programs require more resources than planned, the buying power of  the defense dollar is reduced and funds are not available for other  competing needs. It is not unusual for estimates of time and money to be  off by 20 to 50 percent. When costs and schedules increase, quantities are  cut and the value for the warfighter\u2014as well as the value of the investment  dollar\u2014is reduced. In these times of asymmetric threats and netcentricity,  individual weapon system investments are getting larger and more  complex. Just 4 years ago, the top five weapon systems cost about $281  billion; today, in the same base year dollars, the five weapon systems cost  about $521 billion. If these megasystems are managed with traditional  margins of error, the financial consequences\u2014particularly the ripple  effects on other programs\u2014can be dire.", "While weapon systems acquisition continues to remain on our high-risk list,  DOD has undertaken a number of acquisition reforms over the past 5 years.  Specifically, DOD has restructured its acquisition policy to incorporate  attributes of a knowledge-based acquisition model and has reemphasized  the discipline of systems engineering. In addition, DOD recently introduced  new policies to strengthen its budgeting and requirements determination  processes in order to plan and manage weapon systems based on joint  warfighting capabilities. While these policy changes are positive steps,  implementation in individual programs will continue to be a challenge  because of inherent funding, management, and cultural factors that lead  managers to develop business cases for new programs that over-promise  on cost, delivery, and performance of weapon systems.", "It is imperative that needs be distinguished from wants and that DOD\u2019s  limited resources be allocated to the most appropriate weapon system  investments. Once the best investments that can be afforded are identified,  then DOD must follow its own policy to employ the knowledge-based  strategies essential for delivering the investments within projected  resources. Making practice follow policy is not a simple matter. It is a  complex challenge involving many factors.

As the government\u2019s largest purchaser at over $200  billion in fiscal year 2003, DOD is unable to assure that it is using sound  business practices to acquire the goods and services needed to meet the  warfighter\u2019s needs. For example, over the past decade DOD has  significantly increased its spending on contractor-provided information  technology and management support services, but it has yet to fully  implement a strategic approach to acquiring these services. In 2002, DOD  and the military departments established a structure to review individual  service acquisitions valued at $500 million or more, and in 2003 they  launched a pilot program to help identify strategic sourcing opportunities.  To further promote a strategic orientation, however, DOD needs to  establish a departmentwide concept of operations; set performance goals,  including savings targets; and ensure accountability for achieving them. In  March 2004, we reported that if greater management focus were given to  opportunities to capture savings through the purchase card program, DOD  could potentially save tens of millions of dollars without sacrificing the  ability to acquire items quickly or compromising other goals.", "DOD also needs to have the right skills and capabilities in its acquisition  workforce to effectively implement best practices and properly manage the  goods and services it buys. However, DOD reduced its civilian workforce  by about 38 percent between fiscal years 1989 and 2002 without ensuring  that it had the specific skills and competencies needed to accomplish  current and future DOD acquisition/contract administration missions, and  more than half of its current workforce will be eligible for early or regular  retirement in the next 5 years. We found that inadequate staffing and the  lack of clearly defined roles and responsibilities contributed to contract  administration challenges encountered in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF).  Further, we have reported that DOD\u2019s extensive use of military logistical  support contracts in OIF and elsewhere required strengthened oversight.  Just recently, we identified surveillance issues in almost a third of the  contracts we reviewed. We also noted that some personnel performing  surveillance had not received required training, while others felt that they  did not have sufficient time in a normal workday to perform their  surveillance duties. DOD has made progress in laying a foundation for  reshaping its acquisition workforce by initiating a long-term strategic  planning effort, but as of June 2004 it did not yet have the comprehensive  strategic workforce plan needed to guide its efforts.", "DOD uses various techniques\u2014such as performance-based service  contracting, multiple-award task order contracts, and purchase cards\u2014to  acquire the goods and services it needs. We have found, however, that DOD  personnel did not always make sound use of these tools. For example, in  June 2004, we reported that more than half of the task orders to support  Iraq reconstruction efforts we reviewed were, in whole or in part, outside  the scope of the underlying contract. In July 2004, we found that DOD  personnel waived competition requirements for nearly half of the task  orders reviewed. As a result of the frequent use of waivers, DOD had  fewer opportunities to obtain the potential benefits of competition\u2014 improved levels of service, market-tested prices, and the best overall value.", "We also found that DOD lacked safeguards to ensure that waivers were  granted only under appropriate circumstances.", "Our work has shown that DOD would benefit by making use of commercial  best practices, such as taking a strategic approach to acquiring services;  building on initial efforts to develop a strategic human capital plan for its  civilian workforce; and improving safeguards, issuing additional guidance,  and providing training to its workforce on the appropriate use of  contracting techniques and approaches. DOD is undertaking corrective  actions, but because most efforts are in their early stages, it is uncertain  whether they can be fully and successfully implemented in the near term.

We  have since expanded the inventory management high-risk area to include  DOD\u2019s management of certain key aspects of its supply chain, including  distribution, inventory management, and asset visibility, because of  significant weaknesses we have uncovered since our 2003 high-risk series  was published. For example, during OIF, the supply chain encountered  many problems, including backlogs of hundreds of pallets and containers  at distribution points, a $1.2 billion discrepancy in the amount of material  shipped to\u2014and received by\u2014Army activities, cannibalized equipment  because of a lack of spare parts, and millions of dollars spent in late fees to  lease or replace storage containers because of distribution backlogs and  losses. Moreover, we identified shortages of items such as tires, vehicle  track shoes, body armor, and batteries for critical communication and  electronic equipment. These problems were the result of systemic  deficiencies in DOD\u2019s supply chain, including inaccurate requirements,  funding delays, acquisition delays, and ineffective theater distribution.", "While DOD reports show that the department currently owns about $67  billion worth of inventory, shortages of certain critical spare parts are  adversely affecting equipment readiness and contributing to maintenance  delays. The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and each of the military  services have experienced significant shortages of critical spare parts, even  though more than half of DOD\u2019s reported inventory\u2014about $35 billion\u2014 exceeded current operating requirements. In many cases, these shortages  contributed directly to equipment downtime, maintenance problems, and  the services\u2019 failure to meet their supply availability goals. DOD, DLA, and  the military services each lack strategic approaches and detailed plans that  could help mitigate these critical spare parts shortages and guide their  many initiatives aimed at improving inventory management.", "DOD\u2019s continued supply chain problems also resulted in shortages of items  in Iraq. In an April 8, 2005, report, we reported that demands for items like  vehicle track shoes, batteries, and tires exceeded their availability because  the department did not have accurate or adequately funded Army war  reserve requirements and had inaccurate forecasts of supply demands for  the operation. Furthermore, the Army\u2019s funding approval process delayed  the flow of funds to buy them. Meanwhile, rapid acquisition of other items  faced obstacles. Body armor production was limited by the availability of  Kevlar and other critical materials, whereas the delivery of up-armored  High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicles and armor kits was slowed  by DOD\u2019s decisions to pace production. In addition, numerous problems,  such as insufficient transportation, personnel, and equipment, as well as  inadequate information systems, hindered DOD\u2019s ability to deliver the right  items to the right place at the right time for the warfighter. Among the items  the department had problems delivering were generators for Assault  Amphibian Vehicles, tires, and Meals Ready-to-Eat.", "In addition to supply shortages, DOD also lacks visibility and control over  the supplies and spare parts it owns. Therefore, it cannot monitor the  responsiveness and effectiveness of the supply system to identify and  eliminate choke points. Currently, DOD does not have the ability to  provide timely or accurate information on the location, movement, status,  or identity of its supplies. Although total asset visibility has been a  departmentwide goal for over 30 years, DOD estimates that it will not  achieve this visibility until the year 2010. DOD may not meet this goal by  2010, however, unless it overcomes three significant impediments:  developing a comprehensive plan for achieving visibility, building the  necessary integration among its many inventory management information  systems, and correcting long-standing data accuracy and reliability  problems within existing inventory management systems.", "DOD, DLA, and the services have undertaken a number of initiatives to  improve and transform DOD\u2019s supply chain.

To ensure these three elements are incorporated  into the department\u2019s overall business management, we believe Congress  should legislatively create a full-time, high-level executive with long-term  \u201cgood government\u201d responsibilities that are professional and nonpartisan  in nature. This executive, the Chief Management Official (CMO), would be  a strategic integrator responsible for leading the department\u2019s overall  business transformation, including developing and implementing a related  strategic plan.

Since 1999, for  example, we have recommended that a comprehensive and integrated  strategic business transformation plan be developed for reforming DOD\u2019s  major business operations and support activities. In 2004, we suggested  that DOD clearly establish management accountability for business reform.  While DOD has been attempting to develop an enterprise architecture for  modernizing its business processes and supporting information technology  assets for the last 4 years, it has not developed a strategic and integrated  transformation plan for managing its many business improvement  initiatives.

As a  result, DOD managers lacked straightforward road maps showing how  their work contributed to attaining the department\u2019s strategic goals, and  they risked operating autonomously rather than collectively. As of March  2004, DOD formulated departmentwide performance goals and measures  and continued to refine and align them with outcomes described in its  strategic plan\u2014the September 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR).  As previously discussed, DOD outlined a new risk management framework  in the QDR that DOD was to use in considering trade-offs among defense  objective and resource constraints, but as of March 2005 DOD was still in  the process of implementing it.", "Finally, DOD has not established a clear linkage among institutional, unit,  and individual results-oriented goals, performance measures, and reward  mechanisms for undertaking large-scale organizational change initiatives  that are needed for successful business management reform. Traditionally,  DOD has justified its need for more funding on the basis of the quantity of  programs it has pursued rather than on the outcomes its programs have  produced. DOD has historically measured its performance by resource  components, such as the amount of money spent, people employed, or  number of tasks completed.

We have  made numerous recommendations to DOD to improve the management  oversight and control of its business systems modernization investments.  However, as previously discussed, a provision of the Ronald W. Reagan  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005, consistent with  the suggestion I have made in prior testimonies, established specific  management oversight and accountability with the \u201cowners\u201d of the various  core business mission areas. This legislation defined the scope of the  various business areas (e.g., acquisition, logistics, finance, and accounting),  and established functional approval authority and responsibility for  management of the portfolio of business systems with the relevant under  secretary of defense for the departmental core business mission areas and  the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information  Integration (information technology infrastructure). For example, the  Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics is  now responsible and accountable for any defense business system  intended to support acquisition activities, logistics activities, or  installations and environment activities for DOD.", "This legislation also requires that the responsible approval authorities  establish a hierarchy of investment review boards, the highest level being  the Defense Business Systems Management Committee (DBSMC), with  DOD-wide representation, including the military services and defense  agencies. The boards are responsible for reviewing and approving  investments to develop, operate, maintain, and modernize business  systems for their business-area portfolio, including ensuring that  investments are consistent with DOD\u2019s business enterprise architecture.

As a result,  DOD continues to have little or no assurance that its business systems  modernization investment money is being spent in an economical, efficient,  and effective manner. Given that DOD spends billions on business systems  and related infrastructure each year, we believe it is critical that those  responsible for business systems improvements control the allocation and  execution of funds for DOD business systems. However, implementation  may require review of the various statutory authorities for the military  services and other DOD components. Control over business systems  investment funds would improve the capacity of DOD\u2019s designated  approval authorities to fulfill their responsibilities and gain transparency  over DOD investments, and minimize the parochial approach to systems  development that exists today. In addition, to improve coordination and  integration activities, we suggest that all approval authorities coordinate  their business systems modernization efforts with a CMO who would chair  the DBSMC.

One way to ensure  such leadership would be to create by legislation a full-time executive-level  II position for a CMO, who would serve as the Deputy Secretary of Defense  for Management.

The  position would divide and institutionalize the current functions of the  Deputy Secretary of Defense into a Deputy Secretary who, as the alter ego  of the Secretary, would focus on policy-related issues such as military  transformation, and a Deputy Secretary of Defense for Management, the  CMO, who would be responsible and accountable for the overall business  transformation effort and would serve full-time as the strategic integrator  of DOD\u2019s business transformation efforts by, for example, developing and  implementing a strategic and integrated plan for business transformation  efforts. The CMO would not conduct the day-to-day management functions  of the department; therefore, creating this position would not add an  additional hierarchical layer to the department. Day-to-day management  functions of the department would continue to be the responsibility of the  undersecretaries of defense, the service secretaries, and others. Just as the  CMO would need to focus full-time on business transformation, we believe  that the day-to-day management functions are so demanding that it is  difficult for these officials to maintain the oversight, focus, and momentum  needed to implement and sustain needed reforms of DOD\u2019s overall business  operations. This is particularly evident given the demands that the Iraq and  Afghanistan postwar reconstruction activities and the continuing war on  terrorism have placed on current leaders.

In this time of growing fiscal  constraints, every dollar that DOD can save through improved economy  and efficiency of its operations is important to the well-being of our nation.

First, DOD needs to  implement and sustain a strategic and integrated business transformation  plan. Second, we believe that the implementation of two proposed  legislative initiatives\u2014establishing central control of business system  funds and creating a CMO\u2014is crucial. We believe that central control over  business system investment funds would better enable DOD to ensure that  its resources are being invested in an economical, efficient, and effective  manner. As long as funding is controlled by the components, it is likely that  the existing problems with stovepiped, duplicative, and nonintegrated  systems will continue. We support the need for legislation to create a CMO,  in part, because we doubt that there is a single individual\u2014no matter how  talented and experienced\u2014who could effectively address all that needs to  be addressed at DOD, including conducting a global war on terrorism,  transforming the military, and tackling long-standing, systemic business  transformation challenges. We believe that a CMO, serving a 7-year term  with the potential for reappointment, would have the institutional clout and  an adequate term in office to work with DOD\u2019s senior leadership across  administrations to make business transformation a reality. Since the CMO  would not have responsibility for day-to-day management, this position  would not superimpose another hierarchical layer over the department to  oversee daily business operations.
