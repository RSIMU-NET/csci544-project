These obligations total about $3.0 billion over 3 years to support the system. As identified by the department, the obligations were to cover the costs for three programs (VistA Evolution, Interoperability, and Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record Health) and other supporting investments for activities such as networks and infrastructure sustainment. The following table provides a summary of the total VistA and VistA-related obligations.", "GAO's preliminary results indicate that VA is working to define VistA and identify system components to be replaced by the new system. However, according to VA officials, there is no single information source that fully defines the scope of VistA. This situation is partly due to differences in VistA at various facilities. In the absence of a complete definition of VistA, program officials have taken a number of steps to define the system's scope and identify the components that the new system will replace. These steps have included conducting analyses, performing preliminary site (medical facility) assessments, and planning for a detailed assessment of each site where the new system will be deployed.", "Since VA announced in June 2017 that the department would acquire the same electronic health record system as the Department of Defense (DOD), GAO's preliminary results indicate that VA has begun taking actions to prepare for the transition from VistA. These actions have included standardizing VistA, clarifying the department's approach to interoperability, establishing governance for the new program and the framework for joint governance with DOD, and preparing initial program plans. VA is early in its effort to transition from VistA to the Cerner system and the department's actions are ongoing.", "In 2011, GAO reported on nine common factors critical to the success of major IT acquisitions.

In part, we  identified limitations in the capacity of VA\u2019s existing IT systems, including  the outdated, inefficient nature of certain systems and a lack of system  interoperability as contributors to the department\u2019s challenges related to  health care.", "Providing health care to veterans requires a complex set of clinical and  administrative capabilities supported by IT. VA\u2019s health information  system\u2014VistA\u2014has been essential to the department\u2019s ability to deliver  health care to veterans. VistA contains an electronic health record for  each patient that supports clinical settings throughout the department. For  example, clinicians can use the system to enter and review patient  information; order lab tests, medications, diets, radiology tests, and  procedures; record a patient\u2019s allergies or adverse reactions to  medications; request and track consults; enter progress notes, diagnoses,  and treatments for encounters; and enter discharge summaries.", "VistA was developed in house by clinicians and IT personnel in various  VA medical facilities and has been in operation since the early 1980s.  Over the last several decades, VistA has evolved into a technically  complex system comprised of about 170 modules that support health  care delivery at 152 VA Medical Centers and over 1,200 outpatient sites.  In addition, customization of VistA, such as changes to the modules by  the various medical facilities, has resulted in about 130 versions of the  system\u2014referred to as instances.", "According to VA, VistA modules are comprised of one or more software  applications that support various health care functions, such as providing  care coordination and mental health services. In addition to VistA, the  department has other health information systems that must interface with  VistA to send, exchange, or store related health (e.g., clinical and patient)  data.", "Since 2001, VA has identified the need for enhancements and  modifications to VistA and has pursued multiple efforts to modernize the  system. Two major efforts have included the VistA Evolution program  and, most recently, the planned acquisition of the same electronic health  record system that the Department of Defense (DOD) is acquiring.", "In 2013, VA established VistA Evolution as a joint program between OI&T  and VHA that was comprised of a collection of projects and efforts  focused on improving the efficiency and quality of veterans\u2019 health care.  This program was to modernize the department\u2019s health information  systems, increase VA\u2019s data exchange and interoperability capabilities  with DOD and private sector health care partners, and reduce VA\u2019s time  to deploy new health information management capabilities.", "In June 2017, the former VA Secretary announced a significant shift in the  department\u2019s approach to modernizing VistA. Specifically, rather than  continue to use VistA, the Secretary stated that the department planned  to acquire the same Cerner electronic health record system that DOD has  been acquiring.", "Accordingly, the department awarded a contract to Cerner in May 2018  for a maximum of $10 billion over 10 years. Cerner is to replace VistA  with a commercial electronic health record system. This new system is to  support a broad range of health care functions that include, for example,  acute care, clinical decision support, dental care, and emergency  medicine.

These other systems include, for example, dentistry and  oncology applications. As part of this analysis, the department combined  data from the VA Systems Inventory, the VistA Document Library, the VA  Monograph, and other sources to identify the health information  technology environment at a typical VA medical center.", "The resulting analysis of VA\u2019s health IT environment identified a total of  330 applications that support health care delivery at a medical center, of  which 119 applications (approximately 36 percent) have been identified  as having similar functionality as a capability of the Cerner system.  Further, 128 of the 330 applications are identified as VistA applications.  Of the 128 applications designated as VistA, 58 (approximately 45  percent) have been identified as having similar functionality as a  capability of the Cerner system, including pharmacy, laboratory, and  scheduling capabilities.", "In addition to the analyses discussed above, VA has taken steps to  understand differences in VistA at individual facilities. Specifically,  according to EHRM officials, representatives from VA and Cerner have  visited 17 VA medical facilities to conduct preliminary site assessments.  The intent of these assessments is to obtain a broad perspective of the  current state of the systems, applications, integration points, reporting,  and workflows being utilized at individual facilities. These site visits  identified VistA customization that may be site specific. The identification  of such site specific customization is intended to help Cerner plan for  implementation of its system at each location.

This included knowledge of acquisitions and  procurement processes, monitoring of contracts, large-scale  organizational transformation, Agile software development concepts,  and areas of program management such as earned value management  and technical monitoring.", "Finally, officials for five of the seven selected investments identified  having the end users test and validate the system components prior to  formal end user acceptance testing for deployment as critical to the  success of their program. Similar to this factor, leading guidance  recommends testing selected products and product components  throughout the program life cycle. Testing of functionality by end users  prior to acceptance demonstrates, earlier rather than later in the program  life cycle, that the functionality will fulfill its intended use. If problems are  found during this testing, programs are typically positioned to make changes that would be less costly and disruptive than ones made later in  the life cycle.", "Use of the critical success factors described above can serve as a model  of best practices for VA. Application of these acquisition best practices  presents opportunities for the department to increase the likelihood that  its planned acquisition of a new electronic health record system will meet  its cost, schedule, scope, and performance goals.", "In conclusion, VA continued to obligate billions of dollars for its VistA  system. Recently, the department has undertaken important analyses to  better understand the scope of the system and identify capabilities that  can be provided by the Cerner electronic health record system it is  acquiring. VA has additional key activities underway, such as establishing  program governance and EHRM program planning. Based on these  preliminary observations and as the department continues its activities to  transition from VistA to the Cerner electronic health record system, critical  success factors can serve as a model of best practices that VA could  apply to enhance the likelihood that the acquisition of the new system will  be successfully achieved. While it is early in VA\u2019s acquisition of the  Cerner system, it will be important for the department to leverage all  available opportunities to ensure that its transition to a new system is  carried out in the most effective manner possible.
