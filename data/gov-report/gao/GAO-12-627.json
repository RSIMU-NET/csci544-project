Since the NMAP\u0092s inception, the MIG has used three different audit approaches: test, MSIS, and collaborative. This report focuses on (1) the effectiveness of the MIG\u0092s implementation of NMAP, and (2) the MIG\u0092s efforts to redesign the NMAP. To do this work, GAO analyzed MIG data, reviewed its contractors\u0092 reports, and interviewed MIG officials, contractor representatives, and state program integrity officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Compared to the initial test audits and the more recent collaborative audits, the majority of the Medicaid Integrity Group\u0092s (MIG) audits conducted under the National Medicaid Audit Program (NMAP) were less effective because they used Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS) data. MSIS is an extract of states\u0092 claims data and is missing key elements, such as provider names, that are necessary for auditing. Since fiscal year 2008, 4 percent of the 1,550 MSIS audits identified $7.4 million in potential overpayments, 69 percent did not identify overpayments, and the remaining 27 percent were ongoing. In contrast, 26 test audits and 6 collaborative audits\u0097which used states\u0092 more robust Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) claims data and allowed states to select the audit targets\u0097together identified more than $12 million in potential overpayments. Furthermore, the median amount of the potential overpayment for MSIS audits was relatively small compared to test and collaborative audits.", "The MIG reported that it is redesigning the NMAP, but has not provided Congress with key details about the changes it is making to the program, including the rationale for the change to collaborative audits, new analytical roles for its contractors, and its plans for addressing problems with the MSIS audits. Early results showed that this collaborative approach may enhance state program integrity activities by allowing states to leverage the MIG\u0092s resources to augment their own program integrity capacity. However, the lack of a published plan detailing how the MIG will monitor and evaluate NMAP raises concerns about the MIG\u0092s ability to effectively manage the program. Given that NMAP has accounted for more than 40 percent of MIG expenditures, transparent communications and a strategy to monitor and continuously improve NMAP are essential components of any plan seeking to demonstrate the MIG\u0092s effective stewardship of the resources provided by Congress."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the CMS Administrator ensure that the MIG\u0092s (1) update of its comprehensive plan provide key details about the NMAP, including its expenditures and audit outcomes, program improvements, and plans for effectively monitoring the program; (2) future annual reports to Congress clearly address the strengths and weaknesses of the audit program and its effectiveness; and (3) use of NMAP contractors supports and expands states\u0092 own program integrity efforts through collaborative audits.

At the federal level, CMS  is responsible for oversight of the Medicaid program. Until the Deficit  Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA), Medicaid program integrity had been  primarily a state responsibility. The DRA created the Medicaid Integrity  Program to oversee and support state efforts and, among other actions,  directed CMS to hire contractors to review and audit state Medicaid  claims data, which CMS calls the National Medicaid Audit Program  (NMAP).

In its written  comments, HHS stated that we had not appropriately recognized the  progress CMS has made in evaluating and improving the Medicaid  Integrity Program, which included the agency\u2019s redesign of NMAP.  Collaborative audits were the core of that redesign. HHS described  CMS\u2019s redesign approach as a phased one in which not all elements had  been finalized when the agency announced the redesign in its June 2011  annual report to Congress (covering fiscal year 2010). HHS also  commented that we did not fully describe the reasons for CMS\u2019s use of  MSIS data. HHS partially concurred with our first recommendation and  fully concurred with the other two recommendations. HHS\u2019s comments  are reproduced in appendix IV."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "General Comments", "paragraphs": ["Although we characterized collaborative audits as a promising new  approach, HHS commented that we (1) did not acknowledge that CMS  had presented its rationale for the NMAP redesign in the agency\u2019s June  2011 annual report to the Congress, and (2) inappropriately criticized  CMS for not including other redesign details in its report, which HHS said  had not yet been finalized. We continue to believe that a full articulation of  the redesign should include transparent reporting of the results of the  MSIS audits. However, we agree that the June 2011 report, which was  released 18 months after the initiation of collaborative audits, described  their advantages\u2014use of better data, augmenting state resources, and  providing analytic support for states lacking that capability. Regarding the  use of MSIS data, HHS stated that we do not fully describe CMS\u2019s reason  for its use or acknowledge that CMS sought alternative data sources to  supplement or replace MSIS data. We disagree because our report  provides CMS\u2019s reasons for using MSIS data, acknowledges CMS\u2019s  awareness of the MSIS data limitations, and discusses its Transformed  MSIS project to improve the quality of MSIS data. In addition, we pointed  out that officials in 13 of the 16 states we contacted volunteered that they  were willing to provide CMS with their own more complete and timely  MMIS data. We agree with HHS\u2019s comment that not all of CMS\u2019s plans for  the redesign may have been complete at the time the June 2011 annual  report to Congress was being finalized and therefore could not have been  included in that report. We have revised this report to acknowledge that  some of the elements of the redesign may not have been initiated until  after the June 2011 report was finalized."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments on Our Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["HHS agreed with two of three elements related to our first  recommendation regarding CMS\u2019s planned update of its Comprehensive  Medicaid Integrity Plan covering fiscal years 2013 to 2017. HHS agreed  that the planned update should (1) address any NMAP improvements  proposed by CMS, and (2) outline CMS\u2019s plans for effectively monitoring  the NMAP. HHS commented that CMS considers transparency of the  program\u2019s performance to be a top priority. However, HHS did not concur  that the update should quantify NMAP\u2019s expenditures and audit  outcomes; CMS considers such information to be more appropriately  presented in the annual reports to Congress, which already includes  dollar figures on annual expenditures for NMAP and overpayments  identified in each fiscal year. CMS\u2019s annual reports to Congress have  provided a snapshot of results that did not differentiate between the  effectiveness of the various audit approaches used. For example, in its  annual report covering fiscal year 2010, CMS reported that 947 audits  were underway in 45 states and that its contractors had identified  cumulative potential overpayments of about $10.7 million. Based on our  analysis of CMS\u2019s data, MSIS audits had only identified overpayments of  $2.4 million as of September 30, 2010. The remaining $8.4 million in  overpayments were identified during the test audit phase, in which states  identified the audit targets and supplied their own MMIS data. We  continue to believe that CMS should more fully report on NMAP  expenditures and audit outcomes in its annual reports and provide an  overall assessment of NMAP in its next comprehensive plan.", "HHS concurred with our recommendation that CMS should clearly  address NMAPs strengths, weaknesses, and effectiveness in the  agency\u2019s annual reports to Congress. HHS noted that in CMS\u2019s   December 7, 2011 congressional testimony the agency had reported its  awareness of the limitations of MSIS data and outlined steps to improve  contractors\u2019 access to better quality Medicaid data. HHS also concurred  with our recommendation that CMS\u2019s use of NMAP contractors should  support and expand states\u2019 own audit activities, engage other willing  states, and explicitly consider state burden when conducting collaborative  audits. HHS reported that since February 2012 CMS had increased the  number of collaborative audits by 25\u2014from 112 audits in 11 states to 137  in 15 states. Based on HHS comments, we made technical changes as  appropriate.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
