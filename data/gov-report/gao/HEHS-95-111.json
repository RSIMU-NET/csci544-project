These people included families with children who are deprived of support; households that need help buying food basics; and the low-income aged, blind, or disabled. That same year, however, people or households who were ineligible for these benefits, or who were not entitled to the level of benefits provided, received nearly $4.7 billion in AFDC, Food Stamp, and Medicaid benefit overpayments or about 4 percent of the total benefits paid in the three programs.", "Program administrators try to prevent overpayments by carefully determining an applicant\u2019s initial eligibility. However, when errors are made, recovering overpayments is often very time consuming and difficult. Nationwide success in recovering these overpayments varies considerably among the three programs. While states recovered about $215.6 million of nearly $1.2 billion of AFDC overpayments, or about 18.7 percent, in fiscal year 1992, the recovery rate was appreciably lower for the other two programs. In this same year, almost $104.3 million of about $1.6 billion of Food Stamp overpayments, or about 6.5 percent, was recovered; while about $13.2 million, or nearly 2 percent, of an estimated $670.6 million of overpayments was recovered in the Medicaid program.", "When states do not promptly and efficiently identify and collect overpayments, governments lose the immediate use of these funds and incur additional expenses to recover them. Without a vigorous recovery effort, current and potential recipients may infer that the government considers the unrecovered funds dispensable. Under the legislative welfare reform proposals that the Congress is considering, resources available to help low-income Americans may become increasingly limited. Therefore, ensuring that the funds appropriated for these programs reach only those entitled to them is crucial.", "The Ranking Minority Member of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, asked us to determine (1) what states are doing to collect benefit overpayments in the AFDC, Food Stamp, and Medicaid programs; the more effective practices that they are using; and what, if anything, they could do better; and (2) what the federal government could do to help states collect more overpayments."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Government and States Share Responsibility for Three Large Welfare Programs", "paragraphs": ["Each year, the AFDC, Food Stamp, and Medicaid programs provide cash and other assistance to millions of economically disadvantaged persons.

The Food Stamp Program, authorized by the 1964 Food Stamp Act, provided about $21 billion in food coupons to more than 25.4 million recipients to help them buy food to meet their nutritional needs. And the Medicaid program, authorized by title XIX of the Social Security Act, paid about $118 billion in 1992 for medical services for more than 30 million low-income persons who are aged, blind, or disabled; AFDC recipients; and other low-income persons."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Government Oversees State Administration of Programs", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is responsible for the AFDC Program; HHS\u2019 Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) oversees administration of the Medicaid Program; and the Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Food and Consumer Service (FCS) oversees the Food Stamp Program.", "ACF\u2019s, FCS\u2019, and HCFA\u2019s oversight responsibility supports program operation at the state level. These agencies develop and issue regulations on general eligibility and benefit criteria, provide technical assistance and guidance to the states, and help monitor state performance through quality control systems. Under these systems, states must review a sample of their cases each month to assess the accuracy of their staffs\u2019 eligibility and benefit determination decisions. In turn, federal quality control reviewers from ACF, FCS, and HCFA assess the correctness of state findings by evaluating a subsample of the state samples. Differences between the state and federal findings are reconciled to calculate an official state error rate. If the error rate is greater than a program\u2019s targeted error rate\u2014for example, 3 percent in the case of Medicaid\u2014then federal payments may be reduced by an amount calculated on the basis of the percentage point difference between the actual and target error rate. The error rate is also used to estimate the total dollar value of estimated overpayments for the state.", "The federal government and states both provide funding for AFDC, Food Stamps, and Medicaid. The federal government pays from 50 to about 80 percent of benefit costs for AFDC and Medicaid and 50 percent of most administrative costs of those programs.

Depending upon the state, these staff may be determining eligibility and benefit levels for one or all three programs.", "The three programs\u2019 eligibility rules and income tests are complex and differ from one another; so, although all three programs take into account assets, household income, and size, the extent to which they do so varies. For example, in determining an applicant\u2019s eligibility under AFDC in fiscal year 1995, staff generally exclude the first $1,500 in equity value of an applicant\u2019s automobile and count the remainder in determining available financial resources; under Medicaid, depending upon the type of applicant, staff exclude the first $1,500 in equity value or $4,500 in fair market value and, in certain cases, may exclude all of the value; and, under Food Stamps, staff exclude the first $4,550 in fair market value and, in some cases, may exclude all of the fair market value. A requirement that clients notify the staff when their income changes further complicates eligibility determinations. Staff must then use three sets of eligibility criteria to recalculate benefit levels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overpayments Occur for Several Reasons", "paragraphs": ["Given the complexity and diversity of eligibility rules among the three welfare programs, ineligible clients sometimes receive benefits or medical services or eligible clients sometimes receive more benefits than they are entitled to. Overpayments generally result when (1) a participating household or individual intentionally provides incorrect or insufficient information on which eligibility and benefit determinations are based (fraud), (2) a participating household or individual unintentionally provides incorrect or insufficient information (client error), or (3) the administering state agency miscalculates eligibility or benefits or does not correctly act on client-reported information (agency error)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Are Responsible for Recovering Overpayments", "paragraphs": ["Regardless of the cause of overpayments, state AFDC and Food Stamp offices are responsible for (1) preventing and identifying overpayments, (2) verifying potential overpayments and establishing claims for them, and (3) collecting overpayments. While no federal goals exist for states to recover a minimum percentage of their overpayments, federal legislation generally requires states to try to recover them in these two programs. Although state Medicaid offices\u2019 overpayment responsibilities are similar to those for the other two programs, under Medicaid law, the focus is on recovering overpayments to providers of medical services rather than the recipients of services. States may, but are not required to, recover funds from ineligible Medicaid clients when overpayments to providers are made in their behalf. In 1992, as a result of state law or policy, most states attempted to recover overpayments due to errors from Medicaid clients, including long-term care clients who received nursing home services to which they were not entitled.", "States use a variety of methods, including computer matching and quality control reviews, to help prevent overpayments and to identify overpayments. The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 requires states to routinely compare data supplied by applicants and clients of AFDC, Food Stamps, and Medicaid with other data sources in search of discrepancies. These other data sources include (1) Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data on interest, dividends, and other types of unearned income; (2) Social Security Administration data on benefits and earnings; and (3) state reports on quarterly wages and unemployment insurance benefits. States may also identify overpayments when they conduct their monthly quality control reviews of individual cases or verify an individual\u2019s alien status.", "After identifying a possible overpayment, the next step is to verify the overpayment. Because one key factor in determining eligibility and benefit levels is a household\u2019s or an individual\u2019s financial information, this may involve contacting the client\u2014or his or her employer\u2014to obtain wage statements to compare with the information originally provided by the client. Once the overpayment is verified, states establish a claim for it by entering a record in the state client billing and tracking system. By regulation, however, states are not required to pursue every overpayment. For example, both the AFDC and Food Stamp programs give states the option of not pursuing a nonfraudulent overpayment of less than $35 if it cannot be collected by reducing the individual\u2019s or household\u2019s benefit. Under existing waiver authority, FCS has increased the less than $35 threshold to less than $100 for some states.", "After establishing a claim for collection, states then send a written notice to the current or former client who received the overpayment advising him or her of the amount owed, explaining how the overpayment occurred, and requesting repayment. Federal law and regulations allow states to collect AFDC overpayments by offsetting a portion of current clients\u2019 benefits (recoupment) without their consent and do not distinguish between the types of overpayment (agency or client error). However, the Food Stamp Program can recoup for agency errors only if the client voluntarily agrees to such recoupment. In addition, states must first allow clients with client error overpayments to repay them by lump sum or installment payments. States can use recoupment if the client chooses recoupment to repay a client error claim or if the client fails to pay the claim using the method chosen. If the state determines that collection action through any of these payment methods would cause undue hardship for the client, collections can be suspended or repayment amounts reduced.", "States have several other alternatives available to collect overpayments. Depending upon the program, they may garnish wages or intercept federal or state income tax refunds or state lottery winnings. States may also refer cases to collection agencies, report client debt to credit bureaus, use a small claims court, or place liens against a client\u2019s property to collect the outstanding debt.", "All three programs allow states to retain a portion of the overpayments they recover. For AFDC and Medicaid, states keep an amount equal to the proportion of the benefits they originally provided in matching funds\u2014from about 20 to 50 percent\u2014regardless of the type of overpayment error. Although Food Stamp benefits are paid entirely by the federal government, states get to keep a portion of the overpayments that they recover. Currently, state agencies retain 25 percent of recovered Food Stamp overpayments due to client fraud, 10 percent for those due to client error, and nothing for those due to agency error."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implications of Welfare Reform on Recovering Overpayments", "paragraphs": ["As the Congress discusses various approaches to serving AFDC, Food Stamp, and Medicaid clients, some members are proposing restructuring these programs to give states more flexibility in administering them. While federal agencies currently oversee various aspects of these programs, states may find, under reform, that they must assume more\u2014or even all\u2014administrative and oversight responsibility. AFDC, Food Stamps, and Medicaid are entitlement programs: no limit exists on the amount of federal funding a state can receive since every person who is determined to be eligible must receive benefits. Under a block grant approach, however, states would receive a capped, defined amount of money.

The timely establishment of overpayment claims for collection is important because, once clients discontinue receiving program benefits and overpayments can no longer be recouped, collection can be more difficult.", "Another practice used by high-performing states was to establish claims for the more difficult collection cases, such as former clients who have moved out of state, provided no forwarding addresses, declared bankruptcy, or died.

Further, these states dedicated a greater portion of their total staff to recovering overpayments, including using recovery specialists and fraud investigators where appropriate.

The legislation, part of a welfare reform proposal introduced in the 103rd Congress, would have authorized an intercept program for AFDC overpayments. Commenting on this proposal, officials from the Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Service cited the need to revise the proposal\u2019s language so that HHS\u2019 ACF would be the focal point for working with IRS. This would lessen the administrative burden on IRS because it could deal with one entity rather than 50 states and the District of Columbia. This approach would more closely resemble the Food Stamp intercept program, which uses FCS as its focal point.", "In addition to new legislation for AFDC and Medicaid, legislative and regulatory change would be needed to achieve the full potential of the Food Stamp federal income tax intercept program. FCS officials told us that since they piloted the demonstration project, they have recruited additional states each year on the basis of the states\u2019 willingness to devote the staff and computer resources to implement the program. In its 1995 package of legislative recommendations to update Food Stamp legislation, USDA recommended a legislative change that would require all states to use the federal income tax refund intercept. Such a provision is contained in the recently passed House of Representatives\u2019 welfare reform bill, H.R. 4.", "According to FCS officials, USDA also has drafted a regulatory change that would remove the program from its demonstration project status and fully authorize federal income tax refund intercept to collect client error overpayments. FCS officials told us that the decision to limit the federal income tax refund intercept to only overpayments caused by client error was a reaction to the failure of a 1994 legislative proposal to extend tax intercept to agency error overpayments. In commenting on a draft of this report, however, USDA stated that, as part of its evaluation of efforts needed to ensure that agency error claims are treated the same as client error claims, it is again considering the referral of agency error claims for federal tax intercept."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Extending Federal Tax Intercept Could Potentially Recover Substantial Overpayments", "paragraphs": ["If the federal income tax refund intercept program were extended to the AFDC and Medicaid programs, we estimate that overpayment collections could potentially be increased $23.6 million annually.

Further, all of the ACF officials we interviewed believed that states may have to \u201cwait in line\u201d behind other programs already using federal income tax refund intercepts to collect from the same clients.

With the Food and Consumer Service\u2019s (FCS) continued sharing of state recovery information and best recovery practices and the Administration for Children and Families\u2019 (ACF) plans to do so soon, states have an opportunity to improve their recovery efforts in the AFDC and Food Stamp programs.", "Moreover, states could improve their ability to recover more overpayments if the Congress would remove certain federal legislative barriers to collection and recovery techniques. Specifically, states could run more fiscally sound welfare programs if (1) limits on offsetting Food Stamp benefits to recover Food Stamp overpayments arising from agency error were removed and (2) authority to use federal income tax refund intercepts was extended to AFDC and Medicaid overpayments. While providing states these additional tools will not end overpayments in these welfare programs, it would provide states additional opportunities to recover overpayments.", "Managing the three welfare programs\u2019 funds\u2014including identifying, establishing, and collecting overpayments\u2014is critical to the programs\u2019 integrity, regardless of how they may be structured or administered after the welfare reform debate.

While some states may aggressively pursue agency error claims, USDA does not believe that involuntary recoupment alone would generate the added incentive to achieve the additional agency error collections we estimated.", "We do not believe our estimate of additional agency error collections is overly optimistic. While we agree that states have a clear incentive to devote their limited resources to collecting client error overpayments, we also believe that states would have a continued interest to recover overpayments caused by agency errors. First, by law, states are required to establish claims for, and attempt to collect, all types of overpayments. Collecting all types of overpayments helps maintain program integrity. Second, as noted in the report, our survey results suggest that most states would favor a federal requirement to recover agency error overpayments, such as involuntary recoupment, because it would increase their ability to collect such overpayments.
