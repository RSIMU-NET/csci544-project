Based on its evaluation, FAA committed to using one in the near term and to continue to study another for future use. Specifically, in April 2019, FAA committed to implement by 2022 new international standards that allow reduced distances between aircraft, called minimum separation standards. These reduced distances would be enabled by a surveillance technology known as enhanced Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Contract (ADS-C). FAA also decided to continue studying the use of another enhanced surveillance technology known as space-based Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B)\u2014to further improve surveillance in U.S. airspace. Both technologies offer increased frequency in reporting of an aircraft's location, which enhances safety, and can support new minimum separation standards. FAA decided to proceed with enhanced ADS-C in the near term because the efficiency benefits to airspace users exceeded the costs of more frequent location reporting and air traffic control system upgrades by 2 to 1. In contrast, FAA determined that the costs of using space-based ADS-B in U.S. oceanic airspace outweigh the efficiency benefits by 6 to 1. FAA officials added that operational challenges to using space-based ADS-B to manage air traffic in U.S. oceanic airspace have not yet been resolved. FAA plans to continue studying potential uses for space-based ADS-B in U.S. airspace to determine if benefits can outweigh the costs (see figure).", "GAO found that most selected airlines (11 of 14) support FAA's overall approach to enhance oceanic surveillance. Selected airlines also said they expect the new minimum separation standards to improve access to more direct and fuel-efficient routes. FAA is taking steps to provide these benefits by restructuring routes in one area of U.S. oceanic airspace and by applying new minimum standards to give aircraft better access to fuel-efficient altitudes. According to FAA officials, however, additional benefits, such as redesigning other U.S. oceanic airspace, expected by selected airlines are limited by (1) relatively low rates of aircraft equipage with the technology that enables reduced separation and (2) the frequency of disruptive weather patterns in parts of U.S. oceanic airspace."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the past decade, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has  provided air traffic control services to over 18 million flights traversing the  airspace above the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic oceans.

According to FAA officials, these  costs were not included because aircraft operators are equipping their  aircraft for other reasons. Specifically, FAA regulations requiring ADS-B  equipment for aircraft flying through U.S. domestic airspace by 2020  means most aircraft flying in U.S. oceanic airspace will be ADS-B  equipped.

The three efficiency benefits included in FAA\u2019s business  case analysis that were monetized are:  Improved accommodation of altitude requests. According to FAA\u2019s  analysis, a primary benefit of reduced separation standards is that  aircraft will be more likely to fly at a fuel-efficient altitude. In oceanic  airspace, aircraft must make a request to air traffic control to change  their altitude. Despite the immensity of oceanic airspace, there is  competition for the most fuel-efficient altitudes at certain times of day.  For example, according to oceanic air traffic controllers in Oakland,  the majority of the air traffic they handle is flights between Hawaii and  the U.S. west coast, with most aircraft departing at the same time. Air  traffic controllers we spoke with agreed that with enhanced  surveillance and reduced separation standards, they should be able to  grant more altitude requests and allow more aircraft to fly at optimal  altitudes.", "Reduced need for aircraft to carry extra fuel. According to FAA\u2019s  analysis, aircraft operators typically carry more fuel on an aircraft than  needed to fly their planned route. Aircraft carry extra fuel to hedge  against the possibility that its actual flight path will be less fuel-efficient  than its planned flight path. The cost of carrying extra fuel (i.e., the  cost to carry) comes from the added weight of carrying extra fuel,  weight that causes an aircraft to use more fuel and that reduces an  aircraft\u2019s ability to carry revenue-generating cargo. This benefit flows  from the improved accommodation of altitude requests, discussed  above.", "More efficient arrivals and departures at Pacific island airports.", "According to FAA\u2019s analysis, some Pacific island airports do not have  radar surveillance and require U.S. oceanic air traffic controllers in the  Oakland air route traffic control center to manage aircraft arrivals and  departures. As a result, oceanic separation standards are applied as  aircraft arrive and depart these islands\u2019 airports. FAA\u2019s analysis shows  that reducing oceanic separation minimums will allow air traffic  controllers to allow more frequent arrivals and departures from these  airports. According to this analysis, the benefit of more frequent  arrivals and departures is measured in terms of the costs to aircraft  operators (an aircraft\u2019s direct operating costs) and the cost to  passengers (a passenger\u2019s value of time).", "FAA\u2019s business case analysis also includes efficiency benefits of reduced  separation that were not monetized, including emissions savings and  improved air traffic control accommodation of aircraft requests for  descents, routing changes, and speed changes. FAA policy does not  currently allow programs to value carbon dioxide emissions avoided for  investment decisions. Another efficiency benefit of reduced separation\u2014 giving air traffic controllers more flexibility to grant deviations from  planned flight paths due to disruptive weather\u2014was quantified and  monetized, but not factored into the benefit calculation."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s 18 Critical Milestones to Implement a New Separation Standard", "paragraphs": ["To implement new separation standards in U.S. oceanic airspace, the  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a set of 18 critical milestones  that it follows:  1.
