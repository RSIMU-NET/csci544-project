Subsequently, effective January 1, 2005, the rules related to the amount taxpayers can claim as a deduction on their tax returns for vehicles donated to charities changed. Under the new rules, in many cases the amount taxpayers are allowed to claim as a deduction is less than they could have claimed before the changes. Some charities that used vehicle donations as a revenue source said that the changes could lead to fewer donated vehicles and reduced revenues. GAO was asked to determine how charities have been affected by the 2005 changes. GAO discussed the rule changes with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) officials and the impact of the changes with representatives of several charities. GAO judgmentally selected 10 charities from among the 65 contacted in the course of the 2003 GAO study. The experiences of these charities cannot be generalized to all charities because the selected charities were not drawn from a statistical sample of all charities with vehicle donation programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The selected charities GAO contacted reported mixed experiences after the rules for claiming a tax deduction for donating a vehicle were changed. Prior to the law change, taxpayers could claim estimated fair market value for any donated vehicle. However, beginning January 1, 2005, taxpayers are generally limited to deducting only the sales price of the vehicle when a donated vehicle is sold by the charity. The 10 charities GAO contacted reported varied experiences in the number of, quality of, and revenue from donated vehicles; some changes in their business operations; and mixed experiences with administering the changes in the rules. Of these 10 charities, when comparing 2003 to 2006, 6 reported decreases in the number of vehicles donated and some of these decreases were substantial. Also, 3 charities reported an increase, and 1 did not provide data. Three reported an increase in quality, 3 a decrease, and 4 no change. Six reported a decrease in vehicle donation revenue from 2003 to 2006, 3 an increase, and 1 did not provide data. GAO did not find a consistent pattern when comparing the number of donated vehicles with the revenue from the vehicle donation program or a charity's overall revenue. In response to the rule changes, some charities changed their fund-raising activities and some decreased services, such as reducing the hours for providing services. Examples of business operations changes include using minimum bids at auctions, selling vehicles online, and selling vehicles directly to the public instead of through wholesalers. Finally, all 10 reported increased administrative burden due to increased reporting requirements, but they were able to accommodate the increase in paperwork."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Vehicle donation programs are important sources of income for some  charities, with many of these charities selling the donated vehicles and  using the proceeds for their charitable purposes. In 2003, we found that  many taxpayers\u2019 estimates of the value of their vehicles, claimed as tax  deductions, were far in excess of the proceeds of charities\u2019 subsequent  sales of the vehicles. Subsequently, Congress changed the rules so that  beginning in 2005, deductions for vehicles donated and then sold by the  charities were to be limited to the gross sales price of the vehicle with  some exceptions. Some charities were concerned that this would lead to  fewer vehicle donations and less revenue for the charities to use in pursuit  of their missions.", "Because of your interest in the effect of the vehicle donation rule changes,  you asked us to determine how charities have been affected by the 2005  changes to the amounts donors can claim on their tax returns for donated  vehicles.

In  addition, we attempted to contact the 65 charities we interviewed for our  November 2003 report about the vehicle donation process. We reached 58  of these charities and determined which of them still operated vehicle  donation programs as of August 2007, if they used contractors to operate  the programs, and approximately how many donated vehicles they  received in 2006 or 2007. We selected 10 of these charities that still  operated programs and 1 that no longer operated a program and  conducted in-depth interviews with charity officials to obtain their views  about how they were affected by the changes in the amounts donors could  claim on their tax returns. To ensure that we obtained the views of  officials who operated a wide variety of vehicle donation programs, we  selected, based on the results of our initial screening contacts, charities  that did and did not use the exceptions to the gross proceeds of sale rule  and charities that used or did not use contractors to operate their vehicle  donation programs. Also, our screening contacts indicated that some  charities had vehicle donation programs that increased, stayed about the  same, or decreased in terms of the number of donated vehicles in 2006 or  2007 in comparison to 2002, and we selected a similar mix of charities for  our in-depth interviews. The information provided by charity officials is  anecdotal and cannot be generalized to other charities that operate vehicle  donation programs.

The new rules were effective  for all vehicle donations made after December 31, 2004. Prior to this  change, eligible taxpayers could claim up to the fair market value of the  donated vehicle as a deduction on their tax returns. For any vehicles  donated to a charity on January 1, 2005, or later with a claimed value that  exceeds $500, taxpayers can only claim the lesser of the vehicle\u2019s fair  market value or gross proceeds of the sale as a deduction on their tax  returns unless the charity\u2019s intended use of the donated vehicle meets one  of the three exceptions to the gross proceeds of the sale rule. If one of the  exceptions is met, the taxpayer may be eligible to claim the fair market  value of the vehicle as a deduction. The three exceptions are  the charity intends to make a significant intervening use of the vehicle;  the charity intends to make a material improvement to the vehicle; or  the charity intends to give or sell the vehicle to a needy individual at a  price significantly below fair market value in direct furtherance of the  charity\u2019s charitable purpose.", "If the charity sells the vehicle for $500 or less and the exceptions do not  apply, the taxpayer can deduct the lesser of $500 or the vehicle\u2019s fair  market value on the date of the contribution.

The vehicle donation process is depicted in figure 1.", "Step 1 \u2013 Solicitation/donor contact. The vehicle donation process  generally begins with solicitations for donated vehicles through  advertisements. Vehicle donations may be solicited directly by charities,  third-party agents, or both, depending on the agreement between the  charities and third-party agents. Vehicle donations are solicited through  advertisements on the radio, in newspapers, on the Internet, on truck  banners, on television, and on billboards. Also during this step, donors  initiate contact with the charity and or third-party agent to donate their  vehicles. Either a charity or third-party agent may take the initial call from  a potential donor, asking the donor questions that may be used to screen  vehicles, such as the vehicle\u2019s make, year, and condition and if the donor  has the title to the vehicle.", "Step 2 \u2013 Vehicle pickup. After the donor makes the initial call to donate a  vehicle, arrangements are made to pick up the vehicle and deliver it to  wherever it will be stored until it is sold. Once vehicles are picked up, the  charity or third-party agent also obtains the title of the vehicle from the  donor.", "Step 3 \u2013 Vehicle sale. Once collected, donated vehicles are most often  sold. Charities or third-party agents typically sell donated vehicles through  auctions to auto dealers, to the public, or to vehicle salvagers.", "Step 4 \u2013 Distribution of proceeds. After vehicles have been liquidated, the  proceeds are distributed. Charities with in-house vehicle donation  programs keep proceeds that remain after deducting costs associated with  processing the vehicles. When charities use third-party agents, the  financial agreement between the charity and the third-party agent dictates  the proceeds that the charity and fund-raiser will receive from the sale.", "Step 5 \u2013 Charity provides donor with written acknowledgment. Charities  are required to provide a contemporaneous written acknowledgment to  the taxpayer for any contribution of a vehicle with a claimed value that  exceeds $500. The charity can either create its own acknowledgment, or it  can use Copy B of Form 1098-C (Contributions of Motor Vehicles, Boats,  and Airplanes) as the contemporaneous written acknowledgment. For  details about the information that must be included in the written  acknowledgment, including contributions with a claimed value of $500 or  less, see appendix IV.", "Step 6 \u2013 Charity and donor filing requirements. The charity must file a  Form 1098-C if a donor contributes a qualified vehicle to a charity with a  claimed value of more than $500. Charities are not to file Form 1098-C for  contributions of qualified vehicles with a claimed value of $500 or less.  Donors must attach Copy B of Form 1098-C, or a copy of the  acknowledgment if the charity does not use Copy B for this purpose, to  their returns if they are claiming a deduction of more than $500. A donor  must also file Form 8283 (Noncash Charitable Contributions) if the  deduction he/she is claiming for a donated vehicle is greater than $500 and  attach it to the Form 1040 (U.S. Individual Income Tax Return).

Through these contacts, we learned that all but 5 of the 58 charities still  operated vehicle donation programs. During these contacts, we asked  about changes in the numbers of vehicles being donated before and after  the rule changes. Not all of the charities in our screening interviews  provided information about the number of donated vehicles; 30 charities  gave us this information and 21 of them said that they had seen a decrease,  and the rest said that they saw increases or no change.

The official said that by reallocating the resources that had  been devoted to the vehicle program, the charity could raise more money  by focusing on obtaining large donations from selected donors for its fund- raising campaign. At the remaining four charities that no longer had  vehicle donation programs, officials told us either that the employees who  used to operate the vehicle donation program no longer worked for the  charity and no other program officials could speak about the decision to  discontinue the program or that the charity has not received any vehicles  for the past 2 to 3 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Selected Charities Reported Substantial Declines in Number of Vehicles Donated and Had Varied Experiences with the Quality of Vehicles Donated", "paragraphs": ["For the 10 charities covered in our in-depth interviews, 6 reported  decreases from 2003 to 2006 in the number of vehicles donated, 3 reported  increases and 1 did not provide data, as shown in table 2; however, the  latter reported that the number of donated vehicles is about the same  since the rule change. One charity\u2019s donations declined by over 37,000  vehicles, while others realized much smaller decreases ranging from about  350 to 600 vehicles when comparing 2003 and 2006 data. However, when  comparing years 2005 to 2006, 4 of the 5 charities that reported using one  of the exceptions to the gross proceeds of sale rule reported an increase in  the number of vehicles donated. It is important to note that not all of the  vehicles donated to a charity that can use one of the exceptions to the  gross proceeds of sale rule are eligible for the exception. For example, a  charity that gives donated vehicles to needy individuals in direct  furtherance of its charitable purpose may sell some of the donated  vehicles it receives. The vehicles given to needy individuals are eligible for  the exception, but the vehicles that are sold to non-needy individuals are  not.", "All of the six officials who reported a decrease in the number of vehicles  donated to their charities attributed this decrease, at least in part, to the  change in the rules. Some charity officials noted other factors that also  may have affected the number of vehicles donated. For example, officials  at two charities noted that there is more competition in the marketplace  for donated vehicles. An official at another charity noted that vehicle  donations often follow the trends in new vehicle sales, and if people are  not buying as many new vehicles, they are less likely to donate vehicles.  An official at a different charity said that she could not attribute reduced  donations fully to the rule changes because the charity had decreased its  advertising of the vehicle donation program over the past few years.", "Charity experiences with the quality of donated vehicles also varied. Three  of the 10 charities reported an increase in quality, 3 charities reported a  decrease in quality, and 4 charities reported no change in the quality of  vehicles donated. One of the charities that uses one of the exceptions to  the gross proceeds of sale rule reported that the quality of donated  vehicles generally increased and more of these vehicles could be  refurbished and given to needy individuals. The official said that in 2002  the charity was only able to refurbish about 75 vehicles to give to clients  while the charity gave away about 200 vehicles to clients in 2006. An  official at another charity noted that the quality of the vehicles may be  related to the demographics of the areas where the charity operates. In  one area of the state, the charity tends to receive higher-quality vehicles  because many of the area residents are retirees who are financially  comfortable and able to donate their old vehicles, which are still in good  condition, while donors in less-affluent parts of the state tend to donate  vehicles that need to go straight to salvage yards.", "Officials from eight charities said that they will take any vehicle in any  shape, although some charities stipulate that the cost to tow the vehicle  cannot be more than the value of the vehicle.

Previously, this charity operated a 24-hour facility targeted at  single men and women, but now the charity only operates the facility in  the evenings. This same charity instituted a hiring freeze and has  postponed or canceled staff merit pay increases because of the loss in  revenue.

The charity takes the chance  that the vehicles will not sell and it will have to reclaim them at the end of  the auction. This practice helps ensure that the charity will receive the  minimum sale amount for each vehicle at some point. The charity also  sends a representative to the auction to oversee the vehicle sales. The  charity official said that his organization found that it got better prices  when it directly oversaw the auction than when it left the whole process to  the auction house.", "One charity that provides services to needy persons has sold high-end  vehicles on online auction sites such as eBay rather than giving them to  needy individuals. Since high-end vehicles tend to have higher upkeep  prices, the charity was concerned that the needy families would not be  able to fix the vehicles if they broke down. Instead, the charity sells these  vehicles at an online auction and uses the money in its program. This  allows the charity to obtain more revenue than at a wholesale auction,  since the general public is bidding on the vehicle, not just wholesale  buyers.", "One of the charities we interviewed said that in response to the rule  changes, it began operating a used car lot at the end of 2005.

For example, an official at one charity stated,  \u201cit takes time to fill out the Forms 1098-C and to prepare the  acknowledgment that is sent to the donors. We have to keep track of each  sale in order to provide the sale information to the donor. The donor  cannot claim a deduction until the vehicle is sold.\u201d The official also noted  that although it was a burden, the charity has been able to handle the  increase in paperwork. An official at another charity noted that the money  spent on donor mailings has increased because the charity sends out a  donor package with explanations of how the vehicle will be used and the  acknowledgment for the donation and then must also send the Form 1098- C to the donor. According to the official, the paperwork has quadrupled  but the charity can handle it. An official at a different charity stated that  although it now has to file the Form 1098-C, the charity has also become  more efficient at using technology and can therefore handle the increase in  paperwork.", "Six of the charities we interviewed reported difficulties with obtaining  Social Security numbers from donors, while some of the others  experienced few or no problems.

During 2005 and 2006, IRS issued  additional news releases, notices, and publications related to charitable  contributions of vehicles including the following:  Issued a notice in June 2005 that described the new rules, including that  the deduction is limited to the gross proceeds of the sale with some  exceptions; what the exceptions are and that when an exception applies,  the donor may claim the fair market value of the vehicle; what information  must be included in the acknowledgment charities send to donors; and  what charities must report to IRS.  Issued a news release in December 2005 reminding taxpayers that they  must obtain a charity\u2019s written acknowledgment of their vehicle donation  and that if the deduction is for more than $500, they must attach the  acknowledgment to their tax return.  Issued a notice in January 2006 that describes the information reporting  requirements for charities.  Issued a revised publication for donors in February 2006 that describes  how much they can deduct, how their deduction is generally limited to the  gross proceeds of the sale unless an exception applies, what the  exceptions are, how to determine fair market value if they are entitled to  claim fair market value, when an appraisal is required, and what  documents must be attached to their returns.", "Issued a revised publication for charities in May 2006 that describes  charities\u2019 responsibilities in relation to vehicle donations, including what  must be included in an acknowledgment and when it must be sent to the  donor, guidance about using the exceptions to the gross proceeds of the  sale rule, and what information must be reported to IRS and when it must  be provided.

IRS management  disagreed with this recommendation because they believe the actions IRS  was taking in response to a similar recommendation in an earlier TIGTA  report, related to noncash contributions that did not cover vehicle  donations, would address the new reporting requirement for vehicle  donations. TIGTA disagreed with IRS management\u2019s response because  the deficient returns included in TIGTA\u2019s sample were filed after IRS  provided outreach to the public. TIGTA agreed that taking additional  actions to publicize reporting requirements for noncash contributions may  address the new reporting requirements for vehicle deductions but added  that the outreach efforts must specifically emphasize that the  documentation requirements for donated vehicles are different than those  for other noncash contributions.

Using this  information and because of limited compliance resources, officials of that  office said that they determined that issues other than vehicle donations  had a higher priority. In addition, in July 2007, the TE/GE Commissioner  testified that IRS is focusing on noncash contributions, but the problems  are greatest for noncash contributions for which there is no ready market.

They  concluded that the high rate of no change cases and the low audit results  in terms of dollars indicated that vehicle donations were not conducive for  correspondence examinations.

Currently, IRS is not developing a special compliance initiative for vehicle  donations. However, in response to a TIGTA recommendation, IRS is  adding an audit indicator to returns claiming charitable deductions for  donated vehicles over a specific dollar threshold that did not have Form  8283 (Noncash Charitable Contributions) attached. Thus, according to the  SB/SE official, if a tax return is selected for an examination for other  reasons, the audit indicator will let examination staff know that they  should also look at the vehicle donation.", "Besides recommending that IRS add an audit indicator to certain returns  with vehicle donations, TIGTA also recommended in its September 2007  report on charitable donations of vehicles that IRS  lower the dollar threshold for reviewing returns with unsubstantiated  deductions for donated vehicles and    correspond with taxpayers to obtain missing documentation.", "IRS management responded that they consider vehicles a small subset of  the overall population of noncash charitable contributions, they will not  lower the threshold, and they will continue to correspond with taxpayers  who do not provide documentation if their noncash contribution is over a  specific dollar threshold. They also said that they are exploring alternative  ways to address lower-dollar vehicle donation compliance issues.   According to an SB/SE senior program analyst involved with exam policy,  IRS is revising Form 8453 (U.S. Individual Income Tax Declaration for an  IRS e-file Return). This form will be used to transmit supporting paper  documents that are required to be submitted to IRS by taxpayers who are  filing electronically. The Form 8453 will include a list of paper forms that  can be submitted with Form 8453. These will include Form 1098-C and  Form 8283. This should remind filers that they must file these forms with  IRS. TIGTA disagreed with IRS\u2019s policy of treating vehicles as a small  subset of the overall population of noncash contributions. In TIGTA\u2019s  opinion, since Congress specifically provided substantiation levels for  vehicles that were different than the requirements for other noncash  contributions, to ignore this when administering the tax law is not in  keeping with Congress\u2019s intent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our objective was to determine how charities have been affected by the  2005 changes to the amounts donors can claim on their tax returns for  donated vehicles. To address this objective, we reviewed the new vehicle  donation rules that became effective January 1, 2005, and compared them  to the previous vehicle donation rules. In addition, we contacted 58 of the  65 charities we interviewed for our November 2003 report about the  vehicle donation process, and determined which of these charities still  operated a vehicle donation program as of August 2007 and if they used a  contractor to operate the program. In our screening contacts, we also  asked about changes in the number of donated vehicles in 2006 or 2007 in  comparison to 2002. About half of the charities\u201430 out of the 58\u2014 provided a response to this question, and 21 of them said they had seen  decreases and the rest said they had seen increases or no change in  numbers of donated vehicles. We selected 10 of the 58 charities that still  operated programs and 1 that no longer operated a program and  interviewed officials to obtain their views about how the changes affected  the number and quality of donated vehicles, vehicle donation revenues,  their vehicle donation programs, and administrative burden. To ensure  that we obtained the views of officials who operated a wide variety of  vehicle donation programs, we selected charities that did and did not use  the exceptions to the gross proceeds of sale rule and charities that used or  did not use a contractor to operate their vehicle donation programs. The  charities we selected also reflected changes in the numbers of donated  vehicles from 2002 to 2006 or 2007 in similar proportion to what we found  in our screening contacts. The information provided by charity officials is  anecdotal and cannot be generalized to other charities that operate vehicle  donation programs.
