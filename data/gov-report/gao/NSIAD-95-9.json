However, as the Army was developing the plan, the world situation was changing. Evolving national military strategy expanded the Army\u2019s roles in national assistance, humanitarian assistance, counter-drug activities, peacekeeping operations, and counterterrorism. The focus of the national warfighting doctrine changed from a major European war to regional conflicts. The dependence on foreign-based U.S. troops was replaced by one of rapidly deploying U.S.-based troops overseas.", "The Army\u2019s total research, development, and acquisition budget declined by 36 percent for fiscal years 1990 through 1994. Army acquisition funding decreased about 50 percent during this time; however, research and development funding was more stable\u2014remaining in the $5 billion a year range.", "Army officials realized before the 1993 update to the Aviation Modernization Plan was issued that it would not reflect the global and budgetary changes taking place. Therefore, the Aviation Center at Fort Rucker, Alabama, began an effort with the intent of redesigning the aviation force structure to resolve the problems associated with downsizing and affordability. The resultant Army\u2019s Aviation Restructure Initiative was issued February 3, 1993.", "The current aviation modernization strategy is the product of the 1993 Aviation Modernization Plan and the Aviation Restructure Initiative. The objectives of the Army\u2019s modernization efforts were to (1) correct deficiencies in the Army\u2019s aviation force structure, particularly its reconnaissance and attack capabilities; (2) reduce aviation maintenance and support requirements; (3) reduce aviation operating costs; and (4) retire old aircraft. These objectives were to be achieved within anticipated funding levels. According to the Army, modern armed reconnaissance and attack helicopter capabilities are required to project a force worldwide and achieve battlefield dominance. A modernized Apache fleet and the Comanche, when fielded, would provide those capabilities.", "To carry out its modernization strategy, the Army intends to (1) procure about 1,300 Comanche helicopters, some with enhancements provided by the Army\u2019s Longbow program, (2) modify 761 existing Apaches with some or all of the Longbow upgrades, and (3) purchase approximately 350 Kiowa Warrior helicopters to use until the Comanche is introduced. The Army plans to spend $6.2 billion in research, development, and acquisition funds to modernize its helicopter fleet during fiscal years 1995-1999. Of that amount, $4.7 billion, approximately 76 percent, will be spent on the Comanche and the Longbow Apache helicopters, with which the Army intends to perform future reconnaissance and attack missions.", "The implementation of the strategy is scheduled to begin in fiscal year 1995 and is split into two phases. Design goals have been established for the interim time frame\u2014from initiation through the year 2015\u2014and for the objective force\u2014beyond the year 2015 when the Comanche is to be fully fielded. As of February 1993, the Army owned 7,914 helicopters, comprising 10 different types.

Regarding the Army\u2019s attack and reconnaissance fleet, the review concluded that the Army\u2019s modernization plan provided significant improvements and a balanced, deployable, and sustainable fleet. A group of outside experts evaluated the review\u2019s analysis and concluded that the Army\u2019s plan to acquire the Comanche and the Longbow Apache would provide significant improvements in both reconnaissance and attack capabilities. According to the review, the life-cycle cost estimate of this option was $75.6 billion. At the conclusion of the study, the Secretary of Defense endorsed the Army\u2019s aviation modernization strategy with the Comanche as its centerpiece.

The purpose of these interviews was to gain a balanced perspective on the requirements process from those at all organizational levels who are involved in its implementation. Officials that we talked to who were directly involved in the process of developing the requirement were located at the office of the Army\u2019s Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans; Assistant Secretary of the Army for Research, Development, and Acquisition; the offices responsible for developing requirements data for input to and preparation of the Warfighting Lens Analysis at the Army\u2019s Training and Doctrine Command; and offices responsible for preparing branch assessments, which reflect critical inputs to the requirements process such as threat analyses, doctrine, organizational structure, training, and equipment, at the Army Aviation Center at Fort Rucker, Alabama.", "We also talked to active unit commanders, pilots, and aviation maintenance personnel at the brigade, battalion, and squadron levels who provide input to the process and eventually implement the decisions the process produces. These individuals represented Force Package I and Force Package II units. Commanders and pilots in Force Package I units are those that deploy first and, therefore, require the highest level of equipment support and training. Commanders and pilots of Force  Package II units are those that immediately follow Force Package I units in a deployment.", "Because these units are among the first to enter a conflict, we believed that they would be keenly aware of the advantages and disadvantages of the systems they use in the missions they perform. Therefore, they could provide valuable insights into the current mission deficiencies in the Army\u2019s aviation systems and how the Army\u2019s planned strategy would address those deficiencies. This approach was especially important in our assessment of the Comanche\u2019s capabilities to correct deficiencies in the reconnaissance and light attack missions as there are no production representative prototypes to evaluate. We were able to obtain users\u2019 perceptions on how the requirements process responded to their observation on needed and unneeded capabilities in the Comanche helicopter.", "We also obtained documentation on the roles, missions, and doctrinal employment of helicopters and the results of previously conducted studies or tests that evaluated a helicopter\u2019s performance or its requirement.

We used this data to perform our own analysis of aviation requirements for several force structure options, including the 16-division option considered in the Bottom-Up Review.", "To determine if the Army considered alternative aircraft in developing its aviation modernization strategy, we interviewed key Army aviation officials and helicopter contractors involved in the aviation requirements setting and acquisition process. We developed a data collection instrument to obtain performance capabilities and specific mission information on various Army helicopters from both the Army and contractors, which we used for comparison purposes.

It recommended that the Army reduce its force structure to 10 active and approximately 5 reserve divisions by the end of fiscal year 1999.

For example, estimates of the number of Blackhawks and Kiowa Warriors changed as program decisions under the Aviation Modernization Plan and Restructure Initiative changed.

These inconsistencies resulted in DOD underestimating some of the helicopters it needs and overestimating others.", "For example, our analysis shows that using a 16-division force structure with the required number of 12 helicopters in the cavalry troop and eliminating the 2 extra attack battalions, the Army would need 1,378 Comanches.

If the Comanche is unable to meet this ambitious requirement, the operation and support costs associated with this system will significantly increase. In addition, maintenance personnel levels are programmed based partially on the maintenance man hours/flight hour requirement for the system.
