They include a formal institution with binding petroleum reserve obligations, regional associations, and informal gatherings designed to facilitate information exchange. Major forums include the International Energy Agency (IEA), the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Energy Working Group, the North American Energy Working Group, and the International Energy Forum. GAO identified three energy market issues that are important for U.S. efforts in international energy cooperation. First, a tighter energy market with higher, more volatile, prices has developed. This is due to (1) an unanticipated rise in energy demand and (2) constrained supply due to less spare crude oil production capacity and increased political frictions in certain supplier countries. Second, market participation of national oil and gas companies, which are majority owned by governments, has led to limitations on access to resources. Third, more reliable energy market information is needed to facilitate market stability and plan investment. The U.S. government has addressed these issues through its participation in international energy cooperation forums; however, the nature of the forums can limit their impact. Forums have restricted membership, consensus-based agendas and decisions, and voluntary participation. They generally focus on noncontroversial issues such as energy efficiency and technology. Within these constraints, the United States has tried to mitigate effects of tight markets by supporting emergency preparedness. It has not directly addressed the impact of national oil companies, but it has pursued related areas.

The main consumers of oil continue to be the advanced  economies. The United States, OECD Europe, and Japan together  account for about half of annual global oil consumption. However,  consumption in the major developing countries has generally been  increasing at a faster pace. China, in particular, has gained prominence  because its demand has grown so fast. One expert noted that China\u2019s  demand in 2004 rose by an extraordinary 16 percent compared with 2003  and served as a \u201cdemand shock,\u201d or unexpected surge in demand. From  2000 to 2004, total world demand for oil grew by about 8 percent,  increasing from nearly 77 million barrels per day to about 82 million  barrels per day. China\u2019s demand for oil rose by 33 percent over this period,  followed by India\u2019s growth in demand of 15 percent, while U.S. demand  increased by about 5 percent, and OECD Europe by about 2 percent.", "The data used to measure both oil demand and supply are subject to  limitations described later in this report, including lack of timeliness and  transparency, definitional inconsistencies, and national sensitivities. The  estimates provided represent the broad trends from the most current  market information used in forecasting and determining cost. Table 2  shows the top world consumers of oil\u2014countries that consumed more  than 2 million barrels per day\u2014with their level of demand and the  percentage change from 2000 to 2004, as well as their share of the world  oil market in 2004. The United States far exceeds the rest of the world in  its volume of consumption, accounting for a quarter of world demand,  with about 21 million barrels per day in 2004. Most of U.S. oil demand  arises from usage in the transportation sector. China\u2019s demand surpassed  Japan\u2019s in 2003, and it became the second largest consumer of oil, with  about 6 million barrels per day, or about 8 percent of world demand.  India\u2019s demand is also growing quickly. It consumed about 2 million  barrels per day, the sixth highest level of demand.", "As demand has risen, so have oil import needs. For instance, while the  United States produced almost 9 million barrels per day of oil in 2004,  making it the third largest world producer, its production met only 42  percent of its demand, with net oil imports of about 12 million barrels per  day meeting the remaining 58 percent of demand. China\u2019s import  dependence has also grown, and it imported about 45 percent of its oil in  2004. Figure 3 shows the top world net oil importers in 2004, countries  importing more than 1 million barrels per day net. Of these 9 countries, 6  were totally or almost totally import dependent for their oil consumption.  For instance, Japan and South Korea were totally dependent on imports,  predominantly from the Persian Gulf, while many European countries also  imported from Algeria, Libya, and Nigeria. The largest net oil exporter to  the United States was Canada, followed by Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and  Venezuela.", "While the world supply of oil and refined products has risen to meet  increased demand, supply constraints have also increased, eroding certain  market cushions and contributing further to market tightness. Increased  political or energy sector frictions in countries such as Iran, Iraq, Nigeria,  and Venezuela and decreased spare crude oil production capacity have  exerted pressure on crude oil markets. Given the tight market situation,  marked by less spare production capacity and other cushions, any oil  supply disruption can cause the price of oil to rise dramatically.", "One factor contributing to constrained oil supplies is that the political, or  energy sector, friction in key oil producing nations led to supply  disruptions and diminished production capacity, in some cases.  Participation by international oil companies in the oil sector has been  affected by political tensions in Iraq, Venezuela, and Nigeria, and  economic sanctions on Iran and Libya. For example, in April 2006,  Venezuela seized two oil fields operated by two foreign oil companies  because the companies did not comply with new rules imposed by the  Venezuelan government. In Nigeria, recent disruptions due to militant  actions have shut-in about 650 thousand barrels per day of production.", "A second contributing factor is that world production of oil is 84 to 85  million barrels of oil per day, and the rate of production increase has not  kept pace with the rate of increased demand. Furthermore, there is very  little spare production capacity given existing infrastructure. Spare oil  production capacity\u2014 the ability to produce extra barrels of production in  the short-term\u2014is a key market cushion for responding to market  disruptions. Since the mid-1980s, growth in world oil production capacity  has lagged relative to growth in global oil demand, with the result that  spare capacity has declined from a high in recent times of 5.6 million  barrels per day in 2002 to between 1 and 1.3 million barrels per day today.  Most of this spare capacity is held within Saudi Arabia. While in previous  oil supply disruptions, the U.S. government has been able to negotiate with  senior officials in Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing countries to  increase their supply of crude oil, many oil industry officials, experts, and  U.S. government officials said that today such efforts would be less  effective given the limited levels of spare oil production capacity in world  markets.", "Downstream investment in pipelines and tankers has also lagged behind  the growth in global oil demand in recent years, contributing to potential  bottlenecks. Additionally, private inventories of oil have been in a long- term declining trend, in part because of a trend toward just-in-time  inventory, according to energy experts.", "Oil production is capital-intensive and heavily dependent on continuous  investment to maintain existing wells, drill new wells for crude oil  production, and develop and maintain the infrastructure supporting the  production network. Extensive investment in the oil sector will be  required to meet future oil demand and maintain spare capacity, according  to energy experts.", "Looking ahead, there are additional uncertainties related to future supplies  of oil. Expected new supplies of crude oil may be in places that are  difficult to access and could involve high extraction and processing costs,  as with offshore reserves and unconventional crude oils. There is also an  ongoing peak oil debate\u2014disagreement among oil market experts as to  when the world will reach its level of peak production of conventional oil  and then begin to decline.", "For a discussion of the growing role of natural gas in world energy  markets, see appendix III."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Growing Market Participation of National Oil Companies Has Led to Concerns", "paragraphs": ["In an energy market characterized by relatively high oil prices and  increasing energy demand, the growing participation and market influence  of national oil and gas companies\u2014which are majority owned by national  governments\u2014from both energy consuming and producing countries has  contributed to limited access to oil and natural gas resources in some  producing countries.

The impact of this industry shift  is unclear, but some concerns have arisen over (1) the ability of some  national oil and gas companies from consuming nations to efficiently bring  energy resources to the market and (2) the constrained investment  climates in some producing countries dominated by national oil and gas  companies that may inhibit the investment necessary to ensure continued  production and growth."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "National Oil Companies\u2019 Influence Is Growing Relative to International Oil Companies", "paragraphs": ["The influence of the national oil and gas companies is perceived to be  growing, as the ability of international oil and gas companies to replace  their energy resource holdings becomes increasingly limited. According to  DOE Secretary Samuel W. Bodman, in a speech to the National Petroleum  Council in June 2006, 90 percent of the world\u2019s untapped conventional oil  reserves are controlled by governments and their national oil and gas  companies, many of which are in politically unstable regions of the world.  Figure 4 indicates that 7 of the top 10 companies are national or state- sponsored oil and gas companies, ranked on the basis of oil production.  The three international oil companies that are among the top 10 are Exxon  Mobil, BP, and Royal Dutch Shell. Ranked on the basis of oil reserve  holdings, 9 of the top 10 companies are national or state-sponsored oil and  gas companies. These top 10 oil and gas companies accounted for an  estimated 42 percent of world daily oil production and an estimated 64  percent of world oil reserves holdings in 2004, based on EIA data for world  estimates. Figure 5 shows a similarly strong position for the national or  state-sponsored oil and gas companies, with respect to natural gas  production and reserves holdings. These top 10 oil and gas companies  accounted for an estimated 44 percent of world daily natural gas  production in 2004 and an estimated 62 percent of world natural gas  reserves holdings, based on EIA data for world estimates. Some agency  officials and energy experts believe that, should some countries with  national oil and gas companies continue to limit competition and  investment opportunities in their energy sectors, the ability of  international oil and gas companies to replace their energy resource  holdings will become increasingly limited to locations marked by high  geological, political, and financial risks.", "Competition among consuming countries to procure oil and gas assets has  also been affected by the growing participation of national oil and gas  companies. Some energy experts stated that increased access to capital,  combined with increased access to technical expertise available for hire  from third-party service companies, has allowed these consuming  countries\u2019 national oil and gas companies to compete with the  international oil companies in the global marketplace for energy  resources. Additionally, with political leverage and potential financial  support provided from their governments, some national oil and gas  companies may be willing to operate at a lower discount rate and a  potentially lower profit margin. For example, there has been an increasing  trend by some national oil and gas companies from energy consuming  countries such as Brazil, China, India, and Malaysia to become active,  competitive bidders for acquiring exploration rights to energy resources in  other producing countries. Some experts say these national oil and gas  companies may benefit from increased financial support and political  leverage in negotiations with the host supplier countries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National Oil and Gas Companies May Lack Resources to Develop Projects and May Inhibit Competition", "paragraphs": ["According to some agency officials and energy experts, there are two main  concerns about participation of national oil and gas companies in the  energy market. One concern is that some national oil and gas companies  from consuming countries may not have the combination of capital,  technical expertise, and managerial expertise necessary to efficiently and  effectively develop certain oil and gas projects, preventing some of the  production from getting to the global energy market in a timely manner.  Some energy experts stated that a Chinese national oil and gas company,  for example, may have the capital to compete for the rights to explore for  energy resources but may not have the technology and managerial  expertise to develop some projects. Additionally, agency officials and  energy experts expressed concern over the impact of national oil and gas  companies procuring energy assets based on national policy goals rather  than on commercial market business strategy. Whereas, international oil  and gas companies typically seek to maximize returns, some national oil  and gas companies\u2019 operations may be driven primarily by their  government\u2019s energy policy interests and revenue requirements. This may  result in (1) a national oil and gas company potentially preventing some or  all of the production from the resource base under their control from  getting to the global energy market in a timely way or (2) a national  company entering into bilateral exploration based on foreign policy  purposes. Some energy experts added that, although there may also be a  net gain in the resulting energy supply on the market due to increased  activity by national oil and gas companies from consuming countries, the  ability of some of these companies to bring those energy assets to market  is varied and remains a concern.", "A second concern is that constrained investment climates in some  producing countries\u2019 energy markets will inhibit the investment necessary  to ensure continued production and growth is maintained by the country\u2019s  national oil and gas company.

For example, concerns about oil demand information  include the following:    Historical demand data: Uncertainty results from successive revisions of  data, a lack of timeliness in reporting, and questionable reliability of data,  particularly from rapidly growing non-OECD countries such as China and  India. Final demand data are generally available about 16-20 months after  the reference year. By the time final data are reported, initial estimates  may have been revised repeatedly. EIA officials also question the basic  reliability of demand data for non-OECD countries like China and India.  For example, Chinese demand estimates are derived from \u201capparent  demand\u201d\u2014as a sum of estimated production and estimated net imports\u2014 or on inference from Chinese gross domestic product (GDP) growth  estimates. As an example of the uncertainty that results from such  methods, the EIA indicated that Chinese oil demand had grown at roughly  500,000 barrels per day in 2005, while a widely quoted Morgan-Stanley  report indicated that Chinese demand had declined.", "Projections: Uncertainty results from projected demand estimates that  rely upon questionable historical data and that may not fully incorporate  data revisions. For example, both the EIA and IEA use historical demand  and estimated economic growth as a basis for their demand projections.  However, both the EIA and IEA forecasts failed to anticipate the surge in  Chinese and global demand growth in 2004 due to the poor quality of  Chinese data. According to economic experts, uncertainty in future  demand is further compounded by insufficient transparency in EIA and  IEA methodologies for projecting impacts of a high-price future.", "Concerns about oil supply information include:    Historical supply data: Uncertainty in production and stock (inventories)  data results from the proprietary nature of the data, differences in  definitions and conversion rates, and political sensitivities. According to  the EIA, for example, OPEC countries often do not accurately report their  current production levels. An EIA official reported that estimates of  OPEC\u2019s June 2006 crude oil production varied by over 700,000 barrels per  day, from a low of 29.3 million barrels per day by the Petroleum  Intelligence Weekly, to 30 million barrels per day by the IEA. Reliability of  OPEC production data is further complicated by OPEC quotas that are  based on estimated reserves, which are suspected to have been inflated in  order to generate higher quotas. For Russia, swings of up to 100,000  barrels per day have occurred in its production data since Russian data do  not break out gas condensate from oil production, and conversion rates  for a combined stream are uncertain. Production data for some countries  may be inferred from combining oil exports, oil demand, and changes in  oil stocks. However, in addition to problems with demand data, oil stock  data is incomplete and does not generally include stocks held in non- OECD countries (such as in China or India where stock data is considered  a state secret) or in independent storage within OECD countries. In a  previous GAO study, we found that missing stock data in IEA statistics,  referred to as \u201cmissing barrels,\u201d were present in 24 of 26 years between  1973 and 1998.

We  have modified our report language to emphasize that EIA has been more  active in data exchange activities rather than efforts to assist other  countries in data collection and modeling, such as through training  workshops.", "DOE expressed concern with our description of how U.S. data  submissions to IEA have not been timely, and it provided additional details  about several timeliness issues. We have modified our report language to  incorporate these clarifications. Additionally, while we recognize the  challenge for improving U.S. data submissions due to an EIA survey  schedule that does not correspond with IEA\u2019s scheduled due dates, we  maintain our recommendation that DOE examine ways to improve the  timeliness of U.S. data submissions. One consideration could include the  suggestion provided in DOE\u2019s comments to this report that the IEA use  EIA miniquestionnaires and monthly submissions to generate preliminary  U.S. data.", "Finally, DOE stated that it was concerned that GAO asserts that more data  and more timely data will resolve energy market and security issues. GAO  makes no such assertion. Our findings highlight the increased importance  of reliable energy market information in a tight market and, therefore, we  recommend that DOE give greater priority to improving energy  information efforts within the international forums. We specifically  recommend that DOE address two relevant areas in which we saw  opportunities for improvement, by examining how EIA expertise can be  better leveraged and by examining how U.S. data submissions to IEA can  be made more timely.

DOE and the Departments of  Commerce and State play a role in the bilateral energy cooperation  forums, with DOE personnel often co-chairing many of the working groups  involved in the efforts. In some bilateral energy cooperation forums  private industry is included in the discussion of certain issues, whereas  other bilateral energy cooperation forums mainly focus on high-level  dialogue between government representatives on energy policies and  initiatives. The following are examples of some of the main bilateral  energy cooperation forums:    The DOE official responsible for managing U.S. participation in the U.S.- China Energy Policy Dialogue stated it was established in 2004 for high- level dialogue between the two countries on energy issues such as energy  policy, energy efficiency measures and related technologies, renewable  energy, and energy sector reforms. Other areas of focus have included  shared concern over supply security and energy transport issues. The U.S.- China Oil and Gas Industry Forum, established in 1998, is a public-private  bilateral relationship involving government and industry representatives  from both countries. The forum is driven by consensus-based dialogue on  commercial policy and on common goals such as development of secure,  reliable, and economic sources of oil and natural gas while facilitating  investment in the energy industry.", "The DOE official responsible for managing U.S. participation in the U.S.- India Energy Dialogue stated it was established in 2005 with the primary  goal of promoting energy security, increasing trade and investment in the  energy sector, and deploying clean energy technologies. This forum  consists of a steering committee and five working groups focused on oil  and gas, power and energy efficiency, coal, new technology and renewable  energy, and a civil nuclear initiative.

Many countries have  increasingly relied on natural gas. For instance, while the European  Union\u2019s dominant fuel in 2003 was oil, accounting for 40 percent of energy  demand, natural gas has been the fastest growing fuel over the past decade  and accounted for 24 percent of energy demand in 2003, according to the  Energy Information Administration (EIA). Historically, natural gas has not  been a major fuel in China, but its share in the country\u2019s energy market is  rapidly increasing, almost doubling from 1997 to 2004, according to EIA.  While natural gas only accounted for about 3 percent of total energy  consumption in China in 2004, this share is expected to increase.", "The natural gas market has long been dominated by pipelines that deliver  the natural gas from producers to consumers. For instance, 85 percent of  U.S. natural gas imports were provided through natural gas pipelines from  Canada in 2005. Much of Europe is served by pipelines from Russia, which  provides around two-thirds of its imports. However, a gas supply pricing  conflict between Russia and Ukraine in late December 2005 resulted in  Russia\u2019s Gazprom shutting off gas supplies to Ukraine on January 1, 2006,  resulting in an energy crisis for all of Europe. Although Russia had  threatened a cutoff to demand higher natural gas prices in recent years,  this was the first time that a supply disruption had affected flows to  Europe. While the immediate crisis was soon resolved, the incident deeply  undercut Europe\u2019s sense of energy security.", "The United States was the largest consumer of natural gas in 2004, with  about 23 percent of world demand.

Of the seven top natural gas importers, six  depended on imports for more than 75 percent of their demand\u2014including  Ukraine, which met about 78 percent of its natural gas demand through  imports.", "In terms of natural gas production, Russia was the largest producer, with  about 23 percent of total world production, as shown in figure 8. The  United States accounted for 19 percent of total production. Canada, in a  distant third place, produced about 7 percent of total production.", "Until recently, as long as most natural gas was delivered by pipelines that  required geographic proximity, there was not the possibility of developing  a global market in which gas could be shipped to customers not connected  with a pipeline. This has changed recently with the growing development  of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) market, which is made possible because  LNG can be shipped via LNG tankers that can go anywhere in the world  where there is an LNG regasification terminal. LNG technology is not  new\u2014it had declined by the 1980s in the United States, for example, in  part because it could not compete with lower priced domestic natural gas  provided through pipelines. However, interest in LNG imports has been  renewed due to higher U.S. natural gas prices in recent years, along with  increased competition, and advances in LNG technology that have lowered  its costs, according to EIA. LNG is expected to be particularly valuable for  so-called \u201cstranded\u201d natural gas reserves, which are located in areas too  remote from major demand centers to affordably be developed using  pipelines.", "In 2005, Japan was by far the largest importer of LNG, with about 42  percent of total world LNG imports. Its major suppliers included  Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, Qatar, Brunei, and the United Arab  Emirates. South Korea, in second place, accounted for about 16 percent of  total world LNG imports, from some of the same suppliers and Oman,  while Spain, ranked third, imported about 11 percent of the total, mainly  from Algeria, Nigeria, Qatar, and Egypt. The United States ranked fourth,  with about 9 percent of the total, mostly imported from Trinidad and  Tobago. While China is not yet an important consumer in the LNG market,  it is taking steps to significantly increase its LNG profile. With its natural  gas use increasing rapidly, and uncertainties surrounding the potential of  piped Russian natural gas, China is increasingly considering LNG.
