In fiscal year 2004, over $2 billion in funding was provided through the CARE Act, the majority of which was distributed through Title I grants to eligible metropolitan areas (EMA) and Title II grants to states, the District of Columbia, and territories. Titles I and II use formulas to distribute grants according to a jurisdiction's reported count of AIDS cases. Title II includes grants for state-administered AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAP), which provide medications to HIV-infected individuals. GAO was asked to discuss the distribution of funding under the CARE Act. This testimony presents preliminary findings on (1) the impact of CARE Act provisions that distribute funds based upon the number of AIDS cases in metropolitan areas, (2) the impact of CARE Act provisions that limit annual funding decreases, (3) the potential shifts in funding among grantees if HIV case counts were incorporated with the AIDS cases that are currently used in funding formulas, and (4) the variation in eligibility criteria and funding sources among state ADAPs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Under the CARE Act, GAO's preliminary findings show that the amount of funding per AIDS case varied among states and metropolitan areas in fiscal year 2004. Some CARE Act provisions that distribute funds based on the AIDS case count within metropolitan areas result in differing amounts of funding per case. In particular, when a state or territory has an EMA within its borders, the cases within that EMA are counted twice during the distribution of CARE Act funds--once to determine the EMA's funding under Title I, and once again to determine a state's Title II grant. The hold-harmless provisions under Titles I and II guarantee a certain percentage of a previous year's funding amount, thus sustaining the funding levels of CARE Act grantees based upon previous years' measurements of AIDS cases. Title I's hold-harmless provision for EMAs has primarily benefited the San Francisco EMA, which received over 90 percent of the fiscal year 2004 Title I hold-harmless funding. San Francisco alone continues to have deceased cases factored in to its allocation, because it is the only EMA with hold-harmless funding that dates back to the mid-1990s when formula funding was based on the cumulative count of diagnosed AIDS cases. If HIV case counts had been incorporated with AIDS cases in allocating Title II funding to the states in fiscal year 2004, about half of the states would have received an increase in funding and half of the states would have received less funding. Many of those states receiving increased funding would have been in the South, a region that includes 7 of the 10 states with the highest estimated rates of individuals living with HIV. However, wide variation in the maturity of states' HIV reporting systems could limit the adequacy of their HIV case counts for the distribution of CARE Act funding. Among state ADAPs, there is wide variation in the criteria used to determine who is eligible for ADAP medications and services, and in the additional funding received beyond the Title II grant for each state ADAP. States have flexibility to determine what drugs they will cover for their ADAP clients and what income level will entitle a person to eligibility, among other criteria, and the resulting variation can contribute to client coverage differences among state ADAPs. There is similar variation in additional funding sources and eligibility criteria among states that have established waiting lists for eligible clients. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Health Resources and Services Administration provided comments on the facts contained in this testimony and GAO made changes as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Ryan White Comprehensive  AIDS Resources Emergency Act of 1990 (CARE Act). I will specifically  address factors that impact CARE Act funding of services for those with  the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or Acquired Immunodeficiency  Syndrome (AIDS) and program coverage for CARE Act clients. As of  December 2003, over 1 million individuals within the United States are  estimated to be infected with HIV, including about 406,000 individuals with  AIDS. Administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration  (HRSA), the CARE Act makes funds available to states and localities to  provide health care, medications, and support services to individuals and  families affected by HIV and AIDS.", "In fiscal year 2004, more than $2 billion was provided through the CARE  Act for these health care and support services. The majority of these funds  were distributed under Title I and Title II within the CARE Act through  formula-derived base grants, which distribute funding to all eligible  jurisdictions, and through supplemental grants, which distribute funding  to a subset of all eligible jurisdictions. Title I provides funding to all  eligible metropolitan areas (EMA) according to an EMA\u2019s number of AIDS  cases. Title II provides funding to all states, territories, and the District of  Columbia. Within both of these titles are formula grants intended to  distribute funds proportionally to grantees based upon a measure of each  grantee\u2019s share of AIDS cases. Grantees\u2019 reports of AIDS cases are used in  funding formulas because when the CARE Act was enacted in 1990, most  jurisdictions tracked and reported AIDS cases instead of HIV cases.", "The CARE Act\u2019s reauthorizations in 1996 and 2000 modified the original  funding formulas. Prior to the 1996 reauthorization, the CARE Act  measured a jurisdiction\u2019s caseload by its cumulative count of AIDS cases,  which is the number of AIDS cases recorded since reporting began in 1981.  The 1996 reauthorization changed the measurement of a jurisdiction\u2019s  caseload to an estimation of the number of living AIDS cases. This switch  would have resulted in large shifts of funding away from jurisdictions with  a longer history of the disease and a higher proportion of deceased cases  than other jurisdictions. The CARE Act includes hold-harmless provisions  under Title I and Title II that protect grantees from decreases in funding  from one year to the next. Title I of the CARE Act also includes a  grandfather clause for EMAs. A type of hold-harmless itself, this  grandfather clause guarantees that once a metropolitan area has become  an EMA, it will continue to receive funding under Title I, even if its  caseload drops below the threshold for eligibility. The most recent  reauthorization of the CARE Act in 2000 maintained these modifications,  and it further specified that HIV cases should be used in funding formulas  no later than fiscal year 2007. As of June 2005, HIV case counts have not  been used to distribute funding under the CARE Act.", "A portion of Title II funding is for state AIDS Drug Assistance Programs  (ADAP), which provide medications to infected individuals. In fiscal year  2004, Title II base ADAP grants\u2014the ADAP grant given to all states\u2014 totaled $728 million, accounting for 36 percent of all CARE Act funding.  The programs are administered at the state level and each state is allowed  flexibility in determining its program eligibility criteria and the drugs it  provides. Some ADAPs establish waiting lists for eligible individuals for a  period of time when the ADAP cannot provide covered drugs.", "To assist the subcommittee in its consideration of the CARE Act, my  testimony provides our preliminary findings on some of the issues we are  reviewing for the Chairman and other requesters. My remarks today will  focus on selected provisions of the CARE Act and ADAP. Specifically, I  will discuss  1.  the impact of CARE Act provisions on the distribution of funds that is  based upon the number of AIDS cases in metropolitan areas,  2.  the impact of the CARE Act\u2019s hold-harmless provisions and a  grandfather clause on the distribution of funds,  3.  the potential shifts in funding among grantees if HIV case counts had  been incorporated in fiscal year 2004 funding formulas, and  4.  the variation in eligibility criteria and funding sources among the state  ADAPs.", "To address these issues and those within our broader review of the CARE  Act, we interviewed officials from HRSA and the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention (CDC). CDC collects HIV and AIDS case counts  from states and territories. We also interviewed officials from the National  Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors. We obtained and analyzed  data from HRSA regarding the distribution of CARE Act funding and from  CDC regarding AIDS and HIV case counts. We obtained and analyzed HIV  case counts from those states from which CDC does not accept these data  because they do not use names to identify the cases. CDC and the states  provided us with case counts that were available as of June 30, 2003, the  cutoff date for data used to determine fiscal year 2004 funding. HRSA  provided us with CARE Act funding distributions for fiscal year 2004.  Based on the information HRSA, CDC, and the states provided regarding  its verification of the reliability of these data, we determined these data to  be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our analyses. We performed our  work from July 2004 through June 2005 according to generally accepted  government auditing standards. CDC and HRSA provided comments on  the facts contained in this statement, and we made changes as  appropriate.", "In brief, our analysis shows that certain CARE Act Title I and Title II  provisions related to the distribution of funds to metropolitan areas result  in variability between the amounts of funding per case among grantees.  States and territories that have EMAs within their borders receive more  funding per estimated living AIDS case than those without EMAs because  cases within EMAs are counted twice\u2014once to determine Title I funding  to EMAs, and once again to determine a state\u2019s Title II grant. Metropolitan  areas that have been affected by the epidemic but do not have the  necessary number of AIDS cases to become EMAs and receive Title I  funding may qualify for funding as Emerging Communities under Title II.", "However, the allocation of these grants is made by separating eligible  jurisdictions into two tiers based on their reported number of AIDS cases.  Because one half of the total Emerging Communities grant award is  allocated to each tier regardless of how many cases are in each tier, in  fiscal year 2004 jurisdictions in one tier received $1,052 per case while  jurisdictions in the other tier received $313 per case.", "The hold-harmless provisions under Titles I and II and the grandfather  clause for EMAs under Title I sustain the funding and eligibility of CARE  Act grantees on the basis of a previous year\u2019s measurements of the number  of AIDS cases in these jurisdictions. By guaranteeing either a certain  percentage of previous years\u2019 funding amounts or an EMA\u2019s eligibility to  receive funding, these provisions make it more difficult for CARE Act  funding to track the most current distribution of the epidemic. The San  Francisco EMA has primarily benefited from Title I\u2019s hold-harmless  provision, receiving over 90 percent ($7,358,239) of the fiscal year 2004  Title I hold-harmless funding. San Francisco\u2019s current hold-harmless  funding can be traced to its 1995 base grant, which was determined using  the cumulative number of AIDS cases, living and dead, reported since  1981. In essence, deceased cases are still being used to determine funding  for San Francisco. Hold-harmless provisions under Title II also sustain a  state\u2019s level of funding based on case counts from previous years. Because  funding for one of these Title II hold-harmless provisions is drawn from a  set-aside for states with a severe need for drug assistance, this hold- harmless provision could affect the amount of funding received by these  severe-need states in the future. The grandfather clause in Title I  maintained the funding for 29 of the 51 EMAs that became eligible for Title  I base grants in the past. These EMAs, however, would not have qualified  for Title I base grants in fiscal year 2004 based upon their case counts,  which were below the eligibility threshold of 2,000 reported AIDS cases in  the last 5 calendar years.", "If the HIV case counts from state reporting systems had been used with  estimated living AIDS cases in allocating fiscal year 2004 Title II base  funding, about half of the states would have received increased funding  and the other half would have received decreased funding. Using two  different approaches, we found that at least 11 of the states with increased  funding were located in the South, the region with the highest estimated  number of people living with HIV or AIDS in 2003. All states have  established HIV case reporting systems, and the 2000 reauthorization of  the CARE Act required that HIV cases be used in determining formula  funding no later than fiscal year 2007. However, wide differences between  states\u2019 HIV case reporting systems\u2014in their maturity and reporting  methods, for instance\u2014could affect the use of HIV and AIDS case counts  to distribute CARE Act funding because an immature reporting system  might not capture an accurate count of a state\u2019s HIV cases. More mature  systems have longer histories of collecting newly diagnosed HIV cases and  retroactively reporting HIV cases that had been diagnosed before the  reporting system existed. We found that funding would have shifted to  jurisdictions with more mature HIV reporting systems, which includes  many of the reporting systems in the South. However, changes in funding  would be largely offset, at least initially, if the funding formulas included  hold-harmless and minimum grant provisions.", "There is wide variation among state ADAPs in the eligibility criteria they  set for their programs and in the additional funding those programs  receive from sources other than their Title II base ADAP grant. States  determine what drugs they will cover for their ADAP clients and what  income level will make a client eligible for ADAP coverage, among other  criteria. States also vary in the amount of funding they receive from other  sources in addition to their Title II ADAP base grant. State ADAPs can  receive funding from a variety of sources, including transfers from other  CARE Act grants and contributions from states, that can lead to a wide  range of funding amounts per AIDS case. However, we did not find a  relationship between any one factor\u2014a particular income eligibility  criterion, for example, or a type of additional funding beyond the base  grant\u2014and the existence of a waiting list of ADAP clients that could not  be served at a particular time."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Over the course of the last quarter century, the epidemic has spread to  every region of the country. HIV and AIDS cases have been reported in all  states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories, but the impact of the  epidemic varies by region and within states. The South is estimated to  have the highest cumulative number of diagnosed AIDS cases, people  living with AIDS, and deaths from AIDS. In 2003, 7 of the 10 states with the  highest estimated rates of individuals living with HIV were located in the  South.", "The CARE Act was enacted in 1990 to respond to the needs of individuals  and families living with HIV or AIDS and to direct federal funding to areas  disproportionately affected by the epidemic. Titles I and II of the act  provide base funding to affected EMAs and states based on the proportion  of each jurisdiction\u2019s caseload of AIDS cases. These titles also establish  other types of grants to provide supplemental funding. For example, Title  II includes Severe Need grants for states with demonstrated need for  supplemental funding to support their ADAPs. Title II also includes  funding for emerging communities that are affected by AIDS but do not  have the 2,000 AIDS cases reported in the last 5 calendar years in order to  be eligible for Title I funding as EMAs. In order to address the impact of  the disease on racial and ethnic minorities, Minority AIDS Initiative grants  are distributed through both Title I and Title II to EMAs and states.", "Metropolitan areas heavily affected by HIV or AIDS have always been  recognized within the structure of the CARE Act. We previously found  that, with combined funding under Title I and Title II, states with EMAs  receive more funding per AIDS case than states without EMAs. To adjust  for this situation, the 1996 reauthorization instituted a two-part formula for  Title II base funding that takes into account the number of AIDS cases that  reside within a state but outside of any EMA\u2019s jurisdiction. Under this  distribution formula, 80 percent of the Title II base grant is based upon a  state\u2019s proportion of all AIDS cases, and twenty percent of the allocation is  based on the number of AIDS cases within that state\u2019s borders but outside  of EMAs. A second provision included in 1996 protected the eligibility of  EMAs. The 1996 CARE Act amendments provided that once a jurisdiction  is designated an EMA, that jurisdiction is \u201cgrandfathered\u201d so it will always  receive some amount of funding under Title I even if its reported number  of AIDS cases drops below the threshold for eligibility. Hold-harmless  provisions and the grandfather clause were maintained in the 2000  reauthorization of the CARE Act. Table 1 describes selected CARE Act  formula grants for Titles I and II.", "The 2000 reauthorization specified that CARE Act Title I and Title II  funding formulas should use HIV case counts as early as fiscal year 2005 if  such data were available and deemed \u201csufficiently accurate and reliable\u201d  by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). The 2000  reauthorization also required that HIV data be used no later than the  beginning of fiscal year 2007. In June 2004 the Secretary of HHS  determined that HIV data were not yet ready to be used for the purposes of  allocating formula funding under Title I and Title II of the CARE Act. The  Secretary cited a 2004 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, which identified  several limitations in the ability of states to provide adequate and reliable  HIV case counts for use in CARE Act formula allocations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CARE Act Funding Provisions Result in Disproportionate Funding", "paragraphs": ["Some CARE Act provisions have led to jurisdictions receiving different  amounts of funding per AIDS cases.

In addition, Emerging Communities  grants are awarded to eligible communities that are separated into two  tiers based on each community\u2019s AIDS cases reported in the most recent 5  calendar years.

The remaining 20 percent is based on the number of AIDS cases in each  state outside of any EMA. This 80/20 split was established by the CARE  Act\u2019s 1996 amendments to address the fact that states with EMAs received  more funding per case than states without EMAs. However, even with the  80/20 split, states with EMAs still receive more funding per AIDS case.  States without an EMA receive no funding under the Title I distribution,  and thus, when total Title I and Title II CARE Act funds are considered,  states with EMAs receive more funding per AIDS case.  Appendix I shows  the combined fiscal year 2004 funding for all Title I and Title II funding  received by each state.", "Table 2 illustrates the effect of counting EMA cases twice by comparing  the relationship between the percentage of a state\u2019s AIDS cases that are  within an EMA\u2019s jurisdiction and the amount of funding a state receives  per AIDS case. Table 2 shows that as the percentage of a state\u2019s AIDS  cases within EMAs increases, the total Title I and II funding per AIDS case  also increases for the state. For example, states with no AIDS cases in  EMAs received on average $3,592 per AIDS case. States with 75 percent or  more of their cases in EMAs received on average $4,955 per AIDS case, or  38 percent more funding than states with no EMA. If the total Title I and  Title II funding had been distributed equally per AIDS case among all  grantees, each state would have received $4,782 per AIDS case.", "The impact of counting EMA cases twice is that states with similar  numbers of AIDS cases can receive different levels of combined Title I and  Title II funding. For example, for fiscal year 2004 funding, Connecticut had  5,363 AIDS cases while South Carolina had 5,563 AIDS cases. However,  Connecticut had two EMAs that accounted for 91.3 percent of its cases  while South Carolina had none. Connecticut received $26,797,308 ($4,997  per AIDS case) in combined Title I and Title II funding while South  Carolina, with 200 more cases, received $20,705,328 ($3,722 per AIDS  case).

Four of these communities had between 1,000 and 1,999 reported  cases and 25 communities had between 500 and 999 cases.

The Title I hold-harmless provision has primarily benefited one  EMA. Title I also contains a grandfather clause that has resulted in a large  number of EMAs maintaining funding despite no longer meeting the  eligibility criteria. One hold-harmless provision for Title II ensures that the  total of Title II and ADAP base grants awarded to a state will be at least as  large as the total of these grants it received the previous year.

EMAs that did  not receive hold-harmless funding received approximately $1,221 in base  grant funding per AIDS case. Fiscal year 2004 base grant funding per AIDS  case in EMAs that received hold-harmless funding ranged from $1,223  (Newark) to $2,241 (San Francisco). Thus, San Francisco received $1,020  more in base grant funding per AIDS case than did EMAs that did not  receive hold-harmless funding. This hold-harmless funding represents  approximately 46 percent of San Francisco\u2019s base grant. Because of its  hold-harmless funding, San Francisco, which had 7,216 AIDS cases in  fiscal year 2004, received a base grant equivalent to what an EMA with  approximately 13,245 AIDS cases (84 percent more) would have received  based on the proportion of cases.

Those states with the oldest reporting systems include 11  southern states whose HIV reporting systems were implemented prior to  1995. As shown in table 8, states with long histories of collecting HIV case  counts tend to have many more HIV cases compared with their number of  AIDS cases than do states with less mature reporting systems. This is  likely because states with newer systems do not have reports on many  cases of HIV diagnosed before their reporting systems were established.  This can be illustrated by comparing Wisconsin and Delaware, 2 states  with similar numbers of AIDS cases. Wisconsin began reporting HIV cases  in 1985 while Delaware began in 2001. As of June 2003, the 909 reported  HIV cases in Delaware was about 40 percent less than the 1,518 reported  AIDS cases.

The inclusion of HIV cases in the funding  formulas, while improving on the basis for funding allocations by  reflecting cases that have not progressed to AIDS, would also result in  variable funding depending upon the type and maturity of the reporting  system used in each state.
