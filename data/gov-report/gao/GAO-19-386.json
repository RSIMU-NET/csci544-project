DOD officials noted that they have taken an incremental implementation approach to addressing section 922. In 2018, DOD identified 166 recommendations to change the ASD-SO/LIC's oversight of special operations forces (SOF). These recommendations were used to develop 87 actions that were necessary to implement section 922. Since February 2019, DOD has implemented 56 of these actions. For example, the Deputy Secretary of Defense approved a new Special Operations Policy and Oversight Council directive that identified the ASD-SO/LIC as the lead for that council. The Deputy Secretary of Defense also delegated the ASD-SO/LIC with authority to approve waivers to hire civilian personnel during a civilian hiring freeze.", "Although the office of the ASD-SO/LIC has taken many actions to implement section 922, DOD faces two key challenges in completing its implementation of the ASD-SO/LIC's new roles and responsibilities:", "Lack of time frames . As of February 2019, 28 out of 31 unimplemented actions associated with section 922 did not have clear time frames for implementation. According to ASD-SO/LIC and U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) officials, they did not prioritize establishing time frames because they took an incremental approach to implementing actions and addressed them on a case-by-case basis. Without clear time frames for implementation, ASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM may be less effective in implementing section 922.", "Unclear guidance . Current guidance about ASD-SO/LIC responsibilities is outdated: for example, it states that the ASD-SO/LIC shall report directly to the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. However, section 922 states that special operation forces-related administrative matters are managed directly by the Secretary of Defense to the ASD-SO/LIC. The special operations force enterprise is a complex system, and unless roles and responsibilities are clarified in guidance, other DOD stakeholders, such as the military services, may not know the extent of the ASD-SO/LIC's and SOCOM's authorities and responsibilities. DOD officials expressed some concerns that until these matters are clarified in guidance, it will remain unclear whether the ASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM should work together\u2014for example, on personnel issues\u2014and how their relationships with stakeholders with oversight authority will be managed. DOD partially concurred, and based on its comments, GAO modified one recommendation.", "The office of the ASD-SO/LIC has made efforts to develop a workforce plan, including commissioning a manpower study and taking steps to develop a hiring plan; however, these efforts do not fully incorporate some leading principles for a strategic workforce plan. For example, ASD-SO/LIC did not share the hiring plan with its staff, including key officials from the office of the ASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM. Without completing a comprehensive strategic workforce plan that includes key principles, the office of the ASD-SO/LIC may not know what gaps exist in skills and competencies in order to develop effective workforce strategies to fill those gaps.

To support these activities, funding for U.S. Special  Operations Command (SOCOM) increased from $5.2 billion in 2005 to  $12.3 billion in 2018. Despite the growth in activities and resourcing,  oversight of SOCOM\u2019s responsibilities to organize, train, and equip has  remained largely the same.

An example of the review and coordinate role is  that OASD-SO/LIC liaises with the military departments on military  personnel issues.", "Approve: This role requires OASD-SO/LIC\u2019s concurrence to give  explicit or official sanction, permission, or ratification of an activity. An  example of approval authority is that ASD-SO/LIC approves  SOCOM\u2019s Program Objective Memorandum (POM).", "We found the largest share of the 166 recommendations made by the  working groups strengthened OASD-SO/LIC\u2019s roles related to monitor  and to review and coordinate, as shown in figure 1.

For example, prior to the  implementation of section 922, OASD-SO/LIC attended Joint Resources  Management Board meetings. After implementing section 922, OASD- SO/LIC exercised its review and coordinate responsibility by attending  Joint Resources Management Board meetings, thereby formalizing  OASD-SO/LIC\u2019s prior role. According to DOD officials, there is a value in  adding OASD-SO/LIC as a participant in key meetings and formalizing  OASD-SO/LIC\u2019s review and coordinate role.

According to OASD-SO/LIC officials, its actions reflect an  incremental approach to strengthening OASD-SO/LIC\u2019s roles and  responsibilities. In February 2019 OASD-SO/LIC reported to Congress  that it had completed 56 of its 87 actions. For example, one of the actions  identified in the February 2019 monthly report was the need to enhance  OASD-SO/LIC\u2019s role in the development and approval of SOF-related  program and budget matters. The report further identified a number of  actions, including having OASD-SO/LIC approve SOCOM\u2019s POM.  According to the report, OASD-SO/LIC was briefed on and approved  SOCOM\u2019s POM for fiscal years 2020-2024. As another example, the  report identified the need to enhance OASD-SO/LIC\u2019s oversight of SOF- related military construction activities and contingency basing. This  included a requirement that OASD-SO/LIC co-chair SOCOM\u2019s Military  Construction Summit, which according to officials deals with acquisition- related issues regarding military construction and is used to inform the  POM. According to the February 2019 report, OASD-SO/LIC co-chaired  the summit for fiscal year 2019, and its formal role as co-chair will be  reflected in future updates to SOCOM guidance. The February report also  explained that the Deputy Secretary of Defense approved a new Special  Operations Policy and Oversight Council directive that identified the ASD- SO/LIC as the lead for that council. The Deputy Secretary of Defense  also delegated the ASD-SO/LIC with authority to approve waivers to hire  civilian personnel during a civilian hiring freeze.", "Many of the actions taken thus far formalize pre-existing, informal  relationships between OASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM. According to OASD- SO/LIC officials, a formalization of a pre-existing role occurs when OASD- SO/LIC identifies a role that OASD-SO/LIC performed informally before  addressing requirements under section 922 and continues to maintain the  role officially under its section 922 responsibilities. Based on the  February 2019 report to Congress, we found that 26 out of 56  implemented action items (about 50 percent) formalize ongoing OASD- SO/LIC roles and responsibilities that were previously conducted  informally. Officials stated that all of the actions relating to budget  execution are formalizations of previously existing informal roles and  responsibilities. For example, according to OASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM  officials, OASD-SO/LIC had an informal role in reviewing SOCOM\u2019s POM  prior to section 922, such as participating in the review of the POM  without formal approval authority. According to DOD officials familiar with  the POM process, giving OASD-SO/LIC approval authority for SOCOM\u2019s  POM essentially formalized what had been done in the past, while  allowing OASD-SO/LIC to perform a more thorough review. Similarly,  officials stated that OASD-SO/LIC had an informal role in developing  SOCOM\u2019s budget justification books prior to the passage of section 922.  Another action identified in DOD\u2019s February 2019 monthly report is  OASD-SO/LIC\u2019s role in budget submission. Officials explained that, in an  effort to enhance OASD-SO/LIC\u2019s role in budget submission, OASD- SO/LIC has formalized this role. According to the officials, the benefit of  this formalization is that OASD-SO/LIC has greater access to the process  of producing justification books. There have been similar examples of  formalization of pre-existing roles in other areas as well. For example,  prior to section 922, SOCOM\u2019s public affairs requirements were  coordinated with USD (P)\u2019s public affairs office. Rather than duplicate  SOCOM\u2019s existing public affairs role with an additional public affairs office  for the ASD-SO/LIC, OASD-SO/LIC coordinates with the USD (P)\u2019s public  affairs office."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Lack of Clear Time Frames and Guidance Are Challenges to Completing Implementation of the ASD-SO/LIC\u2019s Roles and Responsibilities", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most Actions That Remain to Be Implemented Do Not Have Clear Time Frames", "paragraphs": ["Most of the actions remaining to be implemented do not have clear time  frames for implementation. Based on our analysis of the February 2019  monthly report, we found that 31 out of 87 identified actions remain  unimplemented. Of these 31 actions, three have clear time frames for  implementation. For example, one of the remaining actions involves  enhancing the ASD-SO/LIC\u2019s role in SOF military personnel-related  issues. Among other things, this includes liaising with the military  departments on relevant military personnel issues and coordinating on  related policy issues. The February 2019 monthly report includes an  action related to OASD-SO/LIC\u2019s plans to coordinate a process to monitor  promotions of SOF personnel and communicate issues with military  departments. The report specifies that the ASD-SO/LIC expected to  implement this process in 2019. As another example, documenting and  funding for the Secretariat for Special Operations was expected to be  resolved by the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.", "However, the remaining 28 actions do not have time frames for  implementation. For example, some of the actions associated with  implementing the ASD-SO/LIC\u2019s key functions, such as acquisitions and  legislative affairs, do not have clear time frames for implementation.", "Regarding acquisitions, OASD-SO/LIC is developing standard operating  procedures, such as regular coordination and meetings, but it has not  established time frames for the creation or implementation of these  procedures. Similarly, OASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM are prescribing roles  with regard to legislative affairs pending further departmental guidance,  but they have not established time frames within which these roles will be  defined.", "DOD officials identified some reasons for not having identified time  frames for the remaining actions. First, according to OASD-SO/LIC  officials, their initial efforts were focused on identifying and prioritizing the  list of actions needed to implement section 922, as reflected in the March  2018 report required by law. Since then, according to OASD-SO/LIC and  SOCOM officials, OASD-SO/LIC has taken an incremental approach to  implementing these actions, addressing items on a case-by-case basis as  they occur. For example, OASD-SO/LIC initially placed a higher priority  on implementing its fiscal roles and responsibilities, partly because the  POM cycle included deadlines associated with the President\u2019s Budget for  Fiscal Year 2020. Throughout the cycle, OASD-SO/LIC determined its  specific role in each step of the POM process as the step arose. Second,  OASD-SO/LIC officials stated that they had not established clear time  frames linked to action items because the ASD-SO/LIC was new in that  role and they were waiting for him to determine OASD-SO/LIC\u2019s broader  strategy and goals, which they could use to inform implementation time  frames. However, we note that the ASD-SO/LIC has been in that position  since December 2017, and OASD-SO/LIC has hired new personnel who  could help develop and track time frames.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government emphasizes the  need to establish time frames to implement actions effectively, and as we  reported in June 2018, establishing time frames with key milestones and  deliverables to track implementation progress are important for agency  reform efforts. Failure to do so can have significant consequences. For  example, by not establishing clear time frames for updating guidance that  defines the ASD-SO/LIC\u2019s acquisition roles, the ASD-SO/LIC is at risk for  having unclear roles and responsibilities that may overlap between  SOCOM and the Office of the Secretary of Defense on functions related  to acquisitions. According SOCOM officials, having clearer time frames to  update DOD guidance could enable OASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM to  operate more efficiently and effectively. Without establishing clear time  frames for the implementation of key oversight functions and other  actions, the ASD-SO/LIC may not be able to fully execute OASD- SO/LIC\u2019s service secretary-like authority, and DOD decision-makers may  not be well positioned to track progress and evaluate whether or how the  ASD-SO/LIC\u2019s completed and pending actions support the full  implementation of section 922."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Outdated Guidance Limits Clarity of Understanding of the ASD-SO/LIC\u2019s Broader Roles and Responsibilities under Section 922", "paragraphs": ["While the ASD- SO/LIC\u2019s responsibilities, functions, relationships, and  authorities are established in DOD Directive 5111.10, Assistant Secretary  of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict (ASD  SO/LIC) (Mar. 22, 1995) (incorporating Change 2, Oct. 21, 2011), this  directive is outdated and does not reflect the ASD- SO/LIC\u2019s statutory  roles under section 922 and codified at 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 138. For example,  DOD Directive 5111.10 states that the ASD- SO/LIC shall serve under the  authority, direction, and control of the USD (P). However, section 922  states that the ASD- SO/LIC\u2019s exercise of authority of all special  operations-peculiar administrative matters related to the organization,  training, and equipping of SOF shall be subject to the authority, direction,  and control of the Secretary of Defense. According to DOD officials, while  there is other guidance that broadly lays out DOD roles and  responsibilities, this guidance lacks details concerning operationalizing  ASD- SO/LIC\u2019s roles and responsibilities under the new administrative  chain of command, creating potential confusion regarding the ASD-  SO/LIC\u2019s roles and responsibilities on some key SOF-related issues. For  example:", "SOF personnel issues: SOF personnel activities include readiness  reporting, training, education, warrior care, awards, decorations, and  death notification. Support for SOF personnel issues is generally  dispersed among different components, including the military  services, SOCOM, the office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness (USD (P&R)), and OASD- SO/LIC.  Although DOD Directive 5111.10 states that the ASD- SO/LIC \u201cshall  advise and coordinate with the Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness on manpower\u201d issues, it does not define  whether manpower issues include SOF career management, such as  special pay and promotion. According to DOD officials, DOD lacks  overarching guidance that would clarify ASD-SO/LIC\u2019s role on  manpower issues. DOD Directive 5111.10 also does not provide  specific information about the extent of the ASD- SO/LIC\u2019s  coordination role as it relates, for example, to issues such as career  management, retirement, pay, or promotion with regard to USD (P&R)  responsibilities on SOF personnel management. As a result,  according to DOD officials, the lack of clear and updated guidance  has caused some confusion among DOD components. According to  OASD-SO/LIC officials, after section 922 was implemented, OASD-  SO/LIC\u2019s initial attempts to provide strategic outreach for SOF  personnel faced some challenges because officials were not included  in key personnel meetings. For example, OASD-SO/LIC officials told  us they were not included in some meetings that discussed delegating  civilian hiring waivers. By not participating in some key SOF  personnel-related meetings, OASD-SO/LIC could have missed the  opportunity to advocate for similar waiver authority. According to DOD  officials, USD (P&R) officials did not fully understand the ASD- SO/LIC\u2019s authorities under section 922 when OASD-SO/LIC officials  attended some meetings.", "Despite this confusion, the ASD-SO/LIC has taken some steps to  strengthen its role on SOF personnel issues. For example, according  to DOD officials, during the federal government civilian employee  hiring freeze, DOD delegated civilian employee hiring waivers to the  secretaries of the military departments but did not include waivers for  the ASD-SO/LIC or SOCOM. Without the waiver authority to re-instate  SOF personnel, SOCOM would have to request a waiver separately  through the military services. OASD-SO/LIC officials told us that by  ensuring the ASD-SO/LIC was granted a similar waiver authority,  OASD-SO/LIC officials streamlined the process and supported  SOCOM\u2019s efforts to hire additional SOF civilian personnel. However,  the ASD-SO/LIC\u2019s authority on SOF personnel matters remains  unclear and SOF personnel issues are generally dispersed among the  authorities of USD (P&R), military services, and SOCOM. Overall, it  remains unclear what, if any, authorities the ASD-SO/LIC has with  respect to leading and coordinating the department\u2019s SOF personnel  issues.", "Budgetary authority: SOF-related budgetary issues include the  SOCOM special operations\u2013specific\u2013funding budget materials, the  POM, acquisition, and congressional requests for information, among  other things. DOD officials told us that before section 922 was  enacted, the ASD-SO/LIC reviewed SOF-peculiar budget materials  (generally linked to major force program funding) prior to submission  of the POM, and the ASD-SO/LIC was notified of SOF-related  congressional unfunded priority list submissions. The ASD-SO/LIC  did not have principal staff assistant authority to approve the POM.  DOD Directive 5111.10 states that the ASD-SO/LIC will provide  overall supervision of the preparation and justification of the SOF  budget and programs and will review the SOCOM POM. However, the  DOD directive has not been updated to provide the ASD-SO/LIC with  clear oversight and approval authority over special operations\u2013 specific funding, which traditionally has been controlled by SOCOM.  DOD Directive 5111.10 also states that the ASD-SO/LIC will advise  and coordinate with the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition  and Technology on acquisition priorities, but this does not provide the  ASD-SO/LIC with oversight of the SOF acquisition process. In  addition, DOD does not have any guidance that gives ASD-SO/LIC  clear oversight roles regarding the SOF acquisition process. By  comparison, SOCOM is responsible for the development and  acquisition of special operations-peculiar equipment, materiel,  supplies, and services in accordance with section 167(e) of Title 10,  U.S. Code, and it executes funding in operation and maintenance,  procurement, and military construction accounts, among other things.  According to OASD-SO/LIC senior officials, the ASD-SO/LIC has  some authority over special operations\u2013specific funding through the  POM process. According to OASD-SO/LIC officials, after  implementing section 922, the ASD-SO/LIC established a new  principal staff assistant authority to approve the POM in 2018.  However, DOD officials familiar with SOF-related budgetary issues  stated that it is unclear how much authority the ASD-SO/LIC has over  funding issues to adjudicate potential disagreements between the  services and SOCOM on either SOF-specific or common funding  issues.", "Special Access Programs (SAP): SAPs are programs established  for a specific class of classified information that impose safeguarding  and access requirements that exceed those normally required for  information at the same classification level. Given the sensitive nature  of these programs, DOD has established different levels of authorities  to create and manage SAPs. According to DOD Directive 5205.07,  Special Access Program (SAP) Policy, the Deputy Secretary of  Defense designates certain DOD component heads, or DOD agency  heads\u2014for example, the secretary of a military department or the  Commander, SOCOM\u2014as cognizant authorities to manage and  execute their respective SAPs. While the ASD-SO/LIC has always  played a role in SOF-related SAPs, DOD officials stated that the role  is expected to evolve as part of the implementation of section 922.  OASD-SO/LIC\u2019s February 2019 monthly report includes several  actions intended to enhance the ASD-SO/LIC\u2019s role in the  management of SAPs, and OASD-SO/LIC has already begun  participating in various SAP-related conferences and meetings.  However, according to DOD officials, the ASD-SO/LIC\u2019s future role  related to SAPs remains unclear in existing guidance. For example,  DOD Directive 5111.10 states that the ASD-SO/LIC will provide  oversight over all special operations and low-intensity conflict related  sensitive SAPs. Although the ASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM officials told  us that they are currently further defining these roles, the DOD  directive has not been updated to clarify whether the ASD-SO/LIC  should be included in the SAP governance process, which includes  designating the ASD-SO/LIC as a cognizant authority with service  secretary-like SAP responsibilities. DOD officials expressed some  concerns that until these matters are clarified in guidance, it will  remain unclear whether the ASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM should work  together on SAP issues, and how their relationships with the various  Under Secretaries of Defense with oversight authority will be  managed.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  management should define objectives clearly and assign responsibility for  key roles throughout the organization. Specifically, the standards call for management to define objectives in specific terms so that they are  understood at all levels of the entity. This involves clearly defining what is  to be achieved, who is to achieve it, how it will be achieved, and time  frames for its achievement. We have also previously reported that  management practices key to program success include clearly identifying  organizational roles and responsibilities and clarifying program  objectives. OASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM officials stated that updated  guidance is needed to help clarify the ASD-SO/LIC\u2019s roles and  responsibilities under section 922. In December 2018 OASD-SO/LIC  officials told us that they were starting to update guidance on the ASD- SO/LIC\u2019s roles and responsibilities under section 922 in DOD directive  5111.10. However, OASD-SO/LIC officials did not provide details about  the information that would be updated, and did not provide a copy of that  draft guidance. In addition, OASD-SO/LIC officials did not have clear time  frames regarding when the guidance will be updated.", "As DOD updates the ASD-SO/LIC\u2019s roles and responsibilities either in  DOD Directive 5111.10 or through new guidance, it has an opportunity to  clarify changes in its relationship with DOD components involved in  overseeing SOF administrative matters related to personnel, budgetary  authority, and SAPs. The SOF enterprise is a complex system, and  without clearly identified roles and responsibilities for a service secretary- like role for the ASD-SO/LIC, other DOD components\u2014such as the  military departments, USD (P), and USD (P&R) \u2014may not know the  extent of the ASD-SO/LIC\u2019s and SOCOM\u2019s authorities in key issues  where they have vested interests. For example, it will remain unclear  what authorities the ASD-SO/LIC has with regard to SOF-related  administrative matters, and which entities will have visibility over any  problems or resourcing decisions related to the SOF enterprise. By  clarifying the ASD-SO/LIC\u2019s roles and responsibilities with regard to its  relationship with SOCOM and other DOD components, DOD can more  effectively implement the intent of section 922."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Taken Steps to Develop a Hiring Plan but Has Not Fully Incorporated Some Key Strategic Workforce Planning Principles", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OASD-SO/LIC Has Hired Additional Personnel and Taken Steps to Develop a Hiring Plan to Guide Future Growth", "paragraphs": ["OASD-SO/LIC has taken steps to develop a hiring plan to identify  personnel requirements and an approach to hiring additional personnel.  DOD\u2019s efforts began in 2017, when OASD-SO/LIC commissioned the  Army Office of Manpower and Reserve Affairs to conduct a manpower  study to provide an analysis of manpower requirements based on  unconstrained resources that are necessary to satisfy the service  secretary-like responsibilities under section 922. The Army\u2019s manpower  study was based on nine functions, including budget, acquisitions, and  legislative activities. For each function, the study identified  corresponding tasks and the average man hours, or time needed, to  complete each task. The study, which was included in DOD\u2019s March 2018  report to Congress, ultimately estimated that up to 64 full-time equivalent  (FTE) positions might be needed to implement the ASD-SO/LIC\u2019s section  922 responsibilities. According to OASD-SO/LIC officials, the study  provided an initial framework for OASD-SO/LIC to determine its staffing  needs, but the study was not comprehensive and OASD-SO/LIC\u2019s hiring  needs will likely continue to change in the future.", "Over the past 2 years, according to OASD-SO/LIC officials, OASD- SO/LIC has begun to hire personnel to fulfill various roles and  responsibilities. Specifically, the number of FTEs hired to support OASD-  SO/LIC\u2019s implementation of section 922 increased from 14 in March 2018  to 24 as of December 2018. In addition, section 361 of the John S.  McCain NDAA for Fiscal Year 2019 gave the ASD-SO/LIC additional  flexibility to hire staff in fiscal year 2019. For example, section 361  directed that not less than $4 million in fiscal year 2019 shall be used to  fund additional civilian personnel to help implement section 922. Section  361 also provided the OASD-SO/LIC an exemption from the statutory  civilian personnel limitation in the Office of the Secretary of Defense  imposed by 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 143. Figure 2 shows OASD-SO/LIC\u2019s hiring  actions to date, along with key events related to the implementation of  section 922.", "In December 2018 OASD-SO/LIC officials completed a basic hiring plan  to guide future personnel growth as OASD-SO/LIC continues to  implement actions related to section 922. The plan\u2014documented in a  10 slide presentation\u2014includes OASD-SO/LIC\u2019s short-term hiring goals  through the start of fiscal year 2020, a hiring approach involving a mix of  permanent and temporary staff, and the identification of targeted skillsets  for personnel hired. For example, the plan includes targets related to  achieving key skills, such as force planning and shaping the President\u2019s  Budget for Fiscal Year 2021. The plan also calls for OASD-SO/LIC to  grow from 27 current FTEs to a total of 55 FTEs in fiscal year 2020."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OASD-SO/LIC\u2019s Hiring Plan Does Not Fully Incorporate Key Strategic Workforce-Planning Principles", "paragraphs": ["While OASD-SO/LIC\u2019s current hiring plan represents a first step toward  developing a broad overview of its hiring goals and some key hiring  considerations, it does not fully incorporate some leading practices for  strategic workforce-planning. As we have previously reported, strategic  workforce planning addresses two critical needs: (1) aligning an  organization\u2019s human capital program with its current and emerging  mission and programmatic goals; and (2) developing long-term strategies  for acquiring, developing, and retaining staff to achieve programmatic  goals. While agencies\u2019 approaches to workforce planning will vary, we  have previously identified several key principles that strategic workforce  planning should address, irrespective of the context in which the planning  is done. GAO\u2019s prior work on workforce planning identified the following  five key principles: involve top management, employees, and other  stakeholders in developing the strategic workforce plan; determine the  critical skills and competencies needed to achieve long-term goals;  develop strategies that are tailored to address critical competency gaps;  build the capacity needed to address requirements important to  supporting workforce strategies; and monitor and evaluate the agency\u2019s  progress toward its human capital goals. However, we found that as of  December 2018, the OASD-SO/LIC\u2019s hiring plan had not fully  incorporated several of these key strategic workforce-planning principles,  as described below:", "The hiring plan was not fully aligned with long-term goals. A key  principle in strategic workforce planning is strategic alignment, which  occurs when an agency\u2019s human capital program is linked with its  mission and goals. However, we found that OASD-SO/LIC has not  clearly linked its hiring plan with its overall mission and goals. For  example, the hiring plan mentions short-term goals, such as analyzing  the budget for fiscal year 2021 and long-term goals, such as strategic  assessment and aligning the organization with National Defense  Strategy requirements. However, the plan does not define strategic  assessment, and it lacks detail about how newly hired personnel in  fiscal year 2019 will help OASD-SO/LIC meet long-term goals related  to strategic assessment. For example, OASD-SO/LIC recently hired  seven personnel, but it is not clear whether the newly hired personnel  have skills that match competencies, such as the ability to work with  Special Access Programs, identified in OASD-SO/LIC\u2019s hiring plan.  We have previously reported that unless hiring needs are clearly  linked with long-term goals, the hiring plan may be incomplete or  premature.", "OASD-SO/LIC\u2019s approach did not fully involve stakeholders.", "While stakeholder involvement is not statutorily required, another key  principle of effective strategic workforce planning is to involve top  management, employees, and other stakeholders in developing,  communicating, and implementing strategic workforce plans. We  found several cases in which OASD-SO/LIC did not involve  stakeholders in its key efforts. For example, although OASD-SO/LIC  senior officials shared information about the hiring plan with one  senior official at SOCOM, several OASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM  officials stated that OASD-SO/LIC did not communicate the hiring  plan\u2019s expectations or strategies more broadly, to involve a full range  of OASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM officials and other stakeholders, such  as USD (P). In another example, when OASD-SO/LIC hired personnel  from September 2018 through December 2018, several OASD- SO/LIC and SOCOM officials were unclear about the specific roles  and responsibilities of new personnel hired.", "The hiring plan did not include strategies to address critical  competency gaps and identify related personnel requirements.  Leading principles of effective strategic workforce planning hold that  agencies should develop strategies to address critical skill gaps and  systematic personnel requirements processes, which are considered  a good human capital practice across government. However, we  found that OASD-SO/LIC\u2019s hiring plan did not include completed  competency-gap assessments or have procedures in place to  periodically reassess personnel requirements. Without a systematic  process to periodically assess personnel requirements, OASD-SO/LIC  could not determine whether the Army study\u2019s initial estimates were  the most efficient choice for the workforce. For example with regard to  the legislative affairs positions, OASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM officials  told us that the Army manpower study\u2019s initial estimate of eight FTEs  was too high. OASD-SO/LIC officials eventually hired two FTEs for  the legislative affairs office, but the hiring plan did not include a  methodology to analyze the workforce and explain why two FTEs  would fit within the Army study\u2019s framework. According to OASD- SO/LIC officials, OASD-SO/LIC also did not use a standardized  process to assess whether two FTEs would meet its requirements.", "According to OASD-SO/LIC officials, the hiring plan is the first step in  developing an initial framework, and they stated that it lacked  implementation details. OASD-SO/LIC officials stated that they anticipate  building upon the hiring plan as the current workforce plan evolves over  time. In addition, OASD-SO/LIC officials stated that key priorities include  strengthening OASD-SO/LIC\u2019s participation and oversight of SOF  resources through the POM and fiscal guidance processes. As a result,  the hiring plan includes information about new personnel focused on  fiscal oversight, such as analyzing the budget in fiscal years 2020 through  2021, but it does not clarify long-term goals, competency gaps, and  program results tied to other priorities, such as legislative and acquisition- related functions. Officials from OASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM agreed that  incorporating key principles in the strategic workforce plan would help  them determine the most appropriate size and composition of OASD- SO/LIC\u2019s workforce.", "Until OASD-SO/LIC completes a comprehensive strategic workforce plan  that includes key principles as outlined above, OASD-SO/LIC may not  know what gaps exist in skills and competencies, and what their  workforce strategies to fill those gaps should be. These issues could put  OASD-SO/LIC at risk of hiring personnel who may not adequately meet  its needs as defined by section 922."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As DOD increasingly relies on SOF, the department has taken steps to  implement section 922. Given the expanded statutory authority under  section 922, the ASD-SO/LIC has greater authority to oversee and  advocate for the SOF enterprise. The ASD-SO/LIC has implemented  several actions to clarify and strengthen its oversight roles and  responsibilities, and it has many additional planned actions underway.  However, without time frames to implement action items and revised or  new guidance that clearly articulates the ASD-SO/LIC\u2019s roles and  responsibilities with regard to SOCOM and the wider SOF enterprise,  these changes may not be fully effective. In addition, without a strategic  workforce plan that fully incorporates leading practices to ensure that the  department has the right people, in the right place, at the right time,  OASD-SO/LIC may not be well prepared to respond to future workload  changes and manage its human capital strategically. As OASD-SO/LIC  makes progress in its hiring plan, it is important for OASD-SO/LIC to  develop a strategic workforce plan to ensure that it appropriately  addresses the human-capital challenges of the future and better  contributes to the agency\u2019s efforts to meet its missions and goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We are making three recommendations to the Secretary of Defense:  The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict defines time  frames for completing action items necessary to implement the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for SO/LIC\u2019s expanded section 922 responsibilities.

In  its response, DOD stated that most time frames have been established or  the action completed. Additionally, DOD noted that some actions may not  be completed because they depend on events, actions or leadership  decisions that are outside of OASD-SO/LIC\u2019s control. We agree that  some DOD leadership decisions have yet to be made. However, 28 out of  31 already identified actions do not have clear time frames for  implementation. Further, time frames can be modified as events change  or better information becomes available.   As we discuss in the report,  establishing time frames with key milestones to track implementation  progress are important for agency reform efforts. Without clear time  frames, ASD-SO/LIC may not be able to fully execute its service  secretary-like authority.", "DOD partially concurred with the second recommendation that the ASD- SO/LIC update DOD Directive 5111.10 to clarify the roles and  responsibilities of the ASD-SO/LIC and relationships with DOD  components that have vested interests in the SOF enterprise. DOD is in  the process of revising this directive, but DOD noted that the purpose of  DOD Directive 5111.10 is to define only specific Department-wide roles  and missions for ASD-SO/LIC and is not the appropriate issuance to  define ASD-SO/LIC\u2019s relationship with other DOD components in the SOF  enterprise. Given that DOD does not believe DOD Directive 5111.10 is  the appropriate issuance to clarify ASD-SO/LIC\u2019s relationships with DOD  components, we modified our recommendation from focusing solely on  updating DOD Directive 5111.10 to updating existing guidance and/or  developing new guidance. Updating or developing guidance that clarifies  ASD SO/LIC\u2019s relationship with DOD components, such as the military  departments, USD (P), and USD (P&R) would likely allow for improved  oversight of and collaboration on SOF matters related to personnel,  budgetary authority and SAPs.", "DOD partially concurred with the third recommendation that the ASD- SO/LIC  build upon its hiring plan by developing a strategic workforce  plan that incorporates key principles, such as aligning the plan with long- term mission goals; fully involving stakeholders in developing the plan;  and including strategies to address critical competency gaps and identify  related personnel requirements. In its response, DOD agreed that there is  room to improve the involvement of stakeholders. In addition, DOD stated  that it developed a strategic workforce plan that aligns with long-term  mission goals and has identified strategies to address critical competency  gaps, including target skillsets. However, as noted in our report, the 10  slide presentation that constitutes the hiring plan lacks details that would  be included in a comprehensive workforce plan. For example, the hiring  plan did not explain how the hiring needs would be specifically tied to  long-term goals, such as National Defense Strategy requirements.  Although the hiring plan mentions some skillsets, it does not include a  competency gap assessment or assess personnel requirements. As  noted in our report, OASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM officials stated that the  initial personnel requirements developed by the Army study were  inaccurate for several reasons, including the lack of a standardized  process to assess personnel requirements. Accordingly, we continue to  believe that until OASD-SO/LIC develops a comprehensive strategic  workforce plan that includes key principles outlined in our report, OASD- SO/LIC could be at risk of hiring personnel who may not adequately meet  its needs to perform the roles and responsibilities of section 922.", "We are sending copies of this report to other interested congressional  committees and the Acting Secretary of Defense.
