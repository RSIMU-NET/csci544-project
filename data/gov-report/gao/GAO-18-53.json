According to GAO's analysis of fraud alerts and complaint data, the type of fraud participants may encounter\u2014such as waiting-list, rental, and side-payment fraud\u2014depends on where they are in the HCV process and whether they are applicants, voucher holders, or landlords, as shown in the figure below. For example, side-payment fraud involves agreements\u2014mutual or compelled\u2014in which the voucher holder pays additional rent or other payments to the landlord for benefits, for example to secure a rental or avoid eviction.", "According to GAO's survey of PHAs representing approximately 1.9 million households, PHAs reported few incidents of the various fraud types, although side-payment fraud, a program violation, was noted most frequently. Specifically, GAO estimates that while 41 percent of PHAs were aware of instances of side-payment fraud in the prior year, most reported 2 to 5 incidents in the prior year. In addition, 3 to 10 percent of PHAs were aware of instances of the other types of fraud GAO identified. GAO's online covert testing also found few indicators of potential fraud. For example, some websites requested payment for information about the HCV application process, but none explicitly offered to do something prohibited by program rules, such as placing someone on a waiting list for a fee.", "The Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) and PHAs' antifraud regulations, guidance, and information largely focus on efforts to protect the HCV program. For example, PHAs are required by HUD to inform families of program-related fraud and abuse, including the prohibition against side payments. In addition, GAO found that several PHAs voluntarily provide targeted messages to participants about fraud schemes by outside parties. Through industry associations, PHAs have mechanisms through which they share best practices that could include these and other issues."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["With the goal of providing safe, decent, and affordable housing to low- income families, the elderly, and the disabled, the U.S. Department of  Housing and Urban Development (HUD) supplements tenants\u2019 rental  payments in privately owned housing chosen by tenants through its  Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program. This program is administered  locally by approximately 2,200 Public Housing Agencies (PHA) around  the country. In fiscal year 2016, HUD received approximately $20 billion  for the HCV program, providing rental assistance to approximately 2.4  million households. Local demand in the program may exceed voucher  supply, and households may be on waiting lists for years before they  receive a voucher. In addition, after receiving a voucher, participants have  a limited amount of time to secure a rental.

In this report, we describe (1) the types of  reported fraud schemes committed against HCV participants (including  older adults), awareness by PHAs and other relevant organizations of  fraud incidents and how often they occur, and indicators of such schemes  online; and (2) antifraud regulations, guidance, and informational  materials, if any, that HUD and PHAs have in place to identify and  mitigate fraud against program participants.", "For our first objective, we employed a number of methodologies.  Specifically, to describe the types of fraud schemes reported as being  committed against HCV participants in 2016 and 2017, we searched for  fraud alerts that a nongeneralizable sample of 60 PHAs publicly posted  on the Internet and reviewed the 22 alerts (posted by 20 separate PHAs)  that we found. We also reviewed complaints from the Federal Trade  Commission\u2019s (FTC) Consumer Sentinel database for calendar years  2011 through 2016. We reviewed complaint data to identify examples of  housing and HCV-specific fraud, including schemes affecting older adults.  We assessed the reliability of the data by interviewing officials and  reviewing related documentation, and found the data sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of our reporting objectives. We also interviewed PHA  officials about fraud schemes against HCV participants. Finally, we  identified key academic research that classified online rental fraud, and  interviewed one of the authors of the research.", "To determine awareness of incidents of fraud schemes among PHAs and  other relevant organizations, we surveyed PHA officials and conducted  site visits to interview PHAs and other relevant organizations and experts.  In our survey of a nationally representative, random sample of executive  directors of 278 PHAs, we asked about their awareness of fraud against  participants, in the last year (spring 2016\u2013spring 2017), within the  jurisdiction to which they provide oversight. If the executive directors  responded that they were aware of these schemes, we asked that they  provide information on the number of incidents, within their jurisdiction,  that they were aware of in the prior year. Examples of fraud types  included in the survey were promising placement or a higher place on a  voucher waiting list, selling fake vouchers, theft of security deposits,  requiring side payments and favors, and offering suspect credit-report  services. We surveyed executive directors from all 83 PHAs that  administered 5,000 or more vouchers as of the fourth quarter of 2015,  and a probability sample of 195 executive directors of PHAs with 1,000 to  4,999 vouchers. The survey had a response rate of 84 percent and is  generalizable to the full population of PHAs that administer at least 1,000  vouchers. In addition, we interviewed eight PHAs in total, from locations  in the Midwest, Northeast, and West Coast regions of the United States.  These PHAs were selected using criteria to provide a range of PHAs  across geographical locations and PHA size, among other factors.  Moreover, we also interviewed an HCV voucher holder about the holder\u2019s  knowledge of fraud against participants. We also interviewed industry  experts\u2014selected based on their expertise and experience with legal and  financial issues affecting older adults and low-income individuals\u2014about  fraud affecting older adults, and about identity theft affecting low-income  individuals. Finally, we interviewed officials from the HUD Office of  Inspector General (OIG).", "To identify indicators of fraud schemes online, we used covert testing to  investigate (1) a nongeneralizable sample of 350 rental advertisements in  a selection of U.S. cities across several rental websites, and (2) a  nongeneralizable sample of 26 commercial websites advertising  information on, or assistance with, the HCV program. For our sample of  rental advertisements, we counted any communications with online  advertisers as having an indicator of fraud if they contained requests such  as asking for a wire transfer of a security deposit or first month rent  without first offering to show the property. For commercial websites, we  used multiple search terms across two search engines to produce a list of  target websites. Using undercover identities, we visited each website and  input any requested information, including a name and e-mail address,  and made a payment if the website requested payment for a service. We  also asked website operators whether they could place us on a waiting  list. Because covert testing of advertisements and websites was carried  out on a nongeneralizable sample, results of this effort are also  nongeneralizable.", "To describe antifraud regulations, guidance, and informational materials,  we reviewed relevant HUD regulations and policy documentation, as well  as informational materials developed by the eight PHAs we interviewed,  designed to educate HCV participants about the program. We interviewed  PHA officials about the HCV program and about the information they  provide to participants. We also interviewed officials from FTC, the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the HUD OIG, the U.S. Postal  Inspection Service, and the Department of Health and Human Services  about practices used by federal agencies to inform the public about fraud- related issues.

If the household moves out of the unit, it can move with  continued assistance to another private rental unit.", "PHAs administer the HCV program at the local level, while HUD  administers funding and furnishes technical and professional assistance  to PHAs in planning, developing, and managing the program.  Approximately 2,200 PHAs across the country administer the voucher  program on HUD\u2019s behalf, managing day-to-day operations in the HCV  program, including the application and voucher distribution processes, as  well as housing inspection and approval. PHAs are responsible for  ensuring that rents are reasonable, determining households\u2019 eligibility,  calculating and periodically redetermining households\u2019 incomes and rental  payments, and making subsidy payments to landlords. In addition, PHAs  perform basic program functions, such as establishing and maintaining a  waiting list, processing tenant moves, conducting landlord and tenant  outreach, and reporting to HUD.", "Local PHAs determine the eligibility of households, approve applications,  and distribute vouchers. In general, to be eligible to participate in the HCV  program, households must have very low incomes\u2014that is, incomes not  exceeding 50 percent of the area median income. Moreover, at least 75  percent of new voucher program participants must have extremely low  incomes, not exceeding 30 percent of the area median income. Once a  household is approved by a PHA to participate in the program and finds a  rental unit, that household pays 30 percent of its monthly income, after  certain adjustments, toward rent. The remaining portion of the rent is paid  through the HUD-subsidized voucher. PHAs can pay subsidies to cover  between 90 percent and 110 percent of the fair market rent for their  areas.", "The HCV application and rental process is displayed in figure 1.", "The following applies in the HCV application process:", "Households seeking to enter the HCV program may wait years for  their local PHA to announce an open application period. PHAs may  establish waiting lists if the number of applicants to the program  exceeds available vouchers, and may close the waiting list if it  contains more households than the PHA can assist in the near future.  Therefore, prospective applicants in some locations can wait years for  a local PHA to determine the eligibility of those already on the waiting  list\u2014and provide vouchers to eligible individuals\u2014before reopening  waiting lists to new applicants.", "During open application periods, applicant households may encounter  processes and requirements that vary amongst PHAs. Applying for a  voucher from a local PHA may take place in person or online, while  PHAs may determine an applicant\u2019s priority to receive a voucher by  varying methods, such as a random lottery amongst all applicants, or  on a first-come-first-serve ordering of when applicants applied.  Moreover, PHAs can establish local preferences for selecting  applicants from their waiting lists. For example, PHAs may give  preference to a household that (1) is homeless or living in  substandard housing, (2) is paying more than 50 percent of its income  for rent, or (3) has an older-adult household member. Regardless of  methods to determine eligibility, apply for, and obtain a voucher within  the HCV program, it is free to participants.", "When an open application period ends and before determining  household eligibility, PHAs may initially put applicant households on a  waiting list. Because the demand for vouchers may exceed the supply  available to the local PHA, households that have already waited to  apply to the program may also wait years to receive a determination  of eligibility and receive a voucher.", "After receiving a voucher, households must find eligible private- market rental housing within a limited time frame. A PHA will make  contact with and issue a voucher to a household that is determined to  be eligible and is subsequently selected from the waiting list.  Households receiving vouchers use them to subsidize their rents in  private apartments or houses available in the rental market.  Households must find housing quickly\u2014generally within 60 days\u2014 unless the PHA grants an extension. In some cases, PHAs direct  voucher holders to websites dedicated to rentals in the HCV program,  where private landlords list available units.", "When a voucher-holding household finds a unit that it wishes to  occupy\u2014and reaches an agreement with the landlord over the lease  terms\u2014the PHA inspects the dwelling and determines whether the  rent requested is reasonable. To be eligible, a rental unit must meet  HUD minimum housing-quality standards, and must provide an  acceptable level of health and safety. After the unit is inspected and  deemed eligible, the household signs a contract with HUD, and both  HUD and the household sign contracts with the landlord. The contract  stipulates that the PHA will make the housing-assistance payment to  the landlord and the household will pay the difference between the  housing-assistance payment and the rent. Landlord participation in  the HCV program is free, and landlords do not pay to maintain  compliance with the program. Moreover, the HCV program provides  for the use of vouchers across locations. Once a household receives  a voucher, it may use the voucher in any location in which a PHA  administers the voucher program, as long as it remains eligible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Various Reported Fraud Schemes against Housing Choice Voucher Participants Can Occur, but PHAs Reported Limited Incidents, and GAO Covert Testing Found Limited Online Indicators of Fraud", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Waiting-List, Rental, and Side-Payment Fraud Are among the Reported Types of Schemes That Can Affect Voucher Participants", "paragraphs": ["Reported fraud schemes against program participants\u2014including  prospective applicants, individuals on waiting lists, current voucher  holders, and landlords providing rental units\u2014can occur at each point in  the HCV application and rental process, according to program officials  and our analysis of FTC complaint data. On the basis of our reviews of  fraud alerts issued by PHAs and complaints submitted to the FTC, the  type of fraud that participants, including older adults, may encounter  depends on where they are in the process and whether they are landlords  or renters. Fraudsters perpetrate reported schemes in a variety of ways,  such as through in-person impersonation of PHA staff or by manipulating  telephone numbers to convince landlords to make unnecessary  payments. Reported types of fraud schemes and when they could  potentially occur in the HCV application and rental process are displayed  in figure 2.", "As shown in figure 2, various reported fraud types can be carried out  against HCV participants. While some fraud types are specific to the HCV  program, participants may also be victims of general rental-housing fraud.  The reported fraud types, which we identified through interviews with  PHAs and others and through an analysis of PHA fraud alerts and  Consumer Sentinel complaints, include the following:", "Waiting-List Placement Fraud. In online or in-person settings,  fraudsters may claim they can provide a voucher, place applicants  onto a waiting list, or move individuals to a higher position on the  waiting list. In exchange, fraudsters may request a payment, or may  request information (such as name, credit-card number, and e-mail  address) that may put participants at risk of credit-card fraud or  identity theft. Waiting lists maintained by PHAs may open  infrequently, and program application processes and requirements  vary from location to location. Reported fraud schemes may take  advantage of applicant unfamiliarity with program rules, and target  those seeking to enter the program or awaiting a voucher.", "Rental-Advertisement Fraud. Because they rent in the private market,  voucher holders are susceptible to online rental-fraud schemes.  Those who place online rental advertisements may request wire  transfers from prospective renters to secure fake rentals, or steer  potential renters to suspect credit-reporting services that offer  commissions to the scammers or realtor services that charge users a  onetime or recurring monthly fee.", "Side-Payment Fraud. Officials from PHAs and other organizations  characterized side payments as two distinct activities\u2014alternatively,  as landlord fraud against tenants on one hand, and mutually beneficial  agreements between tenants and landlords on the other. In exchange  for property rental or successful inspection, landlords or building  inspectors may fraudulently request additional payments or pressure  participants for other favors from voucher holders. Landlords may ask  tenants for a monthly payment above the agreed rent, or may require  HCV participants to pay for utilities when not required to in their rental  agreement. For example, a Midwest PHA we interviewed reported  being aware of coercive demands by landlords for side payments or  sexual favors in exchange for a rental unit. Side payments may also  be a mutual arrangement between landlord and voucher holders. For  example, voucher holders may make a payment above their monthly  rent\u2014in violation of program rules\u2014and in exchange the landlord  agrees not to report that there are unauthorized occupants living in  the unit, again in violation of program rules. A West Coast PHA we  interviewed characterized most side payments it is aware of as mutual  agreements of this type.", "Security-Deposit Fraud. Because they rent in the private market,  voucher holders may encounter fraudsters advertising a rental and  requiring a security deposit from one or several prospective renters  even if there is no rental unit available or only one of the prospective  renters will ultimately obtain the rental.", "Program-Compliance Fraud against Landlords. Fraudsters may take  advantage of landlord unfamiliarity with HCV program rules. In calls to  HCV program landlords, fraudsters mask their phone number with that  of the local PHA, and direct the landlords to make a credit-card  payment over the phone to purchase materials or to make a payment  in order to remain in compliance with program rules."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PHAs Are Aware of Limited Instances of Fraud Affecting Voucher Participants in Their Jurisdictions, with Side- Payment Fraud Reported Most Often", "paragraphs": ["An overwhelming majority of surveyed PHAs did not report awareness of  any occurrences of most fraud types that could affect HCV program  participants, while those that were aware of fraud against participants  reported few instances, according to our survey results and interviews.  We surveyed a nationally representative sample of PHAs representing  approximately 1.9 million households. We inquired about incidents  occurring within their area of jurisdiction from spring 2016 through spring  2017. We asked about fraudsters promising placement onto or a higher  place on a waiting list, selling vouchers, stealing security deposits, or  offering suspect credit-report services; voucher holders and landlords  engaging in side payments; and landlords and building inspectors illegally  soliciting favors. Apart from incidents of side payments (discussed in  detail below), on the basis of PHA responses to our survey we estimate  that between 3 and 10 percent of all PHAs with 1,000 or more vouchers  were aware of any occurrences of the types of fraud schemes included in  our survey (see fig. 3). Further, when PHAs were aware of such fraud  schemes, most reported between 2 to 5 cases in their local area of  jurisdiction from spring 2016 through spring 2017. Our other sources of  evidence were consistent with our survey results. For example, we  interviewed officials with two PHA associations\u2014representing  approximately 1,900 total PHAs\u2014about fraud against HCV participants  (other than side payments). The associations reported that they were  unaware of widespread instances of these types of fraud against  participants.", "PHAs were much more likely to report awareness of incidents of side  payments than the other types of fraud included in our survey, according  to our analysis of survey responses. As noted above, side-payment fraud  involves agreements\u2014mutual or compelled\u2014in which the voucher holder  pays additional rent or other payments to the landlord in return for  benefits, to secure a rental, or to avoid eviction. On the basis of survey  responses, we estimate that 41 percent of all PHAs with 1,000 or more  vouchers were aware of incidents of side payments in the prior year, as  shown in figure 3 above. Of PHAs reporting side payments, we estimate  that the vast majority (93 percent) were aware of 1 to 10 instances of side  payments in the prior year (spring 2016\u2013spring 2017), with most reporting  between 2 and 5 incidents in the past year. Further, we estimate that 7  percent were aware of 11 or more instances in the prior year.", "Officials from all eight PHAs we interviewed similarly told us that they  were aware of side payments, but some said that participants rarely  report cases of side payments to them. Because violation of HVC rules  could result in termination of a lease or loss of voucher for the recipient, it  is possible that side payments are not always reported to PHAs. Two  experts providing legal services to low-income individuals said that, in  regard to fraud affecting HCV participants, landlord requests for side  payments is relatively more common than other types of fraud. In  addition, a current voucher holder told us about personal experiences  involving requests for such payments by landlords, but also said that he  or she had not experienced any other types of fraud.", "In response to our open-ended survey question on other fraud not  specifically mentioned in the survey, three PHAs in two regions reported  variations of a type of fraud that intends to convince landlords that they  are not in compliance with HCV rules, and that they must make a  payment over the phone. Although this type of fraud was not included  explicitly in our survey and is therefore not included in figure 3 above, in  survey comments one West Coast PHA and two PHAs in the Southeast  reported instances of this type of fraud. In open-ended survey comments,  a West Coast PHA reported being aware of two attempts of similar fraud,  in which fraudsters called landlords and asked them to make a credit-card  payment over the phone to maintain program compliance. Similarly, two  southeastern PHAs also reported being aware of instances of similar  fraud schemes in the last year, although neither provided the number of  cases reported to them. Furthermore, another West Coast PHA that was  not included in our survey issued an online alert about scammers calling  landlords, masking their actual phone number with the PHA\u2019s phone  number, and stating that in order for the landlord to maintain program  compliance, the landlord must make a credit-card payment over the  phone to purchase a program manual. In an interview, officials from this  PHA reported being aware of 36 attempts of this fraud type against  landlords from September 2015 to April 2017.", "According to PHA officials, fraud schemes generally have not targeted  older-adult HCV participants. In survey responses, a limited number of  PHAs reported fraud against older adults. For example, we estimate that  of PHAs reporting awareness of side-payment schemes, very few PHAs  (about 8 percent) were aware of instances in which landlords targeted  older adults in side-payment requests. Moreover, an official from one  PHA we interviewed stated that because older adults are likely to have  advocates helping them to find housing, they are less likely than other  HCV participants to be victims of fraud. Similarly, one expert providing  legal services to older adults in the HCV program indicated that project- based participants\u2014who rent units only in specific buildings\u2014are more  likely than HCV participants to be targets of in-person fraud because they  are located in identifiable properties.", "Several PHAs issued fraud alerts about schemes against participants, but  officials at PHAs we interviewed about some of the alerts told us that  incidents of these fraud types were limited. Specifically:", "A Midwestern PHA issued an alert about an individual promising a  voucher for a fee and meeting victims in person to receive payment.  In a follow-up interview, PHA officials stated that, in total, they  received five to seven reports about this fraud. Each of these cases  occurred while the PHA\u2019s waiting list was open in 2015. A nearby PHA  also reported that when its waiting list was open in 2011, an individual  with fake PHA credentials fraudulently took payment from individuals  and promised to move them to the top of the waiting list. The PHA  was aware of 10 individuals who were victims of the fraud, and  estimated that they each paid about $200 to the perpetrator.", "A West Coast PHA issued an alert about a website charging  applicants to submit a program application. However, in an interview  the PHA reported awareness of only one case over the last 3 years of  fraud committed by outside parties against voucher participants.", "Although instances of fraud against HCV participants reported to PHAs  appear relatively rare, participants who provide personal information to  unknown individuals are still at risk for identity theft, according to some  experts we interviewed. Two identity-theft experts stated that credit-card  fraud is likely if individuals enter payment information in unverified sites.  Furthermore, one expert stated that low-income individuals can be targets  for identity theft because fraudsters can use stolen identities with low  credit scores to obtain high-interest loans that they do not intend to pay  off."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Few Indicators of Potential Fraud Found in Online Covert Testing", "paragraphs": ["In covert testing using undercover tools and techniques, we found no  indicators of fraud in rental advertisements posted online, and few  indicators of fraud in commercial websites offering information to  participants about the HCV program.", "Through our online covert testing, we found no indicators of potential  fraud in 350 advertisements\u2014selected using a random-selection  methodology\u2014posted in online marketplaces across six cities. On the  basis of an academic study of online fraud schemes on rental  marketplaces and information provided by PHAs, we developed a list of  indicators of potential fraud. These indicators include requests for a wire  transfer of security deposit or first month rent without offering to provide  an in-person viewing of the property, or requesting an up-front or monthly  side-payment agreement as a condition of rental. In searches of one  rental website, we came across a small number of advertisements that  initially appeared to contain an indicator of potential fraud\u2014specifically,  links to a website for specialized realtor services; covert testing of that link  did not find further indicators of potential fraud.", "None of the 26 commercial websites we covertly tested contained text  explicitly stating that they would place or move someone up a waiting list  for a fee.

Payment to the website resulted in  access to a guide and online forum containing a list of open PHA  waiting lists for the HCV program and links to publicly available PHA  websites.", "One website we covertly tested requested payment for an e-book  guide to assist with the HCV application process. We made payment  but never received the e-book.", "One website subject to covert testing stated that landlords in the HCV  program may deny or refuse to rent to a potential tenant based on his  or her credit-report information, and referred us to a suspect website  offering credit reports. The website claimed to offer a \u201cfree credit  report\u201d and requested personal information including a Social Security  number and credit-card number. As part of our covert testing, we  provided a credit-card number. We also entered all zeroes as a Social  Security number on the site, prompting the site to state that it could  not provide us with a credit report, as we had not provided a valid  Social Security number. Despite that fact, the site charged our credit  card a recurring payment.

For example, an applicant  misrepresenting income and assets to obtain an HCV voucher and a  landlord bribing a PHA employee to approve substandard rental housing  are types of program fraud. See figure 4 for examples of HCV program- related fraud listed in the guidebook.", "Education and outreach requirements for PHAs specified in the HCV  guidebook largely focus on providing adequate public notice of waiting-list  openings; an oral briefing when the PHA selects a family to participate in  the program; and a written briefing packet for participants, which must  include a variety of subjects related to program administration, leasing a  unit, and family obligations. Consistent with the guidebook, written or  online briefing materials from the eight PHAs we interviewed mention  various types of program violations.

If the PHA finds that the landlord  is collecting side payments, the PHA must notify the landlord to  immediately cease collecting these payments and require repayment to  the tenant of the full amount collected. The PHA must determine whether  the landlord also collected side payments from other participants and  follow up to require repayment.

For example, in  program briefing documents given to participants, a northeastern PHA warns participants of housing-assistance scams,  and specifically advises participants not to pay to, among other things,  (1) be placed on or be moved up a waiting list or (2) receive an HCV  voucher or voucher extension; a different northeastern PHA advises HCV participants not to give  their voucher to anyone, including the apartment owner, agent, or  property manager; and not to give any money to the apartment  broker, owner, or agent until the PHA approves the selected  apartment; and a West Coast PHA advises HCV applicants and participants to be  aware of fraud, particularly schemes that require a payment to file an  application or to move up a waiting list.", "In addition, PHAs share best practices that could include these and other  issues. For example, two industry associations representing  approximately 1,900 PHAs provide mechanisms for PHAs to share  information and best practices about HCV administration and issues  affecting HCV program participants and their communities. Both regularly  hold conferences, meetings, and other events that provide a venue for  members to discuss relevant issues.
