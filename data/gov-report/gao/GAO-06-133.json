In addition, USCIS streamlined the intercountry adoption process by eliminating the application and fees for parents to obtain U.S. citizenship certificates for eligible children.

Factors in foreign countries' environments may allow for abuses in adoptions. To reduce the likelihood of such abuses, USCIS and State have taken such steps as holding diplomatic discussions with foreign governments and imposing additional U.S. procedural requirements. However, USCIS has not established a formal and systematic process for documenting specific incidents of problems in foreign countries. Such a process would allow for a systematic approach to analyze problematic trends and retain institutional knowledge. The Hague Convention governing intercountry adoptions establishes minimum standards designed to help alleviate some of the risk associated with the adoption process. The United States has signed the Convention and taken several steps toward implementing the Convention; however, key steps remain, including formal ratification of the Convention.

The U.S.  intercountry adoption process is managed by the Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s (DHS) U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and  the Department of State (State) and is complicated by a number of  domestic and foreign government requirements for adopting a child from  another country.

To adopt a foreign-born child that will live in  the United States, the prospective parents must meet qualifications  outlined by U.S. immigration law. Additionally, the child and the  prospective parents must meet the legal requirements for adoption in the  child\u2019s country of origin, and the child must meet requirements outlined by  U.S. immigration law to enter the United States. Despite the existence of  such U.S. and foreign government regulations, a number of factors in  foreign countries, such as corruption, may lead to abuses in intercountry  adoption procedures.

Country-specific adoption requirements, particularly in the top sending  countries of U.S. intercountry adoptions, may contribute to the different  time frames it may take to adopt a child. For example, the Russian  government requires adoptive parents to travel to Russia to meet the  prospective adoptive child. Since Russia also requires that the child remain  in Russia before the court hearing, adoptive parents may travel a second  time to Russia to attend the court hearing and adopt the child. In addition,  procedural requirements in the foreign country may be difficult to meet.  For instance, in Guatemala, birth certificates of the adopted child and  documents proving the identity of birth mothers may be difficult and time- consuming to locate. Other factors, such as the prospective parents\u2019 ability  to provide adequate and timely information to meet U.S. intercountry  adoption requirements, may also contribute to the length of time it takes  for U.S. government officials to approve adoptions. For example,  prospective parents may file application forms for intercountry adoptions  to USCIS, which allows prospective parents up to 12 months to submit  supportive documentation, such as the home study. Estimated total  adoption costs incurred by adoptive parents may also vary depending on  the foreign country.

The Commissioner of the Immigration and  Naturalization Service (INS) made intercountry adoptions a priority for  the agency in March 2002, after the Commissioner suspended orphan visa  processing for Cambodia. The INS created an adoptions task force with  State to comprehensively review the existing INS structure for handling  intercountry adoptions. The task force identified several priorities to  improve the intercountry adoption process, and the agencies have, over the  past 3 years, addressed many of the priorities by taking the following  actions:   Improved interagency coordination: The task force suggested that  coordination needed to continue and that USCIS consider how adoption  work should be distributed and coordinated between USCIS and State.  USCIS and State\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs have established a  relationship to work together to address and resolve adoption issues.  For instance, the agencies hold quarterly meetings to coordinate  implementing changes to regulations, discuss challenges to the process,  and improve the forms used by officials in the process. In particular,  USCIS and State officials regularly discuss specific adoption cases and  issues that arise in overseas posts, as well as regulatory, administrative,  and policy matters related to intercountry adoptions. Moreover, in April  2005, USCIS and State\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs officials met at a  USCIS field office to establish a mechanism for sharing information on  visa processing.", "Improved efforts to communicate with parents: The adoptions task  force identified the need for USCIS and State to provide advisory  notices for prospective adoptive parents. The task force suggested that  emphasis should be placed on ensuring that parents were consistently  informed about procedures, as well as prohibitions related to child  buying in the process, and that parents receive the most current and  complete information available on issues identified in countries where  adoptions occur. To improve communications with parents, USCIS and  State\u2019s Office of Children\u2019s Issues in the Bureau of Consular Affairs  provide information on their Web sites, USCIS and State officials meet  with adoption organizations and parents to discuss various issues and  USCIS field offices have taken steps to provide customer service to  parents. For example, USCIS and State Web sites provide information  on the process in the United States and overseas, and the roles of both  agencies, and alert parents to potential concerns through advisory  notices about adoption procedures in other countries. USCIS and State\u2019s  Office of Children\u2019s Issues provide outreach to parents and the adoption  community by presenting information at regional and national  conferences. In the two domestic USCIS field offices we visited, we  found that officials had taken several actions to communicate with  prospective adoptive parents, such as establishing procedures to meet  prospective parents and providing telephone numbers for parents to  directly contact the Adoption Adjudication Officer.", "Developed standard operating procedures: Another priority of the  adoptions task force was for USCIS to provide consistent guidance for  its field officers adjudicating orphan petitions by developing standard  operating procedures on how to determine parents\u2019 suitability to adopt  and a child\u2019s orphan status. The task force pointed out that, in some  cases, an adjudicator may be the only person in the field office that  handles adoptions and may have a supervisor reviewing their work who  does not have expertise in adoptions. The task force also reported that,  even among the best adjudicators, there was little procedural  consistency in adjudicating adoptions and no centralized guidance from  headquarters. To address this priority, in 2003, USCIS developed  standard operating procedures on adoption adjudications and made  them available to their staff electronically. We reviewed the standard  operating procedures and found that they described in a very detailed  manner the process for adjudicating orphan petitions. Furthermore,  State provides guidance to consular officers on how to process orphan  visa cases in its Foreign Affairs Manual.", "Conducted agency training: The task force noted that both USCIS and  State officials sometimes lacked the training necessary to determine  orphan status. In response, USCIS developed training materials for its  domestic and overseas field adjudicators for determining orphan status  and conducted an intercountry adoptions training course in 2002, which  some State officials attended. We reviewed the training materials and  found that they re-emphasized INA statutes for defining orphan status,  defined the agency\u2019s role and responsibilities for adjudicating orphan  petitions, and provided details for conducting orphan investigations. In  addition, to assist consular officers in their orphan investigations, State  offers fraud training to help its officers ascertain whether information in  documents for determining orphan status, such as birth certificates, is  false or whether documents have been altered or falsified. According to  a State official, State increased the frequency of the course from twice a  year to 8 to 10 times per year in 2005.", "Streamlined the intercountry adoption process: The task force  emphasized that the agency continue to demonstrate its commitment to  maintaining the intercountry adoption process as a priority. USCIS  streamlined some of its intercountry adoption procedures as a result. A  USCIS official acknowledged that the agency is challenged to balance  the prospective parents\u2019 interest in creating their new family as quickly  as possible with the need to review and process each application and  the required documents in accordance with U.S. law. To address issues  relating to timeliness, the agency has instituted a policy requiring  completion of all immigration related applications within 6 months.  Between October 2003 and July 2005, the agency has processed  adoption applications in less than 4 months, on average. According to  USCIS officials, many petitioners file an incomplete Advanced Orphan  Petition (Form I-600A) or Orphan Petition (Form I-600) while they are in  the process of completing their home study. Regulations allow the  petitioner(s) up to 12 months to submit supportive documentation. The  agency strives to process completed applications within 30 days of  receiving all required documentation, according to USCIS officials.", "In addition, in November 2003, USCIS made efforts to eliminate its  backlog of U.S. citizenship certificates by centralizing the process.  USCIS advised its field offices that, if they needed assistance with their  backlog, to send these cases to a central location for processing.  According to a USCIS official, from November through December 2003,  this central office processed 671 of the 700 backlogged cases\u2014the  remaining cases were either denied or returned to the field office for  additional follow-up. In addition, to streamline and simplify the  issuance of Certificates of Citizenship for adopted children who receive  IR-3 visas and have their adoption finalized overseas, USCIS created the  IR-3 Entrant Program in January 2004. The program eliminates the  application and fee for citizenship certificates for about 70 percent of  children adopted by U.S. citizens. A USCIS official noted that the  agency has consistently met its goal to provide certificates within 45  days after the family has entered the United States.", "Further, in the intercountry adoption process, a system of checks and  balances has developed that allows State, in the visa issuance phase, to  review USCIS paperwork before issuing the visa to the child.  Additionally, as a part of the streamlined process for issuing the  citizenship certificates to adopted children, USCIS reviews IR-3  immigrant visa packages to verify that the child acquired automatic  U.S. citizenship upon admission to the United States as required under  the INA.

The task force also reported that  problems in adjudicating orphan petitions can be traced to the fact that  individuals train their successors as best as they can, but there is no routine  mechanism for obtaining feedback on written work from someone with  specialized adoption expertise. In the field offices we visited, we found that  the adjudicators had learned the process for adjudicating adoption  petitions mostly through on-the-job training and mentoring. USCIS held  intercountry adoptions training in 2002 as a result of the task force\u2019s  suggestion; however, not all adjudicators who process adoption cases  attended the training.

According to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF),  such abuses are more likely to occur in countries where legislative  provisions are nonexistent, inadequate, or plagued with gaps and  loopholes. UNICEF research also identified that risk for abuses  significantly increased when government entities that oversee the adoption  process are absent, insufficient, or when the prospective parents act  through intermediaries that may not be licensed. For example, State has  received a growing number of complaints concerning adoption facilitators  operating in various countries.

From 1997 to 2001, the  conspirators operated a scheme to defraud U.S. citizens who adopted some  700 children from Cambodia. The conspirators received approximately $8  million dollars from adoptive parents in the United States. The conspiracy  involved assorted crimes, including alien smuggling, visa fraud, and money  laundering, and included schemes such as the use of baby buyers obtaining  children from birth parents by informing the birth parents that they may  have their child back at any time, then obtaining false Cambodian  passports to enable the children to leave the country. In 2004, after a DHS  investigation, a U.S. adoption facilitator pled guilty to conspiracy to  commit visa fraud and conspiracy to launder money.", "The United States has also noted ongoing concerns with intercountry  adoptions in certain countries, as of the date of this report. These countries  include Guatemala, where a large number of U.S. adopted children  originate from, as well as Nepal, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. In Guatemala,  USCIS and State noted on their Web sites that the use of a false birth  mother to release her child is the usual method chosen by unscrupulous  operators to create a paper trail for an illegally obtained child. USCIS and  State officials acknowledged the known problems in Guatemala of birth  mothers who are paid by private adoption attorneys to relinquish their  children for adoption. According to State, problematic cases may further be  complicated by high incidence of corruption and civil document fraud in  Guatemala. In Nepal, visa fraud is a significant problem facing potential  adoptive parents, according to State\u2019s Web site. State also emphasized that  document and identity fraud related to adoptions are serious concerns in  Nigeria, and a high rate of adoption fraud has been uncovered in Sierra  Leone."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Both Agencies Have Taken Steps to Strengthen Intercountry Adoption Safeguards in Foreign Countries, but USCIS Has Not Formally and Systematically Documented Incidents of Potential Abuses", "paragraphs": ["USCIS and State have taken various steps to strengthen safeguards against  abuses associated with adoptions from foreign countries.

Through discussions between the United States and Vietnam, for example,  intercountry adoptions, which had been suspended, resumed after the two  countries signed an agreement of cooperation in June 2005. In addition,  USCIS has established written guidance for ways to identify fraud in  intercountry adoption cases. The guidance provides that USCIS officers  consider specific fraud indicators, such as documentary deficiencies and  delays in registering birth certificates. Furthermore, State has provided  fraud prevention management training to State consular officers, and  USCIS officials said that all USCIS officers receive training, which includes  an antifraud segment, when hired.", "USCIS and State have established procedures for determining the orphan  status of the child based on the conditions that exist in the country relating  to the intercountry adoption process. These procedures may add to the  length of time for the adoption process. For example, in countries where  the adoption process is clear and transparent, and when officers deal with  adoption agencies with high standards, USCIS allows the field investigation  to be completed through a documentary review. In some instances,  however, deficiencies or inconsistencies in the documentation presented  will require in-depth field investigations. In certain countries, these  investigations can include additional steps, such as interviews with the  birth mother, DNA testing when necessary and feasible, and interviews  with adoption entities such as facilitators, orphanage directors, and local  officials. In Guatemala, for example, USCIS requires DNA testing in all  cases where the child is released by an identified birth mother due to  concerns over the use of false birth mothers to release illegally obtained  children. In Nigeria, where document and identity fraud related to  adoptions are serious concerns, all adoptions are required to undergo full  field investigations to verify the authenticity of the information provided in  the adoption decrees and U.S. orphan petitions. These added steps in the  process may contribute to a lengthier completion time for intercountry  adoptions, but may also help the U.S. government in ensuring the  legitimacy of information provided on the adopted child and in detecting  fraud.", "Both USCIS and State publicize general knowledge of the risk environment  in foreign countries. However, while State has documented specific  concerns via cable communication, USCIS has not established a procedure  to systematically document instances of individual problematic situations  identified through its intercountry adoption work in foreign countries,  including its staff\u2019s knowledge of unscrupulous adoption attorneys and  facilitators, as well as disreputable orphanages and adoption agencies.  Although USCIS officials informed us that they discuss the risk  environment in foreign countries with overseas staff on a periodic and  informal basis, agency officials\u2019 knowledge of specific incidents of concern  may be better captured in a systematically documented method. In  Guatemala, for example, USCIS staff informed us of instances where  facilitators may have provided substantial funds to birth mothers who have  relinquished their children for adoption. A USCIS official had also banned  specific adoption attorneys in Guatemala from submitting intercountry  adoption cases due to the USCIS official\u2019s suspicions of the attorneys\u2019  fraudulent practices. This information, however, is communicated  anecdotally to other USCIS officials without being specifically and  systematically documented. In addition, while USCIS provides information  for State\u2019s publicly available notices documenting country conditions,  individual and detailed accounts of concern are not systematically  captured. USCIS officials also noted that they have access to cables  prepared by State officials that discuss concerns with intercountry  adoptions in foreign countries.

These Central  Authorities must coordinate with each other, provide evaluation reports on  their country\u2019s adoption experiences to other countries, and take the  appropriate measures to prevent improper financial gain from an  intercountry adoption, among other responsibilities. Additionally, under a  Hague adoption, a prospective adoptive parent must apply for an adoption  through the sending country\u2019s Central Authority. To meet these  requirements, the sending country must establish that a child is eligible for  adoption by ensuring that adoption is in the best interest of the child and  that appropriate counseling and consents, not induced by payment, have  been provided, while the receiving country must determine that the  prospective parents are eligible and suitable to adopt. Moreover, the  Convention requires the receiving country to ensure that the child will be  authorized to enter and permanently reside in the country before the  adoption takes place, though this is not a prerequisite to parent-child  contact. Under the Convention, the Central Authority may delegate certain  functions to a public authority or an accredited body, as long as this body  pursues only nonprofit objectives, is staffed by qualified persons, and is  subject to supervision. The Convention also permits many Central  Authority functions to be performed by other bodies or persons who meet  certain ethical, training, and experience standards.", "Although the Convention establishes minimum standards, it does not  establish formal means to determine whether countries are complying with  them.

The United States signed the Convention in 1994. In 2000,  the Senate gave its advice and consent, but the United States will not  formally ratify the Convention until it is able to carry out the obligations  required of it by the Convention. That same year, the United States passed  the implementing legislation, the IAA, which established State as the U.S.  Central Authority for intercountry adoptions. Following passage of the  legislation, State has taken several steps to prepare for implementation,  including drafting and issuing regulations for comment as required by  IAA, hiring staff to carry out some of the responsibilities of the  Convention, and requesting applications for accrediting entities, which  under IAA are responsible for accrediting adoption service providers.  However, some key steps remain, which include finalizing regulations,  deploying case registry software to track adoption cases, and signing  agreements with accredited entities.

Figure 5  provides a detailed time line of the United States\u2019 implementation of the  Convention.", "State officials said the implementation of the Convention is a long-term  project and attributed its lengthiness to several challenges. First, IAA  required that State consider the standards or procedures developed or  proposed by the adoption community before issuing regulations. Once  regulations were issued to the public for comment, State received about  1,500 comments from more than 200 entities expressing a wide range of  views, some calling for more stringent standards and others for less  stringent. State revised the regulations, including responses to comments,  and sent them to Office of Management and Budget. Second, State is  further challenged in drafting agreements with accrediting entities because  such entities could be either state licensing bodies or nonprofits, both of  which entail a variety of different restrictions, such as state laws. Finally,  State must complete some steps in sequential order. For example,  agreements with accrediting entities can not be signed until the regulations  are finalized. Further, although State\u2019s target date for implementation is  fiscal year 2007, agency officials stated that they could not predict how  long it will take accrediting entities to approve adoption service agencies.  According to officials, State will have completed its work needed to  implement the Convention by the end of 2005, at which time the adoption  service providers will have to apply for accreditation.
