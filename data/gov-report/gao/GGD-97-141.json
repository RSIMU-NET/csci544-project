Over the years, the government has created a number of corporations or corporation-like organizations to fulfill a variety of public functions or purposes of a predominately business nature. Historically, such organizations have been created on an individual need basis with the characteristics and functions of each being tailored to its specific mission. In general, these organizations can be identified under certain categories, such as wholly-owned government corporations, mixed-ownership government corporations, government-sponsored enterprises (GSE), or government-created private corporations. Grouping these government-created corporations and corporation-like organizations into these categories can be helpful because such organizations share certain common characteristics. However, for comparative purposes, it should be noted that even within these categories, the organizations are structured and governed in a variety of ways. Therefore, for purposes of this report, we found it more helpful to review each organization in our study individually without regard to any particular category under which it may be identified. Appendix I contains additional information about government-created corporations and corporation-like organizations.", "The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 (1970 Act) created the Postal Service, designated it as an independent establishment of the executive branch, and created a Board of Governors to be its governing body. The Postal Service is not identified as falling under any particular category of government corporation or government-created corporation-like organization. The Postal Service has reported that it is not a government corporation; however, it is frequently considered by others to be one and has been previously included in major government corporation studies done over the last several years.", "According to the Postal Service, its Board of Governors is comparable to the board of directors of a private sector corporation. The Board of Governors directs the exercise of the powers of the Postal Service, directs and controls its expenditures, reviews its practices, and conducts long-range planning. It sets policy; participates in establishing postage rates; and takes up matters, such as mail delivery standards and capital investments and facilities projects exceeding $10 million. It also determines the pay of the Postmaster General (PMG) and approves the pay of other Postal Service officers. By statute, the Postal Service is to maintain compensation and benefits for all officers and employees on a standard of comparability with the private sector. However, no officer or employee can receive pay in excess of the rate for level I of the Executive Schedule\u2014currently $148,400.", "The Board consists of 11 members, including (1) 9 Governors appointed by the president, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to 9 year staggered terms; (2) the PMG, who is appointed by the Governors; and (3) the Deputy Postmaster General (DPMG), who is appointed by the Governors and the PMG.", "By law, Governors are chosen to represent the public interest and cannot be representatives of special interests. They serve part time and may be removed only for cause. Not more than five of the nine Governors may belong to the same political party. No other qualifications or restrictions are specified in law. The 1970 Act provided for each Governor to receive an annual salary of $10,000, plus $300 a day and travel expenses for not more than 30 days of meetings each year. The act providing appropriations to the Postal Service for fiscal year 1997 increased the Governors\u2019 annual salaries to $30,000 per year, but the $300 daily meeting allowance remained unchanged."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To identify current and former members\u2019 areas of concern, including specific issues and their suggested legislative changes, we (1) interviewed all 11 members of the current Board (including the PMG and DPMG); and (2) interviewed 2 former Governors appointed after December 1, 1985, whom we were able to contact. We also interviewed the PMG\u2019s predecessor and the PMG serving at the time of the 1970 Postal Service reorganization. The latter also served as the first Chairman of the Board of Governors. Appendix II lists the interviewees included in our study, position(s) held, and date(s) of appointment.", "We sent each interviewee a list of questions, judgmentally grouped into broad areas, prior to our interview. This list guided our interviews (see app. III). We asked each interviewee if he or she had any issues or concerns within each of the broad areas. If the interviewees had concerns, we asked them to elaborate and identify any specific legislative action(s) they believed Congress might want to consider. We also offered interviewees an opportunity to discuss any other concerns related to the Board.", "For each broad area discussed, we tallied the number of interviewees who believed legislative changes were either needed or not needed. If interviewees did not definitely answer yes or no, we did not include their answers in our tallies.", "To compare the characteristics of the boards of other government-created organizations with those of the Postal Service Board, we developed and sent a matrix to 11 boards, including the Postal Service Board. The matrix covered 73 characteristics, grouped in such broad categories as (1) the board\u2019s mission and responsibilities, (2) the board\u2019s authority, (3) board members\u2019 compensation, and (4) board composition. In developing and refining our matrix and interview questions, we researched and reviewed available information on the structure and characteristics of public and private corporate boards, reviewed prior work we had done on government corporations, and consulted with knowledgeable individuals on Postal Service Board activities.", "Except for the Postal Service, we judgmentally selected the government-created organizations included in our study in order to have a mix of the various types. We selected two government-sponsored enterprises, two wholly-owned government corporations, two mixed-ownership government corporations, and two federally created private corporations. In making these selections, we used our recent report on government corporations, as well as other prior work we had done, to identify organizations of various types. To provide a broader range of organizations for comparison purposes, we also selected two foreign postal administrations\u2014Canada Post and Australia Post. We selected these organizations primarily because of our previous work in this area. These organizations were described in a recent Price Waterhouse report as among the most \u201cprogressive postal administrations.\u201d", "In this report, we highlight differences between the Postal Service and the other government-created organizations as they apply to the four issues most frequently cited by current and former Board members as needing legislative attention. Some of the other issues raised by the interviewees, however, were outside the scope of our matrix. Therefore, we did not have sufficient information to make comparisons with the other government-created organizations on all of the issues raised by the interviewees. Appendix IV contains selected details from the matrices. We did not verify the boards\u2019 responses to our matrix. However, we did ask each of the boards that completed our matrix to review their respective sections of appendix IV for accuracy.", "To provide the Subcommittee with additional information on governance issues that might be helpful in its deliberations on postal reform, we reviewed a broad range of available literature affecting both public and private boards. The result of our literature research is included in our discussions of governance issues.", "We conducted our review at postal headquarters in Washington, D.C., between July 1996 and April 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "We requested comments on a draft of this report from the PMG and the Chairman of the USPS Board of Governors.

Although there was no consensus among the members on the specific issues within each area of concern, several issues were mentioned frequently, and a number of legislative changes were offered for consideration. The most frequently cited issues were (1) the limitations on the Board\u2019s authority to establish postage rates; (2) the inability of the Board to pay the PMG more than the rate for level I of the Executive Schedule\u2014currently $148,400; (3) the Board\u2019s lack of pay comparability with the private sector; and (4) qualification requirements that are too general to ensure that Board appointees possess the kind of experience necessary to oversee a major government business."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Board\u2019s Authority to Establish Postage Rates", "paragraphs": ["The issue most frequently cited by current and former Postal Service Board members as needing legislative attention was the limitations on the Board\u2019s authority to establish postage rates. Ten of the 15 interviewees believed that the current ratemaking process adversely affects the Postal Service\u2019s ability to compete with its private sector competitors. They were concerned that the current ratemaking process is too restrictive and therefore limits the Postal Service\u2019s ability to quickly adjust postage rates in a highly competitive and rapidly changing marketplace. Three of the remaining five interviewees did not comment specifically on this issue, and two said the current ratemaking process should not be changed.", "Under the current ratemaking process, the Postal Service, through its Board of Governors, is to propose changes to the Postal Rate Commission (PRC)\u2014an independent regulatory agency established in the executive branch\u2014and request that it issue a recommended decision. PRC, after holding public hearings and reviewing data provided by the Postal Service, is to provide the Postal Service Board of Governors with its recommended decision concerning proposed rate changes. By law, this process can take up to 10 months. After receiving a recommendation from PRC, the Governors can approve, reject, or allow the recommended rates to take effect under protest; or, under certain circumstances, the Governors can modify a PRC decision. However, before the Governors can modify any PRC-recommended rates, they are required to return the rate case to PRC for reconsideration. After PRC renders a further rate decision, the nine Governors can modify that decision only by a unanimous vote\u2014a task that some members said was almost impossible to achieve because, in their experience, the Governors seldom agree unanimously on any issue. In fact, there has been only one instance\u2014in 1980\u2014where the Governors modified a PRC recommendation for First-Class postage.", "Interviewees suggesting legislative attention in this area offered a number of changes for consideration. Two suggestions were mentioned most frequently. One suggestion was to use administrative law judges to hear rate cases and make recommendations to the Board\u2014rather than going through PRC. The members believed this change would streamline the ratemaking process and still give due consideration to the views of the mailing community. The other suggestion was that the Board be given the authority to override a PRC recommended rate decision with something less than a unanimous vote. For example, suggestions were made that the unanimous vote requirement be changed to either a majority or a two-thirds majority vote. Other legislative changes offered for consideration included (1) giving the Board authority to raise rates within legislatively established parameters (e.g., allow the Board to raise postage rates annually up to the increase in a designated index, such as the Consumer Price Index); (2) restricting PRC\u2019s ratemaking role to monopoly mail\u2014and a related suggestion allowing the Postal Service to establish private sector-type subsidiary companies that would compete directly with private carriers of nonmonopoly mail; and (3) legislatively requiring that PRC render its rate decisions in much less time than the 10 months currently allowed by law. One interviewee, however, said the law should not be changed to require faster decisions from PRC because, given current complex ratemaking requirements, it is unreasonable to expect faster decisions. The two interviewees who said the current ratemaking process should not be changed agreed that the current ratemaking process negatively affected the Postal Service\u2019s ability to compete with private sector carriers. However, they believed a better way of addressing the ratemaking issue was to create a PRC-type body to regulate private sector carriers\u2019 rates rather than change the ratemaking process within the Postal Service.", "Our survey of nine other government-created organizations showed some similarity between the ratemaking processes of the Postal Service and the processes reported by two other organizations\u2014Australia Post and Canada Post. No similarities were apparent at the other seven organizations.", "According to Australia Post, its Board of Directors sets prices for all products and services. The board must notify the Minister for Communications and the Arts of any intention to alter the price of the standard postal rate and the Minister has the opportunity to disallow it. Although it has no direct authority over the price, the Australian Competition and Consumer Council has the opportunity to consider any proposal and make its views known to the Minister as part of his/her consideration of proposed price alterations.", "According to Canada Post, its Board of Directors oversees virtually all ratemaking decisions. This includes decisions for such products as basic domestic and international single-piece letters, international printed matter, and some registered mail products. Once new postage rate regulations are proposed, interested parties are given a 60-day period during which they can provide written comments on the rate change.", "For various reasons, the ratemaking process at the Postal Service contrasts sharply with the reported ratemaking processes at Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, AMTRAK, FDIC, and TVA. Each of these organizations is permitted to set prices in a manner very much like any private sector corporation\u2014i.e., independent of a third-party review or approval. Ratemaking processes at the RTB and the CPB are not comparable to the Postal Service\u2019s ratemaking process. At the RTB, its Board of Directors makes loans at legislatively established rates. At the CPB, there are no products or services sold and, therefore, no ratemaking procedures.", "Proposed legislation introduced in Congress in January 1997 to reform the Postal Service, H.R. 22, proposes significant changes to the ratemaking process and to the long-standing relationship between the Postal Service and PRC. Current law requires that the Postal Service file a request with PRC for changes in rates for services offered. H.R. 22 would change that requirement. It would divide postal products into two categories, noncompetitive mail and competitive mail. Noncompetitive mail would include those products, such as First-Class Mail, for which there are few alternatives to the Postal Service. For products in the noncompetitive mail category, the Service would establish rates using a price cap based on the Gross Domestic Product Chain-Type Price Index modified by an adjustment factor, which PRC would determine every 5 years. Once the cap was established, the Postal Service would generally be able to adjust prices annually without filing a request for change with PRC.", "Competitive mail, such as Express Mail, would include those products facing full competition within the marketplace. The Postal Service could price competitive products as it saw fit, without filing a request for change with PRC. However, Postal Service pricing of competitive mail would be subject to the constraints of the antitrust laws as well as requirements that rates cover the Service\u2019s costs and make a reasonable contribution to overhead. PRC would conduct annual audits of the Postal Service to ensure it was acting in compliance with the law with respect to both noncompetitive and competitive products. Adoption of the ratemaking proposals in H.R. 22 would increase the ratemaking similarities between the Postal Service and Canada Post and Australia Post.", "In testimony before your Subcommittee on the Postal Service on July 10, 1996, the PRC Chairman noted that proposed legislation to reform the Postal Service included several proposals that would increase the Postal Service\u2019s flexibility to price its products. He also noted that under the proposed ratemaking process, provisions for multiple reconsideration and judicial reviews of rate decisions would be eliminated. Generally, the Board has adjusted rates every 3 years or so against a backdrop of an extensive body of public input. Under H.R. 22, the Board could be adjusting many rates as often as annually. The PRC Chairman said that the current system of multiple checks and balances is, in some instances, too much of a good thing. At the same time, however, he cautioned about going too far in the opposite direction.", "Ratemaking issues were again discussed at a hearing before your Subcommittee on the Postal Service on April 9, 1997. Witnesses included economists who helped formulate and design price cap plans for telecommunications and utility regulatory entities, as well as experts in antitrust laws, telecommunication regulation, postal arbitration, and contracts. Differences in opinion among these witnesses as to how well price caps would work for the Postal Service indicate that the debate over the Postal Service\u2019s pricing system and the roles of the Board of Governors and PRC have not yet been resolved among all interested parties. The issue of ratemaking is a central part of the ongoing congressional deliberations related to the proposed postal reform legislation (H.R. 22)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Board\u2019s Authority to Pay PMG", "paragraphs": ["The second most frequently cited issue was the Board\u2019s inability to pay the PMG more than the rate for level I of the Executive Schedule\u2014currently $148,400. Eight of the 15 interviewees said the Board should be given more flexibility to compensate the PMG so that pay could be more comparable with the private sector. One interviewee strongly disagreed that compensation changes were needed, and the other six interviewees had no comment on the issue.", "The eight interviewees who believed the Board should have more flexibility to compensate the PMG were concerned that because of the pay cap, the Board might have a difficult time filling future PMG vacancies with highly qualified candidates. They were concerned that many highly qualified candidates might not even consider the position of PMG because of more financially lucrative positions in the private sector. These eight interviewees suggested legislative consideration be given to removing the pay cap on the PMG\u2019s pay. As an alternative, one of the eight interviewees said legislative consideration should be given to allowing the Board to award the PMG performance-based bonuses over and above the legislated pay cap.", "The one interviewee with an opposing view did not believe the Board would have a difficult time attracting highly qualified candidates to the PMG position at the current salary. That interviewee said people are attracted to the position because of its status and the desire to serve the public\u2014not because they are seeking a highly paid position.", "Our survey of nine other government-created organizations showed that the PMG\u2019s pay is in line with the reported pay received by the top officials in those organizations where pay is legislatively capped. Five of the nine organizations had legislative pay caps similar to the Postal Service\u2019s. Those organizations were TVA, RTB, FDIC, AMTRAK, and the CPB. However, two organizations\u2014Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2014were not subject to legislative pay caps. According to information provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the chief executive officers (CEO) at these two organizations were paid substantially more than the PMG. Data provided show that in 1995, the CEOs at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were each paid more than $1 million, compared to the $148,400 paid the PMG.", "Our ability to make pay comparisons with the CEOs at Canada Post and Australia Post was limited because both organizations said they consider this information to be private. Information provided by Canada Post shows its CEO\u2019s pay is set by Canada\u2019s Governor in Council and was in the neighborhood of $200,000 (U.S.) in 1995. Australia Post did not provide specific information on its CEO\u2019s pay but said the pay is set at a level that takes into account both public and private sector considerations.", "Executive compensation is, has been, and will likely continue to be, a hotly debated issue in both the public and private sectors. Recent literature on executive compensation in the private sector shows the issue to be sharply focused on the amount of compensation paid executives in comparison to the health of the company, returns to investors, and wages paid nonmanagerial employees. For example, Business Week reported in April 1997 that the average pay increase for top executives in U.S. companies last year was 54 percent, compared with an average increase of 3 percent for U.S. factory workers. It also reported that the average CEO in the United States was paid 209 times more than the average U.S. factory worker. According to the literature, the spread in pay between these two groups has continued to widen since the 1980s. As time passes, however, more and more private sector executives are reportedly seeing their compensation challenged by stockholders and employee unions who perceive the pay of some executives to be exorbitant. Other attempts are also being made to bring the issues surrounding executive pay to the forefront. For example, the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) launched an Internet site in April 1997 to give the public ready access to information on executive compensation for the Fortune 500 companies.", "Executive pay issues also exist within the public sector. The Senior Executives Association has cited lifting the 3-year freeze on Executive Level pay as one of its top priorities. Over time, the spread in pay between executives and other employees has narrowed.", "Along with the pay compression issue, Congress and the administration have become increasingly concerned about executive compensation in some government-created organizations and have been taking steps to address some of those concerns. For example, in October 1995, the President signed Executive Order 12976 requiring that certain bonuses paid executives of designated government corporations be preapproved by the Office of Management and Budget. Additionally, since 1992, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been prohibited from providing compensation to any executive officer that is not reasonable and comparable with compensation for employment in other similar organizations (including other publicly held financial institutions or major financial services companies) involving similar duties and responsibilities. Also, a significant portion of potential compensation for executive officers must be based on the performance of the enterprises. Further, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are prohibited from entering into any severance agreement or contract with an executive officer, unless the Director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight of the Department of Housing and Urban Development approves the agreement or contract in advance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Board Members\u2019 Pay", "paragraphs": ["Although 12 of the 15 interviewees believed Board members\u2019 pay was another area warranting legislative attention, there was substantial disagreement on the specific issues and possible legislative remedies. Some interviewees thought Board members\u2019 pay should be increased, while others thought compensation should not be increased because Board service should be considered public service. Others thought the daily meeting attendance fee should be increased. Others thought periodic reviews of Board members\u2019 pay should be required, and varying combinations of these changes were also offered for consideration.", "Six of the 15 interviewees said that even though Board members\u2019 salaries were increased from $10,000 to $30,000 in 1996, they were still below private sector salaries and should be made more comparable. Five of the 15 interviewees also believed the law should be changed to increase the $300 daily fee members are paid for attending Board meetings. Interviewees who suggested legislative change were particularly concerned that there is no legal requirement that pay be reviewed on a periodic basis, and they pointed out that the time span between the last two pay increases was 26 years.", "Seven interviewees, however, said Board members\u2019 salaries should not be increased, and four said daily meeting attendance fees should not be increased. Two interviewees did not comment on Board members\u2019 salaries, and six did not comment on daily meeting attendance fees. Interviewees opposing these suggested legislative changes were generally of the opinion that Board service should be recognized as public service and that Postal Service Governors should not expect compensation similar to that found on private sector boards.", "Our comparison of Postal Governors\u2019 pay with the reported pay of board members of nine other government-created organizations did not show major disparities. In fact, we identified only two notable differences. First, board members at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may elect to receive shares of stock in lieu of cash compensation. Second, board members at TVA and FDIC are paid more than Postal Service Governors, but they serve full time. None of the interviewees believed Postal Board Governors should serve full time.", "As discussed earlier, compensation is an area of contention in both the public and private sectors. Board members\u2019 compensation, like CEOs\u2019 compensation, is currently being examined from different angles by various interest groups\u2014e.g., stockholders and employee unions. Work done by Spencer Stuart, a company that tracks board trends and practices at 100 major American corporations, showed that private sector board members\u2019 annual salaries and meeting attendance fees averaged $55,300 in 1996 (ranging from $25,000 to $100,000). This compares to compensation of about $38,000 that the Postal Service Governors will likely receive in 1997 (salary plus the historical average of daily meeting attendance fees)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Qualification Requirements for Board Membership", "paragraphs": ["The final issue cited by a majority of current and former members as needing legislative attention was the lack of well-defined qualification requirements for Board appointments. Eight of the 15 interviewees stated that the statutes governing Board appointments are too general and should be more precisely defined. Seven of the interviewees, however, said no legislative change should be made in the appointment process. They were generally of the opinion that the current process, which requires Senate confirmation, ensures that highly qualified candidates are appointed to the Board.", "The eight interviewees who favored more precisely defined qualification requirements believed that, historically, appointments to the Board have not always been based on an individual\u2019s demonstrated ability to govern large corporations like the Postal Service. They were concerned that because qualification requirements are not clearly defined in law, the Board may not always have the most appropriate mix of skills for effectively managing an organization as big and as complex as the Postal Service. The interviewees suggested a number of legislative changes that they believed could enhance the appointment process. These included having an independent body make recommendations for Board appointments and delineating, in law, specific requirements for Board service. Examples of specific requirements mentioned included (1) requiring that appointees have corporate experience, (2) requiring a mix of geographic representation on the Board, and (3) requiring labor and mailing industry representation on the Board.", "The statutory restrictions/qualifications for board service at six of the other nine government-created organizations included in our study were more specific than the Postal Service\u2019s. For example, at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, four of the five presidential appointees to the board must have specific business backgrounds: one must be from the mortgage lending industry, one must be from the home building industry, one must be from the real estate industry, and one must be from an organization representing consumer interests. At the CPB, statutes require that the nine appointed board members be selected from such fields as education, cultural and civic affairs, or the arts. Board members are also to represent various regions of the nation and professions, occupations, and various kinds of talent and experience appropriate to the function and responsibilities of the CPB. Additionally, of the nine board members, one is to be selected from among individuals who represent the licensees and permittees of public television stations, and one is to represent the licensees and permittees of public radio stations. Australia Post and AMTRAK statutes require that at least one board member have an understanding of employee issues. The RTB statutes require that of the Bank\u2019s 13 board members, 3 be elected by stockholders of eligible cooperative borrowers, and 3 be elected by stockholders of eligible commercial borrowers.", "The statutory qualifications for board service at the other three government-created organizations included in our study (TVA, FDIC, and Canada Post) were similar to the Postal Service\u2019s qualifications in that they were generally nonrestrictive. For example, requirements for board membership at FDIC state only that the three appointed members must be U.S. citizens and that no more than three of the five board members may be members of the same political party.", "Additionally, like the Postal Service, three of the other nine government-created organizations included in our study have provisions for ex officio membership on their boards. At the Postal Service, the PMG and DPMG are ex officio members of the Board. At the RTB, there are five ex officio members\u2014all from the Department of Agriculture. Ex officio members on the FDIC board include the Comptroller of the Currency and the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision. Additionally, one of the presidentially appointed members also serves as the chair of the board and full-time head of FDIC. The Secretary of Transportation and AMTRAK president serve as ex officio members on AMTRAK\u2019s board.", "Current literature on private sector governance suggests that some aspects of corporate governance have been undergoing changes in recent years. Some stockholders, concerned with publicized instances of excessive executive compensation, coupled with unacceptable corporate performance, are increasingly scrutinizing governance issues, including the qualifications of board members. An article in the spring 1995 issue of Business Quarterly points to a lack of meaningful qualifications for board members and a lack of needed expertise and knowledge as two areas that could signal competence problems affecting board performance. The article goes on to point out that healthy boards require, among other things, a balance of qualifications, knowledge, skills, attitudes, and experiences. Business literature suggests that now, more so than in previous eras, corporations are developing more well-defined criteria for board membership\u2014acknowledging that various roles on the board may require various backgrounds and skills.", "Although conceptually it may be desirable to have board representation for all stakeholders, it presents a real challenge to do so within the Postal Service structure.

A recurring theme in this literature focuses on accountability. For example, in April 1995, the Congressional Research Service reported that a key issue for policymakers is how to make government corporations politically accountable for their policies and operations while still giving them the necessary financial and administrative discretion to function in a commercial manner. An article in the February 1995 issue of Government Executive also expressed concern that quasi-government organizations are largely unaccountable for their actions.", "Some of the current and former Postal Service Board members we spoke with had the following specific concerns in these four areas.

The other issue concerned the limited specificity in law concerning the Board\u2019s oversight responsibilities.", "Four of the six interviewees said that uncertainties about how far the Postal Service should go in competing with the private sector are not helped by the Postal Service\u2019s current legal designation. By law, the Postal Service is designated as an independent establishment in the executive branch. One interviewee characterized this situation by saying that the Postal Service\u2019s current legal designation places it in the unenviable position of being \u201cneither fish nor fowl,\u201d i.e., neither an executive agency nor a private corporation. The four interviewees suggested that Congress consider clarifying the Postal Service\u2019s legal designation, which, in turn, should provide a clearer picture of the Service\u2019s mission.", "Legal status questions are not unique to the Postal Service. Such questions are being raised with regard to government-created organizations in general. Unclear legal definitions are disconcerting to some, while others use it to their advantage. For example, a fellow at both the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) and the Johns Hopkins Center for the Study of American Government said government-created organizations can generally choose whatever legal status best suits their purposes. He cited a 1977 incident in which the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development instructed Fannie Mae to increase its mortgage purchases in the inner cities. Fannie Mae replied that, as a private agency, its principal obligation was to its stockholders, who would object to its investing in riskier properties. A few years later, however, when the administration attempted to strip away some of Fannie Mae\u2019s special privileges, such as its tax exemptions, Fannie Mae responded, \u201cCongress established Fannie Mae to run efficiently as an agency, not as a fully private company.\u201d Without those special relationships, Fannie Mae said, it would not be able to survive.", "While discussing the Postal Service Board\u2019s mission and responsibilities, four of the six interviewees said the Board could benefit from more detailed guidance concerning its oversight responsibilities.
