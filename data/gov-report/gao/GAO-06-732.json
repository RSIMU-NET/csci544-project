Administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the CDBG program provides funding to metropolitan cities and urban counties, known as entitlement communities, and to states for distribution to nonentitlement communities. This report discusses (1) how recipients use CDBG funds, including the extent to which they comply with spending limits, (2) how HUD monitors recipients' use of CDBG funds, and (3) how HUD holds recipients that have not complied with CDBG program requirements accountable. To address these objectives, we visited 20 recipients, analyzed HUD data, and interviewed HUD staff."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["HUD data show that CDBG recipients spend the largest percentage of their grants on public improvements (such as water lines and streets) and housing, but HUD does not centrally maintain the data needed to determine compliance with statutory spending limits. Due to the lack of centralized data, GAO was not able to determine the extent to which all recipients have complied with statutory spending limits on public services (such as health and senior services) and administration and planning. However, data provided by HUD for the 100 most populous entitlement communities, which received about one-third of the CDBG funds allocated in fiscal year 2006, showed that not all of these entitlement communities complied with the limits. Of the 100 communities, 3 exceeded their public service spending limit, and 1 exceeded the administration and planning spending limit. Given that entitlement communities collectively spend at or close to the limits, it is important for HUD to be able to report on the extent of their individual compliance with these limits. HUD uses a risk-based approach to monitor CDBG recipients; however, it has not developed a plan to replace monitoring staff or fully involved its field staff in plans to redesign an information system they use to monitor recipients. HUD's monitoring strategy calls for its field offices to consider various risk factors when determining which recipients to review because it has limited monitoring resources, and its workload has increased as its staffing levels have decreased. For example, 13 of the 42 field offices that oversee CDBG recipients do not have a financial specialist to evaluate the financial operations of each recipient, and 39 percent of CDBG monitoring staff is eligible to retire within the next 3 years. Despite these statistics, HUD has not developed a plan to hire staff with needed skills or manage upcoming retirements. Finally, although the Integrated Disbursement and Information System (IDIS) is a tool that HUD field staff use to monitor, HUD headquarters has solicited little input from them on efforts to redesign IDIS. Although it has issued a clear policy stating what actions it will take when entitlement communities fail to meet the statutory requirement that funds be spent in a timely manner, HUD has not developed similar guidance establishing a consistent framework for holding CDBG recipients accountable for deficiencies identified during monitoring. For deficiencies other than being slow to expend funds, HUD has the flexibility to institute sanctions ranging from issuing a warning letter to advising the recipient to return funds. Although its field offices have great flexibility when taking sanctions, HUD has not issued guidance establishing a framework to ensure that they are treating recipients that commit similar infractions equitably. We found instances in fiscal year 2005 where treatment seemed inconsistent. For example, several field offices found that recipients had not documented that a funded activity met any one of the program's three national objectives, but took different actions. In the continued absence of guidance, HUD lacks a means to better ensure consistency in the sanctioning process."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program is the federal  government\u2019s principal community development program.

However, the administration\u2019s fiscal year 2006  budget proposed consolidating the program with other community and  economic development programs in the Department of Commerce and  reducing overall funding. Congress did not act on this proposal, but the  administration proposed additional program reforms and a 27 percent  funding reduction in its fiscal year 2007 budget. Because of these proposed  changes, you requested that we review the use of CDBG funds and how  HUD oversees the program. Specifically, this report discusses (1) how  recipients have used CDBG funds, including the extent to which they have  funded activities that meet national program objectives, complied with  spending limits, and reported accomplishments achieved with funds; (2)  how HUD has monitored recipients\u2019 use of CDBG funds; and (3) how HUD  has held recipients that have not complied with CDBG program  requirements accountable for their actions.", "To address these objectives, we visited 20 recipients\u20144 states, 2 urban  counties, and 14 cities. We selected these recipients based on factors such  as geographic dispersion, funding level, and need. During these visits, we  interviewed staff, toured funded projects, and reviewed 144 recipient files.  We also visited four nonentitlement communities. We analyzed Integrated  Disbursement and Information System (IDIS) data on expenditures and  Grants Management Process (GMP) System data on the extent of HUD  monitoring. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report. Finally, we reviewed HUD\u2019s program regulations  and guidance and interviewed headquarters and field staff.

The objective of the  program is to develop viable urban communities by providing decent  housing and a suitable living environment and expanding economic  opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income.  Program funds can be used on housing, economic development,  neighborhood revitalization, and other community development activities.  As shown in figure 1, CDBG appropriations have fluctuated over time.", "After funds are set aside for special purposes such as the Indian CDBG  program and allocated to insular areas, the annual appropriation for CDBG  formula funding is split so that 70 percent is allocated among eligible  metropolitan cities and counties (referred to as entitlement communities)  and 30 percent among the states to serve nonentitlement communities.  Entitlement communities are (1) principal cities of metropolitan areas, (2)  other metropolitan cities with populations of at least 50,000; and (3)  qualified urban counties with populations of at least 200,000 (excluding the population of entitled cities). Currently, 1,128 entitlement communities  receive CDBG funds, which is up from 866 entitlement communities in  fiscal year 1990; 50 states also receive CDBG funds. HUD distributes funds  to entitlement communities and states based on the higher yield from one  of two weighted formulas that consider factors such as population, poverty,  housing overcrowding, the age of the housing, and any change in an area\u2019s  growth in comparison with that of other areas. HUD ensures that the total  amount awarded is within the available appropriation by reducing the  individual grants on a pro rata basis.", "Entitlement communities may carry out activities directly or may award  funds to subrecipients to carry out agreed-upon activities. Subrecipients  can be governmental agencies such as public housing authorities or park  districts; private nonprofits such as private social service agencies,  community development corporations, or operators of homeless shelters;  and certain private, for-profit entities that facilitate economic development.  Whenever an entitlement community uses a subrecipient, it must enter into  a signed, written agreement with that subrecipient that includes a  statement of work\u2014which describes the work to be performed, the  schedule for completing the work, and the budget\u2014and the recipient\u2019s  recordkeeping and reporting requirements.", "Every activity funded by entitlement communities and states must meet  one of three national program objectives. Activities undertaken must (1)  principally benefit low- and moderate-income persons, (2) aid in the  prevention or elimination of slums or blight, or (3) meet urgent community  development needs. Recipients must use at least 70 percent of their funds  for activities that principally benefit low- and moderate-income people over  a period of 1, 2, or 3 years, as specified by the recipient. Generally, an  activity is considered to principally benefit low- and moderate-income  people if 51 percent or more of those benefiting meet the definition.  However, the CDBG statute includes an exception that enables certain  entitlement communities to utilize CDBG funds for \u201carea benefit activities\u201d  in census tracts having a low- and moderate-income population of less than  51 percent. Area benefit activities are activities that benefit all of the  residents in a particular geographic area, such as a park, community center,  or streets. Entitlement communities that may utilize this exception are  those that have a limited number of census tracts with a majority low- and  moderate-income population, and the exception extends to the 25 percent  of census tracts within the entitlement community\u2019s boundaries having the  highest percentages of low- and moderate-income persons.", "Recipients can only use their CDBG funds on 26 eligible activities. For  reporting purposes, HUD classifies these eligible activities into eight broad  categories, as defined in table 1. Some of the activities that can be funded,  such as loans for housing rehabilitation, generate program income for  recipients that must be used to fund additional activities. There are  statutory limitations on the amounts that recipients may spend in two  specific areas. Pursuant to provisions in annual appropriations laws,  recipients may only use up to 20 percent of their annual grant plus program  income on planning and administrative activities. Recipients may also only  use up to 15 percent of their annual grant plus program income on public  service activities. Entitlement communities comply with these  requirements by limiting the amount of funds they obligate for these  activities during the program year, while states limit the amount they spend  on these activities over the life of the grant.", "Recipients must submit a strategic plan that addresses the housing,  homeless, and community development needs in their jurisdictions at least  once every 5 years. The plan covers CDBG and three other formula grant  programs administered by HUD\u2014the HOME Investment Partnerships  (HOME) Program, the Emergency Shelter Grants (ESG) Program, and the  Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) Program.  Annually, recipients must submit an action plan that identifies the activities  they will undertake to meet the objectives in their strategic plans. At the  end of each year, recipients must submit to HUD an annual performance  report detailing progress they have made in meeting the goals and  objectives outlined in their strategic and action plans. HUD staff use  detailed checklists to review recipients\u2019 strategic and annual actions plans  as well as their annual performance reports.", "HUD\u2019s Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD) administers  the CDBG program through program offices at HUD headquarters and 42  field offices located throughout the United States. The headquarters offices  set program policy, while staff in the 42 field offices monitor recipients.  Each field office is headed by a CPD director. CPD has a total authorized  staff of approximately 800\u2014about 200 at headquarters and 600 in the field.  CPD field offices are responsible for a broad range of grant management  activities that include annual review and approval of entitlement grantee  action plans, preparation and execution of grant agreements, review of  entitlement grantee annual performance reports, managing homeless  program competition to include reviewing over 4,500 applications;  preparing conditional award letters; reviewing and approving technical  submission for conditionally approved grants; setting up budgets for each  grant in Line of Credit Control System; executing grant agreements and  grant closeout activities, providing technical assistance to entitlement and  competitive grantees, and recapturing unobligated/unexpended grant  funds, as well as monitoring activities.", "In September 2005, CPD issued a new monitoring handbook. The handbook  states that monitoring is an integral management control technique and  that the goal of monitoring is to determine compliance, prevent/identify  deficiencies, and design corrective actions to improve or reinforce program  participant performance. It contains two chapters on monitoring the CDBG  program, and these chapters include 29 exhibits for field office staff to use  when monitoring CDBG recipients.", "HUD staff use two major information systems to monitor the use of CDBG  funds\u2014IDIS and GMP. Developed in fiscal year 1996, IDIS is a management  information system that consolidates planning and reporting processes  across HUD\u2019s four formula grant programs. The recipients use this system  to enter information on their plans, establish projects and activities to draw  down funds, and report accomplishments. The GMP system, created in  fiscal year 1997, records information such as HUD\u2019s monitoring of  recipients, provision of technical assistance, and review of recipients\u2019 plans  and performance reports.

At that time, we found that HUD\u2019s  monitoring did not ensure that the programs\u2019 objectives were being met or  that recipients were managing their funds appropriately. We also noted that  IDIS did not provide the information necessary to accurately assess  recipients\u2019 performance and thus did not compensate for HUD\u2019s  breakdowns in monitoring. Specifically, we reported that IDIS (1) provided  ample opportunity for major problems with data entry and did not allow  such problems to be corrected easily, (2) did not provide timely and  accurate information, and (3) had difficulty producing reports.

As  shown in figure 2, CDBG recipients spent 32 percent of their total funds on  public improvements and 25 percent on housing in fiscal year 2005. Within  the category of public improvements, recipients spent the largest  percentage of their funds on water and sewer improvements. Under the  housing category, the single activity that received the most funding was  single-unit residential rehabilitation.", "Although both entitlement communities and states devote large amounts of  funding to public improvements, figure 3 shows some differences in how  they use their CDBG funds. Entitlement communities spend the largest  percentage of their CDBG funds on housing activities. In fiscal year 2005,  entitlement communities spent 27 percent of their CDBG allocations on  housing activities, followed by 24 percent on public improvements, and 17  percent on administration and planning activities. In contrast, states  distribute over half of their CDBG funds to public improvements. In fiscal  year 2005, states distributed 54 percent of their funds to public  improvements, 17 percent to housing activities, and 15 percent to economic  development. States and entitlement communities use a similar process to  identify CDBG needs, but states also have to determine how they will  distribute their funds to nonentitlement communities. How states choose  to distribute their funds varies from state to state. For example, Georgia  distributes most of its CDBG funding through a competitive process that  funds the best projects regardless of activity type. Colorado also uses a  competitive process, but it distributes a third of its CDBG funding to  housing, a third to business financing, and a third to public facilities and  community development. Pennsylvania distributes most of its CDBG  funding using a formula method. For examples of how selected states  distribute their CDBG funds, see appendix II.", "As a result of the flexibility inherent in the CDBG program, the types of  activities that entitlement communities and states fund within each broad  category vary considerably.

The remaining  activities funded, excluding activities coded for administration and  planning, sought to eliminate slums or blight, addressed urgent needs, or  were missing a national objective code. For the small percentage of  activities missing a code, we could not determine which national objective  was met. According to a HUD official, activities missing a national  objective code were also administration and planning activities, however,  we could not verify this statement based on our analysis of HUD\u2019s IDIS  data.", "A special statutory exception allows certain entitlement communities to  count activities that benefit fewer than 51 percent low- and  moderate-income people as meeting the corresponding national objective.  This exception allows the recipient to use the first 25 percent of all census  tracts in its jurisdiction to qualify as meeting the national objective. For  example, if a city or county consists of 40 census tracts, only 4 of which  contain 51 percent or more low- and moderate-income persons, that  recipient can also consider the 6 census tracts with the next highest  percentages of low- and moderate-income persons as low- and  moderate-income census tracts.", "Currently, 359 of the 1,128 cities and urban counties that receive CDBG  funds are eligible to use this exception.

For  example, when information on compliance with the administrative and  planning spending limit was recently requested from HUD for a House  report, HUD could not provide data that directly addressed the request.  The agency provided the data that were readily available but noted that the  data could not be used to determine compliance with the spending limit.

Due to this provision, a total of 41 entitlement  communities are allowed to use more than the 15 percent they would have  been allowed if they were subject to the cap. For example, the city of  Chicago, Illinois is allowed to use $41 million (48 percent of its fiscal year  2006 allocation) for public services. The city of Seattle, Washington is  allowed to use about 36 percent of its CDBG funds for public services.

According to HUD, the training  sessions will (1) provide information about how recipients can implement  the outcome indicators through their local and state procedures for data  collection and reporting and (2) discuss entry of the performance data into  IDIS. The agenda topics include data quality and how to measure the  outcome of various activities such as housing and economic development.  For this training, HUD has developed a training manual and guidebook that  contains information on measuring outcomes achieved with CDBG funds.

However, two individual field offices did  not monitor 20 percent of their recipients. As shown in table 2, CPD has  monitored more than 20 percent of its CDBG recipients in recent years.", "HUD\u2019s monitoring policy calls for HUD staff to focus on high-risk recipients  when selecting CDBG recipients for review. Consistent with our internal  control standards, HUD has developed a formal risk analysis process for its  field offices to use when determining which recipients to review. Field  office staff rate recipients on various factors that fall under the following  four categories: financial, management, satisfaction, and services. The  staff total the scores from each factor and assign recipients a final score on  a 100-point scale. At each field office, a CPD management representative  then conducts a review to ensure the validity and consistency of the scores.  HUD considers recipients that receive a score of 51 or greater to be high  risk; it considers those with a score of 30 to 50 to be medium risk; and  those with less than 30 it considers to be low risk. Recipients that receive a  high-risk rating are subject to monitoring, unless a management  representative approves an exception. CPD management representatives  can approve an exception if (1) the HUD Office of Inspector General is  auditing the recipient; (2) they determine that monitoring is  administratively infeasible in the current year, given other monitoring  actions; or (3) they have other reasons\u2014such as HUD recently monitored  the recipient or it monitored another program administered by the  recipient. Field office staff must review high-risk recipients on site unless  they reviewed them on site in the last 2 years, and the purpose of the  monitoring is to validate the implementation of corrective actions.  Medium- and low-risk recipients can be reviewed using remote, or off-site,  monitoring.", "Our review of data from GMP\u2014the system that field staff use to record the  results of the risk analysis process and any monitoring  performed\u2014showed that HUD\u2019s field offices followed the risk analysis  process in all but 16 cases in fiscal year 2005. For fiscal year 2005, HUD  designated 164 recipients as high risk. Out of these 164 recipients, GMP  data showed that 107 were monitored, 41 were granted an exception, and  16 were not monitored or provided an exception. The risk scores assigned  to the 16 high-risk recipients that HUD did not monitor or provide an  exception ranged from a low of 51 to a high of 80. These 16 recipients  received allocations totaling about $145 million in fiscal year 2005. They  included Detroit, Michigan ($43 million), Oregon ($16 million), and  Honolulu, Hawaii ($11 million). According to HUD, these recipients were  not monitored or granted an exception either because its field staff  misunderstood the exception requirements or the field office responsible  for monitoring the recipient experienced a staffing shortfall. However,  despite not monitoring these 16 high-risk recipients, 8 of the 12 responsible  field offices monitored recipients that they did not consider high risk.", "Further, we found that HUD reviewed most, but not all, CDBG recipients at  least once in the 5-year period from fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year  2005. As shown in table 3, our analysis of GMP data showed that HUD  monitored all but 255 recipients in fiscal years 2003 through 2005. These  255 recipients received about $525 million in fiscal year 2005 funding. When  we expanded our analysis to 4 years (fiscal years 2002 through 2005), we  determined that HUD had monitored all but 140 recipients that received a  total of about $239 million in fiscal year 2005. During the 5-year period from  fiscal year 2001 through 2005, HUD did not monitor 84 recipients that  received a total of about $132 million in fiscal year 2005.", "Monitoring recipients is critical because it often results in findings. During  our site visits, we reviewed 144 recipient files and found documentation problems. For example, 24 of the 144 files we reviewed did not contain  sufficient documentation to show that the activity met one of the three  national objectives, as required by the program. Another 14 files did not  note which national objective the activity was supposed to meet.  Additionally, 46 files we reviewed showed no evidence of monitoring by the  recipient. In contrast, recipients we visited tended to have signed  agreements with their subrecipients as required by program regulations. Of  the 90 cases that involved a subrecipient, 87 files contained a signed  subrecipient agreement, and 76 of the 87 agreements contained the five  required elements we tested. When HUD reviews files during its  monitoring, it finds similar occurrences. Fifty-seven percent of HUD\u2019s fiscal  year 2005 reviews resulted in at least one finding. In total, HUD\u2019s fiscal year  2005 monitoring resulted in 581 findings and 447 concerns. Examples of  cited findings included not documenting a national objective, funding an  ineligible activity, poor recordkeeping, and incomplete subrecipient  requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD Has Limited Staff and Travel Funds to Devote to CDBG Monitoring", "paragraphs": ["HUD employs a risk-based monitoring approach because it has limited staff  and travel funds to devote to CDBG monitoring. CPD\u2019s staffing levels have  decreased nationwide, as its CDBG workload has increased. From fiscal  year 1993 to the beginning of fiscal year 2006, the number of CPD field  office staff decreased from 751 to 599, a decline of 20 percent. During the  same time period, the number of entitlement communities grew from 889  to 1,128, an increase of 27 percent. This increase in workload has had a  greater effect on certain CPD field offices. As of February 2006, the average  number of CDBG recipients per program representative was nearly four.  The number of recipients per representative exceeded this average at 20 of  the 42 CPD field offices and was six or more at three offices. The HUD  official responsible for CPD field office staff told us he would like to have  more staff but has to get the work done with what he has. Additionally,  CPD program representatives in their role as program monitors oversee  other HUD programs, including three other formula grant programs,  homeless programs, and a number of smaller competitive grant programs.  For example, at the Chicago CPD office, each representative monitors four  to six formula grants, as well as approximately 100 competitive grants.  Although they represent fewer dollars than the formula grant programs, the  competitive grant programs require more monitoring, according to CPD  program managers. The programs are generally administered by small  nonprofit organizations that experience a large amount of staff turnover.  Further, there were 9,705 active competitive grants in fiscal year 2005.", "A number of CPD field offices also do not have a financial analyst.  Financial analysts are important because they evaluate the financial  operations of each recipient and ensure that CPD\u2019s monitoring activities  adequately address any financial vulnerabilities in CPD programs and  related capacity concerns. They help field offices review budget  submissions, financial report submissions, independent audit reports, and  drawdown requests. As of late April 2006, 13 of the 42 CPD field offices did  not have a financial analyst. These 13 field offices averaged a CDBG  portfolio of $60 million. In offices we visited that did not have a financial  analyst, other staff assumed some of the responsibilities of a financial  analyst, but these staff had other responsibilities as well and lacked the  specialized skills of a financial analyst.", "Staffing shortages may worsen in the future because many current CPD  field staff are eligible to retire. As of February 2006, 39 percent of CPD field  staff was eligible to retire within the next 3 years. If we include those  eligible for early retirement, the percentage increases to 59 percent within the next 3 years. For example, the four officials we interviewed in the  Milwaukee field office told us that they were all currently eligible to retire,  including the CPD Director. Denver field office officials told us that the  office could lose all but one of its program representatives to retirement in  the next 5 years.", "HUD has not developed a plan to hire staff with needed skills, such as  financial analysts, or to help CPD manage upcoming retirements. Our  internal control standards state that agencies, as part of their human  capital planning, should consider how to retain valuable employees, plan  for their eventual succession, and ensure continuity of needed skills and  abilities. According to a HUD official, HUD has taken a number of steps to  manage its CPD workforce, such as hiring interns and implementing a  leadership development program. However, these efforts do not  specifically address the need to hire financial analysts and replace the staff  that will become eligible for retirement in the next few years. According to  internal control standards, an agency should have a specific and explicit  workforce planning strategy that allows for identification of current and  future human capital needs and a formal recruiting and hiring plan with  explicit links to skill needs the agency has identified.", "HUD internal reviews and the HUD Inspector General have also noted that  limited staffing has negatively impacted CPD\u2019s monitoring. In fiscal year  2004, 11 of the 12 internal management reviews, known as Quality  Management Reviews, performed at CPD field offices noted staffing  issues. For example, the reports noted that one office might not meet its  monitoring goals due to significant loss of staff and that staff at two offices  had an unbalanced workload. Also, one report noted that the field office  needed a financial analyst for oversight of $113 million in CPD program  funds. Furthermore, in a June 2004 report on CPD management controls,  the HUD Inspector General observed that reductions in field office staffing levels had impacted CPD\u2019s monitoring capabilities. The report noted that,  between 1993 and 2003, CPD had been negatively impacted by staffing  challenges that had plagued all of HUD.", "Further, according to HUD field office staff, limited travel budgets have  affected their ability to monitor CDBG recipients. For fiscal year 2005, the  travel budget for all 42 CPD field offices was about $392,000. The travel  budgets for the six field offices we visited ranged from $2,528 in Baltimore  (11 CDBG recipients) to $20,691 in Los Angeles (105 CDBG recipients).  Some field office staff told us their travel budgets affect which recipients  they select for on-site monitoring during the risk assessment process. For  example, they will limit their monitoring of recipients that require a high  cost of travel. They will either conduct off-site monitoring or document an  exception, which allows them to monitor these recipients less often despite  their risk analysis score. Additionally, when monitoring recipients, field  office staff sometimes shorten their visit to fit within their travel budget. In  its June 2004 report, the HUD Inspector General reported similar findings  and added that field offices will also reduce the amount of staff  participating in a monitoring visit in order to reduce travel costs. According  to the headquarters official that manages CPD\u2019s field offices, he has to  balance the travel needs of all 42 field offices when allocating limited travel  funds. To help the field offices better plan their travel, he has begun  providing them with quarterly, rather than monthly, allocations of funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD Has Made Little Effort to Involve Field Staff in Plans to Redesign IDIS", "paragraphs": ["HUD is currently redesigning IDIS but has solicited limited input from its  field staff. IDIS, a tool that HUD field staff use to conduct on-site and  off-site monitoring, has shortcomings that limit its usefulness as a  monitoring tool. IDIS was designed to be a real-time information system  providing financial disbursement, tracking, and reporting functions for  CPD. In our April 1999 report, we noted that the system was not providing  needed information, and our current work indicates that, despite HUD  improvements to the system, it still is not providing all the information  needed to monitor recipients\u2019 performance. During our site visits, field  office staff noted that (1) the data in IDIS are not always current because  some recipients do not update it quarterly, as HUD recommends and (2) the  accomplishment data in IDIS are not as reliable as the financial data. As  previously noted, HUD is currently working with recipients to improve the  quality of the accomplishment data. Also, a HUD headquarters official  noted that HUD plans to add reports that will better assist field staff with  their monitoring. Similarly, in a report on how to incorporate performance  measures into IDIS, the National Academy of Public Administration found  that (1) IDIS allows data input errors and omissions, (2) the ability to  manipulate data for reporting purposes is limited, and (3) HUD staff and  recipients have expressed frustration with using the system.", "To improve the usefulness of IDIS, HUD is currently reengineering the  system. The department has obligated $9.4 million for development of the  new system. One problem with the initial development of IDIS was that  HUD did not adequately consider input from end users. HUD has attempted  to address this problem in the statement of work for the new system by  stating that the contractor should gather requirements from HUD  stakeholders and recipients. Specifically, the contractor was to work with  HUD\u2019s field offices to identify issues with the current accomplishment  reporting, hold sessions with both field office staff and recipients to solicit  user requirements pertaining to reports, and develop a draft prototype to  solicit HUD stakeholder and recipient feedback on proposed navigation  approaches. Soliciting input from end users on their requirements is  consistent with best practices for system development. Our guidance on  information technology investment management states that (1) investment  control processes should ensure that key customers and business needs for  each project are identified and that the users are engaged in this process  and (2) users should participate in project management throughout a  project\u2019s or system\u2019s life cycle to ensure that it supports the organization\u2019s  business needs and meets users\u2019 needs.", "Contrary to the IDIS statement of work and our guidance on information  technology investment management, HUD headquarters and its contractor  have solicited little input from field staff. As the HUD staff tasked with  monitoring CDBG recipients, field staff are the users that rely most heavily  on IDIS as a monitoring tool. Although HUD headquarters and the  contractor have held only one session with field staff, they have already  drafted a document outlining the system\u2019s functional requirements.  According to the HUD official that is overseeing development of the new  system, the one session held with field staff was unproductive; therefore,  they plan to wait until they are making decisions regarding the standard  reports that the system will generate to solicit additional input from field  office staff. If HUD\u2019s plans to involve its field staff in efforts to improve  IDIS are limited to soliciting input regarding the new system\u2019s reporting  capabilities, the other factors that have limited IDIS\u2019 effectiveness as a  monitoring tool may not be addressed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HUD Has Implemented a Clear Timeliness Policy, but Has Not Issued Similar Guidance on Other Enforcement Actions", "paragraphs": ["Although HUD has issued a clear policy stating what actions it will take  when entitlement communities fail to meet the statutory requirement that  funds be spent in a timely manner, it has not developed similar guidance  establishing a consistent framework for holding CDBG recipients  accountable for deficiencies identified during monitoring.

To ensure that entitlement communities comply with  this standard, HUD established a grant reduction policy for untimely  recipients in November 2001. The new policy stated that an untimely  recipient had 1 year to become timely. If it still did not meet the 1.5  standard at the end of its next program year, HUD would reduce its next  grant by how much it exceeded the standard, unless HUD determined that  the lack of timely spending was due to factors beyond the recipient\u2019s  control.

Because it has limited monitoring resources, HUD has  implemented a risk-based process to identify recipients for review.  However, HUD faces challenges as it carries out these responsibilities.  First, a large percentage of the field staff responsible for monitoring CDBG  recipients will be eligible for retirement within the next 3 years. HUD has  not developed a plan for replacing this vital program expertise. HUD has  established an internship program and other initiatives to develop senior  leaders, but such activities will not, in themselves, replace experienced  professionals.

We had planned to use IDIS data to examine the extent to which  CDBG recipients were complying with the statutory spending limits on  public services and planning and administration but determined that (1)  IDIS did not save some of the data needed to determine compliance by  entitlement communities and (2) IDIS data cannot be used to determine  states\u2019 compliance with the limits. Therefore, we requested data from HUD  showing the percentage of funds spent by selected recipients on public  services as well as on planning and administration. We initially requested  data on the 200 entitlement communities that received the most funding,  but HUD could only provide data on the 100 most populous entitlement  communities within our time frames.

We agree that it is important to monitor compliance with  administration and planning and public service spending caps.  However, our report emphasizes HUD\u2019s need to centrally maintain data  on compliance with statutory spending limits so that it can report on  the extent of compliance; therefore, we made no change to the report in  response to this comment. 2. The CPD staffing/hiring plan was approved in June 2006 and was  provided to us along with HUD\u2019s written agency comments. Because  the plan was provided at the close of this engagement this report does  not evaluate the extent to which the plan addresses identified  workforce needs. 3. The guidance that HUD references was issued in the 1990s. When we  interviewed the Director of CPD\u2019s Office of Field Management and field  office staff regarding the monitoring of CDBG recipients, they stated  that they were following the new CPD Monitoring Handbook, which  was issued in September 2005. The introduction to this handbook states  that it establishes standards and provides guidance for monitoring CPD  programs, including CDBG. Beyond referring field staff to various  sections of the program regulations, the new handbook does not  describe what conditions its field staff should consider when taking  corrective actions and what specific conditions warrant different types  of corrective actions. Because we believe that HUD needs a consistent  framework for holding CDBG recipients accountable for deficiencies  identified during monitoring, we made no change to the report. 4. Our report acknowledges that any additional guidance that HUD  develops for its field staff taking sanctions could allow for the  consideration of individual situations. Because individual situations  may vary, we stated that such guidance could establish a framework, or  parameters, within which field offices should operate. Although HUD  points to several forms of guidance in its comment, none of them  specifically addresses the concerns raised in this report. The regulatory  language in 24 C.F.R. 570.910(a) states that corrective actions should be  designed to (1) prevent a continuation of the performance deficiency;  (2) mitigate, to the extent possible, the adverse effects or consequences  of the deficiency; and (3) prevent a recurrence of the deficiency. While  this language establishes the purpose of taking sanctions, it does not  provide parameters that help field staff determine which specific  corrective sanction is appropriate to address the deficiency identified.   Section 2-8.B. of the CPD Monitoring Handbook describes HUD\u2019s basis  for determining whether a deficiency should result in a finding or  concern, but it does not help field office staff determine which sanction  may be appropriate if the deficiency results in a finding. Finally, as we  mentioned in our response to the previous comment, the additional  handbook HUD referenced was issued in 1992, while the CPD  Monitoring Handbook was issued in 2005. Given the great flexibility  that exists when taking sanctions, we believe it would be useful to  provide field office staff further guidance to ensure they are treating  recipients that commit similar infractions equitably.   5. We revised the report to include the suggested text. 6. We revised the text to make it clear that the 29 exhibits we mention are  in the two handbook chapters that are specific to the CDBG program. 7. We agree that the meetings referenced by HUD can be helpful in  sharing information on current operational issues with IDIS. However,  the meetings that HUD has referenced are either regularly scheduled  management meetings or training on HUD\u2019s new performance  measurement system. None of these meetings are the field office  sessions that are specifically mentioned in the statement of work for  the reengineered IDIS system. When we asked about the status of  sessions that the statement of work said would be held with field staff  regarding user requirements, accomplishment reporting, and proposed  navigation approaches, the HUD official that is overseeing development  of the new system stated that these sessions would not be held until  late summer 2006 at the earliest, although a functional requirements  document had already been drafted. Further, additional statements  made by that official and HUD\u2019s written comments indicate that the  focus of future meetings with field staff will only be on reporting  requirements. We continue to believe that soliciting input from end  users on system requirements is consistent with best practices for  system development and recommend that field office staff should  participate in project management throughout the system\u2019s life cycle to  ensure that the completed system supports both HUD\u2019s business needs  and the end user field office needs. 8. We agree that monitoring low- or medium-risk grantees can serve a  useful and valid program purpose, especially considering the large  number of grantees designated as such. The report acknowledges that  HUD policy permits the monitoring of medium- and low-risk recipients  by noting that they can be reviewed using remote, or off-site,  monitoring. Therefore, we made no change to the report. 9. We agree that monitoring recipients is critical to fulfill statutory and  regulatory responsibilities to assess compliance as well as carry out  stewardship responsibilities. In our report, we are providing one reason  why monitoring is critical, not an all-inclusive list, so we did not change  the report.  10. We revised the text as suggested. 11. We agree that grant monitoring is a critical stewardship responsibility.  This section of our report is highlighting the fact that program funding  cuts are being made at the same time as the number of grant recipients  is increasing, which creates challenges as HUD carries out its  stewardship responsibilities. 12. We agree that it is easier to develop policies and procedures to address  timeliness deficiencies than it is to develop guidance that addresses the  myriad of deficiencies identified during monitoring. However, given the  importance of holding CDBG recipients accountable for how they use  their funds, we recommend that HUD consider issuing additional  guidance for field staff that establishes the parameters within which  field offices should operate and provides greater transparency to the  sanctioning process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition, Paul Schmidt, Assistant Director; Nima Patel Edwards; Cynthia  Grant; Curtis Groves; Alison Martin; John McGrail; Marc Molino; David  Noguera; David Pittman; Nitin Rao; and Paige Smith made key  contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
