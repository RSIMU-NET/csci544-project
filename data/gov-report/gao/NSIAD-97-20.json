Working capital is used to finance the manufacture or purchase of goods and services.

These programs provide loan repayment guarantees that reduce the risk associated with such loans. Some states also have programs to assist SMEs in obtaining working capital.", "Eximbank facilitates export financing through its Working Capital Guarantee Program, which is authorized by the Export Trading Company Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-290, Sec. 206, Oct. 8, 1982). During fiscal year 1995, Eximbank guaranteed almost $302 million in export working capital loans, which represented about 3 percent of Eximbank\u2019s total dollar authorizations for the year. Over 97 percent of the exporters assisted by Eximbank through the program during fiscal year 1995 were self-certified as small businesses, as defined by SBA regulations (13 C.F.R. Part 121).", "SBA developed its Export Working Capital Program (formerly known as the Export Revolving Line of Credit) in response to a requirement in the Small Business Export Expansion Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-481, Sec. 112, Oct. 21, 1980). SBA\u2019s program falls within the statutory authority of the agency\u2019s regular business loan guarantee program, known as the 7(a) program.Under the 7(a) program, SBA guarantees private lender loans to small businesses that have been unable to obtain financing. During fiscal  year 1995, SBA guaranteed about $69 million in export working capital loans, which represented less than 1 percent of SBA\u2019s total 7(a) program. All exporters assisted through SBA must qualify under the agency\u2019s definition of a small business. During fiscal year 1995, over 90 percent of the businesses assisted through SBA\u2019s working capital program had less than 50 employees.", "In its 1993 report to Congress, TPCC made a series of recommendations to increase the effectiveness of U.S. export financing programs. One recommendation called for the establishment of one-stop shops, that is, the U.S. Export Assistance Centers (USEAC), as a single point of contact for all federal export promotion and finance programs. Another recommendation called for federal agencies to encourage qualified state or local export finance entities to enter into cofinancing arrangements in which risk is shared. A third recommendation called for streamlining and harmonizing key features of Eximbank and SBA\u2019s working capital guarantee programs to make them more customer-focused and take advantage of the agencies\u2019 comparative strengths. According to TPCC, harmonization was to give SMEs access to working capital through a broader nationwide network of lenders on a more consistent, efficient, and effective basis.

Over the past couple of years, the division has expanded its outreach to SMEs through its Delegated Authority Program. Under this program, a private lender and Eximbank enter into an agreement that allows the lender to approve Eximbank guaranteed loans to exporters without first having to submit individual applications to Eximbank for approval. During fiscal year 1996, delegated authority lenders approved 192 loans, 69 percent of the agency\u2019s export working capital guarantee transactions.

They standardized such key features as the application forms used by lenders or exporters, application fees, and guarantee coverage. To standardize the guarantee coverage, Eximbank reduced its coverage from 100 percent of principal and interest to 90 percent, and SBA raised its 85-percent guarantee to 90 percent. Both agencies also streamlined their procedures for processing loan guarantees. Additionally, they agreed to a market segmentation plan that (1) assigned SBA primary responsibility for assisting small businesses whose export working capital needs do not exceed SBA\u2019s $750,000 exposure limit and (2) made Eximbank responsible for assisting exporters who do not fall within SBA\u2019s small business standards or whose transactions exceed SBA\u2019s limit.", "The effects of harmonization-related changes are difficult to measure because many occurred when Eximbank and SBA were making other changes aimed at improving export finance assistance for small businesses. For example, in fiscal year 1995, SBA began to set export working capital goals for each of its 69 district offices, and it developed new coguarantee agreements with a few states. SBA also provided basic export finance training to almost 300 of its staff and resource partners (e.g., small business development centers) and more in-depth training on transaction lending to its trade finance specialists. Likewise, during the same period, Eximbank enhanced its Delegated Authority Program by increasing the limits on the aggregate amounts participating lenders can provide to single borrowers annually and allowing lenders to retain all or part of a loan fee, depending on the amount of the loan. Together, Eximbank and SBA officials also conducted export finance seminars in 13 cities that were attended by about 1,300 bankers. In addition, the agencies worked with the Department of Commerce to expand the USEAC network.", "These program changes, including those related to the agencies\u2019 harmonization efforts, appear to have helped expand the use of the program, improve SME access to working capital, and increase the number of lenders participating in export financing.

An Eximbank official stated that the agency has the flexibility to waive this requirement for otherwise creditworthy borrowers but could recall only a few instances in which this was done.", "ProAction Agency, the consultant commissioned by Eximbank and SBA to evaluate harmonization efforts, identified another key difference between Eximbank\u2019s and SBA\u2019s programs; Eximbank and SBA fees for processing guarantees are not standardized. For loans with a term of greater than 6 but not more than 12 months, Eximbank charged 1.5 percent of the loan amount, and for loans of 6 months or less, it charged 0.75 percent of the loan amount. SBA charged a fee of 0.25 percent of the guaranteed amount for loans with a term of 12 months or less. ProAction Agency also identified some remaining differences in Eximbank\u2019s and SBA\u2019s efforts to harmonize program documentation and operational procedures.", "ProAction Agency concluded that because of the vast differences between the two agencies\u2019 programs, harmonization could not have been reasonably completed within the recommended 12-month time frame. It further noted, however, that the lack of program standardization created a larger burden on lenders and exporters in the form of increased paperwork, high turnaround time, and general confusion regarding expectations. During fiscal year 1996, no other features of the two export working capital programs were standardized. SBA commented that, during fiscal year 1997, it and Eximbank have been working together to identify ways to further harmonize the closing documents for their export working capital loans.", "Furthermore, progress toward harmonization of the two agencies\u2019 programs was interrupted during fiscal year 1996 when the guarantee coverage of SBA\u2019s 7(a) program was reduced in accordance with the Small Business Lending Enhancement Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-36, Sec. 2, Oct. 12, 1995). While Eximbank\u2019s guarantee coverage remained at 90 percent, SBA\u2019s coverage was reduced to 75 percent for loans above $100,000 and to 80 percent for loans below that level. In a report to Congress, SBA characterized this change as a severe setback to harmonization that caused confusion among the lending and small business exporting communities. SBA officials believe that this setback caused the agency to lose the momentum that allowed it to almost triple (from 71 to 190) the number of loans it guaranteed in fiscal year 1995. An Eximbank official emphasized that a common guarantee rate was an important element of harmonization and predicted that SBA\u2019s reduced rate would negatively affect small business exporters who need the localized support and assistance of SBA and its lenders.", "Notwithstanding the reduction in SBA\u2019s guarantee rate, SBA increased the number of export working capital loans guaranteed by 38 percent for fiscal year 1996. Eximbank increased the number of loans guaranteed by 56 percent. The value of loans guaranteed under each of the agencies\u2019 programs likewise increased by almost 38 percent. Figure 1 shows the number of loans guaranteed by both agencies between fiscal years 1991 and 1996.", "In addition to increasing the number and value of loans guaranteed during fiscal year 1996, Eximbank and SBA have continued to enlist new exporters at generally the same rate as in the prior year. The number of new lenders funding loans through the export working capital programs, however, declined for both agencies in 1996, as shown in table 2. Effective October 1, 1996, SBA was provided authority to restore its guarantee coverage to 90 percent for its Export Working Capital Program, pursuant to the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 1997  (P.L. 104-208, Sept. 30, 1996)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Issues Associated With Expanding the Use of Cooperative Agreements", "paragraphs": ["To facilitate small business export finance, Eximbank and SBA have established more cooperative agreements with both the private and public sectors. Delegating authority to private sector lenders and devolving certain program responsibilities to state export finance organizations are examples of cooperative agreements. Expanding the use of these approaches could further leverage federal resources and expand federal outreach to SMEs, but it would also shift more responsibility for the guarantee of funds from the federal government to the private sector and the states. Nevertheless, Eximbank and SBA remain responsible for ensuring that the programs are well managed, funds are properly spent, and program objectives are met."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Delegating Authority to Lenders", "paragraphs": ["Eximbank\u2019s Delegated Authority Program exemplifies one cooperative approach to increasing SME access to export financing. Under the program, exporters can have working capital guarantees processed and approved by a network of 69 delegated authority lenders located in 25 states plus the District of Columbia, rather than having to go through Eximbank\u2019s Washington, D.C., office. This program has also allowed Eximbank to leverage its resources and increase lender participation.", "The Delegated Authority Program enabled the U.S. Division\u2019s staff to handle an increasing number of working capital guarantees while maintaining the same level of staffing. For example, in 1994, no loans were processed under the Delegated Authority Program, but in fiscal year 1995, Eximbank\u2019s delegated authority lenders processed 99 loans valued at $115 million, without an increase in the U.S. Division\u2019s staff. This activity represented 55 percent of Eximbank\u2019s working capital guarantee program. During fiscal year 1996, the delegated authority lenders processed  69 percent of the agency\u2019s working capital guarantees. This activity represented 192 loans valued at about $227 million. U.S. Division officials estimated that, even though the Delegated Authority Program allowed them to leverage their resources, about 20 to 30 percent of staff time was spent administering and monitoring the program.", "The Delegated Authority Program also appears to have increased the level of lender participation. In fiscal year 1995, 29 active delegated authority lenders funded, on average, over twice as many loans using delegated authority than they did the prior year, when the program was dormant. According to Eximbank officials, lenders\u2019 ability to provide guarantees without obtaining prior approval coupled with fiscal year 1995 program enhancements contributed to the increased level of lender participation in the program. These enhancements included, for example, lenders\u2019 ability to retain all or part of a loan fee. Over 74 percent of the 56 respondents to our Delegated Authority Program survey confirmed that quicker processing time attributable to the lenders\u2019 ability to approve loan guarantees, fee incentives, and the 90-percent guarantee coverage were the most important factors for remaining enrolled in the program.", "Because more than two-thirds of Eximbank\u2019s export working capital loans are handled through the Delegated Authority Program, monitoring lenders\u2019 compliance with program requirements and managing the associated level of risks of these loan guarantees have become increasingly important. Eximbank developed a new monitoring system that requires inspections of all delegated authority lenders that have made at least one transaction under the program. According to Eximbank officials, these inspections assess lenders\u2019 compliance with various program requirements, including repayment terms, reviews of creditworthiness, and maintenance of loan transaction documentation. If Eximbank identifies compliance problems, it can place the lender on probation or retract the lender\u2019s delegated authority status. Eximbank officials said that possible loss of eligibility is one of the most effective measures for ensuring a lender\u2019s compliance. Another measure is the 10-percent risk assumed by the bank in the event of loan defaults. As of June 1996, the default rate for exporters whose loans were guaranteed through the Delegated Authority Program in fiscal year 1995 was 1 default out of 99 loans, and the default rate for loans guaranteed through Eximbank headquarters was 3 defaults out of 80 loans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Devolving Greater Program Responsibility to the State Level", "paragraphs": ["In 1993, TPCC recognized the merits of expanding the use of cooperative arrangements with states when it endorsed cofinancing agreements as part of an overall government strategy to facilitate export promotion and financing. Under these agreements, federal programs can expand their outreach to SMEs by taking advantage of the states\u2019 proximity to target firms and their knowledge of local businesses. Also, all 17 states and the  1 U.S. territory with export finance programs that were surveyed indicated their programs were designed to serve smaller companies. Likewise, states benefit from cooperative agreements by gaining access to federal guarantee funds that complement their own funds.", "However, key limitations to expanding such agreements are (1) legal prohibitions at the state level and (2) varying levels of state commitment to export finance assistance. Moreover, these types of arrangements require provisions or mechanisms to ensure that federal guarantee funds are appropriately committed. Legal prohibitions sometimes prevent states from offering state-backed guarantees. Constitutions for six states prohibit them from providing export finance assistance, according to a report by the National Association of State Development Agencies. States may also vary in their level of commitment to export financing, depending on the policy priorities of the states\u2019 current administration. A state program administrator said maintaining a consistent level of commitment to a particular program can be difficult because states have limited funds and a large number of competing demands. In some states, the level of funding available to support export financing has changed from year to year. In Maryland, for example, the leveraged guarantee funding was reduced from $60 million in fiscal year 1995 to $50 million in fiscal year 1996 because of a shift in the state\u2019s program priorities. In Texas, the leveraged funding was reduced from $2 million in fiscal year 1995 to no funding in fiscal  year 1996.", "Eximbank established partnerships with state and local government offices and private organizations to help market its small business financial products. In September 1996, it implemented a pilot program delegating authority for approving working capital guarantees to six of the agency\u2019s state partners. Eximbank requires participating states to have an active export guarantee program with an average loan-loss track record of 5 percent or less, an independent credit approval process, and at least one person within the office or organization who has completed Eximbank\u2019s City/State Program training requirements.", "Under pilot program guidelines, the maximum Eximbank guarantee will not exceed the legislative limit of the respective state partner, and Eximbank\u2019s maximum aggregate liability on principal will be $10 million per state partner. The state, Eximbank, and the lender will be partners in each guarantee, sharing all risks or losses or recovered amounts on a proportional basis. Matching fund requirements and risk-sharing provisions are intended to promote accountability, and Eximbank officials believe they encourage state partners to ensure that federal funds are appropriately committed. Transactions under this program are also expected to conform with Delegated Authority Program guidelines and documentation requirements. As with delegated authority lenders, state partners are to be subject to periodic field inspections by Eximbank staff.", "SBA has developed separate coguarantee arrangements with three states, as discussed earlier. It relies on risk-sharing program features, documentation requirements, and its final approval authority to ensure that states exercise due diligence and comply with coguarantee arrangements. Although SBA does not have formal eligibility requirements for developing coguarantee arrangements with states, agency officials emphasized that they tailor the agreements to the individual state programs. For example, SBA\u2019s agreement with California provides for a 50/50 matching guarantee for 90 percent of the principal of working capital loans. Guarantees under this agreement are not to exceed $1.5 million, or up to $750,000 per agency per guarantee, the maximum amount that California can guarantee. According to the director of the California program, the state conducts its loan analysis and completes its forms as usual and then sends the loan guarantee package to SBA trade finance specialists located at the USEAC in Long Beach for approval.

Although Eximbank and SBA have made progress in harmonizing their programs, a number of factors would need to be considered before any such transfer occurred. For example, Eximbank\u2019s program may not serve some exporters currently served by SBA since its delegated authority lenders may not handle the smaller export transactions SBA does. Other exporters may not have easy access to Eximbank\u2019s U.S. Division and its network of delegated authority lenders, which are located in only 25 states plus the District of Columbia and tend to be clustered around large metropolitan areas. Likewise, some SBA lenders currently served by SBA may lose the benefit of being introduced to the program and becoming involved in export financing, since Eximbank and SBA tend to encourage greater lender participation in differing ways and reach out to different types of lenders.

During fiscal years 1995 and 1996, only 24 percent of the loans guaranteed through Eximbank\u2019s Delegated Authority Program were valued at less than $500,000 and about 70 percent of the export working capital loans guaranteed by SBA were valued at less than $500,000, as shown in figure 2.", "Dollar value (in thousands)", "In our survey of delegated authority lenders, over 80 percent (46 of 56) of the respondents indicated that they would be willing to provide export working capital loans for less than $833,333 to existing customers, and 62 percent (35 of 56) indicated they would be willing to provide such loans for new customers. However, 66 percent of the respondents indicated that they would probably not provide a working capital loan under a certain threshold, which for these lenders was a median threshold of $250,000.During fiscal years 1995 and 1996, 14 percent of the export working capital loans guaranteed through delegated authority lenders were less than $250,000 compared with about 40 percent of the loans guaranteed by SBA.", "More than half of the delegated authority lenders indicating they had a threshold stated that processing loans below that amount was too costly and time-consuming for them to make a profit. In response to follow-up contacts, six of seven delegated authority lenders who were generally willing to provide smaller working capital loans agreed such loans were largely unprofitable for their institutions. They were willing to provide small working capital loans chiefly to develop new business opportunities with exporters or maintain their existing customer base.", "Over 60 percent of the respondents indicated that certain incentives would be effective in encouraging them to provide working capital loans under $833,333. These incentives included changes to Eximbank\u2019s program, such as allowing lenders to retain a greater portion of the facility fee and further relaxing collateral requirements. Other changes were outside the scope of the Delegated Authority Program, including allowing lenders to receive credit for promoting small business export finance through the Community Reinvestment Act and relaxing loan loss reserve requirements.

Data presented in the report on the number and value of loans guaranteed exclude those cases in which a guarantee was approved but was subsequently withdrawn or canceled. To identify the number of new lenders and new exporters, we compared agency data for fiscal years 1994 through 1996. New lenders or exporters for fiscal year 1995 were those that did not participate in the programs in fiscal year 1994 (before harmonization).
