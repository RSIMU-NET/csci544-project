Most of these reforms call for providing increased education, training, and supportive services to welfare recipients. To finance the increased costs of these reforms, some proposals, such as H.R. 4\u2014currently before the 104th Congress\u2014would restrict public assistance benefits to certain groups of legal immigrants. Such proposals may have stemmed from concerns raised about the sheer number of legal immigrants receiving benefits, about 1.4 million in 1993. Other proposals, such as the administration\u2019s proposal, would require certain categories of immigrants to wait longer before receiving public assistance. These proposals stem from concerns raised about the number of immigrants that end up receiving public assistance, even though they were admitted into the country with a promise of financial support from a sponsor.", "These proposals would affect several public assistance programs and you specifically asked us to focus on two key programs: Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). The SSI program provides cash benefits to poor aged, disabled, and blind individuals. SSI is federally funded, with some states providing a supplement. In 1993, federal and state expenditures for the almost 6 million SSI recipients were nearly $24 billion. The AFDC program provides cash benefits to poor families with children who lack support from one or both of their parents and is jointly funded with federal and state dollars.", "In 1993, about 14.1 million recipients received over $22 billion in federal and state AFDC payments. A recipient cannot receive both SSI and AFDC benefits.", "This report examines (1) how legal immigrants\u2019 utilization of SSI and AFDC compares with that of citizens, (2) the trends in the numbers of legal immigrants receiving SSI or AFDC benefits, (3) the characteristics of immigrant recipients relevant to determining eligibility under the welfare reform proposals, and (4) the possible impacts of the proposals to restrict immigrants\u2019 SSI and AFDC benefits on federal welfare programs.

SSI provides benefits to three groups of needy individuals: aged (65 years old and older), blind, and disabled. AFDC provides benefits to needy families with children. Immigrants eligible for assistance include those classified by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) as lawful permanent residents. Also eligible for benefits are certain other legally admitted immigrants, classified by public assistance programs as permanently residing in the United States under color of law (PRUCOL).Under the SSI and AFDC programs, the PRUCOL category includes immigrants, such as refugees, asylees and certain others whose deportation INS does not plan to enforce. (See glossary.) However, a few small categories of immigrants considered as PRUCOL are not uniform between the two programs.", "Some legal immigrants are admitted into the country under the financial sponsorship of a U.S. resident. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, as amended, provides for the exclusion of any alien who is likely to become a public charge. Aliens can show prospective self-sufficiency through (1) proof of sufficient personal resources, (2) an offer of a job with adequate compensation, (3) posting of a public charge bond, or (4) an affidavit of support submitted on their behalf by a sponsor who preferably is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. By signing the affidavit of support, sponsors attest to their ability and willingness to provide financial assistance to the immigrant. However, several courts have ruled that these affidavits of support are not legally binding.", "Concerned about the number of sponsored immigrants receiving public assistance, the Congress amended program statutes to include a sponsor-to-alien deeming period; that is, if a sponsored immigrant applies for public assistance before a certain time period, a portion of the sponsor\u2019s income and resources are deemed or assumed to be available for the immigrant\u2019s use (whether or not they are available in fact). This deeming provision is used to determine eligibility as well as benefit amount. For the AFDC program, this period is 3 years after admission to the United States as a permanent resident. In 1993, the deeming period for the SSI program was temporarily extended from 3 to 5 years, starting in January 1994 through September 1996. The deeming provisions do not apply if an immigrant becomes blind or disabled after admission to the United States as a permanent resident. Affidavits of support were amended so sponsors currently agree to provide financial support to the immigrant for 3 years.", "The Responsibility and Empowerment Support Program Providing Employment, Child Care and Training Act of 1994, reintroduced as H.R. 4, the Personal Responsibility Act of 1995, introduced by a group of Republicans during the 104th Congress as part of their \u201cContract With America,\u201d would eliminate most legal immigrants\u2019 eligibility for SSI and AFDC, as well as food stamps, Medicaid, foster care and adoption assistance, education programs and numerous other public assistance programs. Two groups would remain eligible: (1) refugees in the country fewer than 6 years and (2) lawful permanent residents who are 75 years old and older and who have been in the country 5 years or more. The provisions of this proposal would go into effect 1 year after enactment with no grandfathering provision.", "In contrast, the administration\u2019s proposal would increase the time period that sponsors\u2019 incomes would be deemed available to immigrants receiving AFDC, SSI, or food stamps to 5 years. After the fifth year, sponsored immigrants would still receive benefits if their sponsor\u2019s income was below the U.S. median income. The proposal would become effective as of October 1995 and contains a grandfather clause protecting current recipients.

Based on CPS data, immigrants receiving SSI or AFDC represented about 6 percent of all immigrants in 1993; in contrast, about 3.4 percent of citizens received such assistance. However, the total number of immigrants receiving SSI or AFDC is much lower than the number of citizens because legal immigrants represent only about 6 percent of the U.S. population. Based on 1993 administrative data, an estimated 18.6 million citizens received SSI or AFDC, compared with an estimated 1.4 million legal immigrants.", "Much of the difference in recipiency rates between immigrants and citizens can be explained by differences in their demographic characteristics and household composition. Immigrants are much more likely than citizens to be poor. In 1993, about 29 percent of immigrant households reported incomes below the poverty line, compared with 14 percent of citizen households. Researchers have noted that immigrant households have larger numbers of small children and elderly or disabled persons and contain more members with relatively little schooling and low skill levels. These are all characteristics that increase the likelihood of welfare recipiency. Public policy has also played a role in immigrants\u2019 receipt of public assistance. Refugees and asylees are categories of immigrants who are much more likely to be on welfare than citizens or other immigrants. By virtue of their refugee or asylee status alone, they qualify immediately for assistance programs that may be restricted to other immigrants.", "Almost 83 percent of all immigrants receiving SSI or AFDC in 1993 resided in four states: California, New York, Florida, and Texas.

The number of immigrants receiving SSI increased from 151,207 to 683,178 while the number of citizen recipients increased from approximately 3,750,300 to 5,301,200.

Consequently, aged immigrant recipients grew from 7.0 to 28.2 percent of all aged recipients. Over the same time period, the number of immigrants receiving disabled benefits increased six-fold (44,600 to 266,730), while the number of citizens receiving disabled benefits increased by 81 percent (approximately 2,341,500 to 4,242,800). As a result, the percentage of disabled immigrants more than tripled, rising from 1.9 to 5.9 percent of all disabled recipients.

No studies have quantified these effects; however, experts have suggested a number of possible outcomes. For example, some immigrants who lose eligibility may find themselves financially worse off. Other immigrants may find ways to increase their income by increasing their work effort or relying more heavily on their sponsors (if they have one) for financial support. Also, immigrants may supplement their incomes by applying for state-funded public assistance or seek changes in their naturalization status that would result in the reinstatement of their benefits.", "Immigrants who lose eligibility for federal welfare programs may turn to state-funded public assistance programs, thus shifting costs to the states. State general assistance programs would be unable to restrict benefits to legal immigrants losing federal eligibility. According to the 1971 Supreme Court ruling in Graham v. Richardson, states cannot categorically restrict legal immigrants from receiving state benefits. As of 1992, state- or county-funded public assistance programs were operating in 42 states. California and New York, two states with high concentrations of immigrants on public assistance and which operate state general assistance programs, could be greatly affected. As a result, the possible savings that states would accrue from their reduced share of AFDC benefits to immigrants could be offset by increased costs for state-funded general assistance.", "Immigrants may also change their naturalization and immigration patterns. Eliminating or restricting benefit eligibility may prompt more immigrants to become citizens to retain their eligibility, according to an Urban Institute study. CBO\u2019s $21.7 billion cost-savings estimate takes into account higher naturalization rates. However, the impact of the proposal on naturalization rates is difficult to predict. Even higher naturalization rates could lower actual program savings. Restricting legal immigrants\u2019 eligibility for benefits may also have longer-term effects on the number and composition of immigrants entering this country. Eliminating benefits for most legal immigrants could prompt some prospective immigrants to reconsider their decision to seek residence in this country. In addition, potential sponsors of immigrants may reconsider whether they would assist others in entering this country if doing so may result in additional financial responsibility on the part of the sponsor, according to an INS official.", "As agreed with your office, we did not obtain written agency comments but we did discuss the report with program officials at HHS, SSA, and INS.
