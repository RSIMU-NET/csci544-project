Led by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), federal bank regulators conducted a stress test to determine if these banks needed to raise additional capital, either privately or through CAP. This report (1) describes the SCAP process and participants' views of the process, (2) assesses SCAP's goals and results and BHCs' performance, and (3) identifies how regulators and the BHCs are applying lessons learned from SCAP. To do this work, GAO reviewed SCAP documents, analyzed financial data, and interviewed regulatory, industry, and BHC officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The SCAP process appeared to have been mostly successful in promoting coordination, transparency, and capital adequacy. The process utilized an organizational structure that facilitated coordination and communication among regulatory staff from multiple disciplines and organizations and with the BHCs. Because SCAP was designed to help restore confidence in the banking industry, regulators took unusual steps to increase transparency by releasing details of their methodology and sensitive BHC-specific results. However, several participants criticized aspects of the SCAP process. For example, some supervisory and bank industry officials stated that the Federal Reserve was not transparent about the linkages between some of the test's assumptions and results. But most of the participants in SCAP agreed that despite these views, coordination and communication were effective and could serve as a model for future supervisory efforts. According to regulators, the process resulted in a methodology that yielded credible results. By design, the process helped to ensure that BHCs would be capitalized for a potentially more severe downturn in economic conditions from 2009 through 2010. SCAP largely met its goals of increasing the level and quality of capital held by the 19 largest U.S. BHCs and, more broadly, strengthening market confidence in the banking system. The stress test identified 9 BHCs that met the capital requirements under the more adverse scenario and 10 that needed to raise additional capital. Nine of the 10 BHCs were able to raise capital in the private market, with the exception of GMAC LLC, which received additional capital from the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury). The resulting capital adequacy of the 19 BHCs has generally exceeded SCAP's requirements, and two-thirds of the BHCs have either fully repaid or begun to repay their TARP investments. Officials from the BHCs, credit rating agencies, and federal banking agencies indicated that the Federal Reserve's public release of the stress test methodology and results in the spring of 2009 helped strengthen market confidence. During the first year of SCAP (2009), overall actual losses for these 19 BHCs have generally been below GAO's 1-year pro rata loss estimates under the more adverse economic scenario. Collectively, the BHCs experienced gains in their securities and trading and counterparty portfolios. However, some BHCs exceeded the GAO 1-year pro rata estimated 2009 losses in certain areas, such as consumer and commercial lending. Most notably, in 2009, GMAC LLC exceeded the loss estimates in multiple categories for the full 2-year SCAP period. More losses in the residential and commercial real estate markets and further deterioration in economic conditions could challenge the BHCs, even though they have been deemed to have adequate capital levels under SCAP. This report recommends that the Federal Reserve complete a final 2-year SCAP analysis, and apply lessons learned from SCAP to improve transparency of bank supervision, examiner guidance, risk identification and assessment, and regulatory coordination. The Federal Reserve agreed with our five recommendations and noted current actions that it has underway to address them. Treasury agreed with the report's findings."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The recent financial crisis seriously undermined confidence in the nation\u2019s  financial system and institutions. In February 2009, to help restore  confidence, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) announced  the Financial Stability Plan, which established the Supervisory Capital  Assessment Program (SCAP). SCAP, as implemented by the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) and other  federal banking regulators, was to determine through a stress test  whether the largest 19 U.S. bank holding companies (BHC) had enough  capital for the next 2 years (2009-2010) to support their lending activities  and survive a second similar economic shock. As of December 31, 2008,  the largest 19 BHCs accounted for approximately 67 percent of the assets  and more than 50 percent of loans in the U.S. banking system. BHCs that  were found to need additional capital would be allowed, and were  encouraged, to raise the funds privately, but if they could not, Treasury  would provide capital infusions using funding available under the  Troubled Asset Relief Program\u2019s (TARP) Capital Assistance Program  (CAP). However, Treasury made no investments under CAP and  terminated the program in November 2009. When SCAP was first  announced in February 2009, and again around the time the Federal  Reserve released the results of the stress test in May 2009, some  academics, market participants, and others raised concerns about the test,  noting that the assumptions used in the more adverse economic scenario  were not severe enough and that the test did not account for differences in  institutions\u2019 business models.", "As part of GAO\u2019s continued analysis and monitoring of Treasury\u2019s process  for implementing the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, this  report on the stress test expands on SCAP activities that we reported on in  June 2009. Specifically, this report (1) describes the process used to  design and conduct the stress test and participants\u2019 views on the process,  (2) describes the extent to which the stress test achieved its goals and  compares its estimates with the BHCs\u2019 actual results, and (3) identifies the  lessons regulators and BHCs learned from SCAP and examines how each  are using those lessons to enhance their risk identification and assessment  practices.", "To meet the report\u2019s objectives, we reviewed the Federal Reserve\u2019s The  Supervisory Capital Assessment Program: Design and Implementation  (SCAP design and implementation document) dated April 24, 2009, and  The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program: Overview of Results  (SCAP results document) dated May 7, 2009. In addition to the publicly  released BHC-level loss estimates, we analyzed the initial stress test  results that the Federal Reserve provided to each BHC, the subsequent  adjustments the Federal Reserve made to these results, and its reasons for  making them. We also reviewed the BHCs\u2019 quarterly regulatory filings,  such as the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2009 Consolidated Financial Statements for  Bank Holding Companies\u2014FR Y-9C (Y-9C); form 10-Qs and annual form  10-Ks; speeches, testimonies, and articles regarding SCAP and stress  testing; and BHC presentations to shareholders and earnings reports. To  more completely understand the execution of SCAP, we completed a  literature search of stress tests that other entities have conducted, such as  the Committee of European Banking Supervisors and the International  Monetary Fund. We also reviewed the Congressional Oversight Panel\u2019s  analysis of SCAP. In addition, we reviewed the capital plans of the 10  BHCs that were required to raise capital to satisfy their SCAP capital  requirement. We collected and analyzed data on the BHCs\u2019 actual  performance from a private financial database of public information and  compared it with the 2-year SCAP estimates and with GAO\u2019s 1-year pro  rata loss estimates for the more adverse scenario (pro rata loss estimate).  GAO calculated the pro rata loss estimates by dividing the SCAP more  adverse 2-year loss estimates by 2. This pro rata estimate methodology has  some limitations, because losses, expenses, revenues, and changes to  reserves are historically unevenly distributed and loss rates over a 2-year  period in an uncertain economic environment can follow an inconsistent  path. However, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency (OCC), credit rating agencies, an SNL Financial analyst, and all  of the BHCs we interviewed that are tracking performance relative to  SCAP estimates are also using the same methodology. We obtained  Federal Reserve and BHCs comments on our performance comparison.  Further, we interviewed regulatory and BHC officials to get their views on  the SCAP stress test. Regulatory officials included bank examiners,  economists, and attorneys from the Federal Reserve; the Federal Reserve  district banks; the OCC; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  (FDIC); the Office of Thrift Supervision; and BHC senior officials,  including chief financial officers and chief risk officers, who participated  in the SCAP stress test and were responsible for coordinating and  discussing the results with regulators. These officials represented several  types of BHCs, including traditional, custodial, investment, auto finance,  and credit card institutions. Finally, we met with credit rating agency  officials to get their views on SCAP and understand their own stress  testing practices for banks. For additional information on the scope and  methodology for this engagement, see appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2009 to September 2010  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Despite efforts undertaken by TARP to bolster capital of the largest  financial institutions, market conditions in the beginning of 2009 were  deteriorating and public confidence in the ability of financial institutions  to withstand losses and to continue lending were further declining. On  February 10, 2009, Treasury announced the Financial Stability Plan, which  outlined measures to address the financial crisis and restore confidence in  the U.S. financial and housing markets. The goals of the plan were to (1)  restart the flow of credit to consumers and businesses, (2) strengthen  financial institutions, and (3) provide aid to homeowners and small  businesses. Under SCAP, the stress test would assess the ability of the  largest 19 BHCs to absorb losses if economic conditions deteriorated  further in a hypothetical \u201cmore adverse\u201d scenario, characterized by a  sharper and more protracted decline in gross domestic product (GDP)  growth, a steeper drop in home prices, and a larger rise in the  unemployment rate than in a baseline consensus scenario. BHCs that were  found not to meet the SCAP capital buffer requirement under the \u201cmore  adverse\u201d scenario would need to provide a satisfactory capital plan to  address any shortfall by raising funds, privately if possible. CAP, which  was a key part of the plan, would provide backup capital to financial  institutions unable to raise funds from private investors. Any of the 19  BHCs that participated in the stress test and had a capital shortfall could  apply for capital from CAP immediately if necessary. The timeline in  figure 1 provides some highlights of key developments in the  implementation of SCAP.", "In a joint statement issued on February 10, 2009, Treasury, along with the  Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC (collectively referred to as the SCAP  regulators), committed to design and implement the stress test. According  to a Treasury official, the department generally did not participate in the  design or implementation of SCAP, but was kept informed by the Federal  Reserve during the stress test. The SCAP regulators developed economic  assumptions to estimate the potential impact of further losses on BHCs\u2019  capital under two scenarios. The baseline scenario reflected the consensus  view about the depth and duration of the recession, and the more adverse  scenario reflected a plausible but deeper and longer recession than the  consensus view. Regulators then calculated how much capital, if any, was  required for each BHC to achieve the required SCAP buffer at the end of  2010 under the more adverse scenario.", "The SCAP assessment examined tier 1 capital and tier 1 common capital,  and the BHCs were required to raise capital to meet any identified capital  shortfall (either tier 1 capital or tier 1 common capital). Tier 1 risk-based  capital is considered core capital\u2014the most stable and readily available  for supporting a bank\u2019s operations and includes elements such as common  stock and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. SCAP\u2019s focus on tier  1 common capital, a subset of tier 1 capital, reflects the recent regulatory  push for BHCs to hold a higher quality of capital. The focus on common  equity reflected both the long held view by bank supervisors that common  equity should be the dominant component of tier 1 capital and increased  market scrutiny of common equity ratios, driven in part by deterioration in  common equity during the financial crisis. Common equity offers  protection to more senior parts of the capital structure because it is the  first to absorb losses in the capital structure. Common equity also gives a  BHC greater permanent loss absorption capacity and greater ability to  conserve resources under stress by changing the amount and timing of  dividends and other distributions.", "To protect against risks, financial regulators set minimum standards for  the capital that firms are to hold. However, SCAP set a one-time  minimum capital buffer target for BHCs to hold to protect against losses  and preprovision net revenue (PPNR) that were worse than anticipated  during the 2009 to 2010 period. For the purposes of SCAP, the one-time  target capital adequacy ratios are at least 6 percent of risk-weighted assets  in tier 1 capital and at least 4 percent in tier 1 common capital projected as  of December 31, 2010. For the purposes of the projection, the regulators  assumed that BHCs would suffer the estimated losses and earned revenues  in 2009 and 2010 in the more adverse scenario. SCAP regulators conducted  the stress test strictly on the BHCs\u2019 assets as of December 31, 2008,  and\u2014with the exception of off-balance sheet positions subject to  Financial Accounting Statements No. 166 and 167, which assumed in the  analysis to come on balance sheet as of January 1, 2010\u2014did not take int account any changes in the composition of their balance sheets over the year time frame.", "Stress testing is one of many risk management tools used by both BHCs  and regulators. Complex financial institutions need management  information systems that can help firms to identify, assess, and manage a  full range of risks across the whole organization arising from both internal  and external sources and from assets and obligations that are found both  on and off the BHC\u2019s balance sheet. This approach is intended to help  ensure that a firmwide approach to managing risk has been viewed as  being crucial for responding to rapid and unanticipated changes in  financial markets. Risk management also depends on an effective  corporate governance system that addresses risk across the institution and  also within specific areas, such as subprime mortgage lending. The board  of directors, senior management, audit committee, internal auditors,  external auditors, and others play important roles in effectively operating  a risk management system. The different roles of each of these groups  represent critical checks and balances in the overall risk management  system. However, the management information systems at many financial  institutions have been called into question since the financial crisis began  in 2007. Identified shortcomings, such as lack of firmwide stress testing,  have led banking organizations and their regulators to reassess capital  requirements, risk management practices, and other aspects of bank  regulation and supervision.", "Stress testing has been used throughout the financial industry for more  than 10 years, but has recently evolved as a risk management tool in  response to the urgency of the financial crisis. The main evolution is  towards the use of comprehensive firmwide stress testing as an integral  and critical part of firms\u2019 internal capital adequacy assessment processes.  In the case of SCAP, the intent of the stress test was to help ensure that  the capital held by a BHC is sufficient to withstand a plausible adverse  economic environment over the 2-year time frame ending December 31,  2010. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee)  issued a document in May 2009 outlining several principles for sound  stress testing practices and supervision. The Basel Committee document  endorses stress testing by banks as a part of their internal risk  management to assess the following:    Credit risk. The potential for financial losses resulting from the failure of  a borrower or counterparty to perform on an obligation.", "Market risk. The potential for financial losses due to an increase or  decrease in the value of an asset or liability resulting from broad price  movements; for example, in interest rates, commodity prices, stock prices,  or the relative value of currencies (foreign exchange).", "Liquidity risk. The potential for financial losses due to an institution\u2019s  failure to meet its obligations because it cannot liquidate assets or obtain  adequate funding.", "Operational risk. The potential for unexpected financial losses due to a  wide variety of institutional factors including inadequate information  systems, operational problems, breaches in internal controls, or fraud.", "Legal risk. The potential for financial losses due to breaches of law or  regulation that may result in heavy penalties or other costs.", "Compliance risk. The potential for loss arising from violations of laws or  regulations or nonconformance with internal policies or ethical standards.", "Strategic risk. The potential for loss arising from adverse business  decisions or improper implementation of decisions.", "Reputational risk. The potential for loss arising from negative publicity  regarding an institution\u2019s business practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SCAP Process Generally Viewed as Promoting Coordination, Transparency, and Capital Adequacy", "paragraphs": ["According to SCAP regulators and many market participants we  interviewed, the process used to design and implement SCAP was  effective in promoting coordination and transparency among the  regulators and participating BHCs, but some SCAP participants we  interviewed expressed concerns about the process. The majority of  supervisory and bank industry officials we interviewed stated that they  were satisfied with how SCAP was implemented, especially considering  the stress test\u2019s unprecedented nature, limited time frame, and the  uncertainty in the economy. SCAP established a process for (1)  coordinating and communicating among the regulators and with the BHCs  and (2) promoting transparency of the stress test to the public. In addition,  according to regulators, the process resulted in a methodology that yielded  credible results and by design helped to assure that the BHCs would be  sufficiently capitalized to weather a more adverse economic downturn."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "SCAP Process Included Coordination and Communication among the Federal Bank Regulators and with the BHCs", "paragraphs": ["Robust coordination and communication are essential to programs like  SCAP when bringing together regulatory staff from multiple agencies and  disciplines to effectively analyze complex financial institutions and  understand the interactions among multiple layers of risk. Moreover,  supervisory guidance emphasizes the importance of coordination and  communication among regulators to both effectively assess banks and  conduct coordinated supervisory reviews across a group of peer  institutions, referred to as \u201chorizontal examinations.\u201d", "The regulators implemented each phase of SCAP in a coordinated  interagency fashion. Also, while some disagreed, most regulators and  market participants we interviewed were satisfied with the level of  coordination and communication. They also thought that the SCAP  process could serve as a model for future supervisory efforts. The  regulators executed the SCAP process in three broad phases:  In the first phase, the Analytical Group, comprising interagency  economists and supervisors, generated two sets of economic conditions\u2014 a baseline scenario and a more adverse scenario with a worse-than- expected economic outcome\u2014and then used these scenarios to aid in  estimating industrywide indicative loan loss rates. To develop these  scenarios, the Analytical Group used three primary indicators of economic  health: the U.S. GDP, housing prices in 10 key U.S. cities, and the annual  average U.S. unemployment rate. The baseline scenario reflected the  consensus view of the course for the economy as of February 2009,  according to well-known professional economic forecasters. The Federal  Reserve developed the more adverse scenario from the baseline scenario  by taking into account the historical accuracy of the forecasts for  unemployment and the GDP and the uncertainty of the economic outlook  at that time by professional forecasters. The Federal Reserve also used  regulators\u2019 judgment about the appropriate severity of assumed additional  stresses against which BHCs would be required to hold a capital buffer,  given that the economy was already in a recession at the initiation of  SCAP.", "In the second phase, several Supervisory Analytical and Advisory Teams\u2014 comprising interagency senior examiners, economists, accountants,  lawyers, financial analysts, and other professionals from the SCAP  regulators\u2014collected, verified, and analyzed each BHC\u2019s estimates for  losses, PPNR, and allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL). The teams  also collected additional data to evaluate the BHC\u2019s estimates, and to  allow supervisors to develop their own independent estimates of losses for  loans, trading assets, counterparty credit risk, and securities and PPNR for  each BHC.", "In the third phase, the Capital Assessment Group, comprising interagency  staff, served as the informal decision-making body for SCAP. The Capital  Assessment Group developed a framework for combing the Supervisory  Analytical and Advisory Teams\u2019 estimates with other independent  supervisory estimates of loan losses and resources available to absorb  these losses. They evaluated the estimates by comparing across BHCs  and by aggregating over the 19 BHCs to check for consistency with the  specified macroeconomic scenarios to calculate the amount, if any, of  additional capital needed for each BHC to achieve the SCAP buffer target  capital ratios as of December 31, 2010, in the more adverse economic  environment. Lastly, the Capital Assessment Group set two deadlines: (1)  June 8, 2009, for BHCs requiring capital to develop and submit a capital  plan to the Federal Reserve on how they would meet their SCAP capital  shortfall and (2) November 9, 2009, for these BHCs to raise the required  capital.", "A key component of this process was the involvement of multidisciplinary  interagency teams that leveraged the skills and experiences of staff from  different disciplines and agencies. The Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC  had representatives on each SCAP team (the Analytical Group,  Supervisory Analytical and Advisory Teams, and the Capital Assessment  Group). For example, OCC officials said that they contributed to the  development of quantitative models required for the implementation of  SCAP and offered their own models for use in assessing the loss rates of  certain portfolios. In addition, each of the SCAP regulators tapped  expertise within their organization for specific disciplines, such as  accounting, custodial banking, macroeconomics, commercial and industry  loan loss modeling, and consumer risk modeling. According to the FDIC,  the broad involvement of experts from across the agencies helped validate  loss assumptions and also helped improve confidence in the results.  Further, these officials noted that the SCAP process was enhanced  because productive debate became a common event as team members  from different regulatory agencies and disciplines brought their own  perspectives and ideas to the process. For example, some SCAP staff  argued for a more moderate treatment of securities in BHCs\u2019 available for  sale portfolios, which would have been consistent with generally accepted  accounting principles under a new change in accounting standards. They  maintained that the modified accounting standard for declines in market  value (and discounting the impact of liquidity premia) that had been  implemented after the stress test was announced and before the numbers  had been finalized was in some ways more reflective of the realized credit  loss expectations for the affected securities. After significant discussion,  the regulators decided to allow for the accounting change in the baseline  loss estimates, but not in the more adverse scenario estimates. They  believed that under the more adverse scenario there was a heightened  possibility of increased liquidity demands on banks and that many  distressed securities would need to be liquidated at distressed levels.  Consequently, for securities found to be other than temporarily impaired  in the more adverse scenario, they assumed the firm would have to realize  all unrealized losses (i.e., write down the value of the security to market  value as of year end 2008). Similarly, some staff argued against adopting  other changes in accounting standards that were expected to impact  BHCs\u2019 balance sheets, including their capital adequacy. Primary among  these was the inclusion of previously off-balance sheet items. As noted  above, ultimately, the more conservative approach prevailed and the  expected inclusion of these assets was addressed in SCAP.", "To facilitate coordination, the Federal Reserve instituted a voting system  to resolve any contentious issues, but in practice differences among  regulators were generally resolved through consensus. When SCAP  regulators met, the Federal Reserve led the discussions and solicited input  from other regulators. For example, officials from OCC and FDIC both  told us that they felt that they were adequately involved in tailoring the  aggregate loss estimates to each BHC as part of the determination of each  BHC\u2019s SCAP capital requirement. SCAP regulators were also involved in  drafting the design and results documents, which were publicly released  by the Federal Reserve.", "Representatives from most of the BHCs were satisfied with the SCAP  regulators\u2019 coordination and communication. Many of the BHC officials  stated that they were generally impressed with the onsite SCAP teams and  said that these teams improved the BHCs\u2019 coordination and  communication with the regulators. BHC officials said that they usually  received answers to their questions in a timely manner, either during  conference calls held three times a week, through the distribution of  answers to frequently asked questions, or from onsite SCAP examiners.  Collecting and aggregating data were among the most difficult and time- consuming tasks for BHCs, but most of them stated that the nature of the  SCAP\u2019s requests were clear. At the conclusion of SCAP, the regulators  presented the results to each of the institutions showing the final numbers  that they planned to publish."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Market Participants Generally Agreed that the SCAP Process Was Transparent", "paragraphs": ["The SCAP process included steps to promote transparency, such as the  release of key program information to SCAP BHCs and the public.  According to SCAP regulators, BHCs, and credit rating agency officials we  interviewed, the release of the results provided specific information on the  financial health and viability of the 19 largest BHCs regarding their ability  to withstand additional losses during a time of significant uncertainty.  Many experts have said that the lack of transparency about potential  losses from certain assets contributed significantly to the instability in  financial markets during the current crisis. Such officials also stated that  publicly releasing the methodology and results of the stress test helped  strengthen market confidence. Further, many market observers have  commented that the Federal Reserve\u2019s unprecedented disclosure of  sensitive supervisory information for each BHC helped European bank  regulators decide to publicly release detailed results of their own stress  tests in July 2010.", "Not all SCAP participants agreed that the SCAP process was fully  transparent. For example, some participants questioned the transparency  of certain assumptions used in developing the stress test. According to  BHC officials and one regulator, the Federal Reserve could have shared  more detailed information about SCAP loss assumptions and calculations  with BHCs. According to several BHC officials, the Federal Reserve did  not fully explain the methodology for estimating losses but expected BHC  officials to fully document and provide supporting data for all of their  assumptions. Without knowing the details of the methodology, according  to some BHC officials, they could not efficiently provide all relevant  information to SCAP examiners."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SCAP Was Designed to Help Ensure That BHCs Were Adequately Capitalized Under the More Adverse Economic Scenario", "paragraphs": ["SCAP regulators aimed to ensure that SCAP sufficiently stressed BHCs\u2019  risk exposures and potential PPNR under the more adverse scenario. To  accomplish this, the regulators made what they viewed to be conservative  assumptions and decisions in the following areas. First, the regulators  decided to stress only assets that were on the BHCs\u2019 balance sheets as of  December 31, 2008, (i.e., a static approach) without accounting for new  business activity. According to BHC officials, new loans were thought to  have generally been of better quality than legacy loans because BHCs had  significantly tightened their underwriting standards since the onset of the  financial crisis. As a result, BHCs would have been less likely to charge- off these loans within the SCAP time period ending December 31, 2010,  resulting in the potential for greater reported revenue estimates for the  period. By excluding earnings from new business, risk-weighted assets  were understated, charge-off rates were overstated, and projected capital  levels were understated.", "Second, SCAP regulators generally did not allow the BHCs to cut expenses  to address the anticipated drop in revenues under the more adverse  scenario. However, some BHC officials told us that they would likely cut  expenses, including initiating rounds of layoffs, if the economy performed  in accordance with the more adverse economic scenario, especially if they  were not generating any new business. Federal Reserve officials noted that  BHCs were given credit in the stress test for cost cuts made in the first  quarter of 2009.", "Third, some BHCs were required to assume an increase in their ALLL as of  the end of 2010, if necessary, to ensure adequate reserves relative to their  year end 2010 portfolio. Some BHC officials believed that this requirement  resulted in the BHCs having to raise additional capital because the  required ALLL increases were subtracted from the revenue estimates in  calculating the resources available to absorb losses. This meant that some  BHCs judged to have insufficient year end 2010 reserve adequacy had to  account for this shortcoming in the calculation of capital needed to meet  the SCAP targeted capital requirements as of the end of 2010 while  maintaining a sufficient ALLL for 2011 losses under the more adverse  economic scenario. According to some BHCs, the size of the 2010 ALLL  was severe given the extent of losses are already included in the 2009 and  2010 loss estimates and effectively stressed BHCs for a third year.", "Finally, according to many BHC officials and others, the calculations used  to derive the loan loss rates and other assumptions to stress the BHCs  were conservative (i.e., more severe). For example, the total loan loss rate  estimated by the SCAP regulators was 9.1 percent, which was greater than  the historical 2-year loan loss rates at all commercial banks from 1921 until  2008, including the worst levels seen during the Great Depression (see  figure 2). However, the macroeconomic assumptions of the more adverse  scenario, which we will discuss later in the report, did not meet the  definition of a depression. Specifically, a 25 percent unemployment rate  coupled with economic contraction is indicative of a depression. In  contrast, the more adverse scenario estimated approximately a 10 percent  unemployment rate with some economic growth in late 2010.", "SCAP regulators also estimated ranges for loan loss rates within specific  loan categories using the baseline and more adverse scenarios as guides.  They used a variety of methods to tailor loan losses to each BHC,  including an analysis of past BHC losses and quantitative models, and  sought empirical support from BHCs regarding the risk level of their  portfolios. However, some BHCs told us that the Federal Reserve made  substantial efforts to help ensure conformity with the indicative loan loss  rates while incorporating BHC-specific information where possible and  reliable. Table 1 compares the different indicative loan loss rate ranges  under the more adverse scenario for each asset category with actual losses  in 2009 for SCAP BHCs and the banking industry. Some BHCs stated that  the resulting loan loss rates were indicative of an economy worse off than  that represented by the more adverse macroeconomic assumptions,  although they recognized the need for the more conservative approach.", "However, nearly all agreed that the loan loss rates were a more important  indication of the stringency of SCAP than the assumptions.", "After the public release of the SCAP methodology in April 2009, many  observers commented that the macroeconomic assumptions for a more  adverse economic downturn were not severe enough given the economic  conditions at that time. In defining a more adverse economic scenario, the  SCAP regulators made assumptions about the path of the economy using  three broad macroeconomic indicators\u2014changes in real GDP, the  unemployment rate, and home prices\u2014during the 2-year SCAP period  ending December 2010. The actual performances of GDP and home prices  have performed better than assumed under the more adverse scenario.  However, the actual unemployment rate has more closely tracked the  more adverse scenario (see figure 3). Further, as noted earlier, some  regulatory and BHC officials have indicated that the loan loss rates that  the regulators subsequently developed were more severe than one would  have expected under the macroeconomic assumptions. While our analysis  of actual and SCAP estimated indicative loan losses (see table 1) is  generally consistent with this view, these estimates were developed at a  time of significant uncertainty about the direction of the economy and the  financial markets, as well as an unprecedented deterioration in the U.S.  housing markets."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "While SCAP Increased Capital Levels and Improved Confidence in the Banking System, BHCs Could Face Ongoing Challenges", "paragraphs": ["SCAP largely met its goals of increasing the level and quality of capital  held by the 19 largest BHCs and, more broadly, of strengthening market  confidence in the banking system. The stress test identified 10 of the 19  BHCs as needing to raise a total of about $75 billion in additional capital.  The Federal Reserve encouraged the BHCs to raise common equity via  private sources\u2014for example, through new common equity issuances,  conversion of existing preferred equity to common equity, and sales of  businesses or portfolios of assets. Nine of the 10 BHCs were able to raise  the required SCAP amount of new common equity in the private markets  by the November 9, 2009, deadline (see table 2). Some of these BHCs also  raised capital internally from other sources. GMAC LLC (GMAC) was the  only BHC that was not able to raise sufficient private capital by the  November 9, 2009, deadline. On December 30, 2009, Treasury provided  GMAC with a capital investment of $3.8 billion to help fulfill its SCAP  capital buffer requirement, drawing funds from TARP\u2019s Automotive  Industry Financing Program. A unique and additional element of the  estimated losses for GMAC included the unknown impact of possible  bankruptcy filings by General Motors Corporation (GM) and Chrysler LLC  (Chrysler). Thus, a conservative estimate of GMAC\u2019s capital buffer was  developed in response to this possibility. The Federal Reserve, in  consultation with Treasury, subsequently reduced GMAC\u2019s SCAP required  capital buffer by $1.8 billion\u2014$5.6 billion to $3.8 billion\u2014primarily to  reflect the lower-than-estimated actual losses from the bankruptcy  proceedings of GM and Chrysler. GMAC was the only company to have its  original capital buffer requirement reduced.", "Capital adequacy generally improved across all 19 SCAP BHCs during  2009. As shown in table 3, the largest gains were in tier 1 common capital,  which increased by about 51 percent in the aggregate across the 19 BHCs,  rising from $412.5 billion on December 31, 2008, to $621.9 billion by  December 31, 2009. On an aggregate basis, the tier 1 common capital ratio  at BHCs increased from 5.3 percent to 8.3 percent of risk-weighted assets  (compared with the SCAP threshold of 4 percent at the end of 2010). The  tier 1 risk-based capital ratio also grew from 10.7 percent to 11.3 percent  of risk-weighted assets (compared with the SCAP threshold of 6 percent at  the end of 2010). While these ratios were helped to some extent by  reductions in risk-weighted assets, which fell 4.3 percent from $7.815  trillion on December 31, 2008, to $7.481 trillion on December 31, 2009, the  primary driver of the increases was the increase in total tier 1 common  capital.", "The quality of capital\u2014measured as that portion of capital made up of tier  1 common equity\u2014also increased across most of the BHCs in 2009. The  tier 1 common capital ratio increased at 17 of the 19 BHCs between the  end of 2008 and the end of 2009 (see table 4). Citigroup Inc. (Citigroup)  and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Goldman Sachs) had the largest  increases in tier 1 common capital ratios\u2014747 and 450 basis points,  respectively. However, GMAC\u2019s tier 1 common capital ratio declined by  155 basis points in this period to 4.85 percent. MetLife, Inc. was the only  other BHC to see a drop in its tier 1 common capital ratio, which fell by 33  basis points to 8.17 percent and still more than double the 4 percent target.  Based on the SCAP results document, the 2008 balances in the table  include the impact of certain mergers and acquisitions, such as Bank of  America Corporation\u2019s (Bank of America) purchase of Merrill Lynch & Co.  Inc. Further, the increase in capital levels reflects the capital that was  raised as a result of SCAP.", "As previously stated by interviewees, the unprecedented public release of  the stress test results helped to restore investors\u2019 confidence in the  financial markets. Some officials from participating BHCs and credit rating  agencies also viewed the BHCs\u2019 ability to raise the capital required by the  stress test as further evidence of SCAP\u2019s success in increasing market  confidence and reducing uncertainty. But some expressed concerns that  the timing of the announcement of SCAP on February 10, 2009\u2014nearly 3  months before the results were released on May 7, 2009\u2014may have  intensified market uncertainty about the financial health of the BHCs.", "A broad set of market indicators also suggest that the public release of  SCAP results may have helped reduce uncertainty in the financial markets  and increased market confidence. For example, banks\u2019 renewed ability to  raise private capital reflects improvements in perceptions of the financial  condition of banks. Specifically, banks and thrifts raised significant  amounts of common equity in 2008, totaling $56 billion. Banks and thrifts  raised $63 billion in common equity in the second quarter of 2009 (see  figure 4). The substantial increase in second quarter issuance of common  equity occurred after the stress test results were released on May 7, 2009,  and was dominated by several SCAP institutions.", "Similarly, stock market prices since the release of the stress test results in  May 2009 through October 2009 improved substantially in the overall  banking sector and among the 18 public BHCs that participated in SCAP  (see figure 5). The initial increase since May 2009 also suggests that  SCAP may have helped bolster investor and public confidence. However,  equity markets are generally volatile and react to a multitude of events.", "Credit default swap spreads, another measure of confidence in the  banking sector, also improved. A credit default swap is an agreement in  which a buyer pays a periodic fee to a seller in exchange for protection  from certain credit events such as bankruptcy, failure to pay debt  obligations, or a restructuring related to a specific debt issuer or issues  known as the reference entity. Therefore, the credit default swap spread,  or market price, is a measure of the credit risk of the reference entity, with  a higher spread indicating a greater amount of credit risk. When the  markets\u2019 perception of the reference entity\u2019s credit risk deteriorates or  improves, the spread generally will widen or tighten, respectively.  Following the SCAP results release in May 2009, the credit default swap  spreads continued to see improvements (see figure 6). While many forces  interact to influence investors\u2019 actions, these declining spreads suggest  that the market\u2019s perception of the risk of banking sector defaults was  falling. Further, the redemption of TARP investments by some banking  institutions demonstrated that regulators believed these firms could  continue to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength, as well  as fulfill their roles as intermediaries that facilitate lending, while both  reducing reliance on government funding and maintaining adequate capital  levels. This positive view of the regulators may also have helped increase  market confidence in the banking system (see appendix II for details on  the status of TARP investments in the institutions participating in SCAP)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The 19 Tested BHCs Experienced Better Performance Than a Pro Rata Estimate under the More Adverse Scenario", "paragraphs": ["As of the end of 2009, while the SCAP BHCs generally had not experienced  the level of losses that were estimated on a pro rata basis under the stress  test\u2019s more adverse economic scenario, concerns remain that some banks  could absorb potentially significant losses in certain asset categories that  would erode capital levels. Collectively, the BHCs\u2019 total loan losses of  $141.2 billion were approximately 38 percent less than the GAO-calculated  $229.4 billion in pro rata losses under the more adverse scenario for 2009  (see table 5). The BHCs also experienced significant gains in securities  and trading and counterparty credit risk portfolios compared with  estimated pro rata losses under SCAP. Total resources other than capital  to absorb losses (resources) were relatively close to the pro rata amount,  exceeding it by 4 percent.", "In tracking BHCs\u2019 losses and resources against the SCAP estimates, we  compared the actual results with those estimated under the more adverse  scenario. We used the 2-year estimates of the more adverse scenario from  the SCAP results and annualized those amounts by dividing them in half  (the \u201cstraight line\u201d method) to get pro rata loss estimates for 2009 because  the SCAP regulators did not develop estimates on a quarterly or annual  basis. A key limitation of this approach is that it assumes equal  distribution of losses, revenues, expenses, and changes to reserves over  time, although these items were unlikely to be distributed evenly over the  2-year period. Another important consideration is that actual results were  not intended and should not be expected to align with the SCAP  projections. Actual economic performance in 2009 differed from the SCAP  macroeconomic variable inputs, which were based on a scenario that was  more adverse than was anticipated or than occurred, and other forces in  the business and regulatory environment could have influenced the timing  and level of losses.

(SunTrust)\u2014exceeded these estimates in at least one portfolio (see figure  7). GMAC was the only one with 2009 loan losses on certain portfolios that  exceeded SCAP\u2019s full 2-year estimate. Specifically, GMAC exceeded the  SCAP 2-year estimated losses in the first-lien, second/junior lien, and  commercial real estate portfolios and the 1-year pro rata losses in the  \u201cOther\u201d portfolio; Citigroup exceeded the 1-year pro rata estimated losses  in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio; and SunTrust exceeded  the 1-year estimated losses in the first-lien and credit card portfolios.

In  the second/junior lien portfolio, GMAC saw losses of $1.6 billion,  compared with the $1.1 billion estimated losses for the 2 years. GMAC  experienced losses of $710 million in its commercial real estate portfolio,  compared with $600 million projected for the full 2-year period. Further, in  its \u201cOther\u201d portfolio (which is comprised of auto leases and consumer auto  loans), GMAC\u2019s losses were $2.1 billion, exceeding the 1-year pro rata $2  billion loss estimate. With a tier 1 common capital ratio of 4.85 percent\u2014 just more than the SCAP threshold of 4 percent\u2014at the end of 2009, GMAC  has a relatively small buffer in the face of potential losses.", "GMAC\u2019s position should be placed in context, however, because it is  relatively unique among the SCAP participants. It was the only nonpublicly  traded participant, and the federal government owns a majority equity  stake in the company as a result of capital investments made through the  Automotive Industry Financing Program under TARP. Further, GMAC\u2019s  core business line\u2014financing for automobiles\u2014is dependent on the  success of efforts to restructure, stabilize, and grow General Motors  Company and Chrysler Group LLC. Finally, the Federal Reserve told us  that because GMAC only recently became a BHC and had not previously  been subject to banking regulations, it would take some time before  GMAC was fully assimilated into a regulated banking environment. To  improve its future operating performance and better position itself to  become a public company in the future, GMAC officials stated that the  company posted large losses in the fourth quarter of 2009 as result of  accelerating its recognition of lifetime losses on loans. In addition, the  company has been restructuring its operations and recently sold off some  nonperforming assets. However, the credit rating agencies we met with  generally believed that there could still be further losses at GMAC,  although the agencies were less certain about the pace and level of those  losses.

The SCAP assessment of the securities portfolio  consisted of an evaluation for possible impairment of the portfolio\u2019s  assets, including Treasury securities, government agency securities,  sovereign debt, and private sector securities. In the aggregate, the  securities portfolio has experienced a gain of $3.5 billion in 2009,  compared with a pro rata estimated loss of $17.6 billion under the stress  test\u2019s more adverse scenario. As figure 8 shows, 5 of the 19 BHCs recorded  securities losses in 2009, 13 recorded gains, and 1 (Morgan Stanley)  recorded no gain or loss. Losses were projected at 17 of the BHCs under  the pro rata more adverse scenario, and SCAP regulators did not consider  the remaining 2 BHCs (American Express Company and Morgan Stanley)  to be applicable for this category. In the securities portfolio, The Bank of  New York Mellon Corporation had losses greater than estimated under  SCAP for the full 2-year period. The variances could be due to a number  of factors, including the extent to which a BHC decides to deleverage, how  their positions react to changing market values, and other factors.", "To estimate trading and counterparty losses, SCAP regulators assumed  that these investments would be subject to the change in value of a  proportional level as experienced in the last half of 2008.

The stress test only calculated trading and  counterparty credit loss estimates for the five BHCs with trading assets  that exceeded $100 billion. All five had trading gains as opposed to  losses, based on the publicly available data from the Y-9C. These gains  were the result of a number of particular circumstances. First, the extreme  spreads and risk premium resulting from the lack of liquidity during the  financial crisis\u2014especially in the second half of 2008\u2014reversed in 2009,  improving the pricing of many risky trading assets that remained on BHCs\u2019  balance sheets. Because the trading portfolio is valued at fair value, it had  been written down for the declines in value that occurred throughout 2008  and the first quarter of 2009 and saw significant gains when the market  rebounded through the remainder of 2009. Second, the crisis led to the  failure or absorption of several large investment banks, reducing the  number of competitors and, according to our analysis of Thomson Reuters  Datastream, increased market share and pricing power for the remaining  firms. Finally, the Federal Reserve\u2019s low overnight bank lending rates  (near 0 percent) have prevailed for a long period and have facilitated a  favorable trading environment for BHCs.

As they continue to experience the effects of the  recent financial crisis, estimating precisely how much more they could  lose is difficult.

Standard & Poor\u2019s Corporation noted that many nonperforming loans may  ultimately have to be charged-off, exposing the BHCs to further potential  losses. According to the credit rating agencies that we interviewed, federal  housing policy to aid homeowners who are facing foreclosures, as well as  time lags in the commercial real estate markets, will likely continue to  affect the number of nonperforming loans for the remainder of the SCAP  time frame (December 2010)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Economic and Regulatory Environment Could Impact BHCs\u2019 Net Revenues and Loss Reserves", "paragraphs": ["The total amount of resources other than capital to absorb losses  (resources) has tracked the amount GAO prorated under the stress test\u2019s  more adverse scenario.

For  example, regulators would review firms\u2019 internal bank stress tests of  counterparty risk and would make some suggestions, but reviews of these  tests were done at the discretion of the individual supervisory team and  were not consistently performed across teams. Even though BHCs have  for many years performed stress tests to one degree or another, they have  not been required to report the results of their testing to the Federal  Reserve unless it specifically requested the information.", "The Federal Reserve recently issued a letter to the largest banking  organizations outlining its view on good practices with respect to the use  of stress testing in the context of internal capital adequacy assessment  practices (ICAAP). For example, some areas highlighted in the letter  include how frequent a stress test should be performed, the minimum time  frame that the test should cover, documentation of the process,  involvement of senior management and board of directors, and types of  scenarios and risks to include in such tests. Some BHC officials believed  that stress testing would become an integral part of future risk  management practices and noted that SCAP helped them see how bank  examiners would want them to stress their portfolios in the future. In  anticipation of future action by regulators, many BHCs were designing at  least part of their stress tests along the lines of SCAP. However, a few BHC  officials hoped that future stress tests would not be performed in the same  manner as SCAP, with the largest institutions tested simultaneously in a  largely public setting, but rather as part of the confidential supervisory  review process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulatory Oversight Is to Focus on More Rigorous Stress Testing, but Examiners Need More Specific Guidance", "paragraphs": ["Federal Reserve officials stated that going forward, stress tests will  become a fundamental part of the agency\u2019s oversight of individual banks  and the financial system. As a result of SCAP, Federal Reserve officials  stated that they are placing greater emphasis on the BHCs\u2019 internal capital  adequacy planning through their ICAAP. This initiative is intended to  improve the measurement of firmwide risk and the incorporation of all  risks into firms\u2019 capital planning assessment and planning processes. In  addition to enhanced supervisory focus on these practices across BHCs,  stress testing is also a key component of the Basel II capital framework  (Pillar 2). Under Pillar 2, supervisory review is intended to help ensure  that banks have adequate capital to support all risks and to encourage that  banks develop and use better risk management practices. All BHCs,  including those adopting Basel II, must have a rigorous process of  assessing capital adequacy that includes strong board and senior  management oversight, comprehensive assessment of risks, rigorous  stress testing and scenario analyses, validation programs, and independent  review and oversight. In addition, Pillar 2 requires supervisors to review  and evaluate banks\u2019 internal capital adequacy assessments and monitor  compliance with regulatory capital requirements. The Federal Reserve  wants the large banks to conduct this work for themselves and report their  findings to their senior management and boards of directors. According to  Federal Reserve officials, for BHCs to satisfy the totality of expectations  for ICAAP it may take 18 to 24 months, partly because the BHCs are taking  actions to enhance practices where needed\u2014including with respect to the  use of stress testing and scenario analyses in internal capital  assessments\u2014and the Federal Reserve then needs to evaluate these  actions across a relatively large number of BHCs.", "In addition, the Federal Reserve is finalizing guidance for examiners to  assess the capital adequacy process, including stress testing, for BHCs.  Examiners are expected to evaluate how BHCs\u2019 stress tests inform the  process for identifying and measuring risk and decisions about capital  adequacy. Federal Reserve officials stated that examiners are expected to  look closely at BHCs\u2019 internal stress test methodologies and results. In a  letter to BHCs, the Federal Reserve also emphasized that institutions  should look at time frames of 2 or more years and considers losses  firmwide. It also suggested that BHCs develop their own stress test  scenarios and then review these scenarios and the results for appropriate  rigor and quantification of risk.", "While these are positive steps, examiners do not have specific criteria for  assessing the quality of these tests. For example, the Federal Reserve has  not established criteria for assessing the severity of the assumptions used  to stress BHCs\u2019 balance sheets. The Federal Reserve officials stated that  they intend to have technical teams determine the type of criteria that will  be needed to evaluate these assumptions, but they are in the early  planning stages. Development of such criteria will be particularly helpful  in ensuring the effective implementation of the stress test requirements  under the Dodd-Frank Act. Without specific criteria, Federal Reserve  examiners will not be able to ensure the rigor of BHCs\u2019 stress tests\u2014an  important part of the capital adequacy planning. Furthermore, the absence  of such guidance could lead to variations in the intensity of these  assessments by individual examiners and across regional districts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Risk Identification and Assessment Infrastructure Needs to be Upgraded to Improve Oversight", "paragraphs": ["Following SCAP, regulatory and BHC officials we met with identified  opportunities to enhance both the process and data inputs for conducting  stress testing in the future. This would include processes for obtaining,  analyzing, and sharing data and capabilities for data modeling and  forecasting, which potentially could increase the Federal Reserve\u2019s  abilities to assess risks in the banking system. According to the Federal  Reserve, an essential component of this new system will be a quantitative  surveillance mechanism for large, complex financial institutions that will  combine a more firmwide and multidisciplinary approach for bank  supervision. This quantitative surveillance mechanism will use supervisory  information, firm-specific data analysis, and market-based indicators to  identify developing strains and imbalances that may affect multiple  institutions, as well as emerging risks within specific institutions. This  effort by the Federal Reserve may also improve other areas of supervision  which rely on data and quantitative analysis, such as assessing the process  used by BHC\u2019s to determine their capital adequacy, forecasting revenue,  and assessing and measuring risk, which is critical to supervising large,  complex banks. Officials at the Federal Reserve told us that examiners  should be analyzing BHC performances versus their stress test projections  to provide insight into the agency\u2019s loss forecasting approach. Moreover,  Federal Reserve officials stated that they are always looking to increase  their analytical capabilities, and they have recently implemented a new  governance structure to address some of their management information  infrastructure challenges. However, not enough time has passed to  determine the extent to which such measures will improve banking  supervision.", "In addition, some other deficiencies were found in the data reported to the  Federal Reserve by BHCs using the Y-9C, as well as the Federal Reserve\u2019s  ability to analyze the risk of losses pertaining to certain portfolios that  were identified during the SCAP stress test. This led the Federal Reserve  to develop a more robust risk identification and assessment infrastructure  including internally developed models or purchased analytical software  and tools from data vendors. Going forward, such models and analytics  would facilitate improved risk identification and assessment capabilities  and oversight, including the oversight of systemic risk. Moreover, a risk  identification and assessment system that can gauge risk in the banking  sector by collecting data on a timelier basis is necessary to better ensure  the safety and soundness of the banking industry. Specific areas in which  data collection and risk identification and assessment could be enhanced  include mortgage default modeling to include more analysis of  nontraditional mortgage products, counterparty level exposures, country  and currency exposures, and commodity exposures. An example of where  the Federal Reserve used SCAP to significantly upgrade its ability to  assess risks across large BHCs is the development of a system that  allowed BHCs to submit their securities positions and market values at a  fixed date and apply price shocks. This process was enhanced during  SCAP to facilitate the stress analysis of securities portfolios held by SCAP  BHCs. This system allowed the Federal Reserve to analyze approximately   100,000 securities in a relatively short time period. The Federal Reserve  intends to continue using this database to receive and analyze updated  positions from BHCs.", "With other portfolios, the Federal Reserve contracted with outside data  and analytical systems providers. For multifamily loan portfolios, nonfarm  loans, and nonresidential loans with a maturity beyond 2 years, all of  which are subsets of commercial and industrial loans or commercial real  estate portfolios, the Federal Reserve used internal models and purchased  an outside vendor service that allowed it to estimate losses for these  portfolios. For the remaining commercial portfolios, the Federal Reserve  used different existing models found at both the Federal Reserve and  Federal Reserve district banks and new models developed to meet the  needs of SCAP. When analyzing BHCs\u2019 mortgage portfolios, the consumer  loans Supervisory Analytical and Advisory Team provided templates to the  BHCs to collect granular data for such analysis, allowing the system to  separate BHCs\u2019 mortgage portfolios into much more granular tranches  than would be possible using data from regulatory filings. The Federal  Reserve further used data from various sources, including a large  comprehensive loan-level database of most mortgages that have been  securitized in the United States to assist in developing its own loss  estimates to benchmark against the BHCs\u2019 proprietary estimates.", "These examples point to enhancements in the ability to assess risks to  individual firms and across the banking sector that resulted from the SCAP  stress test. The Federal Reserve has made clear that it views many of these  innovations in its ability to assess and model risks and potential losses as  permanent additions to its toolkit, and has also recognized the need for  more timely and granular information to improve its supervision of BHCs  and other institutions. However, the extent to which these models and  tools will be distributed across the Federal Reserve district banks and  other federal banking regulators is unclear. In addition, as the stress test  applied to trading positions was limited to those BHCs that held trading  positions of at least $100 billion as of February 20, 2009, the Federal  Reserve has not indicated that it will roll out its new system to BHCs with  smaller trading positions. The Federal Reserve has taken steps to maintain  and enhance the tools and data used during SCAP. Further, improving the  Federal Reserve\u2019s financial data collection and supervisory tools will  require additional resources, training for bank examiners, coordination in  the dissemination of new infrastructure across all U.S. financial regulators,  and, according to a Federal Reserve governor, would benefit from relief  from the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 as well.", "The Federal Reserve lacks a complete plan on how it will achieve  permanent improvements in its risk identification and assessment  infrastructure, but according to officials, such a plan is in development.  The Federal Reserve has finalized a plan that describes a governance  structure for overseeing large, complex financial organizations. The plan  defines the roles and responsibilities of various committees and teams  within the Federal Reserve that will carry out its supervisory  responsibilities over these organizations. However, further planning is  needed to incorporate lessons learned from SCAP for addressing data and  modeling gaps that existed prior to the crisis and a structure for  disseminating improvements to risk identification and assessment.  Specifically, this plan will also be critical to addressing improvements to  data and modeling infrastructure in supervising not only large financial  holding companies but also smaller institutions. A fully developed plan  would also consider how to disseminate data, models, and other  infrastructure to the entire Federal Reserve System and bank regulatory  agencies, as well as the newly established Financial Stability Oversight  Council and Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Research. Without such a plan,  the agency runs the risk of not optimizing its oversight responsibilities,  especially in light of its new duties as the systemic risk regulator under the  Dodd-Frank Act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "More Coordination and Communication across Regulators Is Critical for Understanding Risks to Individual Institutions and Financial Markets", "paragraphs": ["Another critical lesson from SCAP was the need for robust coordination  and communication among the regulators in examining large, complex  financial institutions. Officials from the regulatory agencies and BHCs  stated that the degree of cooperation among the SCAP regulators was  unprecedented and improved the understanding of the risks facing the  individual BHCs and the financial market. Such coordination and  communication will become increasingly important as banking regulators  increase their oversight role. Even with recent major reform to the  financial regulatory structure, multiple regulatory agencies continue to  oversee the banking industry, and regulators will need to prioritize efforts  to promote coordination and communication among staff from these  agencies so that emerging problematic issues affecting the financial  industry are identified in a timely manner and effectively addressed.", "Going forward, based on our discussions with various SCAP participants  and statements by Federal Reserve officials, including the chairman, the  regulators\u2019 experience with SCAP is anticipated to lead to the expanded  use of horizontal examinations and multidisciplinary staff that will require  extensive interagency coordination. Horizontal examinations may involve  multiple regulators and underscore the importance of effective  coordination and communication.", "Currently, regulators are conducting horizontal examinations of internal  processes that evaluate the capital adequacy at the 28 largest U.S. BHCs.  Their focus is on the use of stress testing and scenario analyses in ICAAP,  as well as how shortcomings in fundamental risk management practices  and governance and oversight by the board of directors for these  processes could impair firms\u2019 abilities to estimate their capital needs.  Regulators recently completed the initial phase of horizontal examinations  of incentive compensation practices at 25 large U.S. BHCs. As part of this  review, each organization was required to submit an analysis of  shortcomings or \u201cgaps\u201d in its existing practices relative to the principles  contained in the proposed supervisory guidance issued by the Federal  Reserve in the fall of 2009 as well as plans\u2014including timetables\u2014for  addressing any weaknesses in the firm\u2019s incentive compensation  arrangements and related risk-management and corporate governance  practices. In May 2010, regulators provided the banking organizations  feedback on the firms\u2019 analyses and plans. These organizations recently  submitted revised plans to the Federal Reserve for addressing areas of  deficiencies in their incentive compensation programs. In a June 2010  press release, the Federal Reserve noted that to monitor and encourage  improvements in compensation practices by banking organizations, its  staff will prepare a report after 2010 on trends and developments in such  practices at banking organizations.", "Our prior work has found that coordination and communication among  regulatory agencies is an ongoing challenge. For example, in 2007, OCC  onsite examiners, as well as officials in headquarters, told us that  coordination issues hampered the Federal Reserve\u2019s horizontal  examinations. Also, in 2007, a bank told us that it had initially received  conflicting information from the Federal Reserve, its consolidated  supervisor, and the OCC, its primary bank supervisor, regarding a key  policy interpretation. Officials from the bank also noted that when the  Federal Reserve collected information, it did not coordinate with OCC, the  primary bank examiner of the lead bank, resulting in unnecessary  duplication. We noted that to improve oversight in the future, regulators  will need to work closely together to expedite examinations and avoid  such duplications.", "Since the SCAP stress test was concluded, the following examples  highlight ongoing challenges in coordination and communication:    Officials from OCC and FDIC indicated that they were not always involved  in important discussions and decisions. For example, they were not  involved in the decision to reduce GMAC\u2019s SCAP capital requirement, even  though they were significantly involved in establishing the original capital  requirement. Also, FDIC noted that it was excluded from such decision  even though it is the primary federal bank regulator for GMAC\u2019s retail  bank (Ally Bank).", "The Federal Reserve held an internal meeting to discuss lessons learned  from SCAP, but has yet to reach out to the other SCAP regulators. The  OCC and FDIC told us that they had not met with the Federal Reserve as a  group to evaluate the SCAP process and document lessons learned. As a  result, the FDIC and OCC did not have an opportunity to share their views  on what aspects of SCAP worked and did not work, as well as any  potential improvements that can be incorporated into future horizontal  reviews or other coordinated efforts.", "In the recent horizontal examinations, both FDIC and OCC noted that the  interagency process for collaboration\u2014especially in the initial design  stages\u2014was not as effective as it was for SCAP. OCC commented that  more collaboration up front would have been preferable. Also, FDIC  stated that the Federal Reserve did not include it in meetings to formulate  aggregate findings for the horizontal examination of incentive  compensation programs, and it experienced difficulties in obtaining  aggregate findings from the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve  commented that the FDIC was involved in the development of findings for  those organizations that control an FDIC-supervised subsidiary bank and  that FDIC has since been provided information on the findings across the  full range of organizations included in the horizontal review, the majority  of which do not control an FDIC-supervised subsidiary bank.", "These continued challenges in ensuring effective coordination and  communication underscore the need for sustained commitment and effort  by the regulators to ensure the inclusion of all relevant agencies in key  discussions and decisions regarding the design, implementation, and  results of multiagency horizontal examinations. As the SCAP process has  shown, active participation by all relevant regulators can strengthen  approaches used by examiners in performing their supervisory activities.  Without continuous coordination and communication, the regulators will  miss opportunities to leverage perspectives and experiences that could  further strengthen the supervision of financial institutions, especially  during horizontal examinations of financial institutions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Publicly reporting a comparison of the actual performance of the SCAP  BHCs and the estimated performance under a more adverse scenario  provides insights into the financial strength of the nation\u2019s largest BHCs.  Senior Federal Reserve officials have publicly disclosed select aggregate  information about the performance of the 19 BHCs consistent with the  recommendation in our June 2009 report. Specifically, we recommended  that the Federal Reserve consider periodically disclosing to the public the  performance of the 19 BHCs against the SCAP estimates during the 2-year  period. However, the Federal Reserve has yet to commit to completing a  final analysis that compares the BHCs\u2019 actual performance with the  estimated performance under SCAP\u2019s more adverse economic scenario for  the entire 2-year period and making this analysis public. Such an analysis  is important for the market and BHCs to assess the rigor of the stress test  methodology. Publicly releasing the results also would allow the public to  gauge the health of the BHCs that participated in SCAP, which is a strong  proxy for the entire U.S. banking industry. And public disclosure of this  analysis could act as a catalyst for a public discussion of the value of  effective bank risk management and enhance confidence in the regulatory  supervision of financial institutions.", "The public release of the stress test methodology and results helped  improve market confidence in the largest BHCs during the recent financial  crisis and provided an unprecedented window into bank supervision  process. Subsequently, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and a Federal  Reserve governor have publicly stated that greater transparency should be  built into the supervisory process and that feedback from the public could  help increase the integrity of the supervisory process. Increased  transparency can also augment the information that is available to  investors and counterparties of the institutions tested and enhance market  discipline. Despite these statements, the Federal Reserve and other bank  regulators have yet to start a formal dialogue about this issue, nor have  they developed a plan for integrating public disclosures into the ongoing  supervisory process. Such a plan could detail the types of information that  would benefit the markets if it were publicly released; the planned  methodology for the stress tests, including assumptions; the frequency  with which information would be made public; and the various means of  disseminating the information. Taking into account the need to protect  proprietary information and other market-sensitive information would be  an important part of such a plan. While regulators will undoubtedly face  challenges in determining how best to overcome skepticism about the  potential effects on the financial markets of disclosing sensitive  information on the financial health of banks, the Dodd-Frank Act requires  that the Federal Reserve and certain banks publicly release a summary of  results from periodic stress tests. Without a plan for enhancing the  transparency of supervisory processes and practices, bank regulators may  miss a significant opportunity to further strengthen market discipline and  confidence in the banking industry by providing investors, creditors, and  counterparties with useful information.", "The SCAP stress test shed light on areas for further improvement in the  regulators\u2019 bank supervision processes, including oversight of risk  management practices at BHCs. Prior to SCAP, regulatory oversight of  stress tests performed by the BHCs themselves was ineffective.  Specifically, although regulators required stress tests, the guidelines for  conducting them were more than a decade old, and the individual banks  were responsible for designing and executing them. The Federal Reserve\u2019s   reviews of the internal stress tests were done at the discretion of the  BHCs\u2019 individual supervisory teams and were not consistently performed.  Further, even though BHCs performed stress tests, they were not required  to report the results of their stress testing to the Federal Reserve without a  specific request from regulators. Post-SCAP, however, the Federal Reserve  has stated that stress testing will now be a fundamental part of their  oversight of individual banks. The Federal Reserve expects to play a more  prominent role in reviewing assumptions, results, and providing input into  the BHCs\u2019 risk management practices. While the Federal Reserve has  begun to take steps to augment its oversight, currently Federal Reserve  examiners lack specific criteria for assessing the severity of BHCs\u2019 stress  tests. Without specific criteria, Federal Reserve examiners will not be able  to ensure the rigor of BHCs\u2019 stress tests. Furthermore, the absence of such  criteria could lead to variations in the intensity of these assessments by  individual examiners and across regional districts.", "The experience with SCAP also showed that regulators needed relevant  and detailed data to improve oversight of individual banks and to identify  and assess risks. As the Federal Reserve and the other regulators conduct  more horizontal reviews, they will need a robust plan for quantitatively  assessing the risk in the banking sector. Collecting timely data for the  annual stress testing and other supervisory actions will be critical in order  to better ensure the safety and soundness of the banking industry. The  Federal Reserve has finalized a plan that describes a governance structure  for overseeing large, complex financial organizations. However, further  planning is needed to incorporate lessons learned from SCAP for  addressing data and modeling gaps and a structure for disseminating  improvements to risk identification and assessment. Further, efforts to  improve the risk identification and assessment infrastructure will need to  be effectively coordinated with other regulators and the newly established  Financial Stability Oversight Council and Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial  Research in order to ensure an effective systemwide risk assessment.  Without fully developing a plan that can identify BHCs\u2019 risks in time to  take appropriate supervisory action, the Federal Reserve may not be well- positioned to anticipate and minimize future banking problems and ensure  the soundness of the banking system.", "Despite the positive coordination and communication experience of the  SCAP stress test, developments since the completion of SCAP have  renewed questions about the effectiveness of regulators\u2019 efforts to  strengthen their coordination and communication. For example, on  important issues, such as finalizing GMAC\u2019s SCAP capital amount, the  Federal Reserve chose not to seek the views of other knowledgeable bank  regulators. While the Dodd-Frank Act creates formal mechanisms that  require coordination and communication among regulators, the  experiences from SCAP point to the need for a sustained commitment by  each of the banking regulators to enhance coordination and  communication. In particular, ensuring inclusion of relevant agencies in  key discussions and decisions regarding the design, implementation, and  results of multiagency horizontal examinations will be critical.

We also reviewed the confidential April 24,  2009, and May 5, 2009, presentations that the SCAP regulators made to  each of the 19 BHCs to identify estimates of preprovision net revenue  (PPNR) and changes in allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) for the  2 years ended 2010. Our primary source for the actual results at the BHCs  was the Federal Reserve\u2019s Y-9C. In doing so, we used the SNL Financial  database to extract data on the Y-9C and the Securities and Exchange  Commission forms 10-K and 10-Q. These data were collected following the  close of the fourth quarter of 2009, the halfway point of the SCAP\u2019s 2-year  time frame.", "Since losses were not estimated on a quarter-by-quarter or yearly basis but  projected for the full 2-year period, we assumed that losses and revenue  estimates under the more adverse scenario were distributed at a constant  rate across the projection period. Thus, we compared the actual 2009 year  end values with half of the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2-year SCAP projections.  This methodology has some limitations because losses, expenses,  revenues, and changes to reserves are historically unevenly distributed  and loss rates over a 2-year period in an uncertain economic environment  can follow an inconsistent path. However, the Federal Reserve, OCC,  credit rating agencies, an SNL Financial analyst, and most of the BHCs we  interviewed who are tracking performance relative to SCAP estimates are  also using the same methodology. We assessed the reliability of the SNL  Financial database by following GAO\u2019s best practices for data reliability  and found that the data was sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To  confirm the accuracy of our BHC tracking data, we shared our data with  the Federal Reserve and the 19 SCAP BHCs. We received comments and  incorporated them as appropriate.", "Some of the data that we collected were not in a form that was  immediately comparable to the categories used in the SCAP results, and  we had to make adjustments in order to make the comparison. For tier 1  common capital, most asset categories, and resources other than capital to  absorb losses, we had to find a methodology suited to aggregating these  data so that we could compare it to the corresponding SCAP data. For  example, net-charge offs for the various loan categories are broken out  into more subcategories in the Y-9C than those listed in the SCAP results.  In addition, we calculated \u201cResources Other than Capital to Absorb  Losses\u201d to correspond to the SCAP definition of PPNR minus the change  in ALLL, which required obtaining data from multiple entries within the Y- 9C. When calculating noninterest expense we removed the line item for  goodwill impairment losses because this item was not included in the  SCAP regulators\u2019 projections. We also used the calculation of a change in  ALLL until December 31, 2009. But the SCAP regulators considered an  increase in ALLL over the full 2-year period to be a drain on resources,  because the provisions made to increase the ALLL balance would not be  available to absorb losses during the 2-year SCAP time frame. This notion  creates a problem in using the formula for 1-year tracking purposes  because an increase in ALLL during 2009 would require provisions for that  increase, but those added reserves could ultimately be used to absorb  losses during 2010. To maintain consistency, our calculation considers  ALLL increases during 2009 to be a drain on resources, but we recognize  that this money could act as a resource to absorb losses rather than a  drain on those resources.", "We faced an additional limitation pertaining to the ALLL calculation and a  challenge with regard to the treatment of trading and counterparty  revenues. In our review of SCAP documentation, we found that SCAP  regulators used two different ALLL calculations\u20141 calculation for 4 of the  BHCs that included a reserve for off-balance sheet items and another for  the remaining 15 BHCs that did not include off-balance sheet reserves. The  Federal Reserve confirmed that there were two different calculations that  were not adjusted for consistency. In order to be consistent across the  BHCs, we applied the same methodology that the regulators used for 15 of  the BHCs to the 4 that remained. The treatment of trading and  counterparty revenue created a challenge because the data in the Y-9C  includes both customer derived revenue from transactions for BHCs that  operate as broker-dealers and gains (or losses) from proprietary trading  and certain associated expenses. These items are presented only in net  form in the Y-9C. However, for the five BHCs (Bank of America  Corporation; Citigroup, Inc.; Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.; JPMorgan Chase  & Co.; and Morgan Stanley) that had their trading portfolios stressed, the  trading and counterparty line is based on projections of gains (losses)  from proprietary trading, but PPNR (specifically noninterest revenue) is  based on gains from customer derived revenue from transactions for BHCs  that operate as broker-dealers. Because we could not segregate these  items based on the Y-9C, we have included the net amount in both the  trading and counterparty and noninterest income line items. This means  that the net amount of the trading gains or losses as reported in the Y-9C  are included in two places in our tracking table for those five BHCs. For  the remaining 14 BHCs, we included the entire line item in noninterest  income, as that is where it was located in the SCAP projections.", "Table 6 shows the items we used to calculate tier 1 capital, asset losses,  PPNR, and ALLL as of December 31, 2009 and the specific sources we  used. We also included specific references to the sources we used. Some  elements within the table required a more detailed aggregation or  calculation and are therefore explained further in tables 7 and 8 below.  For reporting these capital measures and asset balances for the year  ending December 31, 2008, we generally relied on the figures published in  various SCAP documents.", "Table 7 shows our methodology for calculating tier 1 common capital,  including the part of the Y-9C in which the data can be found. Currently,  there is no defined regulatory method for calculating tier 1 common  capital, and it is not a required data field for BHCs to file in their Y-9C  submissions. As a result, we developed a formula consistent with the  Federal Reserve\u2019s by reviewing the guidance available in the SCAP design  and implementation and SCAP results documents and consulting with SNL  Financial regarding its methodology.", "Table 8 provides a crosswalk for the asset classification we used to group  the various charge-off categories listed in the Y-9C.", "To ensure additional comparability with SCAP, we attempted to identify  any unique circumstances that could skew the results. For example, after  we shared our initial tracking estimates with the 19 BHCs, one BHC had  identified an issue with our calculation of tier 1 common capital that  resulted from the way information is reported on the Y-9C. After  discussing the issue with the BHC and verifying their explanation, we  adjusted our calculation to more accurately reflect their position. Another  BHC also had a one-time charge that had been included in the \u201cOther\u201d loss  category, and we decided to segregate this item as a separate line item. We  have also submitted our tracking spreadsheet to the Federal Reserve and  to each BHC to give them an opportunity to provide input and ensure the  accuracy and comparability of our numbers. Appropriate adjustments to  2009 numbers based on information received from the Federal Reserve  and individual BHCs are noted, where applicable, in the tables in appendix  III.", "Some items that impact precise comparisons between actual results and  the pro rata estimates are disclosed in our footnotes, rather than as  adjustments to our calculations. For example, the stress test was applied  to loan and other asset portfolios as of December 31, 2008, without  including a calculation for ongoing banking activities. Because the Y-9C  data includes ongoing activity as of the date of the report, the actual  results are slightly different than the performance of the stressed assets as  the BHCs were treated as liquidating concerns rather than going concerns  in the SCAP stress test. Distinguishing between the gains (losses) from  legacy assets and those that resulted from new assets is not possible using  public data. Other examples are that SCAP did not include the impact of  the owned debt value adjustment or one-time items (occurring subsequent  to SCAP) in their projections of PPNR. As credit default swap spreads  narrowed in 2009, liability values increased at most banks, causing a  negative impact on revenue at those banks that chose to account for their  debt at fair value; but these losses were not included in the SCAP  estimates. One-time items, such as sales of business lines, were also not  included in the SCAP estimates of PPNR, as these events occurred  subsequent to the stress test and, in part, could not be fully predicted as a  part of SCAP. Rather than remove the losses from the owned debt value  adjustments and the gains (or losses) due to one-time items from the  BHCs\u2019 2009 PPNR results, we disclosed the amounts in footnotes for the  applicable BHCs. We chose this treatment so that PPNR would reflect  actual results at the BHCs, while still disclosing the adjustments needed  for more precise comparability to SCAP.", "We identified the TARP status of each of the 19 BHCs that participated in  SCAP by reviewing data from the Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Stability\u2019s  TARP Transactions Report for the Period Ending September 22, 2010  (TARP Transactions Report) and the SCAP results document. We used the  SCAP results document to identify BHCs that were required to raise  capital. The TARP Transactions Report, was then used to identify the  program under which TARP funds were received (if any), the amount of  funds received, capital repayment date, amount repaid, and warrant  disposition date and to determine whether the warrants were repurchased  or sold by Treasury in a public offering.", "To gain a better understanding of future potential losses, we determined  the percentage of BHCs\u2019 total loans that are either nonaccrual or more  than 90 days past due using Y-9C data from the SNL Financial database.  We used quarterly data for the period 2007 through 2009 on nonaccrual  loans and past due balances of more than 90 days, for each of the BHCs.  We aggregated the data into the same six loan categories used in SCAP:  first-lien mortgages, second/junior-lien mortgages, commercial and  industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, credit card balances, and  \u201cOther.\u201d (See tables 8 and 9 for details.) Once the data were aggregated,  we divided that data by the applicable total loan balance for each category  at each point in time (i.e., quarterly basis). One limitation is that Y-9C data  were not available for all periods for four of the BHCs (American Express  Company; GMAC LLC; The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.; and Morgan  Stanley) because they had recently became BHCs. As a result, we did not  include these BHCs in the calculation during those periods where their Y- 9Cs were not available (fourth quarter of 2008 and earlier for all except  GMAC LLC, which also did not have a Y-9C in the first quarter of 2009).", "We collected Y-9C data from the SNL Financial database to calculate the  loan loss rates across BHCs with more than $1 billion of assets and  compare the 19 BHCs with the indicative loss rates provided by the SCAP  regulators. We used annual data for the year ended December 31, 2009, on  loan charge-offs. We also used average total loan balances. In the Y-9C  total loan balances were categorized somewhat differently from charge- offs. Table 9 provides a crosswalk for the asset classification. We  aggregated loan balance data into the same categories that were used in  the indicative loss rate table in SCAP: first-lien mortgages, prime  mortgages, Alt-A mortgages, subprime mortgages, second/junior lien  mortgages, closed-end junior liens, home equity lines of credit,  commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans,  construction loans, multifamily loans, nonfarm nonresidential loans, credit  card balances, other consumer, and other loans. Once the data were  aggregated into these categories, we divided the net charge-offs by the  applicable average loan balance. This calculation showed the loss rate for  each category (e.g., first-lien mortgages and commercial real estate) for  the year ended December 31, 2009. This methodology was applied to  calculate the loss rates for the 19 SCAP BHCs and all BHCs with more than  $1 billion of assets, respectively. Because those institutions had recently  converted to being BHCs, Y-9C data on loan balances was not available for  the fourth quarter of 2008 for American Express Company; The Goldman  Sachs Group, Inc.; and Morgan Stanley, and was not available for GMAC  LLC for both the first quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2008.  Therefore, we approximated the loan balances in these periods for GMAC  LLC and American Express Company based on their Form 10-Q for these  time periods. Because The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and Morgan Stanley  have considerably smaller loan balances, in general, than the other BHCs;  the fourth quarter of 2008 balance was not approximated for these BHCs.  Instead, the average loan balance was simply based on the available data  (e.g., first quarter of 2009 through fourth quarter of 2009).", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2009 to September 2010  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

BHCs  participating in SCAP must follow specific criteria to repay TARP funds.

Some of these  factors include whether the banks can demonstrate an ability to access  the long-term debt market without relying on the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation\u2019s (FDIC) Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program  and whether they can successfully access the public equity markets,  remain in a position to facilitate lending, and maintain capital levels in  accord with supervisory expectations.
