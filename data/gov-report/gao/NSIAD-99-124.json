The first two adjustments were based on  conservative assumptions and likely understated the savings between the  proposals.  Also, in some cases, supporting documentation was lacking or  inconsistent approaches to estimating costs were used.  Given these issues,  we did not attempt to determine a cumulative effect of these adjustments.", "Directions regarding the preparation of overhead savings were provided in  the Sacramento solicitation.  It stated that the evaluation of overhead  savings would emphasize a competitor's analysis and documentation of  proposed management initiatives to ensure that the projected savings  would occur\u2014particularly those predicted for more than 24 months after  award.  The solicitation evaluation criteria provided that the proposed first-year savings, if determined to be reasonable, would be allowed.  The  second-year savings, if supportable, would also be allowed but discounted  for risk.  The solicitation also stated that proposed savings for 3 years and  beyond might be allowed if clearly appropriate but would be considered  under the best-value analysis.", "Ogden used a regression-based methodology to develop its estimate of  projected overhead savings that should result from consolidating the  commodity and A-10 aircraft work with existing work at Ogden.  Ogden  based its analysis on 8 years of historical data to capture the relationship  between changing workloads and their effect on overhead rates.  In its  assessment, Ogden normalized the data to reflect cost accounting changes  that occurred over the 8-year period.", "After reviewing Ogden\u2019s projections, the Air Force evaluation team  concluded that the regression methodology was an adequate starting point  for projecting future overhead and general and administrative savings.   However, they expressed concern about Ogden\u2019s application of this  methodology and asked  DCAA to evaluate Ogden\u2019s overhead savings  analysis.  DCAA concurred with the use of the regression methodology but  questioned the workload baseline Ogden used in developing the savings  estimate.  DCAA found that in establishing the baseline, Ogden did not  include all the workload that is expected to be transferred into the depot  separate from the competition process.  The evaluation team reduced  Ogden\u2019s proposed overhead savings for the commodity and A-10 workload  by a significant amount over the 8-year performance period.  The team said  they based this reduction on a more realistic projection of Ogden\u2019s baseline  due to the transition of workloads transferring separate from the  competition.  We were unable to reconstruct how this figure was derived  because the Air Force did not provide supporting documentation.", "After making this adjustment, the evaluation team determined the number  of years that overhead savings would be allowed.  Team members said they  had a general lack of confidence in the regression analysis, the overhead  rates, and the application of savings beyond the initial years of the  performance period.  They said that all overhead fixed costs associated  with excess capacity would be eliminated in the long run.  Consequently,  the team said that production overhead savings would occur only on a  prorated basis for the first 3 years.  Likewise, the team estimated general  and administrative savings for 8 years\u2014with the annual amount prorated  progressively beginning with the second year.  Taken together these  estimates represent the evaluation team's $46.2 million estimate for  overhead savings.", "The Air Force\u2019s estimate of overhead savings is conservative and is likely  understated.  We question the Air Force\u2019s assumption that overhead fixed  costs associated with excess capacity would be eliminated beginning in the  first and second year through reductions in force or attrition.  For example,  a significant percentage of Ogden\u2019s proposed production overhead cost  savings were related to nonpersonnel costs such as facilities and capital  equipment, which by their nature are long-term assets and would not likely  be eliminated in the evaluators\u2019 estimated time frame.  Additionally, the  projected organizational structure in the directorates and divisions  projected to gain competition work showed that some positions have only  one person assigned and that the costs associated with these positions  would likely remain fixed for the life of the requirement.  Therefore, it  appears reasonable to assume that some level of overhead savings relative  to these positions would be achieved during the entire performance period.", "We noted an inconsistency in how the evaluation team treated Ogden's  regression analysis.  On the one hand, the evaluation team accepted the  proposed overhead costs for the competition workload that had been  developed using Ogden\u2019s regression analysis.  DCAA officials expressed  confidence in this procedure and stated that it provided a reasonable  estimate of savings and is applied fairly regularly to commercial firms.  On  the other hand, when assessing the overhead savings associated with  existing workload at the Ogden facility, the evaluation team expressed a  lack of confidence in the same regression analysis and, based on these  concerns, prorated projected overhead savings associated with this  workload.

Consequently, it made an adjustment to  increase Ogden\u2019s proposed overhead costs for the competed commodity  workloads.  However, the team did not make a corresponding adjustment  to reduce the overhead costs for the noncompetition work to fairly  represent the total government cost.  Consequently, this resulted in a  corresponding overstatement of the noncompetition overhead costs and a  corresponding understatement of overhead savings for the noncompetition  workloads.

In April 1996, we  testified that, if not effectively managed, privatizing depot maintenance  activities, including the downsizing of remaining DOD depot infrastructure,  could exacerbate existing excess capacity problems and the inefficiencies  inherent in underused depot maintenance capacity.  Privatizing workloads  in place at two closing Air Force depots would not reduce the excess  capacity in the remaining depots or the private sector and consequently  would not be a cost-effective approach to reducing depot infrastructure.    Later that year, we reported that privatizing in place, rather than closing  and transferring the depot maintenance workloads at the Sacramento and  San Antonio centers, would leave the Air Force with costly excess capacity  at its remaining depots that a workload consolidation would mitigate.

The  strategy involved several large consolidated work packages, essentially one  at Sacramento and two at San Antonio (one for the C-5 aircraft and one for  engines).  In December 1996, the Air Force issued procedures to conduct  public-private competitions for the workloads and to allow one of the  remaining public depots to compete with the private sector for each of the  three workload packages.  The Air Force's procedures allowed evaluation  credit for public and private sector proposals that offered overhead savings  to other government workloads.", "In February 1997, the Air Force issued a request for proposals for the C-5  aircraft depot maintenance workload.  In September 1997, the Air Force  awarded the C-5 workload to the Warner Robins Air Logistics Center based  on the Air Force conclusion that it had the lowest total evaluated cost.  As  required by the 1998 Defense Authorization Act, we reviewed the C-5  award, issuing our report on January 20, 1998.  We concluded that (1) the C-5 competition procedures provided an equal opportunity for public and  private offerors to compete without regard to where the work could be  performed; (2) the procedures did not appear to deviate in any material  respect from the applicable laws or the FAR; and (3) based on Air Force  assumptions and conditions at the time of award, the award resulted in the  lowest total cost to the government.", "On December 19, 1997, DOD submitted to Congress a determination and  report to support bundling the engine workloads at the San Antonio depot  and a determination and report to support bundling the commodity and  aircraft workloads at the Sacramento depot.  DOD was required to submit  these documents before issuing single solicitations at each location for the  combined work.  In response to 1998 Authorization Act requirements and  subsequent requests from the Senate Committee on Armed Services and  the House Committee on National Security, we issued two reports and two  testimonies providing our assessment of DOD\u2019s determinations that it was  more logical and economical to combine the workloads being competed at  the closing depots.

Section 2469a sets forth a number of requirements  that the Air Force must satisfy in the solicitations it issues and the source  selection process it uses, to make awards for the specified workloads.   Particularly, the solicitation and the source selection process must (1)  permit both public and private offerors to submit offers; (2) take into  account the fair market value of any land, plant, or equipment at a closed or  realigned military installation that is proposed to be used by a private  offeror in the performance of the workload; (3) take into account the total  estimated direct and indirect costs that will be incurred by DOD and the  total estimated direct and indirect savings (including overhead) that will be  derived by DOD; (4) use cost standards to determine the depreciation of  facilities and equipment that provide, to the maximum extent practicable,  identical treatment to public and private offerors; (5) permit any offeror,  whether public or private, to team with any other public or private entity to  perform the workload at any location or locations of their choosing; and (6) ensure that no offeror may be given any preferential consideration for,  or in any way be limited to, performing the workload in place or at any  other single location.", "In addition to 10 U.S.C. 2469a, there are a number of other laws that are  generally applicable to the outsourcing of government-performed depot  workloads.

Under this factor, the SSA noted that both  offerors had been assigned a green, or acceptable, rating, with low risk by  the SSAC.  The SSA stated that Lockheed\u2019s approach, which was to perform  all of the work at the Sacramento ALC facilities, had less potential for  disruption to the ongoing operations than the Ogden ALC plan, which  involved the transition of the KC-135 aircraft work to the Boeing facility at  the San Antonio ALC.  The A-10 aircraft and the commodities work was to  be done at the Ogden ALC facilities in Utah.  While recognizing that the  Ogden ALC approach was sound and would minimize disruption to  workload production, the SSA nevertheless concluded that the Lockheed  plan, which would maintain the existing, experienced government  workforce in place at Sacramento \u201cwas a benefit.\u201d  Since the SSA  concluded that neither offeror had significant strengths or weaknesses  under this factor, she did not propose to make a \u201cdollarization\u201d adjustment.", "Under the personnel plan factor, an offeror was to provide a plan that  detailed the staffing necessary to perform the workloads and a plan to  acquire, train, and maintain the staff.  The SSA concurred with the SSAC's  green rating for both proposals and the assignment of a low risk rating to  the Lockheed proposal and a moderate risk rating to the Ogden ALC  proposal.  The SSA noted that Lockheed would use the trained and  experienced workforce at the Sacramento ALC.  The SSA believed that  there was risk that some of the current workforce would not wish to leave  government service but concluded that a significant portion would want to  continue working at the Sacramento location.  On the other hand, the SSA  had concerns about the Ogden ALC\u2019s ability to hire 328 people from the  Sacramento workforce to work on the commodities at Ogden.  In this  regard, the SSA noted that Boeing intended to hire its workforce for the  KC-135 aircraft from San Antonio, Texas, and Wichita, Kansas, where it  currently maintains a facility.  The SSA found \u201creal differences\u201d between  the proposals under this factor, concluding that the weakness in the Ogden  ALC proposal regarding the availability of the experienced workforce  resulted in a moderate risk rating.  Consequently, the SSA concluded that  the risk should be offset by an upward \u201cdollarization\u201d cost adjustment in  the determination of Ogden ALC\u2019s most probable total evaluated cost.", "Under the integrated master schedule factor, an offeror was to submit a  comprehensive transition time line based on the integrated master plan  that identified all tasks and major event milestones required to transition  all of the workloads.  Both offerors were given green, or acceptable, ratings  with a low risk by the SSAC.  The SSA had a concern with the Ogden ALC  approach, which would transfer the workload to two locations: Ogden,  Utah, for the commodities and the A-10 aircraft and San Antonio, Texas, for  the KC-135 aircraft, which would involve completely a new workforce for  the KC-135.  This concern did not raise to the level of a weakness because  the SSA had confidence in Ogden ALC's risk mitigation strategy of using  intense integrated product team oversight.

Other information  to be provided includes (1) a work activity flow plan for one complete  aircraft to show the sequence of movement through the required processes  and (2) \u201cwaterfall\u201d plans, which are to describe the work flow activity using  the number of aircraft represented by the best estimated quantity and, in  the alternative, the maximum order quantity.  In addition, any process  improvements to current practices of performing the work are to be  explained under this factor.", "For the KC-135 aircraft, the SSAC rated both proposals as blue  (exceptional) and assigned Ogden ALC a low risk rating and Lockheed a  low/moderate rating.  In adopting the ratings, the SSA noted that both  proposals contained strengths concerning the reduction of the flowdays  needed for the programmed aircraft depot maintenance.  She nevertheless  concluded that the Ogden ALC proposal was the strongest under this  factor.  According to the SSA, this advantage was grounded in Ogden  ALC\u2019s proposal to exceed the RFP flowday requirement of 175 days by  contractually committing to a reduction to 150 days by fiscal year 2002 and  to 140 days by fiscal year 2003.  In addition, the SSA was impressed by  Ogden ALC\u2019s proposal to use in-line jacking to accomplish \u201cover and above\u201d  structural work concurrently with the planned programmed work and its  plan to use a continuous fluid sampling analysis to ensure early recognition  of defects.  The SSA, however, did note a weakness in Ogden ALC\u2019s  approach concerning its plan to use fewer labor hours than considered  readily achievable by the evaluation team.  The SSA concluded that this  risk could be mitigated by normal monitoring and was not significant  enough for a moderate risk rating.", "The SSA recognized that Lockheed also had proposed to reduce the  required flowdays (to 165 in fiscal year 2002 and to 155 by fiscal year 2004),  but Lockheed\u2019s approach, which involved using two shifts, had some risk  because Lockheed had not documented the availability of the workforce  for the extra shift or the way the proposed productivity increases would be  achieved.  Another element contributing to Lockheed\u2019s low/moderate risk  rating was the SSA\u2019s concern about the plan to use field team employees to  meet the proposed productivity increases and flowday reductions.  The  SSA decided that Ogden ALC\u2019s superior flowday reduction could not be  \u201cdollarized\u201d because the KC-135 was not an aircraft that generated revenue  for the Air Force.  However, the SSA recognized that this was a significant  benefit and concluded that Ogden ALC offered an approach to the KC-135  aircraft work that had greater strengths and was more advantageous than  Lockheed\u2019s approach.", "Under the hydraulics factor, the SSA concurred with the SSAC\u2019s rating of  each proposal as green and low risk.  The SSA concluded both proposals  were essentially equal and proposed no \u201cdollarization.\u201d", "Under the factor for instruments/electronics, the SSA agreed with the  SSAC\u2019s ratings of both proposals as green and low risk.  Again, the SSA  concluded that both offerors were essentially equal and proposed no  \u201cdollarization.\u201d", "Under the electrical accessories factor, the SSAC rated both proposals as  green; Lockheed was given a low risk rating, while Odgen ALC was rated as  a moderate risk.  This rating was caused by a process improvement  concerning the pretesting of oil-cooled generators and a change in the  painting sequence of the repair process.  According to the SSA, the new test  process could create production bottlenecks due to test equipment  constraints with the potential of increased flowdays and the new paint  process could increase flowtime.  Thus, the SSA concluded that to offset  this moderate risk, an upward \u201cdollarization\u201d adjustment to the evaluated  cost of the Ogden ALC proposal would be added.  This adjustment would  reduce, in the SSA's view, the risk rating to low.", "Under the A-10 aircraft factor, the SSA concurred with the SSAC's ratings  of both proposals as blue and low risk.

Ogden  ALC\u2019s customer cost was calculated to be $1,097,615,652.  Lockheed\u2019s  customer cost was $1,256,721,586.", "Using the customer cost for each offeror as a base, the evaluators made the  comparability adjustments called for in the CCH and the RFP.  Two sets of  adjustments were made.  The first set, required by form number 1 of the  CCH, encompassed adjustments to the public sector offer and the second  set, required by form number 2 of the CCH, governed adjustments  applicable to the public and private sector proposals.", "The CCH form number 1 adjustments made to the Ogden ALC proposal  included upward and downward changes in a number of categories.  The  most significant were upward adjustments for base operating support,  unfunded civilian retirement, and retiree health benefits.  The upward and  downward adjustments resulted in an adjusted cost of $1,153,415,260 to the  proposal.  The adjusted cost was lower than Lockheed's customer cost of  $1,256,721,586.", "Some CCH form number 2 adjustments were made to both proposals.   Upward adjustments were made to both types for GFM for both the  commodities and the KC-135 aircraft, contract administration, reduction-in- force (RIF) costs; costs associated with the transition of government  personnel (i.e., costs of retaining current work force at McClellan that will  be subject to a RIF and not be rehired by the new source after the workload  is transitioned pending their separation); and costs of performing the work  in process during the transition that each offeror elected not to perform.   Most of these adjustments were similar in size for both proposals.  The  largest difference was in the RIF cost adjustment, resulting in increases to  Ogden ALC\u2019s and Lockheed\u2019s costs.  Examples of downward adjustments  were those made for the payment of federal income tax on profits to the  Lockheed and Ogden ALC proposals.", "Form number 2 also provided for a downward adjustment for a public or  private offeror that proposed and supported overhead savings to other  government work resulting from the increased work from the competition  sharing the costs of fixed assets.  While no such savings were proposed  by Lockheed, the evaluators determined that a downward adjustment of  between $70,357,189 and $24,665,837 could be applied to the Ogden ALC  proposal to represent the savings applicable to other workloads at the  Ogden ALC facility during the performance period.", "The net result of the form number 2 comparability analysis for the  Lockheed proposal was an upward adjustment of $630,058,494.  The form  number 2 upward adjustments to the Ogden ALC proposal included the  high and low ranges for overhead savings.", "This final cost adjustment resulted in a total alternative cost for Lockheed  of $1,886,780,080 and a range of between $1,694,862,974 and $1,740,554,326  for Ogden ALC.

The first concern was Ogden ALC's  proposal to have the workforce at the closing Sacramento depot perform  most of the work in process on the KC-135 aircraft before the workload  was transitioned to the Boeing facility at San Antonio.  While the  adjustment for this work in form number 2 assumed normal workforce  efficiency (80 percent), the evaluators, based on the experience of previous  transitions from closing depots, concluded that it was likely that the  closing depot would experience declining efficiency.  Consequently, the  evaluators calculated the impact of a lower efficiency rate (45 percent) on  the work to be completed at Sacramento.  This rate resulted in a  quantification of the risk of performing the remaining KC-135 work at  Sacramento.  Next, the evaluators added another adjustment that  represented the risk that Boeing would not  achieve its proposed 90-percent efficiency rate as it began the KC-135 aircraft work at its new  facility.", "The evaluators were similarly concerned about the transition risks in the  Ogden ALC proposal for commodities workload.  The evaluators calculated  the Sacramento efficiency rate for the completion of commodities work in  process to be 65 percent.   Further, the evaluators reduced the efficiency  rate proposed for the new commodity work to be performed by the  combined workforces at Sacramento and Ogden.  The total  recommendation for \u201cdollarized\u201d transition risk for all the affected  workloads (KC-135 aircraft and commodities) under the Ogden ALC  proposal was $20,732,000.", "The evaluators were also concerned about transition risk in connection  with the Lockheed proposal.  Their concerns centered around the  efficiency of the Sacramento workforce in accomplishing the work in  process for both the KC-135 aircraft and commodity workloads.  In both  cases the evaluators assumed a Sacramento efficiency rate of 65 percent  (higher than the rates of Ogden ALC and its partner Boeing, as Lockheed  proposed to perform the work at the closing Sacramento facility using  much of the current workforce).  Further, for both workloads, the  evaluators did not think that Lockheed could achieve its proposed  efficiency rates at the start of full performance.  The calculations resulted  in a proposed total \u201cdollarization\u201d of $16,068,000 for the Lockheed  proposal.", "The evaluators concluded that the risks inherent in two aspects of Ogden  ALC\u2019s proposed performance of the commodities workload after transition  should be \u201cdollarized.\u201d  The first risk involved Ogden ALC\u2019s process  improvements and whether those improvements (particularly those in the  electrical accessories area) would result in a reduction of workhours.  The  evaluators were skeptical that the reduction  could be achieved, and they  consequently calculated a proposed upward \u201cdollarization\u201d adjustment of  $17,380,738 to represent the risk that the predicted reduction would not  occur.", "The second risk related to the nature of the public depots\u2019 funding under  the working capital fund and the possibility that the government will have  to shoulder the additional cost if Ogden ALC cannot perform at its  proposed labor rates.  The evaluators requested DCAA to conduct a rate- risk analysis on the Ogden ALC cost proposal, comparing the proposed  rates to Ogden ALC\u2019s current and past labor rates.  DCAA calculated what it  believed to be more realistic rates and concluded that its rates would result  in a $37,373,690 increase in Ogden ALC's cost.  The evaluators concluded  that a \u201cdollarized\u201d risk range representing the high and low historical rates  analyzed by DCAA should be established for this factor.", "As the result of these evaluations, the SSAC presented the SSA with a  recommended total evaluated cost range for each offeror.  The  recommendation consisted of a high range, including the lowest overhead  savings, if any, combined with the highest upward \u201cdollarization\u201d  adjustments, and a low range consisting of the highest overhead savings, if  any, and the lowest upward \u201cdollarization\u201d adjustments.  The high range  was $1,819,717,982, and the low range was $1,707,243,712 for Ogden ALC.   The high range for Lockheed was $1,902,848,080, while the low range was  $1,886,780,080.
