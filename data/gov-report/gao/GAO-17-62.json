Specifically, insurers do not assume the risk of the federal share of potential losses and, thus, do not consider the potential federal share of losses in how they manage their terrorism risk exposure and price coverage. Many insurers include a nominal charge for terrorism risk coverage, if they charge for it at all. Most insurers manage their exposure by limiting the amount of coverage they provide in certain geographic areas. Under the current structure, in some scenarios federal losses must be recouped through premium surcharges on policyholders with TRIA-eligible insurance coverage after a certified terrorism event. However, depending on the size of the terrorism event and the aggregate premiums of affected insurers, the federal government may not be required to recoup all of its losses. To date, no terrorism events have been certified under TRIA.", "Designing and implementing alternatives to TRIA's current funding structure, such as a federal terrorism risk insurance charge or set-aside of insurer funds, would require trade-offs among various policy goals and involve complexities. For example,", "Federal charge. A charge on insurers or policyholders could either (1) be a risk-based charge intended to help pay for the federal share of potential losses, replacing the current recoupment structure, or (2) be a charge, or fee, paid to the Treasury for the promise of payment of the federal share of loses with recoupment in place to cover the actual losses. A federal charge could help cover potential losses, but determining a price based on risk would be difficult.", "Terrorism set-asides. An insurer set-aside to explicitly address terrorism exposure through liabilities, capital, or assets could be designed as (1) loss reserves for future terrorism losses, (2) separate or additional capital requirements for terrorism risk, or (3) separate assets that only could be used for terrorism losses. A set-aside of insurer funds could help cover insurers' potential losses but some approaches would be complex to implement due to implications related to current accounting practices and state laws.", "TRIA's current recoupment structure and some alternative approaches could increase prices for policyholders and have various effects on market participants and the federal government. GAO's analysis indicated that the current structure and some alternative approaches could affect the price of coverage and policyholder decisions to purchase terrorism coverage. In addition, one set-aside approach could restrict the flexibility with which insurers can use assets (generally, for a variety of risks) and thus hamper risk management. Under each option, federal fiscal exposure exists. For example, a charge to cover the federal share of losses may be insufficient to cover losses in the near term. However, the design of an alternative approach can, in part, mitigate the magnitude of these effects. For example, lengthening recoupment time frames, charging a broad group of policyholders, or allowing flexibility in applying a set-aside could help mitigate the effects."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, which resulted in reported  total insured losses of roughly $44 billion (2015 dollars), drastically  changed the way insurers viewed the risk of terrorism.

First,  we reviewed two ways a federal terrorism risk insurance charge could be  structured: (1) as a premium-like charge to help pay for the federal share  of potential losses, or (2) as a backstop charge, or fee, paid to the  Treasury for the promise of payment of the federal share of losses, or  backstop. In addition, we developed a pricing framework based on prior  GAO work on government fees and interviewed industry participants. We  also assessed how the objectives of the pricing framework are expressed  in premiums or premium-like charges in selected federal and state  programs and in charges for government-provided backstops provided in  the national terrorism risk insurance programs of two selected countries.  Programs were selected to illustrate a range of approaches for structuring  and collecting charges. Second, we selected programs or proposals to  identify key design factors and implementation considerations for  policymakers if they implemented a requirement or incentives for insurer  terrorism set-asides. Programs or proposals were selected to illustrate  variation among the design factors. To describe the practices, laws, and  rules the federal government could take into account in relation to a set- aside, we reviewed documentation on the selected approaches and  sources describing relevant accounting standards, and tax laws.

Specifically, we  assessed the potential effects of recoupment of the federal share of  losses, a federal terrorism risk insurance charge, and terrorism set-asides  on insurers and reinsurers, state regulation, policyholders, and the federal  government. Using data and a number of informed assumptions, we  illustrated the potential effects on policyholder prices and participation  and insurer volume of premium under recoupment and the alternative  funding approaches. The scenarios and potential effects are illustrative;  they are not specific determinations of market effects or federal fiscal  exposure. We determined that the data used in this report were  sufficiently reliable for providing illustrative examples of potential effects.  We also examined whether, and to what extent, the program provides an  economic subsidy and illustrated the potential size of any subsidy. In this  report, we define an economic subsidy as a payment or benefit from the  government to private market participants, for which the government  receives no commensurate benefit.

To  underwrite insurance\u2014that is, decide whether to offer coverage and at  what price\u2014insurers consider both the likelihood of an event (frequency)  and the amount of damage it would cause (severity). Although insurers  increasingly have used sophisticated modeling tools to assess terrorism  risk, from a statistical perspective little data exist on which to base  estimates of future losses in terms of frequency or severity, or both.  Reinsurers (insurers for insurers) follow an approach similar to that of  insurers for pricing risk exposures and charging premiums based on that  risk and, therefore, face similar challenges in pricing terrorism risks.", "Congress passed TRIA in 2002 to address some of the challenges the  insurance industry and businesses faced after the September 11 attacks,  when coverage for terrorism risk generally became unavailable. The  goals of TRIA are to (1) protect consumers by addressing market  disruptions and ensuring the continued widespread availability and  affordability of commercial property/casualty insurance for terrorism risk;  and (2) allow for a transitional period for the private markets to stabilize,  resume pricing of such insurance, and build capacity to absorb any future  losses, while preserving state insurance regulation and consumer  protections.", "As required by TRIA, insurers must make terrorism coverage available to  commercial policyholders, although commercial policyholders are not  required to buy it. TRIA requires an insurer to make coverage for  terrorism losses available that does not differ materially from the terms,  amounts, and other coverage limitations applicable to losses arising from  events other than acts of terrorism. For example, an insurer offering $100  million in commercial property coverage must offer $100 million in  coverage for property damage from a certified terrorist event. As  discussed in greater detail later in this report, insurers can charge a  separate premium to cover their terrorism risk, although some include the  coverage in their base rates for all-risk policies. Neither insurers nor the  federal government charges for the government\u2019s coverage of terrorism  risk under TRIA, but the government may recoup at least some of its  losses following a terrorism event.", "For eligible lines, TRIA covers insured losses resulting from an act of  terrorism, which is defined, in part, as a \u201cviolent act or an act that is  dangerous\u201d to human life, property, or infrastructure.

In the event of a certified act of terrorism, TRIA\u2019s  loss-sharing structure requires that insurers pay claims on covered  terrorism losses and that Treasury reimburse individual insurers for  losses that exceed a specified amount. For federal compensation to be  paid, aggregate industry insured losses from certified acts must exceed a  certain amount (program trigger). For calendar year 2016, this amount  was $120 million. An individual insurer with terrorism losses in excess of  a deductible (20 percent of its previous year\u2019s direct earned premiums in  TRIA-eligible lines) may make a claim to Treasury for payment of the  federal share of compensation for its insured losses. As shown in figure 1,  Treasury would reimburse the insurer for a certain percentage of its  losses (84 percent for calendar year 2016) above the deductible, and the  insurer would be responsible for the remaining portion (16 percent).  Annual coverage for losses is limited (capped) so that aggregate industry  insured losses in excess of $100 billion are not covered by private  insurers or the federal government.", "Recoupment. The federal share of losses may be recouped after a  terrorist event through premium surcharges. As previously discussed,  Treasury reimburses an insurer for a certain percentage of its losses  above its deductible. And, if insurers\u2019 aggregate losses are below a  specified amount, Treasury may be required to recoup federal losses  through post-event premium surcharges. Figure 2 shows the TRIA  funding mechanism before and after a terrorism event. Specifically, the  program includes a provision for mandatory recoupment of at least a  portion of the federal share of losses if the aggregate sum of all insurers\u2019  deductibles and co-shares are below an amount prescribed by TRIA\u2014 known as the industry aggregate retention amount. Under mandatory  recoupment, the insurers must impose and remit to Treasury a premium  surcharge on all policies in TRIA-eligible lines until total industry  payments reach 140 percent of any mandatory recoupment amount.  Treasury establishes the amount of the mandatory recoupment  surcharge. The collection timeframes for mandatory recoupment range  from 1 year and 9 months to about 6.5 years, depending on when the  terrorism event occurs.", "When federal assistance exceeds the mandatory recoupment amount,  TRIA allows for discretionary recoupment. Under the discretionary  recoupment provision, Treasury may recoup additional amounts based on  the ultimate cost to taxpayers of no additional recoupment, economic  conditions in the marketplace, the affordability of commercial insurance  for small and medium-sized businesses, and other factors Treasury  considers appropriate. Treasury also sets the surcharge for  discretionary recoupment, but the increase to TRIA-eligible premiums  must not exceed 3 percent per calendar year.", "Changes in TRIA reauthorizations. As shown in table 1, the TRIA  reauthorizations have changed several loss-sharing provisions of the  program. Over time, the reauthorizations have reduced federal  responsibility for losses and increased private-sector responsibility for  losses. The 2015 reauthorization requires further incremental decreases  in the federal share of losses over 5 years.

Many state laws have filing or review exemptions (or both) that  apply to large commercial policyholders.

Enterprise  risk management generally has two goals: (1) to identify, evaluate,  and quantify risks; and (2) to ensure that the organization actively  implements risk-treatment strategies and manages appropriate risk  levels. Examples of specific enterprise risk-management practices  include identifying and categorizing risks, establishing well-defined  risk tolerances, assessing risk mitigation with cost-benefit analyses,  and conducting stress tests and other risk-modeling analyses.

The ultimate objective of solvency  regulation is to ensure that policyholder, contract holder, and other  legal obligations are met when they come due and that companies  maintain capital and surplus at all times and in such forms as required  by statute to provide a margin of safety. SAP stress the measurement  of ability to pay claims in the future.

We also found that some  insurers used models available from risk modeling firms to estimate the  severity of potential attack scenarios to determine internal limits on the  aggregate coverage they would offer in defined areas (aggregation limits).

However, in some  circumstances insurers may segregate or restrict their assets for specific  purposes such as for collateral.

Insurers generally  account for actual or expected claims by establishing loss reserves as  liabilities on their balance sheet. As with all future losses, insurers cannot  create loss reserves for potential terrorism losses before an event occurs.

However, as previously discussed, terrorism risk insurance is  challenging to price because the frequency and severity of terrorism  events are difficult to predict and quantify.

For workers\u2019 compensation lines, insurers in 38 states use rates  developed by the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI).  According to NCCI, to help set workers\u2019 compensation premium rates that  include terrorism risk, NCCI uses information from modeling firms.

Based on our prior work on designing and  assessing federal user fees, other government-collected funds, and user- based taxes, we identified pricing objectives and characteristics that could  have some applications for policymakers in considering various  approaches for a federal charge for terrorism risk insurance, as shown in  table 3. Using four pricing objectives (promoting economic efficiency,  equity, revenue adequacy, and limiting administrative burden), we  evaluated two approaches for a voluntary or required federal charge for  terrorism risk insurance:  Premium-like charge: A charge that would be intended to help pay for  the federal share of potential losses and could replace the current  recoupment provision. Such a charge could be an amount based on risk  using insurance principles or it could be designed as a flat rate or vary  based on insurer or insured characteristics.", "Backstop charge: A charge or fee paid to the Treasury for the promise  of payment of the federal share of losses, or backstop. Such a charge  could be determined in a variety of ways, but it would not necessarily be  based on insurance principles. In addition, recoupment could still be in  place to cover the federal share of losses as the charge would not be  intended to be adequate to cover potential losses.", "Policymakers may face tradeoffs among the pricing objectives as no  single design will satisfy all parties on all dimensions, and the level of  importance different policymakers may place on different objectives will  vary, depending on how they value the characteristics of each.", "Economic efficiency. A premium-like charge could address risk and  insurable value\u2014characteristics of promoting economic efficiency\u2014but  would be difficult to price. Specifically, a premium-like charge could be  based on existing premiums that policyholders paid insurers. However,  this approach has some limitations because the existing, underlying  premiums are not accurately priced according to risk. As we previously  discussed, insurers lack data to accurately price terrorism risk insurance  and may charge a nominal percentage of the underlying commercial  property/casualty premium. Four industry associations, three insurers, an  insurance broker, and a state regulator said a reliable method or model to  estimate manmade catastrophes like terrorism events is currently not  available and representatives questioned how the federal government  could set risk-based prices to promote economic efficiency in the absence  of a viable method to estimate terrorism risk.", "Taking into account risk mitigation activities\u2014another characteristic of  economic efficiency\u2014would be challenging to incorporate into a premium- like charge. Three insurers stated that, due to the unpredictable nature of  potential terrorism events, risk-mitigation measures could be more costly  than beneficial because terrorists might change tactics in response to  mitigation efforts. One of the insurers further noted that mitigation efforts  would be less effective at an individual insurer or policyholder level than  at a national level, and a state regulator said the federal government is  the primary body for taking mitigation actions such as through national  security. While mitigation efforts may be difficult to incorporate into the  premium pricing process for terrorism risk, an insurer said it takes certain  mitigation efforts into consideration when making decisions to accept a  client. For example, the insurer said that 24-hour guard service, perimeter  fencing, and intrusion detection devices are some mitigation efforts  considered in the decision.", "In contrast, a backstop charge does not need to be closely tied to an  estimate of each participant\u2019s terrorism risk exposure or risk-mitigation  activities. For example, a backstop charge would only need to cover the  cost of its administration rather than potential losses and, therefore, does  not need to be risk-based.", "Equity. With either a premium-like charge or backstop charge,  policymakers may need to consider trade-offs between fairness and  affordability. Industry stakeholders noted challenges in structuring a  federal charge for terrorism risk to promote the characteristics of equity  (fairness), which involve the extent to which the pricing structure (1)  provides similar treatment to participants with similar levels of risk, and (2)  considers affordability. One insurer stated that to achieve equity, all  participants with similar levels of terrorism risk should be charged similar  rates. Two other insurers and a state regulator cautioned that prices  needed to be affordable to maintain participation rates and support a  thriving market that offers coverage for terrorism risk. One insurer pointed  out that affordability is important to consider because it was a factor in the  withdrawal of insurers and reinsurers from offering terrorism coverage  after the September 11 terrorist attacks. One state insurance regulator  said an affordability goal could be problematic to the extent it competes  with the goal of each participant paying their fair share, and another state  regulator said that an equitable charge would be more achievable if  collected after a terrorism event\u2014as currently structured under TRIA\u2019s  recoupment provision\u2014when more information would be known about the  amount of losses.", "Revenue adequacy. If policymakers wanted to focus on raising adequate  revenue to cover expected losses over time, a premium-like charge might  be a better option than a backstop charge. However, some industry  stakeholders we interviewed stated that a charge that could generate  enough revenue to cover the federal share of losses would be cost- prohibitive. An annual charge would need to be very high to accumulate  enough funds over time to cover very large losses which, an insurer  surmised, could drive down take-up rates and require other sources of  funds, such as surcharges or taxes. Also as discussed, industry  associations, insurers and others we interviewed said that determining a  price that would provide adequate revenues to pay for the federal share  of potential losses would be difficult because estimating terrorism  frequency and loss is not possible with any statistical accuracy. In  contrast, a backstop charge approach would not be intended to cover  expected losses.", "Administrative burden. If policymakers focused on reducing  administrative burden, a backstop charge might result in lower  administrative costs than a premium-like charge. Industry stakeholders  generally held similar views that a premium-like charge would bring about  higher levels of administrative burden than the current program\u2014that is,  the responsibilities of program staff or third parties to collect and process  the charge and oversee the effort. Officials from the Congressional  Budget Office and the Congressional Research Service cautioned that  collecting and managing federal charges from the more than 1,000  commercial property/casualty insurers would entail a large resource  commitment from the federal government. According to our interviews, if  such a charge was implemented, increases in staff and expertise would  be required to collect, manage, and oversee the charges. Officials from  Treasury estimated that a program that collected an upfront charge would  necessitate an additional 15-20 more full-time staff to collect the charges  and audit primary insurers\u2014up from the three staff that would be needed  to administer third-party service contracts following a certified terrorism  event. The officials said more staff could be needed to operate on an  independent board and to manage the collection and investment of the  funds. According to one insurer, pricing a federal charge as a flat rate on  premiums across all TRIA-eligible insurance lines and including it on  policyholders\u2019 statements similar to premium taxes would be transparent  and easily audited and thus may require less administrative burden than a  variable rate. Two insurers emphasized that the current method\u2014 recouping the federal share of losses after a terrorism event\u2014is the least  burdensome, with relatively low administrative costs to Treasury.", "In contrast, under the backstop charge approach, administrative burden  may be less than a premium-like charge because staff and operations  would not be needed to estimate losses and set a corresponding pricing  structure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Depending on Approach, Implementing Terrorism Set-Asides Could Be Complex", "paragraphs": ["Another alternative funding method for TRIA\u2014designing and  implementing an insurer set-aside\u2014could be complex because of existing  state laws and insurance accounting standards, among other reasons.

Insurer set-asides could be structured in at least three  ways: (1) loss reserves for events that have not yet occurred, (2) separate  capital requirements for terrorism risk exposures, or (3) segregated  assets that only can be used for a specific purpose such as potential  terrorism losses.

In 2013,  insurers began testing a weighted measure in their minimum risk- based capital determinations, taking into account earthquake and  hurricane risks to determine a target amount of capital to maintain that  would preserve their solvency following a natural catastrophe.  Insurers\u2019 capital is not limited to covering losses from hurricanes and  earthquakes.", "A third way of structuring an insurer set-aside involves segregation of  assets for a specific purpose and is illustrated by proposals by House  members to build segregated insurer set-asides for terrorism losses to  help stabilize the marketplace following a terrorism event. Under these  proposals, insurers could set aside a portion of terrorism risk premiums  collected from policyholders as specifically segregated assets to be used  only for potential terrorism losses.

Specifically, a loss  reserve similar to NAIC\u2019s catastrophe reserve proposal could involve a  significant departure from existing insurance statutory accounting  standards. Implementing set-asides also could involve revisions of state  insurer solvency laws, and federal tax law changes (for example, to  provide a tax deduction).

Specifically, an approach similar to the NAIC catastrophe reserve  proposal\u2014in which insurers would create loss reserves for events that  have not yet occurred\u2014would be contrary to the current general basis for  recording insurance losses under SAP. As previously discussed, SAP  states that insurers only may create loss reserves for an event that has  occurred and for which the cost of the event is estimable. Implementing  an approach for potential terrorism losses similar to the NAIC catastrophe  reserve proposal would involve NAIC modifications of SAP to allow  insurers to maintain loss reserves for events that have not yet occurred.", "In addition, using some of the set-aside approaches may affect the total  amount of assets that an insurer holds to support its ability to pay current  and future claims.", "Under a structure in which insurers would establish loss reserves for  events that have not yet occurred (similar to the NAIC catastrophe  reserve proposal), an insurer\u2019s assets would remain available for all  types of insured risks. However, initially establishing such new loss  reserves would reduce capital. If, as a result, the insurer\u2019s capital  would fall below the minimum capital requirements, the insurer would  need to raise additional funds to continue to meet capital  requirements. However, most U.S. insurers hold several times more  capital than states require. If the insurer\u2019s capital still exceeded  minimum capital requirements even after establishing such new loss  reserves, creating a loss reserve for events that have not yet occurred  might have no immediate impact on the amount of assets an insurer  holds.", "Under a structure that would establish separate capital requirements  for terrorism risk exposures similar to NAIC\u2019s catastrophe risk weight,  an insurer\u2019s assets also would remain available for all types of insured  risk.

In addition, holding  assets that are specifically segregated for terrorism losses may  require insurers to raise additional capital. However, if an insurer  holds several multiples of the minimum required capital, the  segregation of assets might have no immediate impact on the amount  of assets the insurer already holds.", "State laws. The complexity of implementing set-asides also could include  revising state laws to recognize or account for how to treat the assets in  the event states needed to oversee and resolve insolvent insurers. For  instance, accommodating a set-aside with segregated assets might  require amending NAIC\u2019s model laws and later adoption and enactment  by the states. Furthermore, two state regulators pointed out that  implementing a set-aside with segregated assets for potential terrorism  losses could affect state oversight related to laws and practices for  insurers that become insolvent. For example, the two state regulators  pointed out that policymakers should consider if funds in the TRIA set- aside would become part of state receivership procedures to pay non- TRIA claims of insolvent insurers.", "Federal tax laws. Some set-aside approaches also may have  implications for federal tax laws. For example, current federal tax rules do  not allow insurers to deduct potential losses. However, providing  preferential tax treatment for potential terrorism losses\u2014in conjunction  with changes to SAP that would allow such reserves\u2014could provide  incentives for insurers to establish related loss reserves. Such revisions  would need to incorporate limitations to prevent overestimation of  potential loss reserves, as an overstatement of loss, if allowed, would  improperly decrease the amount of taxable income.", "In addition, policymakers also would need to clarify the tax implications  related to a set-aside with segregated assets. For example, policymakers  would need to clarify whether amounts added to segregated assets would  receive favorable tax treatment (such as tax credits or reductions to  taxable income).

After the recoupment  collection period, policyholders could see price decreases.", "Using multiple assumptions, we estimated the effects of a premium- like charge directly imposed only on policyholders with terrorism risk  coverage. Specifically, when using the percentage load method, we  estimated that terrorism risk insurance prices would increase by about  16 percent and participation on average could decrease by about 10  percent. When using the revenue target method, we estimated that  prices on average would need to increase by about 43 percent to  collect the target amount, which could result in an average  participation decrease of about 27 percent.", "Set-aside approaches that result in the need for insurers to raise  additional capital to cover other types of insured risks may result in price  increases and participation decreases. In particular, the approach in the  legislative proposals may result in price increases for two reasons: (1) a  portion of insurers\u2019 terrorism risk premiums would be shifted to a  segregated asset account that could only be used for potential terrorism  losses, and insurers might increase prices if, as a result, they needed to  raise additional capital to cover other insured losses; or (2) depending on  the size and timing of a terrorism event, some of the segregated assets  might be used to pay for some of or all the federal share of losses, so that  not all the premiums collected would necessarily be available to cover the  insurer\u2019s own share of losses.", "The potential size of any price increase may depend on such factors as  the cost of raising any additional capital,  the perceived likelihood of events resulting in payments towards the  federal share of losses,  the perceived likelihood and timing of any recoupment payments, and  the perceived likelihood that the federal government would reimburse  insurers whose assets contributed to covering the federal share of  losses.", "Other set-aside approaches that do not require segregation of assets may  have a minimal impact, if any, on pricing. An insurer only would pay for its  own losses, and its assets would remain available for all types of insured  risks. If the insurer already had enough capital to meet required  standards, an additional reserve or capital requirement might have no  impact on the amount of capital it needed to hold, as discussed earlier.", "Price increases from recoupment surcharges or alternative funding  options could vary by the extent to which insurers passed costs to  policyholders and by insurer size. Two stakeholders stated that insurers  likely would pass recoupment surcharges to policyholders, but other  stakeholders pointed out that some insurance companies could choose to  absorb the cost to maintain competitive prices. Stakeholders\u2019 opinions  varied on whether insurers would pass on the federal charge to  policyholders. Treasury officials said that insurers would want to pass the  cost of a charge to policyholders, but market forces would dictate the  extent to which they could. Another stakeholder said that most insurers  likely would absorb the cost of a charge by spreading it across all the  lines of business they wrote. This amount could be categorized as a  general expense and might not be a significant addition to a premium  rate. Additionally, the stakeholder said that the rate increase attributed to  this expense likely would be too small to attract state regulators\u2019 scrutiny  and policyholders would not notice the additional cost. Small insurers  might be less able to absorb the cost and, consequently, more likely to  pass the cost to their policyholders, according to one stakeholder.", "Declines in policyholder participation from recoupment surcharges or  alternative funding options could vary by industry and other factors. For  example, any reduction in participation among commercial property  builders likely would be constrained due to lender requirements to  maintain terrorism risk coverage as a condition of financing development  projects. Furthermore, state requirements to maintain workers\u2019  compensation coverage (from which terrorism risk cannot be excluded)  generally could moderate the reductions in policyholder participation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mitigating Factors", "paragraphs": ["Our estimates indicated that longer time frames and broader application  could help mitigate the potential adverse effects on policyholders of a  recoupment surcharge, especially since the 2015 TRIA reauthorization  increases the potential amount of funds that the government could collect  through mandatory recoupment.

We estimated that the mandatory recoupment that  would follow an event of that size occurring in 2017 could lead to a larger  increase in TRIA-eligible commercial property/casualty premiums than an  event of equal size occurring in 2019. For example, when using the  percentage load method, we estimated prices would increase about 6  percent. When using the revenue target method, we estimated that prices  on average could increase about 17 percent.

This exposure  exists until the federal share of losses is recouped. However, if  Treasury opted not to fully exercise the program\u2019s recoupment  provisions, an implicit fiscal exposure would remain. By statute, the  federal government must recoup any mandatory portion of losses  following a terrorism event but can choose not to recoup any  discretionary portion of losses, which represents a fiscal exposure.", "Much of the estimated recoupment amounts resulting from larger,  catastrophic losses would be considered discretionary under TRIA\u2019s  provisions, and could exceed $60 billion. Because the program  mandates a 3 percent cap on the increase of premium rates in TRIA- eligible lines for the discretionary portion of recoupment, we estimate  that in an extreme case Treasury might need to collect a premium  surcharge for as long as 28 years to fully recoup the discretionary  portion of losses. The effects of a protracted period of premium  surcharges could be a factor in Treasury\u2019s determination of whether to  pursue discretionary recoupment in such a scenario. In addition, the  weakened economic environment that resulted after the September  11, 2001, terrorism events suggests that an event large enough to  trigger TRIA likely would result in a weakened economic environment.  As such, one insurer questioned whether the federal government  would follow through with mandatory or discretionary recoupment. As  we previously discussed, mandatory recoupment could lead to large  price increases, especially in shorter collection time frames, which  could affect the political will to carry out recoupment.", "Our analysis indicates that the program could provide an economic  subsidy to the extent that the federal government is not expected to  recoup all of its losses. As we explain in appendix VI, we assess the  presence of a subsidy on the basis of whether and to what extent the  federal government would be expected to recoup its losses,  regardless of whether a terrorism event or recoupment occurred.  Using various assumptions and taking into account several limitations,  we analyzed the potential size of any subsidy by estimating the  annual forgone federal terrorism risk insurance premiums. We  estimated the annual economic subsidy amount could be as high as  $1.6 billion, if the government were not expected to recoup any of its  losses. However, if the federal government were expected to recoup  all of its losses as described in TRIA, the economic subsidy amount  would be $0 (no subsidy). For more information on our subsidy  analysis, see appendix VI.", "Second, a premium-like charge also could affect federal fiscal  exposure but including a recoupment provision could mitigate such  effects. A premium-like charge could reduce federal fiscal exposure if  sufficient funds were collected to pay for losses. However, if terrorism  losses exceeded funds collected from the charge and no recoupment  provision was in place, the federal government would need to cover  the difference. For example, it could take many years to accumulate  sufficient funds to cover potential losses, and if the federal share of  losses from a terrorism event exceeded the collected funds, the  financial exposure to the federal government could be higher than  under the current program in the absence of recoupment. However,  the federal fiscal exposure could be mitigated if recoupment were to  remain a part of the program, providing a mechanism by which the  federal government could recover losses that exceeded the funds  collected from a premium-like charge.", "Third, implementing a premium-like charge could result in increased  prices for terrorism risk or TRIA-eligible insurance, which in turn could  lead to decreased participation in private insurance and, therefore,  fewer private funds available to fund recovery. However, a backstop  charge (with recoupment to cover the actual federal share of losses)  might result in lower price increases on policyholders and have less  effect on affordability and policyholder participation.", "Finally, we found that implementation of some terrorism set-aside  approaches likely would have minimal impacts on federal fiscal  exposure due to losses and others could increase federal fiscal  exposure by allowing deductions for taxes before a terrorism event  occurs. Set-aside approaches that do not involve segregated assets  might have minimal impact on federal fiscal exposure. However, to  the extent that a segregated assets approach could be designed to  cover the federal share of losses, it could reduce federal fiscal  exposure. Additionally, officials from NAIC, Treasury, and state  regulators expressed concerns that insurers could overstate any pre- event loss reserves or segregated assets for terrorism risk in an  attempt to reduce their tax exposure.

Under the  current program, Treasury generally has a passive role in the insurance  market but becomes active following a terrorism event. With a federal  charge, the government would potentially take on administrative  responsibilities (such as collecting and managing funds) before an event  occurred. In an April 2016 report on terrorism risk insurance programs in  other countries, we found that the costs for carrying out these  responsibilities were generally a small percentage of the programs\u2019  overall income. Similarly, the administrative costs to the federal  government of implementing a federal charge could be low and funded by  the charge collected. A set-aside approach also could involve some  administrative costs for data collection.

In  addition, in a segregated assets set-aside approach\u2014which would  require insurers to set aside funds that could be used for both their share  and the federal share of terrorism losses\u2014the federal government would  need to determine the appropriate amount of the segregated assets that  would be held for the federal share of losses.", "Pricing a premium-like charge could present significant challenges for the  federal government, partly because Treasury has limited data on  collected terrorism premiums, amounts of coverage, or location of  coverage. In addition, setting an appropriate amount to charge or an  appropriate target amount to collect could present significant challenges  to Treasury because of the difficulty of estimating the magnitude and  frequency of terrorism events. By using data and modeling, other nations\u2019  terrorism risk insurance programs have developed methods to address  limitations related to estimating the frequency and severity of terrorism  events. Specifically, some programs use data on premiums collected,  coverage amounts, and location in pricing the charge under their  programs. For example, some programs base their charges on the  amount of coverage or the terrorism risk premium that is charged by the  primary insurers. Such programs also use models with specific terrorism  event scenarios and frequencies. Alternatively, a backstop charge might  require less data and be less challenging to implement. For example, the  United Kingdom Treasury collects a backstop charge to reflect the  potential cost of capital, which may present fewer data challenges than  collecting a risk-based charge. Specifically, as we found in our April 2016  report on terrorism risk insurance programs in other countries, the  program in the United Kingdom annually pays a backstop charge to the  United Kingdom Treasury for access to an unlimited line of credit should it  be needed to cover policyholder claims. According to a United Kingdom  Treasury official, this charge is intended to reflect the potential cost of  capital to the government for backing this liability.", "Additionally, in pricing a premium-like charge, the government would face  decisions about which participants to charge and would need to consider  whether the charge was affordable. For example, our analyses indicated  that the government would need to charge a larger set of policyholders  than those purchasing terrorism risk coverage (similar to its current  recoupment methodology) to avoid potentially steep percentage  increases in prices. Furthermore, as one stakeholder stated, an  affordable federal charge only on policyholders that purchased terrorism  risk coverage would not go far in helping the federal government  accumulate funds for its share of losses (because of the potential size of  the federal share under TRIA).

We used the top 4, top 10, and top 20,  and all TRIA-eligible insurers as proxies to represent different sized  premium bases. The direct earned premium associated with the insurers  rather than the number of insurers is important because prior year direct  earned premium determines the aggregate insurer deductible.

We  determined that the data used in this report were sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of our reporting objectives. To project the annual change in  the size of the TRIA-eligible market from 2015 to 2018, we used  estimations of terrorism risk premiums from 2004 through 2013 from A.M.  Best. We found the data sufficiently reliable for this purpose. We  calculated the annual change to be an increase of 2 percent. To estimate  the percentage of TRIA-eligible premiums that was paid for terrorism risk  insurance, we used estimates of the percentage of commercial property  insurance premiums paid for terrorism risk insurance from Marsh and  Treasury. We found the data sufficiently reliable for this purpose. We  used peer-reviewed, published information on the price elasticity of  corporate demand for insurance that we determined to be reliable and  suitable for illustrating potential effects of recoupment and alternative  approaches.

While policyholders\u2019 demand for  terrorism risk insurance may increase following a terrorism event,  demand for TRIA-eligible insurance likely would be less affected. At the  same time, although TRIA requires insurers to make terrorism risk  insurance available, a terrorism event could lead to price increases by  participating insurers based upon their reassessment of the likelihood of  future events, and thus depress demand.

We assume that insurers fully pass  through to policyholders a percentage increase in premium rates (that  is, the load) based on the annual collection or target amount and  insurers\u2019 aggregate direct earned premium. For example, if the annual  collection amount resulted in a 3 percent recoupment surcharge on  premium rates, we assumed that insurers fully would pass through  that percentage increase to policyholders and raise premium rates (by  3 percent). This method would result in larger effects than the revenue  target method in the form of insurer loss of direct earned premium.", "Revenue target method. We assume that insurers have the incentive  and would attempt to increase prices to collect, at the margin, as  much additional direct earned premiums as possible up to the annual  collection or target amount. Such price increases would be above and  beyond a full pass through to make up for some or all of the loss of  net revenue resulting from decreased policyholder participation in  reaction to the price increase. For example, if Treasury annually  recouped $6 billion from insurers, we assumed insurers would raise  prices to collect, at the margin, an additional $6 billion in direct earned  premiums. This method would result in larger effects than the  percentage load method in the form of premium increases and  decreases in participation rates.", "Generally, our analyses using the revenue target resulted in a larger  impact for policyholders in terms of prices and participation, while the  percentage load analysis resulted in a larger impact for insurers in terms  of impact on direct earned premiums.", "Assumptions related to analyses of potential effects: Due to the  prospective nature of this analysis, we made a number of assumptions.", "When necessary, we assumed market reactions to the changes in  insurers\u2019 prices due to recoupment or alternative funding options,  such as the sensitivity of participation in TRIA-eligible insurance to  price changes (price elasticity) and the pricing behavior of insurers.", "For all options, we assumed prices would increase.", "For each step in our analysis, we assumed that only the variables of  interest changed, and all other variables remained constant during the  collection or build-up period.

We determined  that a subsidy exists in the program to the extent that the federal  government is not expected to recoup all its losses. To estimate the  potential annual size of the subsidy, we estimated forgone federal  premiums for the federal share of losses. Because we could not  determine premiums using an actuarial method, we used reinsurance  rates paid by other national terrorism risk insurance programs. We were  told by the broker of many reinsurance deals in other national terrorism  risk insurance programs that the rates were fairly stable across countries  and generally ranged from 2 percent to 3 percent of the amount of  coverage. We use a rate-on-line (the ratio of premium paid to loss  recoverable in a reinsurance contract) of 2.5 percent of reinsurance  coverage purchased, assumed the federal government purchased  coverage for its maximum annual losses under TRIA, and added 5  percent as a collection fee. We performed calculations in scenarios in  which the government is expected to (1) recoup neither mandatory nor  discretionary recoupment amounts, and (2) only recoup mandatory  amounts. Specifically, to determine the maximum annual losses under  TRIA, we used SNL Financial\u2019s insurance market data as described  above and modeled the maximum terrorism event size ($100 billion in  insured losses) in 2016 and assumed insurers with an aggregate  premium base equal to the top 20 insurers were affected by the event.

We  estimated the insurer deductible for each insurer group by multiplying  their direct earned premium by 20 percent. If the insurers\u2019 deductible was  greater than or equal to the loss total, there was no insurer co-share and  no federal share.

Additionally, the  share of losses the government sustains depends on the aggregate  TRIA-eligible direct earned premium of the insurers with losses.  Specifically, the federal share of losses is smaller when losses are shared  among insurers with larger aggregate premium bases.

It is unknown whether the set-aside may  be used for other purposes such as solvency.", "Participating insurers would structure the set-aside as a loss reserve to  cover their program deductible on terrorism losses. The reserve is  structured as a loss reserve in which the amount that is contributed to the  set-aside reduces an insurer\u2019s taxable income, according to a program  representative. This set-aside would help to cover potential terrorism  losses and the target amounts are based on each insurer\u2019s market share  of terrorism coverage, according to the program representative. Initially,  the reserves were accumulated over 10 years. The time frame was  increased to 15 years to allow insurers additional time to accumulate  increased program deductibles.", "Canada. According to insurance regulatory officials, Canadian insurance  companies must include mandatory set-asides for specific risk exposures  as part of minimum capital requirements and also have the option to  establish a voluntary set-aside in capital for earthquake events that have  not yet occurred. The mandatory capital set-asides account for potential  losses from earthquake, nuclear, and mortgage risks in risk-based capital  requirements. The Canadian insurance regulator provides guidance for  an insurer to determine the supervisory target level of required capital for  each risk (risk weights) that would be included as part of an insurer\u2019s risk- based capital requirements. The supervisory capital target for earthquake  risk is calculated based on a 500 year probable maximum loss. In  addition, for potential earthquake losses, insurers also may participate in  establishing a voluntary set-aside in capital. Officials said that this  voluntary set-aside is not typically used by insurers for various reasons  including the fact that it locks-in capital that may otherwise be used  elsewhere. Officials also told us that assets are not specifically  segregated in either the mandatory or voluntary set-asides and that the  voluntary set-asides provide a deduction for income tax purposes.", "Finland. According to insurance department representatives, nonlife  insurers in Finland must establish set-asides structured as equalization  reserves\u2014a type of loss reserve\u2014that serves as a buffer for  exceptionally high claims. These mandatory insurers\u2019 equalization  reserves can cover events that have not yet occurred, including losses  from natural catastrophes and terrorism. The calculations of target  amounts and contributions to such equalization reserves are based on  European Union capital requirements. The equalization reserve also has  a maximum amount, which can be up to four times the target amount.  Representatives also told us that the set-aside is not subject to tax on an  ongoing basis but may be subject to income taxes as the set-aside is  decreased.", "France. According to French insurance regulatory officials, insurance  companies in France may establish set-asides generally structured as  equalization reserves to cover events that have not yet occurred,  including natural disasters and terrorism. Insurers establish equalization  reserves on a voluntary basis that allow for tax deduction by the French  Tax Administration, but these reserves are not allowed to be included on  financial statements prepared under international accounting standards  because the event has not occurred, according to officials. Insurers  benefit from a tax deduction to reduce an insurer\u2019s taxable income for  contributions to these set-asides if certain standards are met, such as not  exceeding a target amount set by the French Tax Administration. The  target amount and time frames depend on the risk that the equalization  reserve is meant to cover. For example, an equalization reserve that  includes terrorism risk can be kept for 12 years.", "Mexico. According to a representative from the insurance regulator,  insurers in Mexico are required to establish set-asides for catastrophic  events that have not yet occurred and structure these set-asides as  special catastrophe reserves to cover natural catastrophe risks as well as  other catastrophe risks. Insurers create the catastrophe reserves with a  target amount based on probable maximum loss that is calculated at the  end of each fiscal year. In addition, insurers record these set-asides as  loss reserves on the balance sheet and contributions to these set-asides  are tax deductible. Once a catastrophic event occurs, insurers must first  exhaust their reinsurance options before utilizing their own catastrophic  set-asides."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Additional Potential Effects of Recoupment and Alternative Funding Options", "paragraphs": ["In this appendix, we discuss additional details about our methodology and  results regarding how recoupment under the Terrorism Risk Insurance  Act (TRIA) and alternative funding options could affect market  participants.

Specifically,  Treasury reimburses an insurer for a certain percentage of its insured  losses above its deductible.

We used terrorism risk reinsurance rates in other national  programs to estimate forgone premiums in the TRIA program because we  lack data to determine premiums that would be required for any other  estimation method. Currently premiums are not collected from  policyholders for the federal share of losses, and the government would  need to consider many factors in potentially setting a federal charge for  terrorism risk insurance. Using reinsurance rates charged by private  reinsurers to other national terrorism risk insurance programs for our  estimate of forgone premiums could provide information on how the  private market values terrorism risk insurance and the cost of capital to  provide that insurance. We were told by the broker of many reinsurance  deals in other national programs that premium rates were fairly stable  across countries and generally ranged from 2 percent to 3 percent of the  dollar amount of coverage. For example, the Australian terrorism risk  insurance program purchased reinsurance in 2014 for six layers of  reinsurance, with the rates ranging from 1.85 percent to 5.5 percent of  coverage. Rates decreased with each additional layer of cover.

For example, the private reinsurance market may not consider the risk  within the United States commensurate with risks in other countries;  U.S. risk may not be sufficiently geographically diverse to qualify for  the same pricing; or Treasury may not have sufficient information on  the risk of the underlying portfolio for reinsurers to price the  coverage.", "Second, the capacity of the private reinsurance market may not be  sufficiently large for the amount that we assume would be purchased  in this analysis. Programs in other countries purchase much smaller  amounts of reinsurance. For example, the Australian program  purchased just under $2 billion (about A$3 billion) of reinsurance  coverage in 2014. Our analysis assumed that the United States would  need to purchase more than 30 times that amount (about $65 billion in  reinsurance coverage).", "Third, the government might not choose to purchase this much  reinsurance.
