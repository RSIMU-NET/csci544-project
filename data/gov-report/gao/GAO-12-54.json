GAO focused on collections administered to households and individuals, analyzed statutory and agency documents, did five case studies of surveys, reviewed documentation of representative samples of active surveys, and interviewed agency officials and experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), agencies, and interagency statistical committees have distinct roles in identifying opportunities to improve federal information collection efforts. OMB exercises several authorities that promote the system\u2019s efficiency, including overseeing and approving agency information collections. The website Reginfo.gov provides the public with information, such as cost and burden, on collections that OMB reviews, though GAO\u2019s review identified some discrepancies in selected items. OMB periodically issues guidance to agencies on complying with federal requirements for information collections, but this guidance generally does not prescribe specific actions to take. GAO\u2019s analysis of agencies\u2019 documentation of active surveys indicated that 77 percent included detailed descriptions of efforts to identify duplication, while those that did not tended to be for collections that are unlikely to duplicate existing information; and 75 percent reported actions beyond those required by statute to solicit external input. OMB, through enhanced guidance, could promote additional awareness of options agencies can take to identify duplication and solicit input. Interagency committees, which primarily draw members from the 13 agencies that have statistics as their primary focus, are particularly important in helping ensure collaboration. The committees have numerous projects underway aimed at addressing key challenges facing the statistical system. However, mechanisms for disseminating information about their work are not comprehensive or up-to-date. Though member agencies are the most-likely customers of the committees\u2019 products, making information about committee work and priorities more accessible could benefit other agencies, academics, and the general public. It could also benefit committee members by providing a central repository for information.", "Administrative data have greater potential to supplement rather than replace survey data. Agencies currently combine the two data sources in four key ways to cost-effectively increase efficiency and quality. Specifically, agencies use administrative data to: (1) link to survey data to create new data products; (2) supplement surveys\u2019 sample frames; (3) compare to survey data to improve accuracy and design of surveys; and (4) combine with survey data to create, or model, estimates. However, expanding the use of administrative data faces key constraints related to the access and quality of the data. While agencies and committees are taking steps to address these constraints and facilitate the process through which agencies work together to share data, individual tools may not be sufficient. A more-comprehensive framework for use by all agencies involved in data-sharing decisions that includes key questions to consider when evaluating potential use of administrative data could make the decision process more consistent and transparent.", "ACS, an ongoing monthly survey that provides information about the nation\u2019s communities, offers agencies important opportunities to increase the efficiency and reduce the costs of their surveys, but its current design limits the extent to which agencies can utilize some of these opportunities. Uses that do not affect ACS design or the survey\u2019s respondents, such as using ACS estimates to inform survey design or evaluate other surveys\u2019 results, have widespread potential. However, more-intensive uses, such as adding content or supplemental surveys to the ACS, currently have limited potential."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that OMB take several actions to improve the broader efficiency of the federal statistical system, including implementing additional quality-control procedures for selected website data, enhancing awareness of ways to meet information collection requirements, better disseminating information on interagency committees, and developing comprehensive guidance for agencies to use when considering data sharing.

Key among them is  that the demand for information is increasing, especially as organizations  look for ways to operate more cost-effectively, while the cost of collecting  data is growing and response rates to surveys\u2014both government and  private-sector\u2014are declining, driven in part by concerns over privacy and  confidentiality. In the face of these challenges, it will be important for  federal statistical agencies to identify opportunities to increase their  efficiency, while maintaining or improving data quality and minimizing  respondent burden and respecting privacy and confidentiality concerns.  Greater use of administrative data, which includes information collected  as part of the execution of government programs as well as information  held by private companies, has been proposed as one approach to  enhance efficiency and quality. Another potential approach is making  greater use of the American Community Survey (ACS), a monthly survey  that replaced the census long form and provides annual data on  communities\u2019 demographic, social, economic, and housing conditions.", "At your request, this report (1) reviews the ways in which OMB and  agencies identify opportunities for improvement and increased efficiency;  (2) evaluates opportunities and constraints for the statistical agencies to  use administrative data in conjunction with selected surveys; and (3)  assesses the benefits and constraints of selected surveys making greater  use of ACS data and resources.", "To achieve our objectives, we focused our review on statistical  information collections administered to households and individuals, as  opposed to businesses or other entities, and subject to the Paperwork  Reduction Act (PRA), which requires OMB approval of certain federal  data collections. Specifically, we performed case studies of five federal  surveys: the Consumer Expenditure Surveys, sponsored by the Bureau of  Labor Statistics (BLS); the National Health and Nutrition Examination  Survey and the National Health Interview Survey, both sponsored by the  National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS); the National Survey of  College Graduates, sponsored by the National Center for Science and  Engineering Statistics (NCSES), part of the National Science Foundation;  and the Survey of Income and Program Participation, sponsored by the  Census Bureau. We selected these surveys based on several factors,  such as their size and cost and whether they use or have the potential to  use administrative data or ACS data.

This structure keeps statistical work within  close proximity to the various cabinet-level departments that use the  information. There are 13 federal agencies, referred to as the principal  statistical agencies, which have statistical activities as their core mission.  These agencies conduct much of the government\u2019s statistical work,  though there are more than 80 additional federal agencies that carry out  some statistical work in conjunction with their primary missions. The 13  principal statistical agencies are all attached to a cabinet-level department  or an independent agency that reports to the president.

This amount is about 0.2 percent of that year\u2019s total federal  budget request. Much of this work is concentrated in the 13 principal  statistical agencies, which account for approximately 40 percent of  requested funding. The budget request for the Census Bureau is among  the highest of the principal statistical agencies.

In a sample of 112 information collections that fell within our scope and  were active as of September 22, 2011, the majority cost less than  $500,000 annually, and fewer than one in five cost more than $1 million  annually. There are a few, more expensive, large and broad-based collections such as the Current Population Survey and National Health  Interview Survey, both of which cost tens of millions of dollars each year,  and the ACS, which costs over $200 million annually (see fig. 2).", "Various statutes and guidance from OMB and other entities establish  standards for quality and privacy that apply to the federal statistical  system. One of the most significant statutes is the PRA, which designates  OMB as the coordinating body of the federal statistical system. The PRA  establishes requirements that agencies must meet in order to administer  information collections, and OMB must meet in overseeing the system,  including that it issue guidance to agencies. Other entities also provide  guidance to agencies that conduct statistical work. In addition, use of  information must be balanced with protection of privacy and  confidentiality. Statutes such as the Confidential Information Protection  and Statistical Efficiency Act (CIPSEA) apply to the federal statistical  system and focus on ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of  respondents\u2019 information. Agency-specific statutes also protect the  privacy and confidentiality of data collected by those agencies.

This system also facilitates OIRA\u2019s review of the  requests and underlies the information provided on the public website  Reginfo.gov. Agency submissions to OMB typically include a copy of the  data-collection instrument (e.g., a survey) and supporting documentation  that, in a standardized form, provides information on the collection, such  as the estimated annual burden hours and cost to the federal  government. Further, under PRA, agencies must certify that the collection  satisfies the act\u2019s standards, for example that the collection avoids  unnecessary duplication. Making this information transparent and easily  accessible to other agencies facilitates coordination and can potentially  help agencies avoid duplication and identify opportunities for  improvement.

Second, combining  administrative data with survey data can increase efficiency by  enhancing previously collected survey data. For example, the National  Center for Health Statistics\u2019s (NCHS) record-linkage program links  survey data from various health-related surveys to different  administrative datasets to create new data products for studying  factors that influence health-related outcomes, such as disability,  health care, and mortality.", "Supplementing surveys\u2019 sample frames: Using administrative data  to supplement surveys\u2019 sample frames\u2014the sources from which a  survey\u2019s sample is drawn\u2014can create efficiencies, reduce costs, and  enhance the quality of surveys. For example, the National Household  Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey uses administrative data from  the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to develop a sample  frame of participating households to potentially include in the survey.  ERS officials said that using these data to help develop the survey\u2019s  sample frame costs less than the alternative of screening a broader  group of respondents to determine if they are participating. In addition,  agencies can use administrative data to augment sample frames in  areas where the sample is not large enough to fully support a survey.  For example, the Census Bureau\u2019s pilot project studying the potential  to use ACS data as a sample frame for the National Immunization  Survey used commercial data to supplement ACS data in a county  that had a limited ACS sample.", "Comparing data to improve survey accuracy and design: By  comparing survey data to similar administrative datasets and  identifying reasons for any discrepancies that may exist, agencies can  improve the quality of survey data. For example, researchers  identified opportunities for improving surveys\u2019 designs and  methodologies after agencies found that surveys of enrollment in  health-insurance programs provided lower estimates than those  compiled from administrative data. Agencies can also improve the  efficiency of their surveys by using administrative data as part of  nonresponse follow-up activities.", "Modeling estimates: Agencies combine administrative data and  survey data to create, or model, estimates that are designed to be  more accurate than estimates based on survey data alone. The main  benefit of modeling is that it provides the ability to produce estimates  for smaller geographic areas than is possible using a survey alone.  For example, the Census Bureau conducts the Small Area Income  and Poverty Estimates Program to provide updated data on poverty  and income, which is used to administer federal programs and  allocate federal funds to local areas. The Census Bureau combines  survey data from the ACS with population estimates and  administrative data and has found that this approach produces  consistent and reliable data more reflective of current conditions than  data produced only by existing surveys."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Are Addressing Issues That Hamper Use of Administrative Data, but Additional Actions Could Facilitate Progress", "paragraphs": ["Despite the benefits of using administrative data to supplement federal  surveys, agencies face five key constraints related to data access and  quality:", "Statutory restrictions on data sharing: Federal and state statutes  sometimes prohibit or limit sharing of data for statistical purposes. In  cases where specified authorized uses do not include statistical use,  nothing short of a statutory change can overcome the constraint. In  other cases, statutes limit sharing to purposes related to program  administration. For example, the 2008 Farm Bill restricts access to  data on participants in certain nutrition-assistance programs to uses  for the \u201cadministration or enforcement\u201d of the programs. Similarly,  the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, restricts federal  student aid data to purposes related to the \u201capplication, award, and  administration of aid.\u201d However, agencies holding such restricted  data can differ on whether statistical uses are related to program  administration. The Census Bureau successfully negotiated access to  the nutrition assistance data because it could demonstrate that the  linked data would help the federal sponsor and state agencies  develop better measures of outcomes, such as poverty, inequality,  and the receipt of government transfers. Conversely, the Census  Bureau was unable to gain access to the federal student aid data for  statistical uses because the Department of Education did not consider  that any of the planned uses related to the program\u2019s administration.", "Consent: Individuals\u2019 consent to allow their administrative and survey  data to be linked affects uses of administrative data for statistical  purposes. Seeking consent derives from a core concept of personal  privacy: the notion that each individual should have the ability to  control personal information about himself or herself. Moreover,  there can be issues regarding the privacy and confidentiality of data  collected for one purpose and used for another, and agencies use  different practices, wording, and level of detail to meet consent  requirements, according to OMB officials. At the time administrative  data are collected, an agency can inform individuals that their data  may be used for statistical purposes, but, according to ERS officials,  agencies collecting administrative data often do not consider possible  future statistical uses and therefore may not provide such notice.  Obtaining consent after data have been collected can be time- consuming and costly. In addition, an agency can ask survey  respondents for permission to link their survey data with certain  administrative data. Some respondents may not consent, which can  substantially limit the number of respondents eligible for linkage and  as a result potentially affect the quality of the linked data.", "Costs and infrastructure: Because the primary cost of collecting  administrative data has already been incurred, using these data can,  in some cases, be more efficient and less costly than new survey  efforts. However, there still are costs to using administrative data for  statistical purposes, including up-front and ongoing investments to  purchase and maintain hardware and software to link data and protect  their confidentiality. Agencies identified various factors that can affect  costs. These include but are not limited to negotiations with the  agency holding the data, the quality of the administrative data, and the  ease with which they can be linked to other data. BLS officials said  that in some cases the costs of using administrative data with survey  data may outweigh any savings and that evaluation of administrative  data options always requires careful consideration of a wide range of  quality and cost issues, including the costs of specialized personnel  and infrastructure. According to an FCSM study that profiled  examples of successful statistical uses of administrative data,  agencies wanting to share data also may not have the necessary  staff, policies, or procedures. For example, negotiating data-sharing  agreements may require significant time. Moreover, many key  administrative datasets are held by states, further complicating the  data-sharing process because agencies have to negotiate under  different policies and procedures as well as work with numerous staff  across states.", "Documentation of datasets: OMB and agency officials said that  agencies holding administrative data do not uniformly document  information about their datasets in a way that is always useful or  efficient for use outside of the agency. This lack of documentation of  datasets makes evaluating their potential for statistical uses  challenging. For example, definitions of key variables of research  interest or information about how frequently the agency updates the  data may not be available. ERS officials also noted that private  companies typically do not disclose detailed information about the  sources of their data, making it difficult to assess their quality. As a  result, agencies interested in using these data for statistical purposes  may have to spend additional time and resources to understand the  content and structure of the datasets.", "Quality of data: Agency officials and experts identified reasons why  the quality of administrative data can vary, which can affect their  potential use with survey data. Specifically, different agencies may  use different systems, definitions, and time frames when collecting  administrative data. For example, states may collect and evaluate the  quality of data in different ways, making it complicated to aggregate  the data across states as well as to compare state-level data. In  addition, several factors can influence the accuracy of data reported in  administrative data. For example, agencies that collect data for the  purpose of program administration may be concerned with the  accuracy of only the variables used for such purpose. Moreover,  reporting incentives may influence data quality. For example,  individuals may underreport income on tax forms, and program  agencies may pay less attention to the accuracy of information  collected from applicants when it does not affect their participation in a  program.", "Agencies and interagency committees have been taking numerous  actions to address these constraints. For example, ERS, in collaboration  with the Census Bureau, NCHS, and OMB is undertaking a pilot project to  address data quality concerns with state-level administrative data, and  FCSM is working on a project to clarify legal requirements for informed  consent (see fig. 3).", "One theme that cuts across many of these efforts, and where additional  short-term actions could accelerate progress, is identifying ways to  facilitate the process of deciding whether to share data among agencies.  FCSM published a paper describing successful data-sharing  arrangements between various federal and state agencies. One of the  four core elements of success that FCSM identified in these  arrangements was mutual interest, in that each participant\u2014in particular  the agency providing the data\u2014evaluates a proposed data-sharing  agreement from its own perspective. On the one hand, agencies may  share data because the linked data can benefit program administration,  as noted earlier. On the other hand, OMB and agency officials noted that  agencies may decide against sharing because perceived disadvantages,  such as policy concerns and potential identification of weaknesses in  program administration, outweigh the possible benefits. In such a case,  an individual agency\u2019s interests may be at odds with the broader  efficiency of the whole federal statistical system. As illustrated in figure 3,  FCSM and agencies are developing tools to approach these decisions in  a more standardized way, such as developing checklists for evaluating  the quality of administrative data and a template for executing data- sharing agreements. However, these individual tools focus on particular  aspects of data sharing\u2014for example, the checklist focuses on data  quality. Separately, they may not be sufficient for agencies to efficiently  identify potential datasets with the greatest potential for mutual benefit  and address all factors involved in the decision-making process.", "The benefits of having more-comprehensive centralized guidance could  include greater consistency, clarification, and efficiency. A more- comprehensive standardized framework that ties together existing tools  with additional resources in order to cover major aspects of the data- sharing process could bring consistency to the decision-making process.  Similar to the checklist that FCSM is developing for agencies to use in  evaluating data quality, the framework could include a template outlining  a list of key questions for all agencies involved in the proposed data  sharing, including federal and state agencies that hold data, to address  issues such as: (1) the steps to take to ensure data reliability; (2) any  statutory limitations on planned uses of the data (including confidentiality  protections); (3) whether consent has already been obtained for additional  use of the data, or how it will be obtained; and (4) methods to fully  account for the costs associated with obtaining and using the data. To be  comprehensive, such guidance would not need to be voluminous, but it  should identify each of these major aspects of data sharing, provide  advice to agencies, and reference any tools available to assist agencies  during the process. It should also be kept up-to-date, reflecting changes  in legislation or other factors that affect data sharing, as well as any new  tools that are developed. Although such a framework may not lead to  sharing in all cases, the framework could better ensure that agencies  weigh the related benefits and costs in a more balanced, consistent, and  transparent fashion. Such guidance could also clarify ways that agencies  could resolve disagreements over data sharing. It could also improve  efficiency, given that agency officials we spoke with cited examples in  which it took multiple years to reach a resolution on data sharing, by  helping agencies evaluate available data and determine those that have  the greatest potential for mutual benefit.", "While agencies can take steps to address some constraints on sharing  data, in other cases only policy actions on the part of the executive  branch or Congress can lift barriers. One of the primary examples of such  action is Congress\u2019s enactment of CIPSEA in 2002, which authorized the  Census Bureau to share selected business data with BLS and the Bureau  of Economic Analysis for statistical purposes. However, CIPSEA is limited  because the Census Bureau\u2019s business data are based in large part on  tax data, and as a result the tax code would need to be amended for the  Census Bureau to also share these data with other statistical agencies.  There have been proposals to amend the tax code to further expand the  scope and coverage of CIPSEA, but action has not yet been taken by  Congress."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Prospects for Enhanced Use of the ACS with Other Surveys Are Mixed", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The ACS Provides Unique Coverage of the Nation\u2019s Population", "paragraphs": ["The Census Bureau\u2019s full implementation of the ACS in 2005 was a major  change to the statistical system. The survey is unique among other  surveys of households and individuals because of its size\u2014the monthly  surveys add to an annual sample of 3.54 million addresses. The ACS  provides annual estimates of social and economic characteristics for all  areas of the country and is a primary source of information on small  areas, such as towns and tribal lands, down to the neighborhood level.  The ACS covers a broad range of topics, such as housing, education, and  employment. The information provided by the ACS was previously only  available once a decade from the decennial census long form, which the  ACS replaced. Users of ACS information include all levels of government,  the private and nonprofit sectors, and researchers. According to the  Census Bureau, ACS estimates are currently used to help allocate more  than $400 billion in federal funding annually. Table 2 lists some of the key  characteristics of the ACS.", "Several of the ACS\u2019s characteristics lend to its appeal for use for other  surveys, including that it produces annual estimates on a broad range of  topics at finer geographic levels than other surveys, and agencies and  others identified five areas of opportunity in which surveys can make use  of ACS data and resources. Two of these areas, which generally rely on  publicly-available ACS estimates and do not require changes to the  survey\u2019s design or methodology, have the greatest potential for  widespread use. The Census Bureau has provided users with various  resources to guide their use of ACS estimates. These include a guide to  comparing estimates, handbooks directed to specific types of users,  training presentations, and a tutorial. The two areas with the most  potential for use are as follows:", "Evaluating and supplementing other surveys\u2019 results: Survey  administrators and data users can also use ACS estimates to  evaluate information collected by other surveys. For example, survey  administrators can use ACS information to evaluate the quality of  responses to other surveys that include some questions that are the  same as or similar to ACS questions. Additionally, data users and  survey administrators can use ACS data to supplement information  collected by other surveys. For example, a recent report based on  analysis of ACS data describes how median earnings vary by the field  in which people obtain their bachelor\u2019s degrees. Such information  can complement results from other surveys. In this case, NCSES also  produces information on earnings by degree type, based on  information in its Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System  database, which contains data on people with a science or  engineering degree and those who work in related fields. NCSES  information collection is less frequent than ACS estimates and  pertains to a more-narrowly defined population, but allows more  detailed analysis of issues such as how people use their college  degrees at work. Together, these two sources of information offer  more-timely and more-detailed information than a single source.", "Designing other surveys: There is also widespread potential to use  ACS data to more-efficiently design other surveys. Because many of  the topics included in the ACS are covered in more detail by other  surveys or relate to other surveys\u2019 target populations, survey  administrators can use ACS estimates at different demographic or  geographic levels to stay up-to-date on changes that may affect their  surveys. These estimates can also be used when designing and  selecting a survey\u2019s sample. Census Bureau officials told us that,  when designing a survey, survey administrators can use the data to  guide the selection of a survey\u2019s sample so that it better represents  individuals or households with certain characteristics. For example,  the Survey of Income and Program Participation can use ACS  estimates at different demographic or geographic levels to identify and  more-efficiently sample geographic areas with disproportionately large  numbers of low-income households because this is a population of  interest for the survey. Because these data are available for small  geographic areas, agencies can use the data when samples include  more-local geographic levels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Uses of ACS That Require Design and Methodology Changes Have Limited Potential", "paragraphs": ["Agencies and others identified three uses of ACS data and resources  that, while offering potential benefits to other surveys, face such  constraints that more widespread use is likely not possible under current  ACS design. These uses are more intensive than the ones described  above, in that they affect the survey\u2019s design and methodology or  respondent burden, or both. Because the ACS has a large sample size  and a complex methodology, there are logistical challenges involved in  changing its design and methodology. Additionally, any changes that  affect the survey\u2019s respondent burden also have limited potential, as there  are already concerns about the burden that the ACS places on  respondents. Uses with more-limited potential are as follows:", "Adding or modifying ACS content: Adding a question to the ACS or  modifying existing questions can improve the efficiency of other  surveys, though doing so involves trade-offs with factors such as  respondent burden. This use of ACS could provide information that  would inform the design of other surveys or facilitate the use of ACS  data for another survey\u2019s sample frame. For example, NCSES worked  with the Census Bureau to add a question to the ACS about the field  in which respondents earned their bachelor\u2019s degrees in order to  identify respondents that are in the target population for the National  Survey of College Graduates. Despite the potential benefits of adding  or modifying ACS content, adding a question to the ACS would  increase respondent burden and have operational impacts, as it  requires the Census Bureau to change the questionnaire design and  processing and editing systems. If these actions result in additional  pages for the questionnaire, it could affect costs and the response  rate. Modifying questions poses an additional challenge because ACS  estimates reflect multiple years of data, and a change in a question  may affect the Census Bureau\u2019s ability to cumulate data.", "Adding supplements to the ACS: Another possible use of the ACS  by other surveys is adding supplements to the ACS, though this use  faces several obstacles. While the ACS currently does not include  supplements, doing so could enable surveys to leverage the  resources of the ACS. Other surveys, such as the Current Population  Survey, allow other agencies or entities to sponsor supplemental  surveys that are added on to the survey\u2019s core set of questions.  According to officials at BLS, which sponsors the Current Population  Survey, in their experience it costs less to add a supplement to an  existing survey than to conduct a separate stand-alone survey.  Additionally, the agencies sponsoring the supplements gain the  benefit of the experience of BLS or Census staff, or both, in designing  and implementing surveys. Although the Current Population Survey  successfully incorporates supplements, the ACS is different in several  key ways, and adding supplements to the ACS would involve  significant challenges. For example, the ACS is mandatory, meaning  that responses are required by law. Assuming a supplement to the  ACS would be voluntary, Census Bureau officials told us that they  would have to determine how to distinguish between the mandatory  and voluntary sections, which would create complexity. Additionally,  the Census Bureau processes ACS data on a yearly basis and does  not have a process in place for producing estimates from a single  month\u2019s data, which would be a challenge if the supplement was  administered along with only 1 month\u2019s ACS mailout. Finally, including  supplements raises concerns about respondent burden and  respondent fatigue. BLS officials noted the potential of matrix  sampling, in which a set of additional questions, as in a supplement, is  added to a month of collection (or all months) but differs from a  supplement in that it is only administered to a subset of the survey  sample in a given collection period. This option could reduce burden  and increase efficiency; however, such an option involves logistical  considerations in administering the survey and processing the data,  and adds complexity for analysts using the data for research.", "Creating sample frames: Using ACS data to develop sample frames  for follow-on surveys has been identified as a potential use of ACS  data, but several factors limit this use. This involves using ACS data  to identify ACS respondents with certain characteristics for potential  inclusion in a follow-on survey and requires the approval of the  Census Bureau and OMB. At present only NCSES uses ACS data  for this purpose. Agency officials told us that using ACS data to create  a sample frame, as opposed to census long-form data, which they  used previously, has improved the agency\u2019s coverage of its target  population and has reduced costs and respondent burden.benefit of this use is expanded analysis, as agencies, under  appropriate Title 13 restrictions, can analyze respondents\u2019 answers to  the ACS along with responses to the follow-on surveys, and can  analyze the characteristics (from ACS data) of those who do and do  not respond to the follow-on survey to determine if they have different  characteristics, which might cause bias in the survey. Surveys such  as the National Survey of College Graduates that focus on  populations that are costly to identify are likely to realize higher gains  in efficiency from using ACS data for this purpose. Despite these  benefits, opportunities for other surveys to use ACS data for this  purpose are limited. ACS\u2019s sample size, although large compared to  most surveys, can be too small for another survey to use for a  sampling frame. This is especially an issue if a survey targets a rare  population or targets members similar to those of surveys already  drawing from the ACS for their frame, because there would be too  much chance of drawing individuals into both follow-on surveys, and  current policy does not allow for that. Census Bureau policy states  that, when agencies conduct follow-on surveys, they may not contact  any member of a household that has already responded to the ACS  and also had a member selected for a follow-on survey. With certain  households in the ACS excluded from potential selection, it becomes  more difficult for other surveys to draw samples because the data no  longer reflect respondents with certain characteristics.", "In the long run, more-intensive uses of ACS data and resources may  require difficult decisions and entail trade-offs with factors such as cost  and respondent burden. Further, they risk affecting ACS response rates  and overall data quality. However, redesign of the scope and  methodology of ACS might overcome some of these constraints. After the  release of the survey\u2019s first 5-year data products in 2010, the Census  Bureau and others began evaluating the survey and exploring options for  increased uses. In addition to its own evaluation of the ACS, at the  Census Bureau\u2019s request the National Academy of Sciences is organizing  workshops with data users to assess the survey. Also, OMB, in  cooperation with the Census Bureau, created an ACS subcommittee of  the ICSP with the goal of investigating trade-offs of options such as  adding questions to the ACS and rotating questions in and out of the  survey. If the Census Bureau changes the survey\u2019s design or  methodology, these changes may become more feasible."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["To ensure the provision of high-quality, timely statistical data for public-  and private-sector users, OMB and the agencies that make up the federal  statistical system must continue to identify opportunities for efficiency in  federal surveys of households and individuals.

In the long  term, addressing the key challenges and constraints that agencies have  identified will necessitate broader public debates and policy decisions  about balancing trade-offs among competing values, such as quality,  cost, timeliness, privacy, and confidentiality. In the short term, our review  indicated that two promising avenues to sustain the progress that OMB  and agencies are making include (1) facilitating collaboration and  coordination among agencies and (2) combining existing data from both  survey and administrative sources.", "The federal statistical system already exhibits many collaborative traits  and practices, in particular through projects sponsored by OMB and  interagency committees that facilitate coordination and the development  of new policies and tools. However, additional efforts could help enhance  the effectiveness of these efforts. Going forward, it will be important for  OMB to supplement existing guidance to clarify the range of options  available to address PRA standards. Supplementing the guidance could  increase agencies\u2019 awareness of these options, in particular those that  were cited less frequently. At the same time, interagency committees  could do more to improve accessibility and timeliness of their work  products. Doing so could maximize the usefulness of committees\u2019 work.  Additionally, OMB\u2019s ability to oversee and coordinate information  collections across the government would benefit from additional steps to  ensure the reliability of data on collections\u2019 costs and burdens. Doing so  would also benefit users of the information, whether they access it  through the website or though OMB reports.", "Agencies identified multiple ways that combining survey and  administrative data can improve the efficiency and quality of their work,  and they are already pursuing such opportunities. Importantly, they have  demonstrated that using existing datasets to supplement each other can  add value for all agencies involved in data sharing. But agencies also  face serious constraints to expanded uses of existing data. One of the  more-significant barriers is the complexity of the process through which  they make decisions about sharing data. Though agencies and  interagency committees are working to create tools to facilitate parts of  this process, more-comprehensive and centralized guidance for agencies  to follow when negotiating and making decisions regarding data-sharing  opportunities could help facilitate the process.", "A standard protocol or framework could accelerate progress in this area  by helping agencies to (1) evaluate the growing array of administrative  data to identify those datasets that have the greatest potential for mutual  benefit of the participating agencies, and (2) consider a common set of  criteria and key questions when weighing the pros and cons of sharing  data.

The majority of the collections within our scope include a  survey, though some also include other methods of information collection  such as focus groups. To examine the issues related to our objectives,  we performed case studies of five federal surveys: the Consumer  Expenditure Surveys, sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; the  National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the National Health  Interview Survey, both sponsored by the National Center for Health  Statistics, part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the  National Survey of College Graduates, sponsored by the National Center  for Science and Engineering Statistics, part of the National Science  Foundation; and the Survey of Income and Program Participation,  sponsored by the Census Bureau.

We used the website\u2019s search feature to  download all of the collections that were classified as (1) active, meaning  that they are currently approved by OMB for use by agencies; (2)  employing statistical methods; and (3) directed to households and  individuals. We downloaded data on all information collections that met  these criteria from Reginfo.gov on two dates, May 17, 2011, and  September 22, 2011.", "We performed more in-depth analyses of the 507 information collections  in our May 17, 2011, download. First, we reviewed the supporting  statements for each of these collections, and on the basis of information  in these documents classified them according to the subject matter on  which they focus. Next, we grouped the collections into categories,  based on information on the sponsoring agency in Reginfo.gov and the  supporting statements. Depending on the sponsoring agency, we put the  collections into one of four categories: (1) those that are sponsored by  one of the 13 principal statistical agencies; (2) those that are sponsored  by another agency that shares a parent agency with one of the 13  principal statistical agencies (for example, agencies in the Department of  Health and Human Services would fall into this category because it is the  parent agency of the National Center for Health Statistics); (3) those that  are not a principal statistical agency and do not share a parent agency  with one; and (4) unknown, for those whose sponsoring agency we could  not determine based on the available information. We also used the  information in the supporting statements to determine if the collections  included a survey component and found that 481 of the 507 did.", "We divided the 481 collections that included a survey component into  three strata that reflect the type of sponsoring agency. Of the 481, we  were not able to determine agency type for 7 collections so we dropped  these records, leaving a population of 474 statistical information  collections. The number of collections by stratum is shown in table 3. In  order to estimate the prevalence of certain characteristics in this  population\u2014for example, the percentage of information collections for  which the sponsoring agency reported steps taken to identify potential  duplication\u2014we drew a stratified sample of 106 collections. Within each  stratum, we estimated the sample size required to yield a 95 percent  confidence interval of plus or minus 14 percent around such an estimate.  For the overall population of 474, the approximate precision for an  estimated percentage of 50 percent is plus or minus 8.4 percent, at the 95  percent level of confidence.", "We reviewed the supporting statements of each of the information  collections in our sample of 106, focusing on agencies\u2019 reported efforts to  identify duplication and to consult with persons outside the agency to  obtain their views. Because agencies follow a standard format in  preparing supporting statements, we focused our analysis on the sections  of the supporting statements in which OMB instructs agencies to include  this information (sections 4 and 8, respectively, of section A of the  supporting statement). To review agencies\u2019 reported actions, we used a  data-collection instrument that contained a series of \u201cyes-no\u201d questions  about the types of efforts reported. For example, we reviewed whether  agencies had reported considering administrative data as a potential  source of duplication, and whether agencies reported that they had  consulted with other agencies when describing consultations outside of  the agency. We did not evaluate whether agencies actually took the  actions they reported taking. Estimates produced from the sample of the  collections are subject to sampling error. We express our confidence in  the precision of our results as a 95 percent confidence interval. This is the  interval that would contain the actual population value for 95 percent of  the samples we could have drawn. As a result, we are 95 percent  confident that each of the confidence intervals in this report will include  the true values in the study population.", "We took several steps to evaluate the reliability of the data we accessed  through the Reginfo.gov website. We interviewed OMB officials and  reviewed documentation of the Reginfo.gov website and the Regulatory  Information Service Center and OIRA Consolidated Information System,which is the system that agencies use to track information collection  requests and that underlies information provided on Reginfo.gov. As part  of our review of the subject matter of the collections in the May 17, 2011,  download, we confirmed that the collections were within our scope. We  also used the information in the September 22, 2011, download to  evaluate the reliability of data on collections\u2019 cost and annual burden. To  do this, we drew a systematic random sample of 56 (approximately 10  percent) of the 555 collections in the download.", "We found a number of inconsistencies between the cost and burden  information available on the website and that provided in supporting  statement documentation. According to an official at OMB, the two  sources should match, but the supporting statement documentation is  more accurate than that on the website. On the basis of our assessment,  we determined that the information from the website was not sufficiently  reliable for the purpose of describing the annual cost or annual burden to  respondents of the collections in our scope. However, through this review  and the other steps we took, we found that the other information provided  on the Reginfo.gov site was sufficiently reliable for our other intended  purposes of identifying the collections within our scope and obtaining  information on their subject matter and reported actions taken to identify  unnecessary duplication and solicit input from outside persons and  entities.", "Because the cost information on the Reginfo.gov website was not  sufficiently reliable, we used cost information from the supporting  statements of the collections in our sample to provide background  information on the costs of the collections in our scope. In addition to  using information from the supporting statements in our initial sample of  56 collections, we drew another systematic random sample of 56  additional collections from the September download. In total, we obtained  cost information from the supporting statements of 112 (approximately 20  percent) of the 555 collections in our scope that were active as of our  September 22, 2011, download.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2010 until February  2012 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
