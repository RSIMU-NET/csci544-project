The E-2 nonimmigrant classification allows an eligible foreign national to be temporarily admitted to the United States to direct the operations of a business in which they have invested a substantial amount of capital, or to work in an approved position (e.g., manager or essential employee). To obtain E-2 status, a foreign national can apply through State for an E-2 visa abroad, or if already in the United States, by petitioning USCIS to extend or change to E-2 status.", "GAO was asked to review State's and USCIS' E-2 adjudication process. This report addresses: (1) outcomes and characteristics of foreign nationals who sought or received E-2 status from fiscal years 2014 through 2018, (2) policies and procedures for ensuring that individuals meet E-2 eligibility requirements, and (3) efforts to assess and address potential E-2 fraud. GAO analyzed State and USCIS data on E-2 adjudications, generalizable samples of E-2 visa applications and petitions, and relevant documents. GAO interviewed officials at 14 State posts abroad, selected based on E-2 application volume and other factors, and observed E-2 adjudications at four of these posts and USCIS's California Service Center."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of State (State) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) annually adjudicated about 54,000 visa applications or petitions from fiscal years 2014 through 2018 for foreign nationals seeking E-2 nonimmigrant status, over 80 percent of which were approved. About eighty percent of E-2 adjudications were for State visa applications, and the remaining 20 percent were for USCIS petitions to extend or change to E-2 status. Generally, about half of the foreign nationals seeking E-2 status were investors, managers, or essential employees of an E-2 business, and the other half were their spouses or children.", "State and USCIS have guidance, procedures, and training intended to help consular and immigration officers ensure foreign nationals meet E-2 eligibility requirements; however, officials GAO interviewed from both agencies identified challenges in the E-2 adjudication process.", "State. Consular officers noted that E-2 visa adjudications are complicated and resource-intensive, often requiring more documentation and time to complete than other visas. For example, the requirement that the investment in the business be substantial does not prescribe a minimum capital amount. Rather, the investment must be large enough to support the likely success of the business, among other criteria. Consular officers at 10 of 14 posts GAO interviewed indicated that determining the investment's substantiality is difficult for newly encountered business types. Providing additional E-2 training or related resources would help ensure that consular officers and locally employed staff have the necessary knowledge and abilities to carry out their responsibilities.", "USCIS. Officials identified similar challenges with respect to E-2 adjudications. However, officials stated that colocating immigration officers who adjudicate E-2 petitions helps to mitigate the challenges because the officers can communicate with each other on how USCIS has typically adjudicated such cases.", "State and USCIS have resources to address E-2 fraud, which includes submitting falsified documents or making false statements material to the adjudication; however, coordination on E-2 anti-fraud efforts is limited. State has anti-fraud efforts in place for all nonimmigrant visa types, but State officials stated that they consider E-2 visa fraud to be lower risk compared to other visas because the large amount of complex paperwork required for the E-2 visa discourages malicious actors. USCIS officials consider E-2 fraud to be a significant issue and have taken steps to identify fraud, such as using fraud assessment technology to determine if a business is financially viable and conducting site visits if fraud is suspected. Both State and USCIS collect information that could be useful to each other's anti-fraud efforts, but interagency coordination on E-2 fraud issues is ad hoc and relatively rare. For example, the main formal mechanism of coordination on E-2 visa issues\u2014a quarterly teleconference\u2014was cancelled 7 out of 8 times in fiscal years 2017 and 2018. Coordinating regularly on fraud issues, which is a best practice from GAO's Fraud Risk Framework, will help both entities to better identify emerging E-2 fraud trends and areas for potential resource sharing."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making five recommendations, including that State provide more E-2 training or resources to consular officers, and that State and USCIS establish a regular coordination mechanism to share information on E-2 fraud risks.

One  source of foreign direct investment is from foreign nationals of 82  countries (treaty countries) who may obtain E-2 nonimmigrant status in  the United States. The E-2 nonimmigrant classification allows a foreign  national of a treaty country (investor) to be temporarily admitted to the  United States solely to develop and direct the operations of a U.S.  business in which he or she has invested a substantial amount of capital.  E-2 status may also be available to other individuals who share the  investor\u2019s treaty country nationality and are working for the business,  such as an employee in an executive or supervisory position (manager)  or an employee having special qualifications essential to successful or  efficient business operations (essential employee). Furthermore, the  spouse and children (dependents) of an E-2 investor, manager, or  essential employee are also eligible for E-2 status.", "There are two pathways for an individual to obtain E-2 status: (1) by  applying through the Department of State (State) for an E-2 visa at a U.S.  embassy or consulate abroad (posts) and then being inspected and  admitted at a U.S. port of entry by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s  (DHS) U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), or (2) if already in the  United States in E-2 or another nonimmigrant status (e.g., business visitor  or student), by petitioning for a change to, or extension of, E-2 status  through DHS\u2019s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). As  with other immigration benefits, State consular officers and USCIS  immigration officers are tasked with ensuring that E-2 status is not  granted to ineligible individuals, including those engaging in fraud, such  as using counterfeit identity documents or making false claims material to  the adjudication process. Additionally, CBP is responsible for inspecting  all E-2 visa holders at U.S. ports of entry to determine their admissibility  for an authorized period of stay.", "Consistent with the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), prospective E-2  nonimmigrants must meet several eligibility requirements. For example,  the E-2 investor, manager, and essential employee must be a national of  a country with which the United States maintains treaties of commerce  and navigation. Further, although there is no prescribed minimum  investment amount, the investor must place a \u201csubstantial\u201d amount of  capital \u201cat risk\u201d (i.e., subject to total or partial loss).", "You asked us to review State\u2019s and USCIS\u2019s oversight and  implementation of the E-2 adjudication process.

To assess the  reliability of the E-2 data, we interviewed State and USCIS officials who  maintain the data and checked the data for missing information, outliers,  and obvious errors, among other actions. On the basis of these steps, we  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  reporting objectives, including providing summary statistics on E-2  adjudications, outcomes, and the characteristics of those seeking E-2  status. We also analyzed generalizable stratified random samples of E-2  visa applications from State and E-2 petitions from USCIS adjudicated in  fiscal year 2018 to gather additional information, such as information on  types of businesses and investment amounts. Specifically, we reviewed  120 E-2 visa applications and 124 E-2 petitions from USCIS for E-2  investors, managers, and essential employees. We chose sample sizes  to achieve precision levels for a percentage estimate of plus or minus 10  percentage points for important sub-populations, such as denied petitions  and role (e.g., investor, manager, and essential employee).", "To assess State and USCIS policies and procedures to ensure that  individuals meet E-2 eligibility requirements, we reviewed relevant  provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act and implementing  regulations, and State and USCIS guidance, such as State\u2019s Foreign  Affairs Manual (FAM) and USCIS\u2019s E-2 standard operating procedures.  We also interviewed officials from State\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs and  Foreign Service Institute, and USCIS on their respective agencies\u2019 E-2  processes and procedures, as well as training.

However, only  consular officers can adjudicate visa  applications.", "We conducted site visits to State and USCIS locations that adjudicate E-2  visa applications and petitions, respectively. For State, we conducted site  visits from October through December 2018. For our site visits, we  selected four posts that (1) were among the 10 highest E-2 adjudicating  posts by volume in fiscal year 2017, (2) had different staffing models for  E-2 visa adjudications, and (3) were geographically dispersed. During  these visits, we observed the processing, prescreening (see sidebar), and  adjudication of E-2 applications, and interviewed consular officials and  locally employed staff (LES), among others, about E-2 visa adjudication  policies, procedures, resources, and training. Our observations from  these site visits provided useful insights into State\u2019s E-2 adjudication  procedures, but are not generalizable to all posts that adjudicate E-2  visas. For USCIS, in November 2018, we visited the California Service  Center in Laguna Niguel, California\u2014which is the only USCIS service  center that adjudicates E-2 petitions\u2014to observe E-2 adjudications and  interview USCIS officials. In addition to our site visits, we conducted  telephone interviews with State consular officers and LES responsible for  prescreening and adjudicating E-2 visa applications at the remaining 6 of  the top 10 posts in terms of E-2 annual adjudications, as well as 4  randomly selected low-volume posts.

Such  misrepresentations may involve a specific  intent to deceive. Immigration benefit fraud is  often facilitated by document fraud and  identity fraud. Immigration-related document  fraud includes forging, counterfeiting, altering,  or falsely making any document, or using,  possessing, obtaining, accepting, or receiving  such falsified documents in order to satisfy  any requirement of, or to obtain a benefit  under the Immigration and Nationality Act.  Identity fraud refers to the fraudulent use of  others\u2019 valid documents.", "To determine the efforts that State and USCIS take to assess and  address potential E-2 fraud, we reviewed relevant State and USCIS   standard operating procedures and guidance. We interviewed  headquarters officials from State and USCIS, including those from State\u2019s  Fraud Prevention Program and USCIS\u2019s Fraud Detection and National  Security Directorate, on how both agencies identify and address potential  E-2 fraud and what, if any, coordination or information sharing occurs  between State and USCIS. During our four site visits abroad, we  interviewed officials, such as State\u2019s fraud prevention managers and  assistant regional security officer-investigators (ARSO-I), on anti-fraud  efforts for E-2 visas at their posts, including potential fraud trends.  Similarly, we interviewed immigration officers at USCIS\u2019s California  Service Center on their anti-fraud efforts for E-2 petitions.

Figure 4 shows the  refusal rates by fiscal year for each applicant type, and appendix III  includes additional information on refusal rates for fiscal year 2018.  According to State officials, refusal rates may be higher for investors  because such applicants are typically the first in their company applying  for an E-2 visa; if denied, then future E-2 applicants (e.g., manager or  essential employee) would need to wait until such investor is approved or  find another individual or business investor to form the basis for their E-2  employment status.", "Refusal Reasons.

Our analysis showed that individuals seeking to change to  E-2 status from another nonimmigrant category from fiscal years 2014  through 2018 were most often changing status from a tourist, business, or  student visa, as shown in figure 10. For example, more than half (53  percent) of all petitions to change to E-2 status were for beneficiaries that  were tourists (B-2) or business visitors (B-1). In addition, about 4 percent  of beneficiaries were seeking to change status within the E-2  classification.

LES include foreign service nationals, U.S.  citizens residing abroad, third country  nationals, and eligible family members of  State employees. LES can provide the  institutional knowledge and expertise in E-2  visa issues, as consular officers rotate posts  every 2 years but LES do not rotate. Consular  managers at 4 of the 14 posts we interviewed  or visited stated that their post specifically  hired LES to work on E-2 visas because of  their specialized knowledge and backgrounds  in business or law. For example, a consular  officer may consult with LES on an application  to better understand the legal relationship  between two companies, as some LES have a  background or developed expertise in  financial law.", "Locally Employed Staff (LES) initial processing and  prescreening. In addition to consular officers, State employs local  residents in its host country to help with consular services (see  sidebar). For example, at some posts State\u2019s LES prescreen visa  applications before consular officers adjudicate the application.  Procedures for LES varied at the posts we interviewed and visited.  For example, LES at some posts provide administrative help and  processing\u2014such as scanning application documents, checking  applications for completeness, and scheduling interviews. LES at  other posts provide additional analytical support\u2014such as by  summarizing applications, completing eligibility checklists, and  maintaining databases on previously issued E-2 visas. Regardless of  the kind of help LES may provide at post, only consular officers  adjudicate E-2 visa applications and make decisions on whether or  not the visa is issued. The number of LES supporting E-2 visa  applications at the 14 posts we visited or interviewed ranged from one  part-time position to five full-time LES. Consular managers and  officers at all four of the posts we visited described the role of LES in  processing E-2 visas as critical (see sidebar). Although USCIS\u2019  California Service Center has staff who assist with processing  petitions, such as by organizing folders with the petition materials,  immigration officers generally perform the analytical tasks themselves.", "Staffing model. Depending on E-2 visa application volume, staffing  considerations, and workload arrangements, the number of consular  officers adjudicating E-2 visas at the 14 posts abroad we interviewed  ranged from one to six per post. Further, on the basis of our  observations and interviews with consular officials at 14 posts, we  found that State\u2019s posts have generally developed three different  staffing models for adjudicating E-2 visa applications, as shown in  table 6. Consular managers stated that the kind of model used at a  post may depend on E-2 visa volume, as well as other factors. For  example, a consular manager at a post we visited explained that the  specialist model worked well at his post because it had a relatively low  volume of E-2 adjudications each year, which meant that a single  officer could focus on such visas. In contrast, a consular manager at a  post we visited that was staffed with a hybrid of generalists and  specialists had higher E-2 visa volume and stated that their model  allowed them to balance efficiency and specialization. For USCIS, a  specialized office of five immigration officers review and adjudicate all  E-petitions (including E-1 and E-2) at one location \u2013USCIS\u2019 California  Service Center, as of July 2018.", "Training. State and USCIS provide training to their respective E-2  processing and adjudication staff on E-2 eligibility requirements. State\u2019s  consular officers assigned to adjudicate E-2 visas receive the majority of  their adjudication training at post, with a brief introduction to E-2 visas  during a mandatory 6-week Foreign Service Institute training course  taken prior to serving as a consular officer overseas. According to Foreign  Service Institute officials, the course provides consular officers with an  overview of the various visa classes they may adjudicate, but focuses on  visas that all consular officers will address at post. Because E-2 visas are  not adjudicated at every post, and consular officers typically cannot  specialize in only one particular classification like USCIS counterparts  who have a dedicated E-2 unit, the course does not concentrate on that  visa classification. Instead, State relies on the individual posts to provide  training to prepare consular officers to adjudicate E-2 visas on an \u201cas  needed\u201d basis.", "On the basis of our interviews and observations, we found that E-2  training programs for consular officers at post generally consist of three  components. First, consular managers and senior consular officers at  post provide the consular officer who will be adjudicating E-2 visa  applications for the first time with an overview of the E-2 eligibility  requirements along with any supplementary E-2 training resources, such  as illustrative examples of challenging E-2 visa cases the post has  previously adjudicated. Second, new consular officers are to observe  senior consular officers adjudicate E-2 visas for 1 to 3 weeks, which helps  the new officer to learn how the requirements are applied. Finally, new  officers adjudicate E-2 visas under the supervision of a senior consular  officer with experience adjudicating E-2 visa applications, with 100  percent of their adjudications reviewed by consular managers until  management determines that the new officer is proficient. As needed,  supervisors will meet with new officers to discuss specific adjudications,  including whether the officer properly documented their decision.", "State\u2019s E-2 training for LES is entirely at post. According to consular  managers and LES, LES training generally consists of a review of  eligibility requirements and supervision. First, new LES assigned to E-2  visa processing and prescreening receive an overview of the E-2 eligibility  requirements from a senior LES. According to LES we interviewed, the  overview of the eligibility requirements helps them to identify the types of  documents E-2 applicants typically submit to establish E-2 eligibility.  Second, new LES are observed by senior LES until management  determines that the LES is proficient at processing and prescreening.", "As noted above, USCIS has staff dedicated to E-2 petitions and USCIS  provides training to new E-2 immigration officers that include the same  basic components as State, such as a review of eligibility requirements  and job shadowing. First, immigration officers who will work on E-2  adjudications receive 3 weeks of classroom training during which they  review the E-2 eligibility requirements. The classroom training is followed  by a 1-week practicum session where USCIS immigration officers apply  the classroom training to sample E-2 petitions. Specifically, immigration  officers explained to us that during the practicum they are given example  cases to which they are to apply their classroom training. After each  officer has adjudicated the example case, they discuss how each applied  the various E-2 eligibility requirements and reconcile any differences with  the assistance of the immigration supervisor facilitating the training.  Second, after the 4 weeks of training, USCIS immigration officers begin to  adjudicate E-2 petitions under the guidance of an E-2 immigration  supervisor.

Specifically, consular officers at 10 of 14 posts we interviewed stated that  E-2 visas are among the most difficult nonimmigrant visas to adjudicate  because of the amount of supporting documentation that is required to  demonstrate that both the business and applicant meet all eligibility  requirements, as well as the time required to prescreen and adjudicate  the application package. For example, E-2 application packages can  include 200 pages or more of supporting documentation, and include a  range of detailed business and financial documents (see sidebar).  Further, consular officers told us that it can take between 45 minutes to 4  hours to review a single E-2 application with its supporting documents.  Consular officers explained that, in contrast, other nonimmigrant visa  categories do not require the same amount of time or number of  documents to adjudicate. For example, business and tourism  nonimmigrant visas typically take less than 10 minutes to adjudicate and  do not require that any documentation be submitted by the applicant prior  to the adjudication.", "Consular officers at the 14 posts we visited or interviewed identified  challenges with respect to the analysis of the E-2 eligibility requirements.

Sufficient to ensure the investor\u2019s financial  commitment to the successful operation of the  business.  Large enough to ensure the likelihood of  success of the business.", "Determining substantial investment. Consular officers at 10 of 14  posts indicated that it can be challenging to determine substantiality of  capital investment amounts. According to the FAM, there is no set  amount of capital which is considered substantial; instead, various  factors must be considered to ensure there is a large enough  investment to support the business. Consular officers noted that it can  be difficult to determine how much capital is needed to support the  many types of businesses that consular officers see in E-2  applications, which can range from small restaurants to technology  start-ups to large automobile manufacturers. For example, a consular  officer may be presented with an application for an investor seeking  an E-2 visa to open a business that the consular officer has never  seen before in an E-2 visa application, such as an airport internet caf\u00e9  that rents hourly sleeping pods to travelers on long layovers. The  consular officer may be initially unfamiliar with what is considered to  be a more unique type of business, and may not know immediately  how much investment would be sufficient to ensure the successful  operation of the business. In such cases, the officer might gather  additional information from the applicant on similar businesses, which  the officer could use to inform their determination as to the amount of  capital that would be needed to support successful operation of the  business in the United States.", "Real and operating business requirement:   The business is a real and active commercial  or entrepreneurial undertaking that produces  goods (i.e. commodities) or services for profit,  and meets applicable legal requirements for  doing business in the particular jurisdiction of  the United States.", "Determining real and operating business. Consular officers at 7 of  14 posts indicated that it can be challenging to determine whether the  business is real and operating. Consular officers explained that  particularly difficult issues may arise for new businesses, which may  not be operational yet at the time of the interview. Consular officers  stated that it can be very clear when a business is not yet operating,  but that additional analysis is required for newly-formed businesses  that do not yet have customers or revenue but may have taken other  actions to start the business. Consular officers at one post explained it  is sometimes very clear that a business is not operating because, for  example, the business has not yet made any contracts with clients,  does not have a website advertising its services, and has no evidence  of any expenses made on behalf of the business. As for newly-formed  businesses, consular officers at another post we visited provided a  hypothetical example of a restaurant whose owner had a lease for the  restaurant space, bought equipment, and hired employees, but had  not opened to customers yet because it was waiting for the chef to  receive an E-2 visa as an essential employee. The officers indicated  that in such a hypothetical scenario in which a business\u2019s qualification  as an E-2 business depends on E-2 visa issuance of a key worker, it  may not be immediately clear without further analysis, whether such  business would be considered real and operating.", "Manager requirement:   The individual is an employee in an executive  or supervisory position.", "Determining manager qualifications. Consular officers at 6 of 14  posts indicated that it can be challenging to determine whether a  prospective manager had or will have sufficient executive or  supervisory duties to meet the E-2 managerial requirement. Consular  officers provided a hypothetical example in which a consular officer  may interview an applicant seeking an E-2 visa to become a manager  at a restaurant, but the applicant may not have any prior management  experience nor will she have any subordinates in the restaurant. Such  a situation may pose challenges to the consular officer to determine if  the applicant would be eligible for an E-2 visa as a manager. Officers  noted that the FAM requirements did not specifically state that the  applicant must have prior experience or subordinates to qualify as a  manager. In such situations, consular officers said they might  request additional information from the applicant about the restaurant,  her skills and experience, and the nature of her managerial role in the  business.", "Essential employee requirement:   The individual is employed in a lesser  capacity than a manager, but possesses  special qualifications (i.e. skills and/or  aptitudes) essential to the business\u2019  successful or efficient operations in the United  States.", "Determining essential employee qualifications. Consular officers  at 6 of 14 posts indicated that it can be challenging to determine  whether a prospective essential employee has special qualifications  (i.e. essential skills or aptitudes). Consular officers noted that they can  ask questions and obtain information about the applicant\u2019s specialized  skills, but that often further research is needed to determine if those  skills are essential to the business\u2019 operations in the United States.  For example, an officer at one post we interviewed provided a  hypothetical example of a pet groomer seeking an E-2 visa as an  essential employee for a pet grooming service. Although one might be  skeptical that pet grooming is a specialized skill and that such an  employee would be considered essential, in such a situation, the  officer noted that he would likely conduct further research. In doing so,  he might determine that the applicant is a well-known expert who  specializes in grooming certain breeds of exotic or show animals, and  that the grooming service is planning to target that type of animal.", "Other requirements. Consular officers told us that some of the other  E-2 eligibility requirements are not particularly challenging. For  example, consular officers at all 14 posts told us that it is relatively  straightforward to determine if the applicant has a clear intent to  depart the United States upon termination of E-2 status because  applicants typically provide an affidavit attesting to their nonimmigrant  intent. Further, consular officers stated that it is easy to determine if  the applicant is an eligible dependent because consular officers are  familiar with local identity information (e.g., birth and marriage  certificates) and there are no nationality requirements for dependents.", "In addition to potential challenges with respect to the analysis of the  eligibility requirements, consular officers at 4 of 14 posts also identified  challenges in understanding business and financial documents that are  provided in support of an E-2 application. For example, at one post we  visited, a consular officer explained the challenges he faced in  understanding U.S. tax documentation and the differences between  various types of corporations. Further, consular managers at two posts  stated that officers without prior knowledge in basic business concepts  can find E-2 visa adjudication challenging when they first arrive at post. A  manager from a third post stated that the complexity of some E-2 visa  cases requires knowledge of business and finance acquired through  substantial experience or education.", "More than marginal business requirement:   The investment must be made in a business  that has the capacity to generate more than  enough income to provide a minimal living for  the treaty investor or employee and family, or  has the present or future capacity (generally  within five years) to make a significant  economic contribution.", "Although LES do not adjudicate visas, LES at 6 of 14 posts also indicated  that they had encountered challenges with respect to the analysis of the  E-2 eligibility requirements. For example, LES at one post indicated that it  can be challenging to determine whether a company is more than  marginal (see sidebar) because the size, type or investment sector of  each E-2 company presents unique facts and circumstances. LES at one  post told us that they needed additional examples of how applicants can  meet the various criteria, which would help the LES flag potential areas of  concern for the consular officer. Further, LES also expressed challenges  in understanding some business and financial aspects of prescreening.  For example, LES at two posts stated that determining the nationality of  large companies can be difficult because they need to trace back  ownership to the original, parent company, and that corporate structures  can be very complicated.", "Given the complexity of adjudicating E-2 visas, the majority of consular  officers and consular managers we spoke with stated that additional  training and resources would be beneficial, such as online training,  conferences to share best practices, or documents clarifying eligibility  requirements. Specifically, consular officers at 9 of 14 posts and consular  managers at 8 of the 14 posts stated that additional E-2 training or  resources would be beneficial to consular officers. For example, a  consular manager at one post noted that the additional resources  provided on State\u2019s intranet, such as the adjudication guide and case  studies, have already helped to improve clarity on the eligibility  requirements, but more resources and training are needed. Further,  consular managers at 4 posts stated that additional training related to tax  and business concepts would be useful. For example, one manager  stated that additional training on how to read and analyze U.S. tax returns  could be helpful to accurately evaluate a company\u2019s overall financial  health and make a determination that a business meets the requirement  to be \u201cmore than marginal.\u201d", "Further, LES at all 14 posts in our review also stated that additional  training or resources would help them perform their responsibilities.

Further, consular managers at 9 of the 14 posts in our review also stated  that additional training and guidance for LES would be helpful. For  example, one consular manager suggested that State develop an online  training course for both E-2 adjudicating officers and LES that reviews  common business documents. Another manager stated that a training or  workshop would provide opportunities to LES and E-2 adjudicating  officers to learn best practices from other posts that adjudicate E-2 visas.", "Although State provides guidance and training on adjudicating E-2 visas,  consular officers, managers, and LES identified challenges in the E-2  adjudication process, such as ensuring adjudicators adequately  understand supporting financial and business documents.

State officials noted that eligibility requirements are  broadly defined so as to cover various business types and investment  amounts. According to the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, management establishes expectations of competence for  key roles to help the entity achieve its objectives, which requires that staff  have the relevant knowledge, skills, and abilities, needed to carry out their  responsibility. Such knowledge, skills, and abilities can be obtained by  on-the-job training, formal training, and other training resources, which  should be available to all staff performing such roles, regardless of their  post. Providing additional E-2 training or related resources would help  better ensure that all consular officers and LES prescreening and  adjudicating these visas have the necessary knowledge, skills, and  abilities to carry out their responsibilities effectively.

Further, immigration officers noted that the non-marginality eligibility  requirement can be difficult to determine in some cases because the  officer may have to project how successful the business will be in the  future. However, the immigration officers explained that their colocation  with all of the other immigration officers who adjudicate E-2 petitions  helps to mitigate the challenges because the officers can coordinate with  each other to determine how USCIS has typically adjudicated such cases.

According to the post\u2019s fraud team, the study showed that even  prospective E-2 visa enterprises that meet the applicable  requirements at the time of application can become unqualified over  time, and that adjudicators should take long-term viability into account  when determining the marginality of a business. The post\u2019s fraud team  also stated that other posts may wish to consider standardized follow- ups for approved E-2 enterprises and routine confirmations of vetted  E companies as the E-2 visa category continues to grow in  popularity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USCIS Has Identified E-2 Fraud as a Priority and Is Analyzing Its Fraud Risk in a Pilot Project", "paragraphs": ["USCIS officials stated they consider E-2 fraud to be a significant issue  and take several steps to identify fraud, including fraud referrals, fraud  assessment technology, and site visits. First, according to USCIS  officials, immigration officers reviewing the E-2 petition look for anomalies  and other indicators of fraud and send a fraud referral for any potential  fraud cases by forwarding the case to the service center\u2019s fraud detection  office. Immigration officers in the fraud detection office then are to  conduct further research, such as reviewing open sources (e.g., company  website) or may request a site visit to the business.", "Second, USCIS uses a fraud assessment technology on all petitions to  determine if an E-2 company exists and is financially viable. Specifically,  the Validation Instrument for Business Enterprises (VIBE) is a technology  that helps immigration officers to determine if a business is operating,  financially strong and viable, has good credit, and has not been involved  in past fraud. According to USCIS officials, VIBE reviews existing  business-related information on an enterprise, such as an office supply  store account or utility bills, to determine if it is real and operating.", "Finally, immigration officers may request site visits based on their review  of the application or VIBE results. During such site visits, immigration  officers visit the business location to determine if the business is  performing as stated in the petition and in compliance with the E-2 visa  eligibility requirements. The results of the site visit are sent back to the  originating location for adjudication. According to USCIS officials, if a  larger conspiracy is uncovered, such as fraud involving multiple  beneficiaries, the immigration officer may make a referral to U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement for further criminal investigation  and potential prosecution, but added that this is very rare.", "USCIS immigration officers made 252 requests for site visits based on  VIBE results from fiscal year 2014 through 2018 for E-2s. Of these site  visits, USCIS determined there was confirmed fraud for 25 percent (63),  as shown in figure 16. Of the 63 confirmed fraud cases, 42 enterprises  were not located at the site provided in the petition and 14 enterprises  had provided fraudulent documents or otherwise mispresented the  facts. For example, in one case, the beneficiary paid a dental laboratory  to assign her in a fictitious position of office manager so that she could  obtain E-2 status, but the beneficiary had never worked there. In another  example, an investor seeking E-2 status in May 2015 submitted a petition  based on a discount store that had gone out of business in January 2013.  According to USCIS officials, when fraud is confirmed, the immigration  officer will deny the petition, review any pending or previously approved  petitions from the petitioner, and fraud finding will be entered into VIBE,  which affects the applicant\u2019s ability to obtain future immigration benefits,  including visa application or petition approvals from the United States  government.", "State consular officers can also request that USCIS conduct site visits to  help in its adjudication of E-2 visa applications, but USCIS data indicate  that such requests are rare. According to USCIS, the agency received 10  external site visit requests from State from fiscal years 2014 through  2018. Of the 10 requests, USCIS conducted site visits to seven  businesses and found one incidence of fraud involving a restaurant.", "According to State officials, site visits are considered to be resource  intensive for the USCIS and can take several weeks or months to  complete. The officials added that if a consular officer determines that an  applicant is unqualified for the visa, it would not be considered an  effective use of the post\u2019s resources to conduct additional investigations  or request a U.S.-based site visit from USCIS.", "Based on the results of the site visits and other factors, USCIS officials  stated that they have prioritized E-2 fraud, and initiated a site visit pilot  program in February 2018 to better determine the extent to which fraud  exists. This pilot program focuses on businesses associated with  individuals approved for an E-2 status extension and certain eligibility  criteria. According to USCIS officials in July 2019, the most commonly  encountered fraud or noncompliance issues thus far have involved  enterprises that were not operational, not engaged in any business  activities, or were not operating as stated in the petition. USCIS plans to  continue the E-2 pilot into fiscal year 2020 and to share the results with  State."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State and USCIS Efforts to Coordinate E-2 Anti-Fraud Activities Are Limited", "paragraphs": ["State\u2019s and USCIS\u2019s respective roles in the E-2 process, along with a  current lack of coordination on E-2 anti-fraud efforts, may contribute to the  differences in the way the agencies view and prioritize the risks of E-2  fraud. Drawing on the results of its site visit pilot project, USCIS has  said it views E-2 fraud as a significant issue and plans to prioritize efforts  to combat E-2 fraud moving forward. While State has taken some steps to  examine and combat E-2 visa fraud, officials we spoke with at posts and  at headquarters told us that E-2 fraud is rare and generally low risk. The  E-2 validation study that one post conducted, noted earlier, also provided  evidence that E-2 fraud occurred, at least in that business sector from  that particular country. While it is possible that additional validation  studies across different posts and business sectors would uncover fraud  trends, State officials noted that validation studies are resource intensive,  and that E-2 visas represent only a small fraction of the total visas they  adjudicate each year. Therefore, State officials stated that such studies  are likely to be focused on more common visa types, such as tourist and  business visitor visas.", "Although some factors may explain why USCIS and State view the risk of  E-2 fraud differently, both agencies encounter foreign nationals seeking  the E-2 status in the United States. Officials from both agencies stated  that USCIS may be more likely to uncover fraud than State because  USCIS processes E-2 status extensions for individuals already in the  United States. E-2 principals (i.e., investors, managers, and essential  employees) would have had up to 2 years to try to run, manage, or work  for their business, with the intention to depart at the conclusion of their  authorized period of stay. If they failed, gave up, or ended employment,  but still sought an E-2 status extension, any materially false  representations made as to their eligibility could be considered fraudulent.  Officials from both agencies suggested that State may be adjudicating  visas for more new businesses, which may qualify at the time of initial  adjudication but could ultimately fail. However, during our observations  and file reviews, we found that USCIS also adjudicates petitions for new  businesses for beneficiaries seeking to change to E-2 status, and State  also adjudicates E-2 visa applications for existing businesses that have  previously been associated with E-2 visa holders. Further, neither State  nor USCIS collect data that track the number of new businesses seeking  E-2 status for their employees. As such, we cannot verify the accuracy of  this reason for explaining why or if USCIS is more likely to encounter  fraud among individuals seeking E-2 status than State.", "Both State and USCIS collect information that could potentially be useful  to each other\u2019s activities to identify and address E-2 fraud, but the  agencies do not have a mechanism for regular coordination on fraud. For  example, as previously noted, consular officers adjudicating E-2 visas  overseas learn to identify country-based fraud trends as well as trends  specific to E-2 visas. USCIS immigration officers can identify similar  trends, and the results of USCIS\u2019s site visits may further identify potential  fraud trends that would be useful for State consular officers.", "However, interagency coordination is ad hoc, generally among  headquarters officials only, and relatively rare. For example, both State  and USCIS officials stated that the main formal mechanism of  coordination on all E-2 visa issues is a quarterly teleconference.  However, such meetings were cancelled 7 out of 8 times in fiscal years  2017 and 2018 because officials did not identify agenda topics to discuss,  according to State and USCIS officials. Further, such meetings have not  included discussions of E-2 fraud issues. State officials stated that they  share country fraud summaries with USCIS. However, these fraud  summaries do not focus on E-2 visas, but fraud trends more generally.", "According to A Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal  Programs, agencies should establish collaborative relationships with  stakeholders to share information on fraud risks and emerging fraud  schemes, as well as lessons learned related to fraud control activities.  Managers can collaborate and communicate through a variety of means,  including task forces, working groups, or communities of practice.  Although State and USCIS have some informal mechanisms in place to  share fraud-related information, such as emails among headquarters  officials and by sharing high-level country fraud reports, formal  information sharing mechanisms have not been regularly operating.  Although the two entities view the risk of E-2 fraud visa differently, both  State\u2019s and USCIS\u2019 E-2 antifraud efforts would benefit from ensuring that  they regularly share information on fraud risks. Doing so will help both  entities to better identify emerging fraud trends, prevent foreign nationals  from fraudulently obtaining E-2 status, and identify areas for potential  collaboration and resource sharing."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The E-2 nonimmigrant classification helps to facilitate foreign investment  in the United States, which contributes to the U.S. economy each year.  State and USCIS share the responsibility for adjudicating thousands of E- 2 visa applications and petitions annually for foreign nationals seeking E- 2 status. Both State and USCIS officials stated that given the complexity  of adjudicating E-2 applications and petitions, and the level of  documentation and time required, the E-2 adjudication process can  present challenges with respect to the analysis of E-2 eligibility  requirements. State consular officers, managers, and LES noted that  additional training and resources are needed to help them better  understand the eligibility requirements and supporting financial and  business documents. Enhancing E-2 training and providing additional  resources such as documents clarifying E-2 eligibility requirements would  help better ensure that consular officers and LES prescreening and  adjudicating these visas have the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities to carry out their responsibilities effectively across posts  worldwide.", "Additionally, some overseas State posts have developed E-2 company  registration programs to more efficiently process and adjudicate E-2 visa  applications. Although there are benefits to such programs, the variation  in the standards of these programs may result in different processing of  companies and applicants across posts, as well as acceptance of varying  levels of risk by posts. Establishing guidance or minimum standards for  posts that choose to implement such programs would better ensure that  all posts\u2019 E-2 visa adjudication processes are consistent with State\u2019s  policies, objectives, and risk tolerance. Further, State and USCIS require  certain information and documents be retained for all E-2 applications and  petitions; however, during our file review of State and USCIS E-2  adjudications, we identified that some required documents were missing  from State files. Ensuring that posts retain all required E-2 documentation  would better position State to be able access applicant information, which  could be needed for law enforcement, anti-fraud, or security purposes  later. Finally, although State and USCIS collect information that could  potentially be useful to each other\u2019s activities to address E-2 fraud,  coordination between State and USCIS on E-2 fraud has been ad hoc,  generally among headquarters officials only, and relatively rare.

To collect information from the applications  and petitions, we created a data collection instrument and established  standard procedures to ensure that we accurately collected the  information from the original forms. We chose sample sizes to achieve  precision levels for a percentage estimate of plus or minus 10 percentage  points for important sub-populations, such as denied petitions and role  (e.g., investor, manager, and essential employee).
