For example, U.S. data for 2010\u2014the most recent available\u2014show that the United States reported $837 billion in GPA-covered procurement. This amount is about twice as large as the approximately $381 billion reported by the next five largest GPA parties\u2014the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Norway, and Canada\u2014combined, even though total U.S. procurement is less than that of the other five parties combined. (See figure.)", "Deficiencies in the statistical reporting of government procurement by GPA and U.S. free trade agreement (FTA) parties, including the United States, limit detailed comparisons as well as transparency\u2014one of the GPA's stated goals. For example, the GPA parties' reports that GAO reviewed were not always submitted on time and often lacked certain required data. Also, a lack of common understanding of key terms' definitions led to inconsistencies in GPA parties' reporting. Moreover, while parties to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are required to exchange government procurement data annually, NAFTA's parties have not done so since 2005; other U.S. FTAs GAO reviewed do not require reporting of government procurement data. As a result, policymakers and others have limited information with which to monitor the agreements or assess their financial benefits.", "The U.S. approach to statistical reporting of GPA-covered government procurement to the WTO does not ensure the data's timeliness, accuracy, and comparability. For instance, while a recent revision of the methodology for calculating covered U.S. federal procurement improves accuracy, it creates a 6-year reporting delay. In contrast, the GPA requires the reporting of annual procurement statistics within 2 years. In addition, U.S. agencies have not developed a methodology for reporting states' covered government procurement, as the GPA requires. Instead, the United States reports total state-level procurement, which GAO estimated may exceed covered procurement by about 10 percent. Further, the expertise needed to report government procurement data to the WTO is fragmented among the four agencies involved, leading to inconsistencies, errors, and deficiencies. Federal standards for internal control call for U.S. agencies to issue relevant, accurate, and reliable information within a time frame that enables entities to carry out their responsibilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making six recommendations to USTR to improve statistical reporting of government procurement under the GPA and U.S. FTAs, including working with GPA parties to enhance their reporting, resuming the required data exchange with NAFTA parties, improving U.S. federal and state procurement data reported to the WTO, and ensuring that U.S. statistical notifications to the WTO are well documented and reviewed for accuracy.

Although we conducted consistency checks across time  periods, we were not able to otherwise assess the comprehensiveness  and accuracy of the data that other parties reported to the WTO under the  GPA; alternative data sources were not available for these parties. In  addressing our second and third objectives, we considered the effects of  a number of data limitations that we identified on precise measurement  and analysis of differences in the parties\u2019 covered government  procurement under trade agreements as well as on analysis of covered  government procurement over time. We determined that although these  limitations affected our ability to perform certain detailed analyses, such  as disaggregation of covered government procurement by type and trend  analysis over a period of time, they were not an impediment to using the  data for broad comparisons of orders of magnitude of covered  government procurement.", "To address all three objectives, we interviewed U.S. agency officials in  Washington, D.C., from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB),  the General Services Administration (GSA), USTR, and the Department  of Commerce (Commerce).

For example, because parties negotiate coverage, the percentage value  depends on (1) the value of actual individual procurements vis-\u00e0-vis the  set threshold levels, (2) the list of covered entities and covered types of  government procurement in parties\u2019 GPA commitments, and (3)  exclusions from coverage. Many EU member states, as well as Japan and South Korea, have actual government expenditures smaller than the  United States\u2019 and are therefore likely to have more smaller-value  individual procurement contracts that fall below the GPA threshold levels.  There is also variance in parties\u2019 commitments in terms of covered  entities. For example, Canada, the EU, Japan, Norway, and South Korea  use a positive list approach for designating covered services\u2014that is,  listing only the services covered by the GPA\u2014while the United States  uses a negative list approach\u2014that is, listing only services by a covered  entity meeting the procurement threshold that are not covered by the  agreement. According to Commerce officials, a negative list approach  provides more liberal coverage than a positive list approach because it is  not an exhaustive list and allows for coverage of new services. Moreover,  our analysis of EU-reported data found that over 80 percent of EU total  government procurement is not covered by the EU commitments.  Procurements can fall outside EU commitments if they are below  threshold or for other reasons, such as when they are specifically  excluded.

Our review of the statistical  notifications submitted by the United States and next five largest GPA  parties found a number of inconsistencies. For example, Canada  switched its reporting from fiscal to calendar year in 2010, making it  more difficult to compare Canada\u2019s data over time. Japan  denominates central government procurement in SDR and subcentral  government procurement in yen, but its statistical notifications do not  provide a conversion rate. Norway reports three estimates of covered  government procurement, which are disaggregated by different  characteristics, but none of the estimated totals match the others. The  United States provided data on federal procurement for 2008, 2009,  and 2010, but the U.S. data on overall and covered federal  procurement in 2008 and 2009 are inconsistent because of a change  in the reporting methodology that began with the 2009 notification.", "Figure 4 shows the deficiencies and other issues that we identified in the  United States and next five largest GPA parties\u2019 statistical reporting."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Common Understanding of Definitions of Key Terms Is Lacking among GPA Parties", "paragraphs": ["We found several areas where there was a lack of common  understanding about the definition of key terms for reporting procurement  data required by the GPA.

According to WTO officials, there is no  official definition of government procurement; as a result, GPA parties  lack a clear, common understanding or practice for computing its  value. Our review of statistical data submitted by the United States  and the next five largest GPA parties for 2010 found that they  generally measured procurement by the total value of contracts  awarded or by actual expenditures on goods and services in a given  time frame. However, we found that the reported contract values  represented different measures of procurement at different points in  time, which resulted in inconsistent reporting. For example, Canada  and Japan report data on government procurement based on the full  value of awarded contracts, the EU reports data on government  procurement based on total contract values at the time of award,  Norway reports the agreed full value of contracts when they are  signed, and the United States reports the total dollars obligated  against GPA-covered contracts in the year they are signed and any  subsequent obligations on those contracts during the following 5  years. In addition, while the GPA outlines the scope of covered  government procurement, our analysis found that GPA parties  interpreted standard statistical terms differently, leading to  inconsistencies in their reporting. For example, the degree to which  the GPA parties\u2019 notifications include data on procurement by state- owned enterprises is unclear. As a result, the parties\u2019 notifications  may provide different measures of covered government procurement.", "Below-threshold central government procurement. While the 1994  GPA requires that parties report the estimated value of below- threshold contracts awarded at the central government level, GPA  parties interpreted this requirement differently, leading to  inconsistencies in their reporting. We found that GPA parties  reported different types of data for below-threshold central  government procurement\u2014some parties reported data for all central  government entities, while other parties reported data only for entities  covered by the GPA. For example, the EU does not report the value  of contracts below the GPA thresholds. Instead, according to the EU  notification, these values can be estimated by deducting the reported  above-threshold procurement from the estimated total government  procurement of goods and services, which also includes procurement  below GPA thresholds and other noncovered government  procurement. In contrast, the United States reports below-threshold  central government procurement only for GPA-covered entities. As a  result, estimates of GPA parties\u2019 below-threshold central government  procurement are not comparable.", "Uniform classification system. There is no single classification  system for reporting procurement by economic sector, which has led  to the use of different systems to categorize reported procurement by  GPA parties. For example, the United States uses the U.S. product  and service codes to classify federal government contracts in product  groups, categorizing reported procurement as either goods and  services or construction services. The EU uses its common  procurement vocabulary to classify EU contracts, categorizing  reported procurement as supplies, services, works, or  \u201cmiscellaneous.\u201d Canada codes reported procurement by its goods  and services identification numbers and groups it into goods, services,  and construction, but plans to replace the current classification with  the UN standard products and services codes in 2017. Without  consistent categorization, it is difficult to compare parties\u2019 covered  government procurement by product group.", "Country of origin. According to the 1994 GPA, parties are to apply  the same rules of origin to products or services supplied for covered  government procurements as they apply in the normal course of  trade. In addition, parties are to provide statistics on the country of  origin for products and services purchased by its entities, to the extent  that such information is available. Japan reports suppliers\u2019  nationality, using it as the basis for determining country of origin for its imported goods and services, but a supplier\u2019s nationality may differ  from the origin of the product or service. The EU, Canada, South  Korea, and the United States do not report this information, although  the United States collects it in its Trade Agreements Report (TAR),  which USTR uses to generate the WTO notifications at the federal  level. Until 2008, in its TAR reporting, the United States defined  country of origin for goods as the place where the product was  manufactured, which, according to OMB officials, aligns with data on  place of manufacture, as defined in the FAR, for purposes of U.S.  government contracting. However, since 2009, U.S. statistical data\u2014 the source of U.S. procurement information reported to the WTO\u2014 have defined country of origin for goods as the place of performance  of the contract and have defined country of origin for services as the  country of the supplier (vendor).

This methodology, which calculated the total  potential value of GPA-covered federal government contracts at the time  of award, provided a simple and direct measure of covered federal  procurement, since the method used to determine the number of covered  contracts and determine the contracts comprising the aggregate contract  values is based on information reported in in FPDS-NG. The methodology  also provided timely annual data based on the bidding opportunities for  prospective domestic and foreign suppliers in that year. (After a contract  is awarded, contract changes may occur, and additional funds may be  obligated to the contract, which would change the contract value.) In  addition, the methodology provided data that were consistent with  information posted on the official U.S. government website of federal  procurement opportunities for GPA purposes.", "However, the original methodology overstated the value of U.S. central  government procurement, primarily because of the way data is reported in  FPDS-NG and by aggregating multiple-year, multiple-award federal  contracts, which resulted in the counting of some award values more than  once. Multiple-award contracts result from a single solicitation and are  awarded to multiple suppliers. The government then selects among the  multiple suppliers to issue individual orders for supplies, services, or both  as needed. Federal contracts, including, multiple-award contracts, can  include options that the government may, or may not, exercise; contracts  with options are often referred to as multiple-year contracts and,  according to OMB staff, generally include a base year with four 1-year  option periods. In FPDS-NG, data on each supplier\u2019s multiple-year,  multiple-award contract reflects the base and all option value, since each  supplier could receive up to the full value of the contract if all options are  exercised.", "For example, a contract for which FPDS-NG shows an award value of  $10 billion, comprising a base value of $5 billion and a $5 billion option,  might result in only $5 billion in obligations if the option is not exercised.  In addition, the contract\u2019s $10 billion award value might be entered in  FPDS-NG for each supplier that is awarded a multiple-award contract,  since each supplier could receive up to the full value of the contract, and  could be entered for each year of the contract\u2019s duration. The original  methodology reported a multiple-year contract\u2019s potential award value\u2014 that is, the contract value including all possible options that could be  exercised against the contract\u2014and aggregated across multiple-award  contracts, even though the options may not be exercised on each  supplier\u2019s contract. Commerce officials explained that contract options  allow for additional purchases under the same contract at the discretion of  the U.S. government entity. For example, Commerce officials told us that  because multiple-year, multiple-award contracts are intended to be used  as needed, contracting officials may set a high total award value for a  group of contracts to allow the contracts to be used repeatedly and to  ensure that there are sufficient funds to pay any awardee for each  contract option.", "According to Commerce officials, they sought to improve the accuracy of  WTO notifications based on the award-value methodology. These officials  said they recognized that the data anomalies in FPDS-NG related to  multiple-year, multiple-award federal contracts materially skewed the  overall statistics and, as a result, cumulatively misrepresented the total  value of U.S. federal procurement for 2008. Because FPDS-NG records  hundreds of thousands of contracts across many agencies, Commerce  did not identify all multiple-year, multiple-award federal contracts. Instead,  Commerce identified three Department of Defense entities that frequently  used this type of contract and two blanket purchasing agreements  reported by the Department of Interior Bureau of Land Management and  deleted these contracts from the FPDS-NG TAR data they used to draft  U.S. notification. However, this approach resulted in inconsistent  treatment of multiple-award contracts with other agencies and also  needlessly excluded all other contracts.", "Using the TAR, we searched FPDS-NG for, and identified, all GPA- covered multiple-year, multiple-award federal contracts awarded in fiscal  year 2009. Our analysis shows that these contracts\u2014which were the  main cause of the original methodology\u2019s inflated estimates of covered  federal procurement\u2014accounted for 12 percent of all covered federal  contracts awarded in fiscal year 2009 (3,637 of 30,243 contracts).

In October 2015, USTR notified the WTO that the  United States had revised its methodology for preparing GPA statistical  reports on federal procurement. To more precisely reflect the value of the  federal procurement market at the time of each report, the revised  methodology would reflect total amounts obligated under GPA-covered  contracts over a 6-year period\u2013that is, the year the contract was awarded  plus 5 years after the award. As a result, the United States did not report  procurement data to the WTO for 5 years, despite the 1994 GPA  requirement to report annual statistics. In December 2015, the United  States submitted its statistical notification of U.S. federal procurement in  fiscal year 2009, based on the revised methodology.", "Our analysis shows that compared with the original methodology, the  revised methodology has both advantages and disadvantages. The  revised methodology provides a more accurate estimate of federal  procurement value than the original methodology, as it uses data for  actual obligations for procurement contracts rather than potential award  values and avoids the inflated values resulting from the aggregation of  multiple-year, multiple-award federal contracts. Because of the change in  methodology, the estimated value of covered central government  contracts in the United States decreased by more than 70 percent from  fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2009, dropping from about $712 billion in  fiscal year 2008 to $204 billion in fiscal year 2009.", "However, the revised methodology\u2019s use of cumulative obligations data  leads to a more than 6-year lag in reporting annual data to the WTO. If  this methodology is used to report data for fiscal year 2014 and  subsequent years, the resulting delay would appear to be inconsistent  with the 2014 GPA\u2019s requirement that parties provide their statistical  notifications within 2 years of the end of the reporting period. The delay  would also reduce the transparency of U.S. covered government  procurement for U.S. policymakers and GPA parties. In addition, it is  inconsistent with federal standards for internal control that call for U.S.  agencies to issue relevant, accurate, and reliable information and to  record and communicate the information within a time frame that enables  entities to carry out their responsibilities. Finally, in measuring actual  obligations for procurement contracts rather than the value at the time of  award, the new methodology is inconsistent with the methodology used  by other large GPA members, such as the EU and Norway, which report  contract values at the time of award rather than actual obligations (or  expenditures). As a result, the revised methodology makes comparisons  of the United States\u2019 and other GPA parties\u2019 central government  procurement less consistent. In addition, the United States continues to  report the number of covered contracts to the WTO based on their award  value, which leads to an inconsistency between the reported numbers  and values of reported U.S. government procurement contracts. The  contracts comprising the reported value of covered (above-threshold)  procurement are determined at a later time under the new methodology  and can result in a different set of contracts. Table 2 shows advantages  and disadvantages of the original and revised methodologies.", "Our analysis also found that, despite using 6 years of data, the revised  methodology does not produce final obligated contract values, because it  does not capture obligations that can occur after the 6-year period.  Since the 2014 GPA requires parties to provide their annual statistical  notifications within 2 years of the end of the reporting period, we analyzed  the distribution of cumulative obligations. As table 3 shows, a preliminary  estimate of 3 years of cumulative obligations for contracts awarded in  fiscal year 2009, consistent with the 2014 GPA\u2019s requirement to report  annual statistics within 2 years of the end of the reporting period\u2014that is,  obligations in fiscal years 2009 through 2011\u2014covered about 67 percent  of cumulative obligations through July 2016. Updating this estimate with  obligations made for these contracts in fiscal year 2012 would raise the  amount covered to about 78 percent. Using the revised U.S. methodology  to analyze 6 years of cumulative obligations against the 2009 awards\u2014 that is, obligations in fiscal years 2009 through 2014\u2014we found that the  amount USTR reported to the WTO in December 2015 equaled about 96  percent of total obligations for these contracts over the 6-year period. In  other words, using 6 years of cumulative obligations, in accordance with  the revised methodology, produced about 30 percent higher procurement  value than using 2 years of obligations consistent with the 2014 GPA  requirement to report within 2 years of the end of the reporting period.  However, the revised methodology did not account for 100 percent of the  contracts\u2019 value after 6 years. The methodology assumes that cumulative  obligations against awarded contracts over a 6-year period\u2014a year  longer than a contract\u2019s typical duration, according to OMB\u2014will capture  the full value of those contracts. Our analysis of federal contracts  awarded in fiscal year 2009 shows that the U.S. estimate of covered  government procurement based on the revised methodology is $200  billion for fiscal years 2009 through 2014. However, cumulative  obligations for these contracts from fiscal year 2009 through July 2016  amounted to $209 billion\u2014about $9 billion more than the amount  obligated for these contracts by the end of the revised methodology\u2019s 6- year period.", "Further, in compiling the fiscal year 2009 U.S. statistical notification  submitted to the WTO in December 2015, USTR did not use the revised  methodology as it was described to the WTO in August 2011. Whereas  that methodology was to use 6 years of obligations data (i.e., fiscal years  2009 through 2014), the fiscal year 2009 statistical notification used 6  years and 6 months of obligations data.

For  California, which is the largest state among the 37 covered states and  accounts for about 14 percent of their total government procurement, we  estimated that 92 percent of the value of goods, services, and  construction contracts awarded to covered entities fell above GPA  thresholds and therefore were covered by the GPA. For Pennsylvania, we  estimated that 95 percent of such contracts were covered by the GPA.

Commerce  calculates the estimates using data on operations and maintenance  expenses; however, for certain entities, the available data aggregate  wages with other operating expenses. As a result, estimates based on  these data overstate these entities\u2019 covered government procurement.  Conversely, covered government procurement reported for some entities,  such as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, includes capital  expenditures, while for other entities, such as the Port of Baltimore,  covered government procurement does not include these expenditures.

We defined covered government procurement under the  GPA and U.S. FTAs as procurement by covered government entities at  the central and subcentral levels that falls above certain predetermined  thresholds and outside certain exclusions stipulated in the agreements.  This amount is largely a measure of the opportunities available to  domestic and foreign firms seeking to compete under open tendering  procedures for government procurement contracts in the countries that  are parties to the agreements.
