VA officials said that before fiscal year 1988, VA was spending about $17 to $18 million annually for SAA contracts. Starting in fiscal year 1988, the Congress set an annual funding cap of $12 million. For fiscal year 1994, the 61 SAAs requested VA funding totaling $14.4 million but received $12 million.

Under the law, SAAs may approve courses of study at unaccredited institutions, thereby making veterans eligible to receive assistance for attending. By contrast, Education\u2019s regulations generally require schools to be accredited before they are certified, thereby making students eligible for title IV programs.

VA\u2019s two principal comments were that the draft report did not elaborate on the specific mechanisms or organizational elements within Education that are in place to ensure that the requirements of title 38 of the U.S. Code are met and it is questionable whether accreditation, in the absence of funding for the state postsecondary review entities (SPRE) program, will accomplish the approval, monitoring, and supervisory requirements of the laws governing VA education programs.", "In the report, we do discuss Education\u2019s gatekeeping triad composed of accrediting agencies, state licensing agencies, and Education itself, which performs the same basic function as SAAs for many of the same schools. Under title 38, the essential responsibility of SAAs is to determine which courses should be approved and to ensure that schools are complying with their established standards relating to the courses that have been approved before an individual entitled to VA education assistance can obtain money for an education or training program.

The SPRE program has never been fully operational, and only nine states\u2019 SPREs had been approved by Education as of September 30, 1995. Thus, the elimination of SPRE funding should have little impact on the operation of the gatekeeping triad. In addition, before the SPRE program was initiated, the majority of education and training programs approved by SAAs were offered by schools that were also accredited and certified by Education\u2019s gatekeeping system. And, as illustrated in this report, we found that both VA and Education gatekeepers apply similar standards in determining educational program acceptability at the same schools.", "VA also said that the role states and SAAs perform in approving education and training programs should continue and that it believes that such a function should not be centralized at the federal level. However, as noted in our report, just as the SAA functions are not totally centralized at the federal level, neither are the gatekeeping efforts of Education\u2019s triad, which relies on the nonfederal work of accrediting entities and state licensing bodies to perform an important portion of the school approval work.", "The full text of VA\u2019s comments appears in appendix VI of this report.", "Copies of this report are being sent to the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs; the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs, Education, and Labor; appropriate congressional committees; and other interested parties.", "Please call me at (202) 512-7014 if you or your staff have any questions regarding this report.
