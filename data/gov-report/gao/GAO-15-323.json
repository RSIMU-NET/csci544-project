GAO reviewed (1) coverage and (2) costs to consumers for one CHIP plan, one QHP, and, where applicable, one SADP in each of five states\u2014Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, New York, and Utah. State selection was based on variation in location, program size, and design; CHIP plan selection was based on high enrollment; and QHP selection was based on low plan premiums. GAO obtained CHIP and QHP premium data from state officials and federal and state websites. GAO also obtained documents from and spoke to federal officials, including from HHS's Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, state officials, including from CHIP and insurance departments, and issuers of QHPs.", "HHS provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In five selected states, GAO determined that coverage of services in the selected State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) plans was generally comparable to that of the selected private qualified health plans (QHP), with some differences. In particular, the plans were generally comparable in that most covered the services GAO reviewed with the notable exceptions of pediatric dental and certain enabling services such as translation and transportation services, which were covered more frequently by the CHIP plans. For example, only the selected QHP in New York covered pediatric dental services; the QHPs in the other four states did not include pediatric dental services, although some officials indicated this would change for 2015 offerings. In those four states, stand-alone dental plans (SADP) could be purchased separately. Selected CHIP plans and QHPs were also similar in terms of the services on which they imposed day, visit, or dollar limits, although the five selected CHIP plans generally imposed fewer limits than the selected QHPs. For services where coverage limits were sometimes imposed on QHPs and CHIP plans, GAO's review found that the limits on CHIP plans were at times less restrictive. For example, the selected QHP in Utah limited home- and community-based health care services to 60 visits per year while the selected CHIP plan did not impose any limits. In addition, for pediatric dental services, coverage limits in the selected SADPs were generally similar to those in the selected CHIP plan; however, when there were differences, CHIP was generally more generous.", "Consumers' costs for these services\u2014defined as deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and premiums\u2014were almost always less in the five states' selected CHIP plans when compared to their respective QHPs, despite the application of subsidies authorized under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) that reduce these costs in the QHPs. Specifically, when cost-sharing applied, the amount was typically less for CHIP plans, even considering PPACA provisions aimed at reducing cost-sharing amounts for certain low income consumers who purchased QHPs. For example, an office visit to a specialist in Colorado would cost a CHIP enrollee a $2 to $10 copayment per visit, depending on their income, compared to the lowest available copayment of $25 per visit in the selected Colorado QHP. GAO's review of premium data further suggests that selected CHIP premiums were always lower than selected QHP premiums, even when considering the application of PPACA subsidies that help to defray the cost to certain consumers. For example, the 2014 annual premium for the selected Illinois CHIP plan for an individual at 150 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) was $0. By comparison, the 2014 annual premium for the selected Illinois QHP was $1,254, which was reduced to $944 for an individual at 150 percent of the FPL, after considering federal subsidies to offset the cost of coverage. Finally, all selected CHIP plans and QHPs GAO reviewed limited out-of-pocket maximum costs, and these maximum costs were typically less in the CHIP plans."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Federal funding appropriated to states to support the State Children\u2019s  Health Insurance Program (CHIP), a joint federal-state program that was  established in 1997 to provide health coverage to certain low-income  children, will end after September 2015 unless Congress acts to  appropriate new funds.

In addition to these services,  we also identified selected enabling services, which can help individuals  access the medical care they need and are recognized by the Health  Resources and Services Administration\u2019s Maternal and Child Health  Bureau as especially important for low income children and those with  special health care needs, a significant number of whom rely on Medicaid  or CHIP for some or all of their health care coverage. We focused our  review on the five states selected for our November 2013 report:  Colorado, Kansas, Illinois, New York, and Utah, selected on the basis of  variations in CMS region, CHIP program design, and size of enrollment in  the separate CHIP program.

We also relied on these data sources to identify the lowest  cost SADP in 2014 in each state where the pediatric dental benefit was  not included in our selected QHP. We then reviewed Evidences of  Coverage from each of the QHPs and SADPs identified to determine  whether the services we identified were covered; whether there were any  annual limits on those services in terms of days, visits, age, or  expenditures; and to identify cost-sharing amounts, including deductibles,  copayments, and coinsurance, for each of the services and any stated  out-of-pocket maximum costs. We obtained 2014 CHIP premiums from  state officials and 2014 QHP premiums from data.healthcare.gov, state  websites, and state officials.

One notable difference between these selected CHIP plans and  QHPs was the frequency by which they limited home-and community- based health care.

In contrast, QHPs we reviewed typically  imposed annual deductibles, which were as high as $500 for an individual  and $1,500 for a family in the plan variation that offered the lowest  available deductibles for QHP enrollees. In addition, consumers who  purchase selected SADPs may face separate deductible costs. For  example, whereas dental services were subject to the plan deductible in  the New York QHP, SADPs in Colorado, Illinois, and Kansas had  separate dental deductibles that ranged from $25 to $50 for individuals  enrolled in selected high plans to $45 to $50 for individuals enrolled in  selected low plans.

For example, the selected CHIP plan in two of our five states \u2013 Kansas and New York \u2013 did not impose  copayments or coinsurance on any of the services we reviewed. In two of  the remaining three states, the selected CHIP plan imposed copayments  or coinsurance on less than half of the services we reviewed, and the  amounts were usually minimal and on a sliding income scale. For  example, for each brand-name prescription drug, the Illinois CHIP plan  imposed a $3.90 copayment on enrollees with incomes greater than 142  and up to 157 percent of the FPL, which was increased to $7 for enrollees  with incomes greater than 209 and up to 313 percent of the FPL. In  contrast, selected QHPs in all five states imposed copayments or  coinsurance on most covered services we reviewed, and the amounts  were consistently higher than the CHIP plan in the same state. For  example, depending on income, the copayment for primary care and  specialist physician visits in Colorado ranged from $2 to $10 per visit for  enrollees in the selected CHIP plan, but was $25 and $35 per visit,  respectively, for all enrollees in the selected QHP. Cost-sharing for dental  services was also higher in a state\u2019s selected SADP than in its selected  CHIP plan a majority of the time. In addition, in states where the selected  QHP charged coinsurance and the selected CHIP plan required a  copayment, a direct comparison of cost differences could not be made,  although data suggest CHIP costs would generally be lower. For  example, for an inpatient hospital admission, higher-income enrollees in  the selected CHIP plan in Colorado paid $50, while all enrollees in the  selected QHP in the state were responsible for 20 percent coinsurance  after the deductible was met, an amount that was likely to be higher given  that 20 percent of the average price for an inpatient facility stay in 2011  was over $3,000.services we reviewed in selected plans.)

With the premium tax credit, the annual premium  amount for selected QHPs was often significantly lower, but was still  higher than the selected CHIP plan in all five states. For example, in  Illinois, the premium for the selected CHIP plan for an individual with an  income at 150 percent of the FPL was $0 and was $1,254 for the selected  QHP, which was reduced to $944 after the premium tax credit was  applied.", "However, the additional premium cost to families enrolling previously  eligible CHIP children into their QHPs\u2014a possibility if CHIP funding is not  reauthorized\u2014may be minimal or nothing.amount lower income families pay in premiums, families with incomes at  250 percent or less of the FPL\u2014at least 75 percent of the separate CHIP  enrollees in the states we reviewed\u2014would generally pay no additional  premium to add a child to their QHP.

In exchanges with at least  one participating SADP, QHPs were not required to include the pediatric dental benefit. Consumers in  these five states were not required to purchase SADPs in 2014, even if their QHP did not include the  pediatric dental benefit.", "Rehabilitation is provided to help a person regain, maintain or prevent deterioration of a skill that has  been acquired but then lost or impaired due to illness, injury, or disabling condition. While PPACA  and its implementing regulations do not define habilitative services, habilitation has been defined by  several advocacy groups as a service that is provided in order for a person to attain, maintain, or  prevent deterioration of a skill or function never learned or acquired due to a disabling condition.  The plan covers bone anchored hearing aids and cochlear implants only. Bone anchored hearing  aids are used when traditional hearing aids are not efficient because of complications such as chronic  infections or blockage. Cochlear implants are for patients with severe hearing loss where traditional  amplification is no longer beneficial.  The plan covers care coordination and case management for children with special health care needs  only. Utah CHIP defines children with special health care needs as enrollees who have or are at  increased risk for chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional conditions and who also  require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that required by adults and children  generally.  Routine transportation includes transportation to and from medical appointments.  Routine transportation is covered for CHIP children greater than 142 and up to 209 percent of the  federal poverty level only."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Coverage Limits for Selected Services in CHIP Plans and QHPs GAO Reviewed in Five States", "paragraphs": ["Tables 1 and 2 provide information on coverage limits for selected  services in State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) plans and  qualified health plans (QHP) in each of the five states we reviewed:  Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, New York, and Utah.

In 2014, each exchange established out-of-pocket  maximum costs for SADPs. Annual out-of-pocket maximum costs for the  selected SADPs in Colorado, Illinois, and Kansas were $700 for one child  and $1400 for two or more children.
