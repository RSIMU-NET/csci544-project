TPCC's annual national export strategies identify broad priorities for promoting U.S. trade, but they do not discuss agencies' specific goals or assess progress made. In its initial strategies, the committee identified 10 regionally dispersed priority markets for future trade promotion efforts, but it did not discuss agencies' specific goals or report later on progress made in increasing exports to these markets. Shifting to a regional approach 3 years later in its 1997 strategy, the committee identified Central and Eastern Europe as a region where U.S. government assistance to U.S. exporters would be important in increasing market share. Again the strategy did not discuss agencies' specific goals nor did later strategies report on progress made or even cover consistent topics from year to year. Without regular assessments of progress, it is not clear whether export promotion resources are being used most productively in support of the strategy. Furthermore, the committee has limited ability to align agency resources with its strategy. The committee has made modest but inconsistent progress in coordinating federal agencies' export promotion efforts. In its first national export strategy in 1993, the committee identified coordination weaknesses and recommended improvements, most of which required interagency consensus to implement. Although many of its initial recommendations were implemented during the committee's first few years, some have not been implemented--for example, the need for improved agency staff training and improved trade information services to bring clarity to the export process, as well as the need for expanded outreach and trade education for new-to-export firms."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Ten years ago, to coordinate the activities of the various federal agencies  involved in export promotion and to ensure better delivery of services to  potential exporters, Congress established the interagency Trade Promotion  Coordinating Committee under the Export Enhancement Act of 1992 (P.L.  102-429).

For example, the 1994 national export strategy  identified a broad set of 10 markets, called the big emerging markets  (BEM), where the TPCC expected exports to grow over the next several  decades. In 1995, the strategy gave additional attention to the traditional  export markets of Japan, Canada, and Western Europe, and 3 years later  the strategy expanded its targets further, emphasizing increasing exports to  nontraditional markets in Latin America and Asia.

In its  1997 national export strategy, the TPCC noted that the United States was  losing market share in some of the BEMs and directed that, where  resources allow, the TPCC agencies target the more promising of these  markets. It identified Poland as one of four BEMs with the greatest market  potential. Commercial staff in Poland initially rose from 9 to 18 between  fiscal years 1996 and 1997; however, the Commerce Inspector General,  noted in a 1997 report that this level was not sufficient. The Inspector  General reported that Poland did not get increased resources, like other  BEMs did, because FCS headquarters did not consider European countries a priority. In its report to the Congress in September 2001, the Inspector  General citing declines in exports from the United States to Poland,  recommended that the post develop a missionwide strategy that reflects  U.S. priorities and objectives. At the time of our visit in 2002, the FCS post  staff level was 14. Nor did Commerce significantly increase staffing in  Turkey, the other BEM in our study of the TPCC\u2019s 1997 strategy for Central  Europe, where FCS staff levels fluctuated from 13 to 15 staff between fiscal  years 1996 and 2001, and a key position was vacant for more than a year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Factors Affect Resource Allocations", "paragraphs": ["Other factors, such as foreign policy initiatives; the need to provide  minimum coverage for a broad set of countries; and agency emphasis on  pursuing exports in open, accessible foreign markets, have also affected  the decisions that agencies make regarding resource allocations.", "In response to foreign policy initiatives, agencies have reallocated staff  overseas and established offices, as illustrated by the following examples.", "In 1994, Congress directed the executive branch to develop an Africa  trade and development policy, and in 2000 Congress enacted the  African Growth and Opportunity Act (P.L. 106\u2014200, title I).

In fiscal year 2002, FCS expects to increase staffing in Ghana  and plans to open an office in Senegal.", "In 1999, TDA and OPIC established the Caspian Finance Center in  Turkey. The center supports two national interests as well as offers  opportunities for U.S. businesses. First, the development of the rich  Caspian Sea energy reserves estimated to be 178 billion barrels or more  of oil would reduce U.S. reliance on more volatile sources of oil; and  second, the transport of oil over a western route through Turkey would  economically benefit this vital U.S. ally.

To support the President\u2019s regional initiative, OPIC and  TDA, with TPCC support, have had full-time regional representatives in  Zagreb since about March 2000, and Commerce has increased its staff  there by one. The office serves as a local point of contact, information,  and support for U.S. investors in the region.", "In addition, both FCS and FAS have had to spread their overseas staffing to  cover a broad range of countries. During fiscal years 1998 through 2001,  Commerce\u2019s FCS opened 21 new offices overseas\u2014many in the newly  independent former Soviet states and African countries where export  markets are in the early stages of development.

FCS decreased staff levels in three of the six  G-6 markets between fiscal years 1996 and 2001, but 2001 staffing levels are  higher in each of the G-6 countries than in six of the BEMs. For example,  Argentina, Hong Kong, Poland, South Africa,  South Korea, and  Turkey  each have fewer staff than Italy, the country with the lowest staff level  among the G-6 countries.

During this period some staff-level working groups  continued to address trade promotion issues and work on publishing the  national export strategy, but they were not able to complete work  implementing the earlier recommendations. Key issues continuing to need  resolution are:  TPCC identified the need to have cross-agency training so that agency  staffs would be knowledgeable enough about the export promotion  programs of the other agencies to explain them to potential exporters.  In 1999, the TPCC requested but did not receive funding from OMB for  such training at overseas posts.

In its 2002  strategy, the recently energized TPCC identified several key areas for  improved agency coordination, some of which address problems initially  recognized in the TPCC\u2019s 1993 strategy, including the need for (1) cross  training agency personnel so they are knowledgeable about other agency  programs, (2) improving exporters\u2019 access to timely and accurate trade  information, and (3) expanding outreach and trade education for new-to- export firms.

The TPCC noted that it is  committed to providing periodic reports to Congress on the  implementation of its recommendations, including specific agency goals  and associated responsibilities. It expects that the first of such progress  reports will be sent in October to the Senate Banking Committee and the  House International Relations Committee.", "The TPCC noted that its 2002 National Export Strategy was based on a  survey of exporters and potential exporters and that regular direct input  from such TPCC customers now provides continuity and consistency in the  TPCC\u2019s strategic approach. It stated that changes in strategic approach will  now be made in response to the changing needs of exporters. We agree that  exporter needs should help define the national export strategy. We also  believe that the TPCC needs to provide leadership to the various federal  agencies involved in export promotion so that the government strategy  better clarifies goals, agency responsibilities, and associated resource  allocations.", "The TPCC noted that our draft report was misleading in its reference to the  TPCC\u2019s not completing its implementation of earlier TPCC  recommendations. It stated that it had made progress in establishing  interagency services such as the Trade Information Center and the  Export.gov Web site and that it did not expect its work ever to be  completed. It also noted that training is another area where agencies are  constantly striving to innovate and improve. We believe these areas are  important, and we agree that continuous improvement is desirable.
