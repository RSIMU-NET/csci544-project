To maintain a presence in these locations, State has often relied on older, acquired (purchased or leased), and temporary work facilities that do not meet the same security standards as more recently constructed permanent facilities.", "GAO was asked to review how State assures the security of these work facilities. GAO evaluated (1) how State manages risks at work facilities overseas; (2) the adequacy of State's physical security standards for these facilities; (3) State's processes to address vulnerabilities when older, acquired, and temporary overseas facilities do not meet physical security standards; and (4) the extent to which State's activities to manage risks to its overseas work facilities align with State's risk management policy and with risk management best practices. GAO reviewed U.S. laws and State's policies, procedures, and standards for risk management and physical security. GAO reviewed facilities at a judgmental sample of 10 higher-threat, higher-risk, geographically dispersed, overseas posts and interviewed officials from State and other agencies in Washington, D.C., and at 16 overseas posts, including the 10 posts at which GAO reviewed facilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["To manage risks at its overseas work facilities, the Department of State (State) tracks information about each facility, assesses threat levels at posts, develops security standards to meet threats facing different types of facilities overseas, identifies vulnerabilities, and sets risk-based construction priorities. For example, State assesses six types of threats, such as terrorism, and assigns threat levels, which correspond to physical security standards at each overseas post. However, GAO found several inconsistencies in terminology used to categorize properties and within the property inventory database used to track them, raising questions about the reliability of the data. For example, GAO identified a facility categorized as a warehouse that included offices and therefore should have been subject to more stringent standards. Gaps in categorization and tracking of facilities could hamper the proper implementation of physical security standards.", "Although State has established physical security standards for most types of overseas facilities, GAO identified some facility types for which standards were lacking or unclear, instances in which the standards were not updated in a timely manner, and inconsistencies within the standards. The following are examples:", "It is unclear what standards apply to some types of facilities.", "In some instances, updating standards took more than 8 years.", "One set of standards requires anti-ram perimeter walls at medium- and higher-threat posts; another required them only at higher-threat posts.", "Furthermore, GAO found that State lacks a process for reassessing standards against evolving threats and risks. GAO identified several posts that put security measures in place that exceed the standards because the standards did not adequately address emerging threats and risks. Without adequate and up-to-date standards, post officials rely on an ad hoc process to establish security measures rather than systematically drawing upon collective subject-matter expertise.", "Although State takes steps to mitigate vulnerabilities to older, acquired, and temporary work facilities, its waivers and exceptions process has weaknesses. When posts cannot meet security standards for a given facility, the posts must submit requests for waivers and exceptions, which identify steps the post will take to mitigate vulnerabilities. However, GAO found neither posts nor headquarters systematically tracks the waivers and exceptions and that State has no process to re-evaluate waivers and exceptions when the threat or risk changes. Furthermore, posts do not always request required waivers and exceptions and do not always take required mitigation steps. With such deficiencies, State cannot be assured it has all the information needed to mitigate facility vulnerabilities and that mitigation measures have been implemented.", "GAO found that State has not fully developed and implemented a risk management policy for overseas facilities. Furthermore, State's risk management activities do not operate as a continuous process or continually incorporate new information. State does not use all available information when establishing threat levels at posts, such as when posts find it necessary to implement measures that exceed security standards. State also lacks processes to re-evaluate the risk to interim and temporary facilities that have been in use longer than anticipated. Without a fully developed risk management policy, State may lack the information needed to make the best security decisions concerning personnel and facilities.", "To manage risk to overseas work facilities, State conducts a range of ongoing activities, including the setting of security standards.

These  threats have been heightened in part due to policy decisions to keep staff  in locations that previously would have been deemed too dangerous for  U.S. personnel. To establish or maintain a U.S. presence in these and  other locations, the Department of State (State) often relies on older,  acquired, and temporary diplomatic facilities that do not meet the same  security standards as more recently constructed permanent facilities. On  September 11, 2012, the acquired facilities at the U.S. Special Mission  compound in Benghazi, Libya, came under attack. Tragically, four U.S.  officials were killed, including the U.S. Ambassador. From September  2012 through December 2013, 53 attacks against U.S. embassy facilities  and personnel occurred, including 4 attacks that resulted in the deaths of  U.S. embassy personnel. These attacks raise questions about the  security of U.S. diplomatic facilities, particularly those facilities not built to  current security standards, such as the facility in Benghazi. In response to  the attack, State has begun taking a number of steps to enhance its risk  management and security efforts aimed at protecting overseas facilities.  For example, shortly after the attacks in Benghazi, State, working with the  Department of Defense, sent out Interagency Security Assessment  Teams to evaluate the security at 19 higher-threat, higher-risk posts.

Our concerns about  these data are discussed in our findings. We evaluated the consistency of  physical security standards within the FAM and FAH and the timeliness of  updates to those policies. We also asked State, USAID, and other agency  officials at 16 posts overseas in-person and by video-conference a  standard set of questions regarding the implementation of physical  security policies and procedures.

For example, the  FAM states that security standards against the terrorism threat are  part of the physical security standards. However, there are currently  no security standards for the terrorism threat in the OSPB standards  within the FAH.  Inconsistencies within the FAH between OSPB standards and the  Physical Security Handbook.

However, as we  previously noted, the physical security standards matrix was not up-to- date and did not accurately reflect all the OSPB standards when we  visited posts. Hence, these officials may not have applied the appropriate  security standards to the facilities at their posts. Some RSOs told us that  State updates the OSPB standards and the Physical Security Handbook  infrequently and that they learn about updates through DS cables or DS\u2019s  internal website.

First, DS is not adequately  tracking waivers and exceptions to the security standards. In January  2013, the State OIG reported that DS does not adequately track waivers  and exceptions. DS does not maintain a database with waiver and  exception documentation, but rather maintains a list of waivers and  exceptions in a spreadsheet. When we reviewed DS\u2019s tracking  spreadsheet, we identified several problems. For example, we found  nine instances in which a line item in the tracking spreadsheet contained  inaccurate information about the type of approved waivers or exceptions  for a facility. In addition, headquarters and post officials we met with could  not always find waiver and exception documentation or were unaware of  previously approved waivers and exceptions, even though DS officials  stated that copies of approved waivers and exceptions are kept both at  DS headquarters and at posts.

Nevertheless,  post and DS officials have not re-evaluated these exceptions. In addition,  an agency at one post recently requested and obtained a colocation  waiver and exceptions to utilize hotel rooms as office space. There are  already two other agencies using the same hotel as office space.

Similarly, State  OIG identified 4 out of 27 posts that did not submit appropriate waivers or  exceptions. To address this problem, State OIG recommended that DS  institute an annual certification process in which the Chief of Mission at  each post would be required to certify that the post either meets all  security standards or that all appropriate waivers and exceptions have  been obtained.

Risk management requires a continuous process that includes  the assessment of threats, vulnerabilities, and potential consequences,  with actions taken to reduce or eliminate one or more of these elements  of risk. Risk management should include a feedback loop that continually  incorporates new information, such as changing threats or the effect of  actions taken to reduce or eliminate identified threats, vulnerabilities, or  consequences. Because policymakers have imperfect information for  assessing risks, there is a degree of uncertainty in the information used  for risk assessments\u2014what the threats are and how likely they are to be  realized. As a result, it is inevitable that assumptions and policy  judgments, as well as hard data, influence decisions in risk analysis and  management. It is important, therefore, that key decision makers  understand the underlying assumptions and policy judgments that have  been made and how these affect the results of the risk analysis and the  resource decisions based on that analysis. An effective risk management  policy, by providing a structured, continuous process with a feedback loop  that incorporate new information and adjusts to changing conditions, can  provide policymakers with better information with which to make risk  decisions in an uncertain environment.", "To provide a basis for examining efforts for carrying out risk management,  in prior work we developed a framework for risk management based on  best practices and other criteria. Our risk management framework is  divided into five phases that form a feedback loop: (1) setting strategic  goals and objectives and determining constraints; (2) assessing the risks;  (3) evaluating alternatives for addressing these risks; (4) selecting the  appropriate alternatives; and (5) implementing the alternatives and  monitoring the progress made and the results achieved (see fig. 6). The  results generated by monitoring in phase 5 feed back into the ongoing  process. In addition, because a framework includes integrated and  continually updated information flows, internal controls are crucial. These  include the policies, procedures, techniques, and mechanisms that  enforce management\u2019s directives and are used to help ensure that  actions are taken to address risk. We used this framework, as well as the  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, to assess  State\u2019s risk management principles and activities.", "While DS created a risk management policy statement in 1997, DS has  not fully developed and implemented the policy. The one-page policy  statement describes six principles: asset identification, threat  assessments, vulnerability assessments, risk assessments, risk  decisions, and feedback. DS officials noted that a year after the statement  was published, its planned implementation was largely overtaken by  State\u2019s response to the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Africa, and that  the policy was not fully developed or implemented. For example, DS\u2019s risk  management statement lacks clear roles and responsibilities for all  stakeholders and detailed guidance on how to carry out its elements,  particularly with regard to implementation and monitoring. Officials further  noted that, contrary to what is stated in the policy, there is no formal  steering group handling the risk management process. Nevertheless, we  also found that many of the activities that DS takes to manage risk align  with the DS risk management policy principles and also with our risk  management framework, including determining risk by combining the  results of asset identification, threat assessments, and vulnerability  assessments. Both the Benghazi ARB report  and the resulting Report  of the Independent Panel on Best Practicesdevelop a risk management policy. State has undertaken several efforts  to develop a more comprehensive risk management policy. For example,  according to State officials, State is applying its recently completed Vital  Presence Validation Process to better manage risk when beginning,  restarting, continuing, modifying, or discontinuing operations at posts,  particularly high-threat, high-risk posts. However, as of February 2014,  some of these efforts, including a fully developed risk management policy,  remain incomplete."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State\u2019s Risk Management Activities Do Not Operate as a Continuous Process and Do Not Continually Incorporate New Information", "paragraphs": ["While many of State\u2019s activities align with the DS risk management policy  statement, in this report we have identified a number of problems with  these activities.

For example, we found that DS does not  use all available information when establishing threat levels at posts.  Specifically, some posts may implement security measures that go above  standards, but this type of information is not effectively captured in the  triennial facility inspection process to document posts\u2019 compliance with  OSPB standards, and according to DS officials, does not inform the  Security Environment Threat List threat-level decisions.", "Furthermore, DS officials noted that the information from the triennial  facility inspection process, which is used to identify facility vulnerabilities,  is not currently used in a meaningful way because several issues impede  DS\u2019s ability to collect and adequately use this information. For example,  because the survey forms are individual documents housed on an  intranet site, DS officials in headquarters cannot easily search through the  data from the surveys or conduct comparative analyses of posts\u2019 data. In  addition, we found that the surveys did not always include all facilities at  posts and that headquarters could not always find the most current  surveys. DS officials indicated that the new online survey process they  are developing will feed certain data into a database, thus improving their  ability to analyze and use the survey data. While we have not  independently evaluated the online survey forms, DS officials noted that  the forms include a checklist for all the current OSPB standards for each  of the threat ratings, and RSOs will be required to complete the new  survey templates online. In addition, according to officials, DS plans to  develop a project management solution that will allow DS officials in  headquarters to track and report on the data collected by the completed  physical security surveys through an automated system.", "Another instance of current information not being fully utilized involves  OBO documentation of facility compliance with the physical security  standards. According to State\u2019s policies, when OBO initiates a major  rehabilitation project on a facility constructed prior to June 1991, it must  request OSPB exceptions if the planned rehabilitation will not bring the  facility into full compliance with current security standards. Furthermore,  according to DS officials, when OBO completes a major rehabilitation  project on a facility constructed prior to June 1991, the bureau is required  to document with a memorandum what aspects of the facility will still not  meet standards after the rehabilitation. However, DS officials told us that  no one in DS tracks the OBO memoranda. Without adequately tracking  this information, RSOs may not have accurate information to plan  mitigation efforts and properly request exceptions to security standards.

For example, as noted above, State does not have a  process for evaluating the existing security standards against evolving  threats and risks, and we found examples where State officials deemed  existing standards inadequate to meet perceived threats and risks.  Similarly, DS lacks a process to re-evaluate risk decisions such as the  granting of waivers and exceptions when risk factors change. DS  quantifies risk to facilities by assessing the number of personnel, threat  levels, host-country capability and willingness to support the post, and  vulnerabilities. At one post we visited, the consulate initially had a  diplomatic presence on one floor of a tenant commercial office space. It  received a colocation and setback waiver to occupy that one floor. In  subsequent years, as the number of personnel grew, the consulate  expanded its office space to include a second floor of the facility.  However, according to post officials, there was never a reevaluation of  the risk to that facility on the basis of the increased personnel presence,  and the post did not request a new waiver until years later when an RSO  noticed the discrepancy. Similarly, waiver and exception request  packages generally include information about the current Security  Environment Threat List levels, but when those levels change\u2014from high  to critical, for example\u2014there is, according to DS officials, no process in  place to notify post or headquarters to re-evaluate the waivers and  exceptions previously granted.", "Similarly, DS lacks a process to re-evaluate interim and temporary  facilities that have been in use longer than anticipated. When State opens  an interim or temporary facility and grants waivers or exceptions, it is with  the expectation that the facility will be replaced by another or closed  within a certain time frame. There is an explicit acceptance of risk in that  decision. However, officials noted that there were a number of facilities  that were designated to be used on an interim or temporary basis, but  because State lacked a process to re-evaluate these facilities, years later  these facilities were still in use without any review of the facility  designation and without revisiting of the risk decision. Similarly, the  Independent Panel on Best Practices found that State redefined missions,  such as Benghazi, as temporary or in other ways that did not require  them to meet physical security standards. For example, at some posts,  State used containerized housing units and other temporary structures as  offices for years though these trailer-like facilities do not meet OSPB  standards and were only intended to be used on an interim or temporary  basis. State officials stated that they do not systematically review interim  and temporary facilities that have been in use longer than anticipated.  However, effective risk management practices require a feedback loop  that continually incorporates new information, and federal standards for  internal controls call for proper execution of management directives.", "In addition, we found that State did not adequately verify that it had  followed through on the feedback it received through all past risk- management related recommendations. Federal standards for internal  controls call for ensuring that the findings of audits and other reviews are  promptly resolved. For example, M/PRI maintains documentation to track  the implementation of all ARB recommendations. Although we did not  assess the reliability of these data, we identified two examples of  recommended updates to the OSPB standards that M/PRI\u2019s  documentation indicated were completed but that our evidence showed  had not been completed. During the course of our review, in December  2013, one of these recommendations was completed. Moreover, when  we asked DS officials about the status of their efforts to close  recommendations resulting from the State OIG\u2019s review of their waivers  and exceptions process, the officials indicated that they had addressed all  of the recommendations.

We found that State has taken a number of measures to  enhance the security of and manage the risk to its personnel and  facilities. For example, State is prioritizing security-related construction  using its evaluation of threat and vulnerability levels at posts. In addition,  State established a new directorate to provide additional security attention  to high-threat, high-risk posts. Furthermore, we found that many of State\u2019s  risk management activities were consistent with best practices. However,  we found a number of problems with State\u2019s implementation of some of  its activities, rather than with the broader activities themselves. Some of  these problems involved the lack of common terminology or the reliability  of data that State uses to analyze risk. Others involved the adequacy of  its physical security standards. In addition, we found problems with  State\u2019s handling of its waivers and exceptions process. While each of  these problems is a reason for concern, in and of itself, taken as a whole  they raise a greater concern that decision makers at State may not have  complete and accurate information with which to make risk management  decisions.

A good  risk management policy includes the use of all relevant information and a  feedback loop that ensures that changing conditions are assessed and  considered by decision makers. Such a policy helps ensure that despite  uncertainty, security personnel have a continuous system in place that  identifies weaknesses proactively rather than reactively. The lack of such  a policy may make State more prone to not considering data needed to  make effective risk decisions. While State is developing a risk  management framework in response to several recommendations  resulting from the attacks in Benghazi, the framework remains  incomplete. Unless State implements a risk management policy that  addresses the problems we identified with State\u2019s current security efforts,  State cannot be assured that the most effective security measures are in  place at a time when personnel working at U.S. diplomatic facilities are  facing ever increasing threats to their safety and security."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To enhance the Department of State\u2019s risk management activities, we are  making 13 recommendations, which we have categorized into four groups  covering (1) consistency and reliability of data; (2) applicability and  effectiveness of physical security standards; (3) identification of risks and  mitigation of vulnerabilities; and (4) development of risk management  policies.", "To improve the consistency and data reliability of Department of State risk  management data, we recommend that the Secretary of State:  1.

We  compared these records to information we collected during discussions  with post officials to identify excess facilities, missing facilities, and  inaccuracies in the data. Although we identified data reliability issues for  some facilities in OBO\u2019s property database, as those issues generally  involved the classification or description of facilities, we determined that  the data were sufficiently reliable to describe the approximate number of  U.S. diplomatic work facilities overseas. To review the timeliness of DS\u2019s  tracking of posts\u2019 triennial physical security surveys, we requested and  obtained most surveys for work facilities at the 14 posts where we  reviewed facility documentation. We reviewed the documentation to  determine whether each survey had been completed in the past 3 years  and reviewed the documents obtained against our list of facilities for each  post to determine if DS provided all the relevant surveys. If DS did not  provide us with a survey we expected, we followed up with DS officials in  headquarters to determine whether or not survey documentation for a  facility existed and if it was appropriately maintained and tracked in  headquarters and at post. To evaluate the reliability of the data DS uses  to assess risk to office facilities overseas, we examined a copy of the  most recent risk matrix completed by DS and identified (1) inaccurate  information based on post-specific information gathered throughout the  course of the engagement, (2) missing off-compound facilities and  inaccurate information based on an analysis of the facilities included in  the risk matrix, and (3) missing data points. Although we identified data  reliability issues in the risk matrix, which may affect the risk scores for  individual posts, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to  broadly characterize overall facility vulnerability and risk scores at the  aggregate level.", "To address the adequacy of State\u2019s physical security standards, we  evaluated the consistency of select physical security standards across  various types of policy guidance and the timeliness of updates to those  policies. We conducted a number of activities to evaluate the consistency  of physical security standards. We reviewed the physical security  standards for work facilities described in the FAM and the FAH\u2014 specifically, the FAH sections containing the OSPB standards and the  Physical Security Handbook\u2014and identified inconsistencies between the  FAM and the FAH and inconsistencies between the two sections of the  FAH. We also reviewed policy guidance documented in memoranda and  compared that to the physical security standards outlined in the FAH.  Finally, we identified inconsistencies between the FAH and the OBO  Building and Zoning Codes discussed in an OIG report. To evaluate the  timeliness of updates to physical security standards in the FAM and the  FAH, we interviewed DS officials to understand the process State follows  to update the FAM and the FAH and determined that updates should take  approximately 60 to 90 days. We then reviewed (1) all ARB reports  resulting from attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities since 1998 or that  included recommendations related to physical security and (2) joint DS- OBO memoranda concerning physical security standards in process. We  examined this documentation and identified instances in which it has  taken State more than a year to update these standards.", "To address how State mitigates vulnerabilities if facilities do not meet  applicable physical security standards, we asked post officials a standard  set of questions; identified several ways to measure general compliance  with physical security standards; and evaluated State\u2019s waivers and  exceptions process. Using the judgmental sample described above, we  traveled to 12 posts and conducted work focused on 4 other posts by  teleconference. Our sample included nine countries in three of State\u2019s  geographic regions\u2014Africa, the Near East, and South and Central Asia.  As noted above, we selected these posts due to their relatively high DS- established threat and risk ratings and the presence of facilities that fell  within our scope. For security reasons, we are not naming the specific  posts we visited for this review. At 16 posts overseas, we asked State,  USAID, and other agency officials in-person and by video-conference a  standard set of questions regarding the implementation of physical  security policies and procedures to understand how State identifies and  mitigates vulnerabilities.", "We also identified three ways to measure general compliance with  physical security standards based on State documentation. First, we  reviewed the list of embassy and consulate compounds. We found that a  significant number were constructed or acquired prior to 1991; because  those facilities are only required to meet many of the physical security  standards to the maximum extent feasible or practicable, we determined  that many of those facilities may not meet standards. Second, we  reviewed DS\u2019s list of approved waivers and exceptions, which they use to  track this documentation, and counted the number of facilities with  colocation and setback waivers and exceptions. We determined that each  facility with a waiver or exception does not meet all physical security  standards. We interviewed DS officials about the waivers and exceptions  spreadsheet. While we found problems with some entries in the  spreadsheet, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to  report a general order of magnitude of the number of waivers and  exceptions. Third, we obtained and reviewed the 2013 risk matrix that DS  completed in September 2013. We then reviewed the facility compliance  scores for each facility ranked in DS\u2019s risk matrix to determine the number  of facilities that DS has found do not meet most OSPB standards for new  facilities. To make that determination, we identified all facilities with a  standards compliance score in the bottom half of the 10-point range.  However, because SECCA\u2019s 100-foot setback requirement received its  own rating in the matrix and was not considered as part of the facility  compliance rating, our analysis of DS\u2019s standards compliance score does  not include the extent to which facilities met the 100-foot setback  requirement. Due to the limitations with DS\u2019s ratings that we noted earlier,  we are only reporting this information to provide a broad indication of  concerns with facilities\u2019 compliance with standards and not to provide a  precise estimate of the number of facilities with particular ratings.", "Furthermore, at 10 posts we visited, we evaluated the compliance of all  work facilities\u2014a combined total of 43 different offices and warehouses\u2014 against the existing physical security standards. Prior to reviewing  overseas facilities, we reviewed prior recommendations made by OIG or  the Interagency Security Assessment Teams. We then developed a  physical security checklist for each of the four facility types we reviewed\u2014 chanceries or consulates, sole occupant of building or compound, tenant  of commercial office space, and unclassified warehouse\u2014on the basis of  the current security standards specified in the OSPB standards and the  Physical Security Handbook. The physical security requirements in the  OSPB standards vary by facility type, date of construction or acquisition,  and threat level. Because we identified some inconsistencies between  these two policy guides, we always included the higher of the two  standards in our physical security checklist in those instances in which we  identified an inconsistency. For example, the OSPB did not include the  compound emergency sanctuary requirement in the OSPB standards until  after our post visits in December 2013. However, because State included  the standards for compound emergency sanctuaries in the Physical  Security Handbook in October 2012, we assessed facilities against this  standard during our facility reviews. We then used these checklists to  evaluate the compliance of work facilities at the 10 posts we visited. In  general, the facilities in our sample were not comparable to those on  recently constructed embassy or consulate compounds, which were  constructed to meet current security standards. Our findings from these  posts are not generalizable to all posts.", "To evaluate the adequacy of State\u2019s waivers and exceptions process,  which is one process by which State mitigates vulnerabilities when  facilities do not meet standards, we reviewed DS\u2019s list of waivers and  exceptions, post-specific physical security surveys, waivers and  exceptions for 14 of the 16 posts in which we conducted work, and our  post-specific physical security checklists for the 10 posts to which we  traveled. We then analyzed DS\u2019s list of waivers and exceptions against  the other documentation we collected and our physical security checklists  to identify any issues with DS\u2019s tracking of waivers and exceptions. We  also reviewed our physical security checklists and identified all security  deficiencies for which a waiver or exception should have been requested;  we then compared that information with DS\u2019s list of waivers and  exceptions and the post-specific waivers and exceptions to identify  missing waivers and exceptions. In addition, we reviewed the post- specific documentation to determine if post officials requested waivers  and exceptions in a timely manner and if the documentation was  accurate. Finally, we identified mitigation measures outlined in the  approved waiver or exception request that the post was expected to  implement and evaluated that information against our physical security  checklists to determine if all agreed upon mitigation measures had been  implemented.", "To address how State\u2019s risk management activities align with its policies  and best practices, we assessed DS\u2019s risk management policy and,  drawing on our other findings, State\u2019s current risk management efforts  against best practices identified by GAO as well as federal standards for  internal control. In addition, we reviewed M/PRI\u2019s ARB recommendation  matrix to assess the extent to which State had addressed and closed past  ARB recommendations. However, based on the work we conducted when  reviewing the timeliness of updates to physical security standards, we  identified two instances of recommendations that State closed though it  had not completed the actions cited in closing them.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2013 to June 2014 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.", "The original version of this report is a restricted report and was issued on  June 5, 2014, copies of which are available for official use only.public version of the original report does not contain certain information  that State regarded as Sensitive but Unclassified and requested that we  remove.
