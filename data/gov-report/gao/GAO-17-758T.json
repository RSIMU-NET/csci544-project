Specifically, FEMA has developed policies and procedures regarding misconduct investigations that apply to all FEMA personnel and has also documented options to address misconduct and appeal rights for Title 5 (generally permanent employees) and Cadre of On-Call Response/Recovery Employees (temporary employees who support disaster related activities). However, FEMA has not documented misconduct policies and procedures for Surge Capacity Force members, who may augment FEMA's workforce in the event of a catastrophic disaster. Additionally, FEMA's Reservist (intermittent disaster employees) policies and procedures do not outline disciplinary actions or the appeals process currently in practice at the agency. As a result, supervisors and Reservist employees may not be aware of all aspects of the process. Clearly documented policies and procedures for all workforce categories could help to better prepare management to address misconduct and mitigate perceptions that misconduct is handled inconsistently.", "FEMA records data on misconduct cases and their outcomes; however, aspects of this data limit their usefulness for identifying and addressing trends. GAO reviewed misconduct complaints recorded by FEMA's Office of the Chief Security Officer (OCSO) from January 2014 through September 30, 2016, and identified 595 complaints involving 799 alleged offenses, the most common of which were integrity and ethics violations. FEMA reported 546 disciplinary actions related to misconduct from calendar year 2014 through 2016. In addition to OCSO, two other FEMA offices involved in investigating and adjudicating misconduct also record data. However, limited standardization of data fields and entries within fields, limited use of unique case identifiers, and a lack of documented guidance on data entry across all three offices restricts the data's usefulness for identifying and addressing trends in employee misconduct. Improved quality control measures could help the agency use the data to better identify potential problem areas and opportunities for training.", "FEMA shares misconduct case information internally and with the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General (DHS OIG) on a regular basis; however, FEMA does not have reconciliation procedures in place to track DHS OIG referred cases to ensure that they are reviewed and addressed. GAO reviewed a random sample of 20 cases DHS OIG referred to FEMA in fiscal year 2016 and found that FEMA missed 6 of the 20 complaints during the referral process and had not reviewed them at the time of GAO's inquiry. As a result of GAO's review, FEMA took action to review the complaints and opened inquiries in 5 of the 6 cases (1 case was closed for lack of information). In 3 of these cases, officials determined that the complaints did not involve FEMA employees. The 2 remaining cases were open as of April 2017. While the results from this review are not generalizable to the entire population of referrals from DHS OIG to FEMA, they raise questions as to whether there could be additional instances of misconduct complaints that FEMA has not reviewed or addressed. Procedures to ensure reconciliation of referred cases across FEMA and DHS OIG records could help ensure that FEMA accounts for all complaints."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our recent report on employee  misconduct at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  FEMA is responsible for coordinating government-wide efforts in  preparing for, protecting against, mitigating the effects of, responding to,  and recovering from all domestic natural or man-made disasters,  including acts of terror. To accomplish this mission, the agency relies on a  total workforce of more than 22,000 permanent and disaster-related  temporary employees. These employees play a key role in supporting  communities and first responders. However, incidents of misconduct can  detract from FEMA\u2019s mission, damage the agency\u2019s reputation, and  hamper the agency\u2019s ability to respond to disasters and maintain public  trust if not effectively managed.", "Within FEMA, three primary offices are involved in reviewing,  investigating, and adjudicating employee misconduct allegations.", "Office of the Chief Security Officer (OCSO) Internal  Investigations Branch: conducts investigations related to more  serious allegations, such as those that may involve potential criminal  misconduct.", "The Office of the Chief Component Human Capital Officer Labor  and Employee Relations Branch (LER): advises supervisors who  conduct lower level investigations and inquiries, such as time and  attendance violations, and provides recommendations on any  counseling or any disciplinary or adverse action for all cases.", "The Office of the Chief Counsel Personnel Law Branch (PLB):  provides legal advice during investigations and conducts legal reviews  of certain reports of investigation and all disciplinary and adverse  actions.", "Representatives from these three offices form FEMA\u2019s Administrative  Investigations Directive (AID) Committee, which reviews misconduct  allegations, assigns investigators, and tracks the status of open cases.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Inspector General  (OIG) also plays a role in reviewing and investigating certain misconduct  allegations, such as allegations of criminal misconduct against a DHS  employee and any allegations of misconduct against senior employees.", "My testimony discusses findings from our July 2017 report on the  handling of employee misconduct allegations at FEMA. Accordingly, my  testimony addresses: (1) the extent to which FEMA has developed  policies and procedures for addressing employee misconduct; (2)  available data on FEMA employee misconduct cases and their outcomes  and the extent to which FEMA uses these data to identify and address  trends; and (3) the extent that information regarding misconduct cases is  shared within FEMA\u2019s personnel management offices and with DHS OIG.", "To conduct this work, among other things, we reviewed, where available,  FEMA\u2019s documented policies and procedures for reporting, investigating,  and adjudicating allegations of misconduct across all of the agency\u2019s  workforce categories, including the following: Title 5 employees, Cadre  of On-Call Response/Recovery Employees (CORE), Reservists, Surge  Capacity Force members, and FEMA Corps members. We also  interviewed officials from FEMA units with responsibilities related to  managing misconduct and analyzed available FEMA data on employee  misconduct. Specifically, we reviewed and analyzed available 2014  through 2016 data contained in three misconduct case tracking  spreadsheets maintained by FEMA\u2019s OCSO, LER, and PLB. Our July  2017 report includes a detailed explanation of the scope and methods  used to conduct our work, which was performed in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FEMA Has Developed and Documented Misconduct Policies and Procedures for Most Employees, but Not its Entire Workforce", "paragraphs": ["FEMA has developed a policy and procedures regarding misconduct  investigations that apply to all FEMA personnel and has also documented  policies and procedures regarding options to address misconduct and  appeal rights for Title 5 and CORE employees. However, FEMA has not  documented complete misconduct policies and procedures for Surge  Capacity Force members or Reservists.", "DHS issued the Surge Capacity Force Concept of Operations in 2010,  which outlines FEMA\u2019s base implementation plan for the Surge Capacity  Force. However, the document does not address any elements  pertaining to Surge Capacity Force human capital management,  specifically misconduct and disciplinary policies and procedures.  According to the FEMA Surge Capacity Force Coordinator, despite the  lack of documentation, any incidents of misconduct would likely be  investigated by FEMA\u2019s OCSO, which would then refer the completed  report of investigation to the employee\u2019s home component for  adjudication and potential disciplinary action. However, although no  allegations of misconduct were made at the time, the Federal  Coordinating Officer in charge of one of the Hurricane Sandy Joint Field  Offices said he had not seen anything in writing or any formal guidance  that documents or explains how the process would work and stated that  he would have had to contact FEMA headquarters for assistance in  determining how to address any misconduct.", "Without documented guidance, FEMA cannot ensure that Surge Capacity  Force misconduct is addressed adequately in a timely and  comprehensive manner. Therefore, in our July 2017 report we  recommended that the FEMA Administrator document policies and  procedures to address potential Surge Capacity Force misconduct. DHS  concurred and stated that FEMA is developing a Human Capital plan for  the Surge Capacity Force and will include policies and procedures  relating to potential misconduct. DHS estimated that this effort would be  completed by June 30, 2018. This action, if fully implemented, should  address the intent of the recommendation.", "Additionally, we found that FEMA\u2019s Reservist Program Manual lacks  documented policies and procedures on disciplinary options to address  misconduct and appeal rights for Reservists. Both LER and PLB officials  told us that, in practice, disciplinary actions for Reservists are limited to  reprimands and termination. According to these officials, FEMA does not  suspend Reservists because they are an intermittent, at-will workforce  deployed as needed to respond to disasters. Federal Coordinating  Officers and cadre managers have the authority to demobilize Reservists  and remove them from a Joint Field Office if misconduct occurs, which  may be done in lieu of suspension. Furthermore, LER and PLB officials  also told us that, in practice, FEMA grants Reservists the right to appeal a  reprimand or termination to their second-level supervisor. However, these  actions are not documented in the Reservist Program Manual.", "Without documented Reservist disciplinary options and appeals policies,  supervisors and Reservist employees may not be aware of all aspects of  the disciplinary and appeals process. Thus, in our July 2017 report, we  recommended that FEMA document Reservist disciplinary options and  appeals that are currently in practice at the agency. DHS concurred and  stated that FEMA will update its Reservist program directive to include  procedures for disciplinary actions and appeals currently in practice at the  agency. DHS estimated that this effort would be completed by December  31, 2017. This action, if fully implemented, should address the intent of  the recommendation.", "We also reported in our July 2017 report that FEMA does not  communicate the range of offenses and penalties to its entire workforce.  Namely, FEMA revised its employee disciplinary manual for Title 5  employees in 2015, and in doing so, eliminated the agency\u2019s table of  offenses and penalties. Tables of offenses and penalties are used by  agencies to provide guidance on the range of penalties available when  formal discipline is taken. They also provide awareness and inform  employees of the penalties which may be imposed for misconduct. Since  revising the manual and removing the table, FEMA no longer  communicates possible punishable offenses to its entire workforce.  Instead, information is now communicated to supervisors and employees  on an individual basis. Specifically, LER specialists currently use a  \u201ccomparators\u201d spreadsheet with historical data on previous misconduct  cases to determine a range of disciplinary or adverse actions for each  specific misconduct case. The information used to determine the range of  penalties is shared with the supervisor on a case-by-case basis; however,  LER specialists noted that due to privacy protections they are the only  FEMA officials who have access to the comparators spreadsheet.", "Because information about offenses and penalties is not universally  shared with supervisors and employees, FEMA management is limited in  its ability to set expectations about appropriate conduct in the workplace  and to communicate consequences of inappropriate conduct. We  recommended that FEMA communicate the range of penalties for specific  misconduct offenses to all employees and supervisors. DHS concurred  and stated that FEMA is currently drafting a table of offenses and  penalties and will take steps to communicate those penalties to  employees throughout the agency once the table is finalized. DHS  estimated that this effort would be completed by December 31, 2017.

For example,  one complaint categorized as integrity and ethics involved allegations that  a FEMA employee at a Joint Field Office was accepting illegal gifts from a  FEMA contractor and a state contractor. Another complaint categorized  as inappropriate comments and conduct involved allegations that a FEMA  employee\u2019s supervisor and other employees had bullied and cursed at  them, creating an unhealthy work environment.

However, the data are largely captured in narrative fields, making it  difficult to extract without manual review.", "In our July 2017 report we recommended that FEMA improve the quality  and usefulness of the misconduct data it collects by implementing quality  control measures, such as adding additional drop-down fields with  standardized entries, adding unique case identifier fields, developing  documented guidance for data entry, or considering the adoption of  database software. In addition, we recommended that FEMA conduct  routine reporting on employee misconduct trends once the quality of the  data is improved. DHS concurred and stated that FEMA is working with  the DHS OIG to develop a new case management system. The system  will use drop-down fields with standardized entries and provide tools for  trend analysis.
