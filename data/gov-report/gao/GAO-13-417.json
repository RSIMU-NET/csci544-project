GAO identified (1) leading company practices for purchasing services, and (2) potential opportunities for federal agencies to incorporate these practices based on prior work.", "To determine leading companies' practices in this area, GAO selected a nongeneralizable sample of companies based upon a literature search and recommendations from Defense and industry organizations that have studied services acquisition. GAO identified and interviewed officials from seven companies, an industry group, and a consulting organization. To identify opportunities for agencies to adopt leading practices, GAO compared the types of services purchased by agencies in fiscal year 2012 with those purchased by companies.

The federal government and leading companies buy many of the same services, such as facilities management, engineering, and information technology. Companies' keen analysis of spending, coupled with central management and knowledge sharing about the services they buy, is key to their savings. Their analysis of spending patterns can be described as comprising two essential variables: the complexity of the service and the number of suppliers for that service. Knowing these variables for any given service, companies tailor their tactics to fit the situation; they do not treat all services the same. Company tactics fall into four basic categories: (1) Standardize requirements, (2) Understand cost drivers, (3) Leverage scale, and (4) Prequalify suppliers.", "To illustrate how buying tactics are tailored, Walmart leverages its scale to compete basic or commodity services that have many suppliers, such as maintenance. When buying sophisticated services with few suppliers, such as consulting, Dell negotiates cost drivers such as labor rates. The framework is dynamic: over the long term, companies seek to reduce complexity and bring in additional suppliers to take advantage of market forces like competition.", "Federal agencies have sizable opportunities to leverage leading commercial practices to lower costs and maximize the value of the services they buy. In September 2012, GAO reported that large procurement agencies such as the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs leveraged only a fraction of their buying power through strategic sourcing and faced challenges analyzing reliable data on spending, securing leadership support, and applying this approach to acquiring services. GAO recommended that these agencies and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issue guidance, develop metrics, and take other actions. The agencies and OMB concurred. OMB directed agencies to take actions to overcome these challenges. Potential savings are significant considering a savings rate of 4 percent applied to the $307 billion spent by federal agencies on services in fiscal year 2012 would equate to $12 billion."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO has made recommendations in previous reports to help agencies strengthen strategic sourcing practices, which agencies concurred with and have planned actions under way."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2012, the federal government obligated $307 billion to  acquire services ranging from the management and operation of  government facilities, to information technology services, to research and  development.

Leading companies have been examining ways of  managing their services in order to stay competitive, respond to market  and stockholder pressures, and deal with economic downturns. We have  previously reported that leading companies implemented a strategic  approach to improve service acquisition outcomes and identified  opportunities for federal agencies, specifically the Department of Defense  (DOD), to implement improvements across the range of services they  purchase. Under the strategic sourcing approach, companies took a hard  look at how much they were spending on services and from whom they  were buying these services. This approach included identifying the  number of suppliers, the number of contracts, and prices paid across the  company to identify inefficiencies such as paying different rates for similar  services and suppliers, or not consolidating purchases across the  company to lower prices. Armed with this knowledge, companies were  able to leverage their buying power, reduce costs, and better manage  their suppliers.", "Given the trend of increased federal government spending on services  and today\u2019s constrained fiscal environment, there has been a renewed  focus on maximizing return on investment. You requested that we identify  practices used by large commercial organizations in purchasing services.  We briefed your staff on the results of this review. This report presents  those results. Specifically, we (1) identified leading company practices for  acquiring services, and (2) examined potential opportunities for federal  agencies to incorporate these practices.", "To determine leading companies\u2019 practices in this area, we selected a  nongeneralizable sample of companies based on (1) a literature search,  including our prior leading practices reports on services acquisition, and  (2) recommendations from the Defense Business Board, Defense  Science Board, and industry experts who have studied the issues. Based  on this approach, we identified and interviewed seven leading companies:  Boeing, Dell, Delphi, Humana, MasterCard, Pfizer, and Walmart; an  industry group: Institute for Supply Management; and a consulting  organization: A.T. Kearney. We identified key practices reported by  companies, including procurement organization structures, services  procurement history and strategies, initiatives and resultant savings, and  contracting methods. We also compared companies\u2019 procurement  practices with those identified in our prior work. To maximize the  applicability of our findings to the federal government, we identified the  top categories of services that the government acquired in fiscal year  2010 from the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation  (FPDS-NG)\u2014the government\u2019s system for tracking contracting data\u2014and  interviewed companies about their practices in those categories. We  analyzed company practices to identify common themes. We then  provided this information to the companies and they confirmed our  analysis. To assess the reliability of companies\u2019 data on acquisition  savings, we requested information on data quality control procedures and  system safeguards from company officials. In addition, we provided  relevant sections of a draft of this report to companies for review and  comment. To assess the reliability of FPDS-NG data, we reviewed  documentation and electronically tested data for obvious problems. We  determined that the company and FPDS-NG data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report. To further identify opportunities for  agencies to adopt leading companies\u2019 practices, we also compared the  types of services purchased by companies and agencies in fiscal year  2012 and relied on our recent, relevant work that examined federal  strategic sourcing efforts.

Table 1 lists the top services purchased by federal  agencies in fiscal year 2012, which range in complexity from defense  research and development to housekeeping.", "We previously reported that agencies have had difficulty managing  services acquisitions and have purchased services inefficiently which  places them at risk of paying more than necessary.can be attributed to several factors. First, agencies have had difficulty  defining requirements for services, such as developing clear statements  of work which can reduce the government\u2019s risk of paying for more  services than needed. Second, agencies have not always leveraged  knowledge of contractor costs when selecting contract types, including  time-and-materials contracts, performance-based contracts, and  undefinitized contracts. Third, agencies have missed opportunities to   These inefficiencies  increase competition for services due to overly restrictive and complex  requirements; a lack of access to proprietary, technical data; and supplier  preferences.", "Agencies purchase services under the Federal Acquisition Regulation,  which places some constraints on how contracts are competed and  awarded. Generally, agencies are statutorily required to award contracts  using full and open competition, unless an exception applies. Additionally,  agencies are subject to certain requirements when awarding contracts,  such as meeting the Small Business Administration\u2019s annual statutory  goals to make awards to various kinds of small businesses.", "GAO has been assessing strategic sourcing and the potential value of  applying these techniques to federal acquisitions for more than a decade.  In 2002, GAO reported that leading companies of that time committed to  a strategic approach to acquiring services\u2014a process that moves a  company away from numerous individual procurements to a broader  aggregate approach\u2014including developing knowledge of how much they  were spending on services and taking an enterprise-wide approach to  services acquisition. As a result, companies made structural changes  with top leadership support, such as establishing commodity managers\u2014 responsible for purchasing services within a category\u2014and were better  able to leverage their buying power to achieve substantial savings. We  have emphasized the importance of comprehensive spend analysis for  efficient procurement since 2002. Spend analysis provides knowledge  about how much is being spent for goods and services, who the buyers  are, who the suppliers are, and where the opportunities are to save  money and improve performance. In 2005, the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) defined strategic sourcing as a structured process based  on spend analysis to make business decisions about acquiring  commodities and services more efficiently and effectively.", "In 2007, GAO reviewed DOD\u2019s processes for acquiring services and  found that DOD could take further action to improve its strategic sourcing.", "GAO reported that the department\u2019s approach had tended to be reactive  and did not fully address key factors for success at either the strategic  (organization-wide) or transactional (individual services transaction) level.  GAO recommended that DOD take a proactive approach to managing  strategic and transactional level service acquisitions elements, including  communicating where individual transactions can then be made to  support strategic goals. Key factors at the transactional level included  clearly defined requirements, appropriate contracting vehicles, and  effective contractor oversight."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Leading Companies Achieve Significant Savings through a Strategic Approach That Establishes Goals, Builds Market Knowledge, and Tailors Procurement Tactics to Different Services", "paragraphs": ["The leading companies we studied used a strategic sourcing approach to  achieve sustained annual savings, over prior year spending, of 4-15  percent in services over the last 5-7 years. This strategic approach drives  companies to continually strive for savings, partly spurred by annual  goals. To enable this process, companies rely on five foundational  principles to build spending and market knowledge and gain situational  awareness of their procurement environment. In the short term,  companies use this knowledge to adjust their procurement tactics for  different types of services depending on service complexity and number  of available suppliers in order to best achieve savings and efficiencies.  This enables companies to target the full range of services they buy. In  the long term, companies try to address their procurement constraints by  reducing requirements complexity to commoditize services and  developing new suppliers to increase competition. This allows companies  to more aggressively leverage their buying power for all types of services."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Companies Foster a Culture of Savings through Setting Goals and Ensuring Accountability", "paragraphs": ["Each of the leading companies we reviewed used annual savings  expectations to drive a corporate culture of savings. For example,  Walmart\u2019s executive leadership sets annual savings goals for their  services procurement division; in 2012, the goal was to save around $100  million, or about 8 percent, of the division\u2019s $1.2 billion budget. A Walmart  official emphasized the importance of savings expectations and  accountability, noting that the very act of establishing goals and metrics  helps enable a culture of savings.  \u201cIf you measure it, it will happen.\u201d", "Companies further translate savings expectations into individual  performance goals to which executives and employees are held  accountable. Savings expectations are allocated to each procurement  team member and the head of procurement regularly reviews progress.  This metric-based accountability spurs companies\u2019 culture of savings, but  is not necessarily dictated by leadership.", "Dell establishes savings expectations and metrics in cooperation with  procurement staff. These metrics are tied to individual performance  contract goals to which staff are held accountable with quarterly  reviews. Top performers are tapped to lead teams and manage critical  procurement projects.", "At Delphi, savings targets are initiated by both procurement staff and  leadership. The process continues iteratively until all parties agree to  a final savings target, including after considering areas where costs  are expected to actually rise due to economic conditions.", "Additional incentives can drive this culture of savings; for example,  one company allows business units to reinvest savings into their  operations, primarily to fund innovation and strategic initiatives.", "Having such a culture is critical to companies\u2019 continual pursuit of savings  and efficiencies. A Pfizer official described this culture as being part of the  company\u2019s DNA.  \u201cSavings is in our DNA.\u201d", "Leading companies reported achieving a sustained savings rate of 4-15  percent annually on services procurement by strategically sourcing the  full range of services they buy. Companies achieved these savings after  increasing their focus on services acquisitions over the last 5-7 years.  Companies reported using the same general procurement strategies and  tactics for both goods and services. However, the impetus for an  increased focus on services was leadership recognition that spending had  significantly increased, resulting in additional dedicated resources to  manage this area.", "Companies chose different paths to begin the process of improving the  efficiency of services acquisition. For example, Pfizer conducted a spend  analysis in 2007 which revealed increased spending on legal, consulting,  and financial services, as well as opportunities for improving the efficiency  of its processes. Boeing\u2019s Chief Executive Officer made tackling services  spending a priority after noticing how much was being spent in this area  compared to the company\u2019s spending on items directly affecting  customers. This led Boeing to adopt a company-wide procurement model  in 2006. Delphi centralized indirect procurement\u2014products and services  used in support of Delphi\u2019s operations\u2014between 2005 and 2007 in order  to improve efficiency and drive savings. Some companies reported  achieving the greatest amount of savings in the initial years after  prioritizing their procurement of services. For example, Dell reported  achieving 23 percent savings in the first year after increasing its focus on  improving services acquisition, and has been able to sustain 10 percent in  savings thereafter. Another company noted that it is typical to achieve  larger savings at the beginning and that the savings percent goes down  over time, to around 4-7 percent annually. Table 2 below highlights  examples of the annual savings companies reported in 2012, and the  main services they buy.", "Leading companies generally agreed that foundational principles\u2014 maintaining spend visibility, centralizing procurement, developing  category strategies, focusing on total cost of ownership, and regularly  reviewing strategies and tactics\u2014are all important to achieving successful  services acquisition outcomes. Taken together, these principles enable  companies to better identify and share information on spending and  increase market knowledge about suppliers to gain situational awareness  of their procurement environment. This awareness positions companies  to make more informed contracting decisions.", "Each company we spoke with had a history of struggling with fragmented  information on spending, which did not allow them to spot inefficiencies or  opportunities for consolidating purchases. For example, Humana\u2019s Chief  Procurement Officer (CPO) conducted a year-long spend analysis effort  which revealed, among other things, cases where a supplier charged  different rates to different departments for the same service. Dell  emphasized the importance of actively monitoring spending trends in  order to identify opportunities for savings. As one official put it,  unmanaged spend is by definition inefficient.  \u201cUnmanaged spend equals inefficiency.\u201d", "To address these issues, companies maintain visibility into spending by  integrating procurement and financial systems across the organization.  For example, in 1999, Boeing upgraded its paper-based manual  processes for procurement to a new, automated system which enabled  more efficient spend analysis. The new system also increased operational  efficiency because it provided a common language and data set for the  procurement staff. To aid efficient spend analysis, Boeing defined a  services taxonomy to allow analysis at the invoice line item level. Invoice  line items are defined beforehand\u2014called billing units\u2014and are built into  contract statements of work. Dell, Delphi, and Humana also reported  using centralized databases that provide transparency into their global  spend. Similarly, in 2012, Walmart started implementing a centralized  database to increase spend visibility.", "In addition to leveraging knowledge about spending, leading companies  centralize procurement decisions by aligning, prioritizing, and integrating  procurement functions within the organization. The companies we spoke  with overcame the challenge of having a decentralized approach to  purchasing services, which had made it difficult to share knowledge  internally or use consistent procurement tactics. Without a centralized  procurement process, officials told us, companies ran the risk that  different parts of the organization could be unwittingly buying the same  item or service, thereby missing an opportunity to share knowledge of  procurement tactics proven to reduce costs. Company officials noted that  centralizing procurement does not necessarily refer to centralizing  procurement activity, but to centralizing procurement knowledge. For  example, Dell\u2019s procurement organization is centralized, and utilizes a  common tool, enabling cost data to be shared globally. Global Category  Managers are expected to have a good understanding of all aspects of  the services within their category. Clearly defined and communicated  policies ensure users cannot engage with suppliers without procurement  organization involvement. Similarly, Pfizer has \u201ccategory teams\u201d with a  global reach for broad groupings of services with category managers  assigned to each category. The global category zone leads are managed  by Vice-Presidents who report directly to the head of the procurement  organization and work with internal business partners, who execute  contracts on a company-wide basis or locally as needed. Boeing has a  team of financial analysts that support the procurement function by  conducting \u201cshould cost\u201d analyses and providing supplier or service cost  breakdowns to procurement agents.  \u201cCentralize the knowledge, not the activity.\u201d", "Company officials told us that the key to an effective centralized process  is ensuring that services spending goes through approved contracts. A  Walmart official referred to non-approved spending as \u201crogue buying.\u201d  Companies focus on compliance in order to eliminate unapproved  purchases. For example, Delphi aims for 95 percent of its sourcing to  adhere to pre-approved category strategies. The company uses an  internally developed database to manage all sourcing initiatives from  concept to business case to approval by the procurement and financial  organizations. Pfizer has a policy that procurement transactions over  $100,000 must be competitively bid with limited, documented exceptions.    \u201cYou must eliminate rogue buying.\u201d", "Companies develop category-specific procurement strategies with  stakeholder buy-in in order to use the most effective sourcing strategies  for each category. Category-specific procurement strategies describe the  most cost-effective sourcing vehicles and supplier selection criteria to be  used for each category of service, depending on factors such as current  and projected requirements, volume, cyclicality of demand, risk, the  services that the market is able to provide, supplier base competition  trends, the company\u2019s relative buying power, and market price trends. For  example, Dell\u2019s Global Category Managers oversee teams that develop  detailed sourcing strategies for each commodity. The major components  of the sourcing strategies are (1) internal analyses which include spend  analysis, stakeholder analysis, business requirements, and cost  modeling; and (2) external analyses which include market research and  supply market analysis.", "Company officials told us that category strategies help them conduct their  sourcing according to a proactive strategic plan and not just on a reactive,  contract-by-contract basis. One company\u2019s CPO referred to the latter as a  \u201cthree bids and a buy\u201d mentality that can be very narrowly focused and  result in missed opportunities such as not leveraging purchases across  the enterprise or making decisions based only on short term  requirements. For this reason, Boeing sometimes chooses to execute a  short-term contract to buy time if market research shows a more  competitive deal can be obtained later.  \u201cYou cannot just go with a \u2018three bids and a buy\u2019 contracting approach.\u201d", "Category strategies also help companies choose sourcing tactics  appropriate to their circumstances. For example, as one company noted,  in one category it may be very beneficial to conduct competitive bidding  via online reverse auctions, while in another category it may be wise to  forego any competitive bidding and extend and lock in pricing based on  market dynamics.strategies for travel and information technology services in order to  leverage purchases globally, but region-based strategies for services  such as facilities management which are used by individual Delphi  facilities. Companies develop strategies that identify the choice of  sourcing vehicles and supplier selection criteria only after extensive  consultation with internal users. This consultation helps procurement staff  better understand user requirements as well as obtain their buy-in.  According to one company CPO, user buy-in is critical; otherwise users  may think that a desire to reduce cost is the only factor driving the choice  of sourcing tactics.", "In another instance, Delphi has global, company-wide  Risk is an important consideration when developing category strategies  and setting priorities. Dell considers factors such as data privacy and  security, financial stability, continuity of supply, and geographic economic  conditions to ensure the proper considerations and protections are in  place prior to finalizing supplier selection decisions. Routine services  such as store and parking lot maintenance services are critical to  Walmart\u2019s mission of retail, demanding a high level of attention. Delphi  and Boeing have a policy of minimizing the risk of transitioning to new  suppliers. For this reason, Boeing retains some staff with subject matter  expertise to oversee contracts in each category and know how the  supplier is meeting those requirements. This ensures flexibility for Boeing  in case the company chooses to change suppliers in the future.", "Companies focus on total cost of ownership\u2014making a holistic purchase  decision by considering factors other than price. At the strategic\u2014or  higher\u2014level, managing internal demand is an important element of  reducing total cost of ownership. For example, Humana closely examines  services requirements in order to prevent unnecessary spending on  services the company does not absolutely need. Boeing considers  internal costs, such as the administrative cost per transaction or purchase  order to determine price and efficiency trade-offs. Dell considers factors  such as risk to the company\u2019s mission, innovation, operational  performance, and demand management. Dell and Delphi examine  suppliers\u2019 management models for maturity, including how well they  manage and train staff and use appropriate cost management tools. In  fact, a Dell official said that the quality of a service is largely determined  by the quality of the supplier\u2019s management structure.  \u201cWhen purchasing a service, you are essentially paying for the quality of  suppliers\u2019 management processes.\u201d", "At the transactional\u2014or lower\u2014level, incorporating non-price factors can  be important inputs into decision making. For example, while Walmart  may often award a contract to the lowest bidder, it takes other  considerations into account\u2014such as average invoice price, time spent  on location, average time to complete a task, supplier diversity, and  sustainability\u2014when awarding contracts. Humana is developing internal  rate cards for consulting services that would help the company evaluate  contractors\u2019 labor rates based on their skill level. Pfizer\u2019s procurement  organization monitors compliance with company processes and billing  guidelines. The company considers its procurement professionals as  essentially risk managers rather than contract managers because they  need to consider what\u2019s best for the company and how to minimize total  cost of ownership while maintaining flexibility.", "Companies regularly review strategies and tactics to adapt to market  trends. This provides room for flexibility in managing suppliers\u2014 something companies we spoke with valued. Walmart officials  emphasized the importance of frequently reviewing tactics in order to  identify new opportunities for savings. For this reason, Walmart constantly  evaluates new ways to invite bids and new types of pricing tiers by which  to lower prices, such as by state or region or volume. Delphi\u2019s strategies  are formally reviewed and documented annually by Delphi\u2019s strategic  council comprised of senior company executives. These reviews may  result in changing tactics or suppliers according to predetermined goals.  For example, for a particular category, Delphi may not want to represent  more than a certain percentage of any supplier\u2019s revenue in order to  minimize risk that the supplier may be overly dependent on Delphi for  long-term viability. If the reviews highlight cases where the limit is  exceeded, Delphi examines ways to bring in an additional supplier.  \u201cYou must continually stay ahead of suppliers or they will figure you out.\u201d", "Similarly, Dell regularly assesses whether to \u201cmake or buy\u201d services,  conducting objective evaluations of internal capability versus that of  external providers. In some instances, although Dell may have the  capability in-house, they may not have available resources at that point in  time, and may therefore elect to purchase that particular service. In order  to retain flexibility to adapt to market trends, companies view long-term  contracts (generally over 3 years) as risky. For example, Pfizer will  examine market conditions and unbundle contracts\u2014use separate  contracts for multiple services\u2014for greater transparency and to bring  more suppliers into the mix; later on Pfizer might bundle contracts to gain  leverage as part of the strategy. Similarly, Delphi prefers contract lengths  of under 3 to 4 years because of the difficulty of predicting the future price  trends of key cost components\u2014for example, fuel, which is a significant  cost component of services involving travel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Companies Tailor Their Procurement Tactics to Each Type of Service Depending on Complexity and Availability of Suppliers", "paragraphs": ["By following the foundational principles to improve knowledge about their  procurement environment, companies are well positioned to choose  procurement tactics tailored to each service.

Two factors\u2014the degree of complexity of the service  and the number of available suppliers\u2014determine the choice of one of  four general categories of procurement tactics appropriate for that  service: leveraging scale, standardizing requirements, prequalifying  suppliers, and understanding cost drivers.

More complex services\u2014referred to as  knowledge-based services\u2014are those where requirements are more  complex, performance more difficult to measure, and where service  provider staff skill levels are paramount; for example, research and  development, engineering and management support, and legal services.", "The number of suppliers that can fulfill a service varies depending on  market conditions and whether specialized skills and knowledge are  required.

For  illustration purposes, the table shows the two factors at the extremes of  their range of possibilities.", "Companies we reviewed are not content to remain limited by their  environment; over the long term, they generally seek to reduce the  complexity of requirements and bring additional suppliers into the mix in  order to commoditize services and leverage competition. This dynamic,  strategic approach has helped companies demonstrate annual, sustained  savings. Companies generally aim to commoditize services over the long  term as much as possible because, according to them, the level of  complexity directly correlates with cost. Companies also aim to increase  competition, whether by developing new suppliers or reducing  requirements complexity, which could allow more suppliers to compete. In  doing so, companies can leverage scale and competition to lower costs.  \u201cComplexity drives cost.\u201d", "Figure 3 below depicts most companies\u2019 overall goal of commoditizing  services over the long term, as depicted by the goal of moving services to  the lower-left quadrant of companies\u2019 transactional framework shown  earlier.", "The two factors\u2014complexity and supplier availability\u2014influence what  tactics are best suited to each quadrant of services as shown in table 4  below.", "For commodity services with many suppliers, such as administrative  support, facilities maintenance, and housekeeping, companies generally  focus on leveraging scale and competition to lower cost. The figure on the  left shows the companies\u2019 transactional framework discussed earlier and  highlights the quadrant represented by commodity services that are  served by many suppliers. Typical tactics applicable to this quadrant of  services include consolidating purchases across the organization; using  fixed price contracts; developing procurement catalogs with pre- negotiated prices for some services; and varying bidding parameters such  as volume and scale in order to find new ways to reduce costs. For  example, Walmart continually lowers costs on store maintenance services  such as parking lot maintenance by inviting bids on a regional or national  basis. Bidders are required to submit quotes based on a variety of options  that are thoroughly discussed ahead of time, such as the number of  stores or regions and contract length. This helps Walmart identify new  contract parameters by which to reduce costs. Boeing has begun  developing procurement catalogs for commonly acquired routine and low- dollar services. The catalogs list approved suppliers and negotiated  prices to allow users to directly execute contracts up to a certain amount.", "For commodity services with few suppliers, such as specialized logistics  and utilities, companies focus on standardizing requirements. Typical  tactics applicable to this quadrant of services include paring back  requirements in order to bring them more in line with standard industry  offerings, and developing new suppliers to maintain a competitive  industrial base. For example, Walmart holds pre-bid conferences with  suppliers such as those supplying store security for \u201cBlack Friday\u201d\u2014the  major shopping event on the day after Thanksgiving\u2014to discuss  requirements and what suppliers can provide. Delphi makes an effort to  maintain a competitive industrial base by dual-sourcing certain services in  order to minimize future risk\u2014a cost trade-off.", "For knowledge-based services with many suppliers, such as information  technology, legal, and financial services, companies prequalify and  prioritize suppliers to highlight the most competent and reasonable  suppliers. Typical tactics applicable to this quadrant of services include  prequalifying suppliers by skill level and labor hour rates; and tracking  supplier performance over time in order to inform companies\u2019 prioritization  of suppliers based on efficiency. For example, Pfizer Legal Alliance was  created to channel the majority of legal services to pre-selected firms.  Delphi only awards contracts to companies on their Category Approved  Supplier List. The list is approved by Delphi leadership and is reviewed  annually.", "For knowledge-based services with few suppliers, such as engineering  and management support and research and development services,  companies aim to maximize value by better understanding and  negotiating individual components that drive cost. Typical tactics  applicable to this quadrant of services include negotiating better rates on  the cost drivers for a given service; closely monitoring supplier  performance against pre-defined standards; benchmarking supplier rates  against industry averages in order to identify excess costs; and improving  collaboration with suppliers. Some companies leverage their knowledge  of cost drivers in order to use time and materials contracts\u2014a contract  type that we have reported as high-risk, mainly because of inadequate  oversight\u2014because that allows them to negotiate individual rates. For  example, Dell\u2019s forensic costing process breaks down service costs to the  smallest component\u2014for example, labor rates and even raw materials  such as fuel. Cost knowledge is shared throughout Dell\u2019s procurement  organization, providing an advantage in negotiating contracts. Boeing  uses benchmark clauses in some contracts, requiring that supplier rates  be within a specified percentage of the benchmarked average as  determined by third-party research firms such as Gartner Group.
