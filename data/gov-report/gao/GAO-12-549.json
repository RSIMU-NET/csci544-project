The cost of credits claimed was $468 million. Most claims were limited to partial rather than full percentage credits (35 percent for small businesses) because of the average wage or full-time equivalent (FTE) requirements. 28,100 employers claimed the full credit percentage. In addition, 30 percent of claims had the base premium limited by the state premium average.", "One factor limiting the credit\u0092s use is that most very small employers, 83 percent by one estimate, do not offer health insurance. According to employer representatives, tax preparers, and insurance brokers that GAO met with, the credit was not large enough to incentivize employers to begin offering insurance. Complex rules on FTEs and average wages also limited use. In addition, tax preparer groups GAO met with generally said the time needed to calculate the credit deterred claims. Options to address these factors, such as expanded eligibility requirements, have trade-offs, including less precise targeting of employers and higher costs to the Federal government.", "The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) incorporated practices used successfully for prior tax provisions and from IRS strategic objectives into its compliance efforts for the credit. However, the instructions provided to its examiners (1) do not address the credit\u0092s eligibility requirements for employers with non-U.S. addresses and (2) have less detail for reviewing the eligibility of tax-exempt entities\u0092 health insurance plans compared to those for reviewing small business plans. These omissions may cause examiners to overlook or inconsistently treat possible noncompliance. Further, IRS does not systematically analyze examination results to understand the types of errors and whether examinations are the best way to correct each type. As a result, IRS is less able to ensure that resources target errors with the credit rather than compliant claimants.", "Currently available data on health insurance that could be used to evaluate the effects of the credit do not match the credit\u0092s eligibility requirements, such as information to convert data on number of employees to FTEs.

This  indicates that other factors contributed to employers not claiming the  credit. Further, it is hard to interpret the impact of awareness on claims  because these surveys included an unknown number of small business  employers that would not be eligible for the credit regardless of their  awareness. For those employers that were unaware, the surveys did not  account for their accountants or tax preparers that may have known about  the credit but did not tell their clients about it because they did not believe  their clients would qualify or because the credit amount would be very  small.

TEGE instructions do not suggest these  steps and also do not provide a prompt for examiners to ensure that  insurance premiums paid on behalf of seasonal employees are included  in calculations.", "According to IRS officials, the TEGE examiners are trained specifically for  doing examinations on the credit and therefore need less guidance than  SB/SE examiners, who work on multiple issues simultaneously. However,  TEGE examination documents contain detailed guidance in a workbook  format for these trained examiners on other credit requirements. Without  detailed guidance for TEGE examiners that instructs them on how to  examine health insurance documents, examiners may not consistently  identify noncompliance, which could lead to erroneous credit refunds.  This could particularly be the case as examining health insurance  documents to check eligibility for this new credit has not been typical work  for these examiners."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Examinations Under Way, but IRS Needs to Develop a Plan for Efficiently Analyzing Results on Credit Compliance", "paragraphs": ["For tax year 2010, SB/SE plans to conduct over 1,500 examinations  related to the credit, and TEGE anticipates about 1,000 examinations. An  SB/SE official said the number of examinations is expected to provide  initial compliance information and allow IRS to establish a compliance  presence without committing too many resources initially. TEGE selected  its number of examinations based on resource decisions, before tax year  2010 claims began. Neither SB/SE nor TEGE adjusted the number of  examinations once actual claim numbers were known. As a result, the  percentage of TEGE claims being examined is high, according to a TEGE  official. Table 1 summarizes the status of IRS\u2019s examinations on the  credit.", "IRS\u2019s database on examination results tracks the aggregate dollar  amount of tax changes as a result of the examination but does not  contain the reason a change is made. Consequently, IRS is not able to  isolate and analyze examination results related to the credit versus other  tax issues. This is particularly a problem for SB/SE examinations, which   Instead, as initial examinations  may cover issues other than the credit.have closed, IRS officials said that management has spoken with  examiners about findings related to the credit. This has been possible  because of the relatively low initial volume of cases, but this approach  may not be feasible as results accumulate. Therefore, it is not clear how  IRS can efficiently analyze results to decide whether changes are  necessary in how it examines the credit or how it educates small  employers about how to comply with the credit\u2019s rules, and whether it  committed too many or too few resources to examinations of the credit.", "Furthermore, IRS does not have criteria for deciding whether the  resources spent on examinations of the credit are appropriate, given the  amount of errors found. IRS officials said that for future years they plan to  select the number of credit examinations based on past results, identified  compliance risks, and available resources. However, without criteria to  assess the results in concert with these risks and resources, IRS is less  able to ensure that examination resources target errors with the credit,  rather than examining compliant claimants.", "For example, early examination results (as of February 2012) show that  67 percent of the examinations completed were closed without changing  the credit amount. Examinations without a change burden taxpayers and  use IRS resources. We recognize that few of the planned examinations  have been completed and the \u201cno change\u201d percentage could change.  According to IRS officials, cases resulting in \u201cno change\u201d tend to be the  first cases closed because they close more quickly than cases requiring a  change. However, IRS is not using change rate information from prior tax  credits to determine if examinations for the credit have a \u201chigh\u201d no-change  rate, which could be one indicator to help decide how many examination  resources to apply to the credit. IRS officials said they do not plan to use  data from examinations of other tax provisions to benchmark measures\u2014 such as the no-change rate or length of time an examination is open\u2014 because results would not be comparable.", "A summary of examination results specific to the credit could also inform  decisions about using additional compliance tools such as soft notices.In the past, IRS has used soft notices to correct errors and collect funds  without initiating an examination.implementing the credit said IRS has not ruled out using soft notices, but  examination results would need to identify an issue that would justify their  use. He said soft notices are not effective for all taxpayers or situations.  He said IRS would consider using soft notices if officials found a series of  returns with mistakes from the same tax preparer or promoter of tax  schemes. Furthermore, soft notices may necessitate follow-up, which  would negate some of the advantages of the notices. If IRS analysis  showed that examinations were not a cost-effective way to pursue certain  errors made in claiming a credit, a soft notice may offer another approach  to improving compliance with lower costs to IRS and less burden on  claimants."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Data to Evaluate Many Questions about the Effects of the Credit Are Not Available", "paragraphs": ["There are a variety of research questions that could be of interest to  policymakers about the effects of the credit that cannot be evaluated with  data currently available.

For example, the available data on employer- sponsored health insurance do not align with the credit\u2019s eligibility criteria,  according to our interviews with subject matter specialists and our review  of the data (see app. VI for a summary of the data sources), nor could we  identify a data source that tracks when, and why, employers begin  offering insurance. As a result of the limitations with all three types of  data, it would be difficult to precisely measure changes in health  insurance availability, offering, and costs because of the credit, without  collecting additional data. Isolating influential factors\u2014such as those  shown in figure 5\u2014that may contribute to the effects of the credit would  also be a challenge in an evaluation.", "IRS officials said they will not collect data on credit claimants, outside of  those collected on Form 8941. IRS\u2019s position on data collection for all  provisions of the tax code is that it only collects data it needs to ensure  compliance with the tax laws.", "Collecting additional data needed for policy evaluation would have costs,  and the magnitude of those costs would depend on the type and amount  of data needed, which depends on the research questions being asked.  An additional consideration in thinking about the benefits and costs of  additional data collection for policy evaluation purposes is the time limits  on claiming the credit. The current version of the credit runs through the  end of 2014.
