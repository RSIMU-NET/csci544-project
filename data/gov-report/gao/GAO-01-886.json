Currently, more than 5,600 employers pay special minimum wages to about 424,000 workers. The Department of Labor is responsible for the oversight of the provisions of section 14(c). Labor\u2019s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) of the Employment Standards Administration has responsibility for administering the special minimum wage program. Employers must obtain a certificate from WHD in order to pay workers with disabilities less than the federal minimum wage. WHD\u2019s responsibilities for administering the program include reviewing applications filed by employers for new 14(c) certificates and renewals, issuing the certificates, providing guidance and training to its own staff and employers, monitoring and enforcing compliance by employers, and ensuring that workers are paid the correct wages.", "Some advocates for workers with disabilities believe that the special minimum wage provisions are necessary because they provide employment opportunities for many of these individuals. However, others have concerns about the appropriateness of paying these workers less than the minimum wage, including whether the provisions encourage individuals with disabilities to work indefinitely in settings primarily with other workers with disabilities rather than obtain jobs in the community.In particular, legislative proposals have been made that would eliminate the special minimum wage provisions of the act for individuals with visual impairments. Although these proposals have drawn attention to the provisions of section 14(c), little is known about workers paid special minimum wages, their employers, or the Department of Labor\u2019s oversight of the provisions. To provide the Congress with information it can use to evaluate these proposals, you asked us to (1) describe the characteristics of employers that employ individuals with disabilities at less than the minimum wage under the provisions of section 14(c), (2) describe the characteristics of workers with disabilities who earn less than the minimum wage, and (3) assess Labor\u2019s management of the special minimum wage program.", "To obtain this information, we surveyed a random sample of work centersand businesses nationwide that, according to Labor records, were authorized to employ workers with disabilities at special minimum wages during calendar year 2000 and visited eight work sites where workers with disabilities are paid special minimum wages: Georgia, Illinois, Texas, and Virginia (one site each); and California and New York (two sites each). The sites were selected on the basis of their geographic location, the predominant impairment of the facilities\u2019 workers, and the number of workers paid special minimum wages in order to obtain sites that were either typical of those in the program or to meet specific selection criteria, such as including one facility that employed primarily workers with visual impairments. In addition, we talked with researchers, disability advocacy groups, employer groups, employers, 14(c) workers, and parents or guardians of 14(c) workers; interviewed Labor officials; and reviewed agency documents, databases, and individual case files.", "We limited the scope of our study to work centers and businesses. Although schools, hospitals, and other facilities that provide residential care also employ workers with disabilities at special minimum wages, these entities are not typical of 14(c) employers in general and represent a small proportion of all 14(c) employers (2 percent are schools and 5 percent are hospitals or other residential care facilities). (See app. I for a detailed description of our scope and methodology.) We conducted our work from August 2000 through July 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Although estimates of the employment rate for individuals with disabilities vary, researchers and advocates agree that it is much lower than the employment rate for the U.S. workforce as a whole, particularly for individuals whose impairments are severe enough to affect their ability to work. The purpose of the provisions of section 14(c) of FLSA, as stated in the legislation, is to prevent the curtailment of employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities. An individual with a disability eligible to be paid special minimum wages is defined in the regulations as someone \u201cwhose earning or productive capacity is impaired by a physical or mental disability, including those relating to age or injury, for the work to be performed.\u201d Determining the impact of the legislation on the employment opportunities of individuals with disabilities severe enough to be eligible to be paid special minimum wages, including whether the purpose of the legislation to not curtail employment opportunities for these individuals is achieved, however, is difficult.", "Most individuals with disabilities who are employed are not paid special minimum wages under the provisions of section 14(c) of FLSA. Many workers with disabilities cannot be paid special minimum wages because their impairments are not severe enough to affect their ability to perform their jobs; others receive accommodations and special support services that allow them to earn at least the minimum wage. Individuals with disabilities work in many different types of employment settings, including jobs in businesses where they work mainly with individuals who do not have disabilities and in work centers where they often work primarily with other individuals with disabilities. Some individuals with disabilities work in jobs with no special support services. In such cases, they generally are not paid special minimum wages under the provisions of section 14(c) because they are able to perform the work at a fully productive level. Individuals with impairments severe enough to affect their ability to perform the work, however, often require support services such as job coaches or special on-site supervision in order to obtain and retain their jobs and many are paid at special minimum wage rates.", "Many of the work centers that employ individuals with disabilities are nonprofit organizations established to provide support services and training as well as employment opportunities for these individuals. Many of these work centers were established by groups of parents of individuals with disabilities and by vocational rehabilitation specialists. Work centers receive much of their funding through state and county agencies from funds provided for support services and vocational training for individuals with disabilities. State and county agencies usually provide funds to work centers in the form of grants or reimbursements for services.", "To carry out Labor\u2019s oversight of the provisions of section 14(c) of FLSA, the Secretary issued regulations that define the requirements of the law and delegated authority to WHD for the administration of the special minimum wage program. WHD staff review and approve employers\u2019 applications for new 14(c) certificates and renewals that allow them to pay individuals with disabilities less than the federal minimum wage, which is currently $5.15 an hour. Work centers and hospitals are required to renew their 14(c) certificates every 2 years; businesses and schools must renew their 14(c) certificates annually. Because most 14(c) employers are work centers that have employed 14(c) workers for many years, most of the 14(c) certificate applications that WHD staff review are applications for renewal. In states that have a higher minimum wage rate than the federal minimum wage, the state rate takes precedence. Employers are required to establish the special minimum wage rate(s) for each worker they employ under the act and to show how they established these rates in the certificate application packages they submit to Labor.", "The process of establishing special minimum wage rates is complex. First, employers must identify the prevailing wage in their geographic area for experienced workers who do not have disabilities that affect their ability to perform the work and who perform the same or similar work. They must then measure the actual productivity of the workers for each job they perform as compared to the productivity of experienced workers who do not have disabilities. Finally, employers must calculate the special minimum wage rate by applying the worker\u2019s productivity rate to the prevailing wage for the job and factoring in the quality of the work performed. For example, if a 14(c) worker\u2019s productivity for a specific job is 50 percent of that of experienced workers who do not have disabilities that affect their work, and the prevailing wage paid to experienced workers for that job is $6.00 an hour, the special minimum wage rate for the 14(c) worker in performing that job would be $3.00 an hour. Workers are paid either hourly rates of pay or piece rates for the number of pieces they produce. Most service jobs are paid at an hourly rate, while most assembly work is paid at a piece rate.", "Employers are also required to obtain a 14(c) certificate in order to pay workers with disabilities less than the hourly wage for contracts covered under the Service Contract Act and the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act. These rates are often higher than the federal minimum wage, particularly for work performed under the Service Contract Act. Therefore, 14(c) workers employed under these contracts may earn more than the federal minimum wage. For example, a worker who has a disability might work under a contract covered by the Service Contract Act for which the contract rate is $15.00 an hour. If a 14(c) worker is only able to perform the work at 50 percent of the productivity level of workers who do not have disabilities that affect their ability to perform the work, he or she would be paid $7.50 an hour.", "Labor monitors and enforces employer compliance by reviewing employers\u2019 14(c) certificate application packages and by conducting investigations of employers. The 14(c) certification team in WHD\u2019s Midwest Regional Office verifies that employers have correctly computed the special minimum wages of their workers by reviewing the documentation in their 14(c) certificate application packages. WHD selects employers for 14(c) investigations either through complaints filed on behalf of workers (by the workers themselves or by their parents or guardians) or by conducting self-initiated investigations of employers selected through criteria developed by WHD officials. The WHD Regional Administrators, with guidance from WHD\u2019s national office, set the priorities for investigations of employers. Labor\u2019s WHD investigators are responsible for enforcing compliance with all aspects of FLSA, including the provisions of section 14(c). When Labor determines through a review of an employer\u2019s certificate renewal application package or an investigation that an employer has underpaid its 14(c) workers, it requires the employer to compute the amount of back wages owed to these workers for a period of 2 years prior to the date of Labor\u2019s review.", "In addition to monitoring and enforcing compliance through its reviews of employer\u2019s 14(c) certificate renewal applications and investigations of employers, Labor ensures employer compliance through its training and outreach efforts for its own staff and 14(c) employers. Because the process of establishing special minimum wage rates is complex, Labor considers these efforts to be an important aspect of its oversight responsibilities for the special minimum wage program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Employers Are Work Centers That Provide Employment and Support Services to Individuals With Disabilities", "paragraphs": ["The majority of 14(c) employers are nonprofit work centers established to provide support services and employment to individuals with disabilities.

Most of these jobs are carried out under contracts with government agencies and private companies. The major sources of funds for work centers are state and county agencies and contracts. While virtually all work centers offer one or more support services designed to help 14(c) workers perform their jobs, the range of services they are able to provide depends on the availability of funding and the eligibility criteria established by the funding agencies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Majority of 14(c) Employers Are Work Centers", "paragraphs": ["About 5,600 employers were paying workers with disabilities special minimum wages under certificates issued under the provisions of section 14(c) at the time of our survey in 2001 (see table 1).

More than 80 percent of the work centers were private, nonprofit entities; 13 percent of the work centers were state or local government organizations. Businesses accounted for 9 percent of the employers, hospitals or other residential care facilities accounted for 5 percent, and less than 2 percent were schools.", "The work centers primarily employed workers who have disabilities, 90 percent of whom were 14(c) workers. On average, each work center employed 86 workers at special minimum wages. The work centers mainly employed workers with mental retardation or other developmental disabilities. Some work centers focused on employing workers who were blind or had other visual impairments, although they comprised a relatively small number (50 work centers)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Work Centers Provide Assembly or Service Jobs Through Contracts With Government Agencies and Private Companies", "paragraphs": ["Work centers offer individuals with disabilities a variety of work, most of which involves assembly or is service-related. (See table 2.) Assembly jobs generally involve uncomplicated one- or two-step processes that are mainly performed by hand. For example, 14(c) workers at a work center in Illinois that we visited assembled small plastic automobile parts, while 14(c) workers at a New York work center snapped together plastic pieces to assemble a lint remover. The service-related jobs involved basic tasks, such as mopping floors and picking up trash. For example, 14(c) workers from a California work center maintained restrooms at public beaches under contracts with local city governments.", "Work center managers balanced their understanding of what work was feasible for their 14(c) workers with their knowledge of the work available in the area. Work center managers also considered where jobs were located. Most jobs in assembly, production, sorting, and collating could be easily performed in the work center. However, jobs such as grounds maintenance and janitorial work had to be performed off-site. If a work center was not located within a reasonable commuting distance, work center managers might decide that these jobs were not feasible for their 14(c) workers. For example, managers at a work center in Illinois did not pursue jobs in neighboring communities that posed a difficult commute for their workers.", "Most work centers provided jobs through contracts with government agencies and private companies. Work center managers at some of the sites we visited told us that they were most likely to contact local companies to find jobs that could be done by their 14(c) workers. According to the director of a work center in Virginia, contracts with private companies, particularly for products, were often for tasks in a production process that would not have been cost-effective for the company to automate. In addition, a manager at a California work center said that several of their contracts came from small companies that were marketing new products and did not yet have enough data to know how much their production costs would be. These companies found that work center contracts could be used to do test runs of a new product at a relatively low cost. Overall, we found that 22 percent of the work centers had preferential contracts with state or local governments, and 17 percent of the work centers had contracts with federal agencies.

Depending on the type of support services needed by the 14(c) workers, work center staff either provide the services themselves or help to obtain these services from other sources. Essentially all (99 percent) of the work centers provided or helped obtain one or more of a wide range of support services that enabled 14(c) workers to obtain or perform their jobs. (See table 3.) For example, some workers with mental retardation could not drive and were unable to use public transportation without assistance. We found that almost all (97 percent) of the work centers provided or helped obtain transportation for their workers. They also provided support services such as psychological counseling and speech therapy to help 14(c) workers function more effectively both on and off the job.", "Most work centers also provided one or more accommodations consistent with the definition of reasonable accommodation in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Our survey showed that 95 percent of the work centers provided work schedule modifications, 85 percent provided job restructuring, and 72 percent provided specialized equipment not required by workers without disabilities. In many cases, work centers accomplished these accommodations through the support services they provided to their 14(c) workers. For example, job restructuring, an example of a reasonable accommodation, could be accomplished using task adaptation, such as breaking a complex task into several small tasks performed by more than one worker, or job station adaptation, such as lowering the height of a table to accommodate someone in a wheelchair.", "From our site visits, we found that the state and county agencies that provided funds to the work centers to pay for support services had different levels of funding available and different eligibility criteria for these services. State policies and criteria for reimbursements and grants varied across the states we visited. According to work center managers, the availability of state grants or reimbursements for services, and the centers\u2019 or their workers\u2019 ability to meet state eligibility criteria for these funds dictated the type and level of support services their centers provided. For example, for one program at the work center in California we visited, the state required workers to work at least 20 hours a week, have an attendance rate of 85 percent, and have a productivity level of at least 10 percent. Another program at the work center designed to prepare workers to move from the work center to jobs in the community was limited to 30 slots because of state funding limits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Work Centers Obtain Most of Their Funds From State and County Agencies and Production Contracts", "paragraphs": ["To pay for their operating costs, including the provision of support services, work centers obtain funds from two primary sources, government agencies and contracts.

The other major source of funding for work centers was contracts for the production of goods and services, which accounted for about 35 percent of their funding. Figure 2 shows the sources of the funding for all work centers.", "Each site we visited had several sources of funding; the proportion of funds from each source varied for each location.

Work centers\u2019 payroll expenses would increase, significantly in some cases, if they were required to pay their 14(c) workers the federal minimum wage of $5.15 an hour. For example, at one of the work centers we visited in New York, the total wages of the 14(c) workers would increase from about $77,000 to about $289,000 if the work center paid all of its current 14(c) workers at the federal minimum wage rate. (See table 5.)", "We also found from our site visits that the work centers\u2019 funding from production of products and services did not cover all costs associated with production. For example, one of the New York work centers obtained about $275,000 from its production contracts. This amount did not cover its costs which, in addition to the wages of its 14(c) workers, included additional direct expenses of about $690,000 for the salaries of its supervisors and support staff and other expenses, such as the cost of materials."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Most 14(c) Workers Have Mental Retardation and Earn Very Low Wages", "paragraphs": ["From the survey, we estimate that most 14(c) workers have mental retardation or another developmental disability as their primary impairment and earn very low wages.

In addition, the majority of 14(c) workers work less than full-time. The 14(c) workers are primarily from 25 to 54 years of age and have been employed in the work centers for several years. At the sites we visited, we found that many 14(c) workers received federal cash disability benefits in addition to their earnings.

The remainder are employed by businesses, hospitals or other residential care facilities, or schools.", "Workers paid special minimum wages by work centers have a wide range of physical and mental conditions that impair their ability to be fully productive at their jobs. (See figure 3.) From the survey, we estimate that the primary impairment of nearly three-quarters of all 14(c) workers employed by work centers was mental retardation or some other developmental disability. About 46 percent of the workers had more than one disability.", "These impairments can affect a 14(c) worker\u2019s productivity in several ways. Some workers with mental retardation, for example, need additional supervision to complete their tasks, something that, according to our survey, virtually all work centers provided. The level of supervision needed by workers with mental retardation, however, varies depending on the needs of the individuals. For example, the supervisor-to-worker ratio for most 14(c) workers at the California work center we visited was 1 to 15. However, this work center also had a special unit that provided an even higher level of supervision to those who needed it\u20141 supervisor to every 4 workers.", "Some 14(c) workers with mental retardation also require special devices that enable them to perform tasks involving measuring and counting\u2014 activities that may be difficult for those with mental retardation to perform. The work center we visited in Texas, for example, devised a wooden jig with holes drilled to a specific depth so that 14(c) workers could automatically attach brass couplings to refrigerator coils at the correct position without having to measure them. The California work center devised a counting board for some of its 14(c) workers who packaged materials. The board was divided into 12 squares so that, by placing one item in each square and putting all of the items in a package after filling up the board, 14(c) workers would know the correct number of items to put in each package without having to count them.", "Certain physical impairments, such as reduced visual acuity or cerebral palsy, also restrict 14(c) workers\u2019 ability to perform tasks involved in performing their jobs. Workers with these types of impairments also receive special supports that enable them to work. For example, because some workers at an Illinois work center found it difficult to clip plastic automobile parts together using only their hands, supervisors built a lever that helped workers with less strength, or reduced manipulative ability, complete the task. At a work center that employed primarily the blind in New York, workers with limited or no vision used a wooden block as a form for folding visual testing equipment at the proper locations. The photos in figure 4 depict some of the special devices and support services that enable 14(c) workers to perform their jobs.", "The wages of 14(c) workers employed by work centers nationwide were very low.

For example, the average productivity level of 14(c) workers at the sites we visited ranged from a low of 11 percent at the work center in Georgia to a high of 42 percent at the work center in Texas. The average hourly wage rates for 14(c) workers at these sites, which were as low as $0.63 per hour to as high of $3.74 per hour, mirrored the productivity levels at the sites.

Employment-related goals usually involved strategies to improve productivity on the current job and included plans to achieve the next step in a career path, such as transition from the work center to work in the community. Nonwork goals involved a variety of activities. For example, the work centers in California and Texas offered classroom training in personal and social adjustment. Training focused on basic topics such as appropriate communication and social behaviors and continued through more advanced topics such as management of finances.", "Several of the work centers we visited also offered training designed to help 14(c) workers become more independent in their interactions with individuals in the community. For example, the work center in New York that primarily employed the blind offered training to its workers on the development of new skills and behaviors, such as problem-solving and assertiveness skills designed to help them, especially those who also had mental retardation, interact more effectively in the community. In addition, the center offered training to workers on how to shop, use banks, and eat in restaurants.", "The work centers we visited also focused on enabling 14(c) workers to make their own decisions about their lives, that is, to exercise self- determination. For example, the California work center competed with at least two other training and employment providers for every new client. In most cases, the potential 14(c) worker made the final choice of provider, often with the help of family members. At the California work center, the 14(c) worker was an active participant in the development of his or her individualized plan and participated in all meetings to decide the next step in the plan. The decisions about whether to move from a job at the work center to work in the community or whether to work at all were also left to many of the 14(c) workers at the work centers we visited. For example, at the work center in Georgia, staff helped 14(c) workers plan alternative activities when they no longer desired to work.

Although Labor officials were unable to explain these discrepancies, when we reviewed the information in its databases on 14(c) employers, we discovered that they contained out-of-date and duplicate information and that Labor overstated the number of 14(c) employers.For example, the databases contained information on 261 employers whose 14(c) certificates had expired between January 1, 2000, and August 31, 2000, but the database contained no indication that these certificates had been renewed. We followed up with some of these employers and found that, according to the employers, some of their certificates had actually been renewed, but Labor had not updated the information in the database. A few of the employers, however, told us they no longer employed workers at special minimum wages although Labor still counted them as current 14(c) employers.  We also found, through our attempts to mail out our survey, that some employers had gone out of business and should have been deleted from Labor\u2019s list of current 14(c) employers.

When we compared the number of workers listed by employers on their 14(c) certificate applications to the number of workers on supplemental forms in their application packages, these numbers did not always match. These inconsistencies may have been caused by language in Labor\u2019s application form that may be confusing to employers, as we reported in a previous correspondence to Labor. For example, the form requires employers to report the number of 14(c) workers they employ in two different places on the form. The instructions for both items, however, are confusing and, as a result, employers may report the wrong number of workers in one or both items on the form. WHD officials told us they are in the process of revising the 14(c) certificate application.

Virtually all work centers that employ 14(c) workers also are nonprofit.

As a result, Labor\u2019s oversight of the special minimum wage program is important in ensuring that 14(c) workers are not underpaid. Labor is not doing all it can, however, to provide this oversight, and Labor officials acknowledge that the special minimum wage program was given low priority in the past.

Therefore, we adjusted our numbers by making the assumption that, if we had contacted all work centers and businesses to which Labor had issued 14(c) certificates, we would have found additional instances in which the employers had gone out of business or in which Labor had incorrectly categorized them. We used the proportion of the initial number of work centers and businesses found to be out of business or incorrectly categorized to estimate the total number of work centers and businesses on Labor\u2019s list that were out of business or incorrectly categorized. We eliminated this estimated number from each group of employers.", "We adjusted the total numbers for each group and our samples to delete the duplicate records, work centers and businesses that were no longer in business, and those that were incorrectly categorized. After making these adjustments, the total number of all other work centers was 5,189 and the sample size for this group was 551. We received 443 responses for this group, a response rate of 80 percent. For the work centers for the blind, the adjusted total was 75 work centers. We sent out surveys to all of these work centers and received 63 responses, a response rate of 84 percent. For the businesses, the adjusted total was 690 and the sample size was 403.We received 284 responses from the businesses, a response rate of 71 percent.", "In the survey, we asked work center and business managers for information about their facility and the workers they employed under their 14(c) certificates. We asked them to fill out the survey only for the certificate selected (the certificate number shown on the mailing label), not for any other facilities they managed, if any.", "We mailed the survey to each work center and business selected to the address listed in Labor\u2019s databases. In some cases, the work center or business gave the survey to another organization, such as a parent organization or work center responsible for completing the employer\u2019s 14(c) certificate application package. See appendix II for a copy of the survey sent to the work centers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Estimates of the Number of 14(c) Workers with Various Characteristics", "paragraphs": ["One of the objectives of our survey was to obtain a variety of information on the characteristics of 14(c) workers. During our pre-tests of the survey, however, we found that some work center managers had difficulty providing the specific information we requested, such as the number of 14(c) workers they employed at various wage levels. Work center managers told us that, while this information was available in each individual worker\u2019s record, extracting and summarizing it specifically for 14(c) workers would be very time-consuming and would discourage them from responding to the survey. As a result, rather than asking work center managers to provide the precise number of 14(c) workers with a specific characteristic, we asked them to estimate the percentage of their 14(c) workers with the characteristic. We asked them to provide their estimates by checking one of six boxes with the following labels: \u201cNone (0%),\u201d \u201cFew (1-19%),\u201d \u201cSome (20-39%),\u201d \u201cAbout half (40-59%),\u201d \u201cMost (60-79%),\u201d or \u201cAll or nearly all (80-100%).\u201d", "To provide an estimate of the total number of 14(c) workers at each work center with a specific characteristic, it was necessary for us to convert each percentage range estimate provided by the work center manager into a single percentage. To do so, we began by assigning a value to each estimate in the midpoint of the range. For example, for an estimate of \u201cSome (20-39%),\u201d we assigned a value of 30 percent. Then, for each of the eight questions asked in this manner, we summed the midpoint percentage values to determine whether they totaled 100 percent, thus accounting for all 14(c) workers employed at the center. If the values totaled more than 100 percent, we reduced each of the individual midpoint percentage values by the percentage by which the total would have to have been reduced in order to total 100 percent. For example, if the midpoint percentage values we assigned totaled 130 percent, this means that the total would have to be reduced by 30 percentage points, or 23 percent (30 divided by 130), in order to reach 100 percent. In this case, we reduced each midpoint percentage value by 23 percent. Conversely, if the midpoint percentage values we assigned totaled less than 100 percent, we increased each value by the percentage by which the total would have to have been increased in order to reach 100 percent. Thus, using this method, we arrived at a single percentage estimate for each of the eight questions on workers\u2019 characteristics posed in this manner. For each question, we converted each percentage estimate into an estimate of the number of 14(c) workers with the specified characteristic by multiplying the percentage estimate by the total number of workers at the center.", "Because of the manner in which we estimated the number of 14(c) workers with various employment and personal characteristics, the estimates should not be viewed as highly precise. They are much less precise than estimates based on accurate counts of 14(c) workers with the specified characteristics at each work center sampled. As stated previously, however, based on our experience during the pre-tests of the survey, we believed that it would not have been feasible to obtain such counts for the work centers. The businesses, however, were able to provide this information because they had so few 14(c) workers (three workers, on average) that they did not have difficulty providing this information. Thus, our estimates of the number of 14(c) workers employed by businesses with various employment and personal characteristics should be considered much more precise than those related to 14(c) workers employed by work centers.", "We also compared employers\u2019 responses to the survey by testing them to determine whether there were any significant differences. We compared the two subgroups of work centers\u2014work centers for the blind and all other work centers\u2014and compared all work centers and businesses.

We selected the sites on the basis of their geographic location, the predominant impairment of the facilities\u2019 workers, and the number of workers paid special minimum wages. To ensure geographic diversity, we selected at least one site in each of Labor\u2019s five regions. In each of the regions, we selected sites that were representative of states with the largest number of 14(c) employers. We also took into consideration the costs associated with visiting each potential site.", "Because our preliminary analysis of the data showed that the majority of 14(c) employers were work centers, we selected primarily work center sites. We visited seven work centers and one business. Our analysis also showed that most work centers employed 14(c) workers whose primary impairment was mental retardation or other developmental disability. Accordingly, five of the seven work centers we selected primarily employed workers with mental retardation. In addition, because of the interest of our congressional requesters in the special minimum wage program as it relates to workers with visual impairments, we selected one work center that primarily employed workers with visual impairments. Finally, we selected one work center that primarily employed 14(c) workers with mental illness because this group was the second most frequently found in work centers.", "Additional considerations for our site visit selection were the number of 14(c) workers and the type of work performed. From the information in Labor\u2019s databases on the number of 14(c) workers employed by each work center and business, we determined that the median number of 14(c) workers at each work center was approximately 65 workers. We selected five of the seven work centers, in part, because the data showed that they employed about this number of 14(c) workers. The other two work centers employed a much larger number of workers. During our preliminary interviews, we learned that work centers provide jobs in both production and service-related work for their 14(c) workers. Therefore, we sought a mix of these types of jobs in selecting our sites. Because the Javits-Wagner-O\u2019Day program is one of the sources of contracts for this work, we selected two sites that had contracts under this program, one site that produced products and one that provided service-related work."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Employer Survey Sent to Work Centers", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comparison of Work Centers for the Blind and All Other Work Centers", "paragraphs": ["Because of the special interest of our congressional requesters in work centers that primarily employ 14(c) workers with visual impairments (work centers for the blind), we analyzed their responses separately and compared them with those of all other work centers that employ 14(c) workers.
