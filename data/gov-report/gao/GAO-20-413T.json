In recent years, some high-profile rulemakings have received extremely large numbers of comments, raising questions about how agencies manage the identity information associated with comments. While the APA does not require the disclosure of identifying information from a commenter, agencies may choose to collect this information.", "This testimony summarizes GAO's June 2019 report on public comment posting practices (GAO-19-483). In that report, GAO examined (1) the identity information collected by comment websites; (2) the guidance agencies have related to the identity of commenters; (3) how 10 selected agencies treat identity information; and (4) the extent to which the selected agencies clearly communicate their practices associated with identity information. The 10 agencies were selected on the basis of the volume of public comments they received on rulemakings. For this testimony, GAO obtained updates on the status of recommendations made to the selected agencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) governs the process by which many federal agencies develop and issue regulations, which includes the public comment process (see figure below).", "In June 2019, GAO found that Regulations.gov and agency-specific comment websites collect some identity information\u2014such as name, email, or address\u2014from commenters who choose to provide it during the public comment process. The APA does not require commenters to disclose identity information when submitting comments. In addition, agencies have no obligation under the APA to verify the identity of such parties during the rulemaking process, and all selected agencies accept anonymous comments in practice.", "GAO found in the June 2019 report that seven of 10 selected agencies have some internal guidance associated with the identity of commenters, but the substance of this guidance varies. This reflects the differences in the way that the selected agencies handle commenter identity information internally.", "GAO also found that the selected agencies' practices for posting public comments to comment websites vary considerably, particularly for duplicate comments (identical or near-identical comment text but varied identity information). For example, one agency posts a single example of duplicate comments and indicates the total number of comments received, but only the example is available to public users of Regulations.gov. In contrast, other agencies post all comments individually. As a result, identity information submitted with comments is inconsistently presented on public websites.", "The APA allows agencies discretion in how they post comments, but GAO found that some of the selected agencies do not clearly communicate their practices for how comments and identity information are posted. GAO's key practices for transparently reporting government data state that federal government websites should disclose data sources and limitations to help public users make informed decisions about how to use the data. If not, public users of the comment websites could reach inaccurate conclusions about who submitted a particular comment, or how many individuals commented on an issue."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In June 2019, GAO made recommendations to eight of the selected agencies regarding implementing and communicating public comment posting policies. The agencies generally agreed with the recommendations and identified actions they planned to take in response. Since the June 2019 report, one agency has implemented GAO's recommendation and seven agencies have identified additional planned actions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our work on identity information  in the public comment portion of the rulemaking process. The  Administrative Procedure Act (APA) establishes procedures for  rulemaking, which is the process agencies follow to develop and issue  regulations. Agencies use regulations to carry out statutory directives to  achieve public policy goals, such as protecting the health and safety of  the public. Under the APA, agencies engage in three basic phases of the  rulemaking process: (1) initiate rulemaking actions, (2) develop proposed  rulemaking actions, known as Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),  and (3) develop final rulemaking actions. Built into agencies\u2019 rulemaking  processes are opportunities for internal and external deliberations,  reviews, and public comments.", "Federal agencies publish an average of 3,700 NPRMs each year. Most  agencies utilize Regulations.gov to receive public comments on proposed  rules, but some agencies have their own agency-specific websites.  Although the number of public comments submitted on NPRMs can vary  widely, in recent years, some high-profile rulemakings have received  extremely large numbers of comments. For example, during the public  comment period for the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s (FCC)  2017 Restoring Internet Freedom NPRM, FCC received more than 22  million comments through its public comment website. Subsequently,  media and others reported that some of the comments submitted to FCC  were suspected to have been submitted using false identity information.", "The APA requires agencies to allow comments on NPRMs to be  submitted by any interested party (commenters). The APA does not  require the disclosure of identity information from commenters, such as  name, email, or address. Agencies therefore have no obligation under the  APA to verify the identity of such parties during the rulemaking process.  Agencies must give consideration to any significant comments submitted  during the comment period when drafting the final rule. However, courts  have held that agencies are not required to respond to every comment  individually. Agencies routinely offer a single response to multiple  identical or similar comments, because the comment process is not a  vote. As explained by Regulations.gov\u2019s Tips for Submitting Effective  Comments, \u201c\u2026agencies make determinations for a proposed action  based on sound reasoning and scientific evidence rather than a majority  of votes. A single, well-supported comment may carry more weight than a  thousand form letters.\u201d", "Additionally, the E-Government Act of 2002 requires agencies, to the  extent practical, to accept comments \u201cby electronic means\u201d and to make  available online the public comments and other materials included in the  official rulemaking docket. Executive Order 13563 further states that  regulations should be based, to the extent feasible, on the open  exchange of information and perspectives. To promote this open  exchange, to the extent feasible and permitted by law, most agencies are  required to provide the public with a meaningful opportunity to participate  in the regulatory process through the internet, to include timely online  access to the rulemaking docket in an open format that can be easily  searched and downloaded.", "Most agencies meet these responsibilities through Regulations.gov, a  rulemaking website where users can find rulemaking materials and  submit their comments, but all agencies are not required to use that  platform. In October 2002, the eRulemaking Program was established as  a cross-agency E-Government initiative and is currently based within the  General Services Administration. The eRulemaking Program  Management Office (PMO) leads the eRulemaking Program and is  responsible for developing and implementing Regulations.gov, the public- facing comment website, and the Federal Docket Management System  (FDMS), which is the agency-facing side of the comment system used by  participating agencies.", "My remarks today are based on our report issued in June 2019.  Specifically, this testimony discusses (1) the identity information selected  agencies collect through Regulations.gov and agency-specific comment  websites, (2) the internal guidance selected agencies have related to the  identity of commenters, (3) how selected agencies treat identity  information collected during the public comment process, (4) the extent to  which selected agencies clearly communicate their practices associated  with posting identity information collected during the public comment  process, and (5) the status of our recommendations to these agencies.", "For our report, we selected a nongeneralizable sample of 10 agencies  (selected agencies) that received a high volume of public comments for  rulemaking proceedings that accepted comments from January 1, 2013  through December 31, 2017. These selected agencies included eight  agencies that use Regulations.gov as their agency\u2019s comment website  (\u201cparticipating agencies\u201d) and two agencies that operate agency-specific  comment websites (\u201cnonparticipating agencies\u201d). We surveyed 52  program offices within these agencies about their comment process and  reviewed comment websites, agency guidance, and comment data. We  also interviewed relevant agency officials. Additional information about  our scope and methodology is available in our June 2019 report. Since  the issuance of that report, we have received and reviewed additional  information from selected agencies related to the actions they have taken  in response to the report\u2019s recommendations.", "We conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.

In  addition to the text of the comment, agencies may choose to collect  identity information by requiring commenters to fill in other fields, such as  name, address, and email address before they are able to submit a  comment. Regardless of the fields required by the comment form, the  selected agencies all accept anonymous comments in practice.  Specifically, in the comment forms on Regulations.gov and agency- specific comment websites, a commenter can submit under a fictitious  name, such as \u201cAnonymous Anonymous,\u201d enter a single letter in each  required field, or provide a fabricated address. In each of these scenarios,  as long as a character or characters are entered into the required fields,  the comment will be accepted. Further, because the APA does not  require agencies to authenticate submitted identity information, neither  Regulations.gov nor the agency-specific comment websites contain  mechanisms to check the validity of identity information that commenters  submit through comment forms.", "Regulations.gov and agency-specific comment websites also collect  some information about public users\u2019 interaction with their websites  through application event logs and proxy server logs, though the APA  does not require agencies to collect or verify it as part of the rulemaking  process. This information, which can include a public user\u2019s Internet  Protocol (IP) address, browser type and operating system, and the time  and date of webpage visits, is collected separately from the comment  submission process as part of routine information technology  management for system security and performance, and cannot be reliably  connected to specific comments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Selected Agencies Have Some Internal Guidance Related to Commenter Identity", "paragraphs": ["Seven of the 10 selected agencies have documented some internal  guidance associated with the identity of commenters during the three  phases of the public comment process: intake, analysis, and response to  comments.

As shown in Table 1, for  selected agencies that have guidance associated with the identity of  commenters, it most frequently relates to the comment intake or response  to comment phases of the public comment process.", "The guidance for these phases addresses activities such as managing  duplicate comments (those with identical or near-identical comment text  but varied identity information) or referring to commenters in a final rule.

When an agency chooses to post a sample of duplicate  comments, the identity information and unique comment contents for all  duplicate comments may not be present on the public website. For  example, for all duplicate comments received, Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC) posts a single example for each set of duplicate  comments and indicates the total number of comments received. As a  result, the identity information and any unique comment content beyond  the first example are not present on the public website.

We found  that the selected agencies we reviewed do not effectively communicate  the limitations and inconsistencies in how they post identity information  associated with public comments.

Seven of the eight participating agencies\u2019  websites direct public users back to Regulations.gov and the Federal  Register, either on webpages that are about the public comment process  in general, or on pages containing information about specific NPRMs.  Three of these participating agencies \u2013 the Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA), the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and the Food and  Drug Administration (FDA) \u2013 do provide public users with information  beyond directing them back to Regulations.gov or the Federal Register,  but only FDA provides users with details about posting practices that are  not also made available on Regulations.gov.", "The eighth participating agency \u2013 the Employee Benefits Security  Administration (EBSA) \u2013 does not direct public users back to  Regulations.gov, and instead recreates all rulemaking materials for each  NPRM on its own website, including individual links to each submitted  comment. However, these links go directly to comment files, and do not  link to Regulations.gov. While EBSA follows departmental guidance  associated with posting duplicate comments, which allows some  discretion in posting practices, the agency does not have a policy for how  comments are posted to Regulations.gov or its own website. Further, in  the examples we reviewed, the content of the NPRM-specific pages on  EBSA\u2019s website does not always match what is posted to  Regulations.gov.", "Because participating agencies are not required to adhere to  standardized posting practices, Regulations.gov directs public users to  participating agency websites for additional information about posting  practices and potential data limitations.
