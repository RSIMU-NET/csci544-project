Agencies made some progress in fiscal year 1997 toward implementing and maintaining financial systems that comply with these requirements. However, agencies have indicated concerns with implementing new accounting requirements imposed by accounting standards which became effective in fiscal year 1998. Moreover, the need to update a significant number of critical systems applications coupled with the government\u2019s history of systems development difficulties portends problems in achieving substantial compliance with FFMIA\u2019s requirements in the near future, particularly as agencies are struggling to address critical Year 2000 computer conversion issues.", "Although the accounting standards were issued several years ago, some agencies are not prepared to address key elements of the requirements that became effective for fiscal year 1998. For example, the managerial cost accounting concepts and standards promulgated in SFFAS No. 4 are aimed at providing reliable and timely information on the full cost of federal programs, their activities, and outputs. The standard requires agency management to define responsibility segments and to measure and report the costs of each segment\u2019s outputs. However, management of several agencies have expressed difficulty in linking responsibility segments to general ledger accounts, which is necessary to assign costs to segment outputs.", "In addition, the deferred maintenance requirements of SFFAS No. 6 require disclosures related to the condition and the estimated cost to remedy deferred maintenance of property, plant, and equipment. As we reported in January 1998, a critical step in developing a deferred maintenance estimate is a complete and reliable inventory of property, plant, and equipment on which to assess maintenance needs. However, in our report on the U.S. government\u2019s fiscal year 1997 consolidated financial statements, we identified the federal government\u2019s inability to properly account for and report billions of dollars of property, plant, and equipment as a material deficiency. The lack of accurate accounting of property, plant, and equipment could impede efforts to implement the deferred maintenance requirements. Moreover, the requirement to disclose deferred maintenance will be a challenge because most agencies do not have experience in generating agencywide estimates of deferred maintenance. Historically, agencies were not required to develop deferred maintenance estimates for financial reporting purposes. Although the 11 agencies responsible for almost 99 percent of property, plant, and equipment reported that they have estimated deferred maintenance for budgetary and other purposes, these estimates were generally limited in scope and not independently verified.", "Also, SFFAS No. 7 requires a new statement\u2014Statement of Financing\u2014to show how budgetary resources obligated during the period relate to the net cost of operations for that reporting entity. Several agencies have expressed concerns about having the available resources to prepare the Statement. In particular, agencies are concerned that preparing the Statement will require extensive analysis by trained accountants because agency accounting systems have not been modified to support the preparation of the Statement. As a result, some agencies requested that FASAB defer the requirements for the Statement of Financing for 2 years. While FASAB recently decided not to recommend deferral of the Statement, it, along with OMB, GAO, and agency CFOs are working to develop a presentation of required information that will satisfy requirements of the standard with data which can be reasonably developed by agencies\u2019 existing systems. Agencies\u2019 problems implementing the new accounting standards will be considered as part of fiscal year 1998 FFMIA reporting.", "Agencies are further challenged by the condition of many of the government\u2019s critical financial systems applications, which are not designed to meet current accounting standards and systems requirements. These systems will need to be replaced or significantly upgraded in the next 5 years. OMB\u2019s Federal Financial Management Status Report & Five-Year Plan reveals that as of the end of fiscal year 1997, agencies identified 809 operating financial management system applications that fall into this category. According to OMB, this represents 72 percent of total applications in operation. OMB also reports that agencies lack the resources to replace or upgrade some systems that need modernization.", "The serious questions that remain in addressing the federal government\u2019s Year 2000 readiness further complicate agencies\u2019 efforts to improve their financial management systems. We specifically discussed the Year 2000 problem as a high-risk area in our February 1997 high-risk report, and have issued guidance to help organizations successfully address the issue. To monitor agencies\u2019 accountability in addressing the Year 2000 problem in their systems, OMB requires agencies to regularly report on their progress.", "We recently reported that the CFO agencies\u2019 progress in addressing Year 2000 computing issues continues at a slow pace. Agencies are appropriately focusing their priorities on Year 2000 compliance issues, and consequently, other efforts to improve financial management systems may be delayed, including efforts to address FFMIA noncompliance.", "Long-standing problems with agencies\u2019 financial management systems decrease the government\u2019s ability to produce timely, uniform, and reliable financial information, which is important for formulating budgets, managing government programs, and making difficult policy choices.
