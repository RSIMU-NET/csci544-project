For example, younger pediatric patients\u2014 neonates, infants, and children\u2014have higher heart rates or respiratory  rates than adults. This difference, as cited by some stakeholders,  makes some devices used for adults, such as certain heart valves, not  appropriate for use in young children; thus a device that has already  been developed for an adult may have to be redesigned for a pediatric  population. Another unique characteristic cited is the range of  pediatric subpopulations and the difficulty in developing potentially  different devices for each of these subpopulations. For example, a  device that is developed for a toddler may not be appropriate for use  in an adolescent, even if they have the same disease or condition. As  a result, manufacturers may have to develop and test a different  device for each subpopulation although the disease or condition may  be the same.", "Recruiting pediatric patients to participate in clinical trials has also  been cited as a challenge for manufacturers. Performing experimental  procedures on children naturally raises concern for their safety, and it  may be difficult to obtain parental consent on behalf of the child to  conduct experimental procedures. This issue is compounded because  the pediatric population is not just one population but rather many  subpopulations. Therefore, manufacturers find it difficult to recruit  enough children for each pediatric subpopulation over a reasonable  time frame and within a manageable number of investigational sites to  ensure enough test subjects to meet clinical trial requirements.", "Given these unique characteristics of the pediatric population, as well as  the fact that the market for pediatric devices is generally smaller than the  market for adult devices, there are limited economic incentives for  manufacturers to develop pediatric medical devices. Stakeholders  indicated that the cost of developing pediatric medical devices relative to  the potential revenue generated by sales in a small market is a significant  barrier to the development of new pediatric medical devices.  Stakeholders also noted that the cost of research and development for  pediatric medical devices can be the same as for adult devices while the  market size is often smaller. Given these factors, stakeholders report that  the return on the investment to develop and test pediatric medical devices  usually falls below the profit goals of most medical device manufacturers.", "Stakeholders noted that the FDAAA provision allowing pediatric HDE  devices to earn a profit is one helpful step to encourage pediatric medical  device development; however, they indicated that this provision is not  enough to address the small market for pediatric devices and the  resources necessary to study a device in a pediatric population. An  official from one device manufacturer that had a pediatric HDE device  approved since FDAAA was enacted told us that the ability to earn a profit  for the HDE device, while helpful, was not part of this manufacturer\u2019s  decision to develop and market it. Stakeholders noted that the maximum  number of 4,000 individuals for HDEs limited the effectiveness of this  incentive for development of devices for larger pediatric populations.  Stakeholders also noted that incentives used for pediatric drug  development would not necessarily work for pediatric medical device  development. For example, patent protection for medical devices is not as  meaningful an incentive as it is for the development of pediatric drugs  because the typical life cycle for medical devices (about 18 months) is  significantly shorter than the typical life cycle for a drug.", "Other barriers identified by stakeholders included an incomplete  understanding of unmet pediatric device needs and issues related to the  medical device regulatory process.", "Several stakeholders commented that there is no consistent inventory  of the devices that need to be developed for pediatric populations.  Although it is unclear who should maintain this inventory, FDAAA did  require FDA to annually report on the number of devices approved in  the preceding year that were labeled for use in pediatric patients or for  which there is a pediatric subpopulation that suffers from the disease  or condition that the device is intended to treat, diagnose, or cure.  FDA has reported to Congress that the pediatric device data  contained in these reports may help identify areas of pediatric device  research and development that need to be addressed. However,  FDA has issued only one of these reports to date. Furthermore,  some of the information from which FDA would develop these reports  may not be as useful as possible in determining unmet need.  Specifically, manufacturers are to include the information on pediatric  subpopulations in their premarket approval applications if readily  available; however, one manufacturer organization stated that it was  unclear about the specific information requirements, and thus  manufacturers may not be submitting useful information for tracking  unmet pediatric device needs.", "Stakeholders also cited as barriers to pediatric device development  certain issues related to the medical device regulatory process in  general. For instance, it was reported that the amount of time that it  will take to get through the regulatory process cannot always be  predicted, which limits the ability to appropriately budget for  development. One manufacturer organization also noted that FDAAA  authorized FDA to consider published data from adult studies and  studies in different age groups when determining effectiveness for  pediatric device approvals; this manufacturer organization commented  that where appropriate, FDA should also use scientific evidence other  than randomized controlled studies, such as well-documented case  histories, to show probable benefit or demonstrate effectiveness.  Recognizing the need to discuss the ways scientific research data can  be used for pediatric medical device applications, FDA announced in  November 2011 that it would hold a public workshop to discuss the  use of scientific research data, including published scientific literature,  to support and establish pediatric indications for medical devices.", "Stakeholders also noted barriers that were unique to HDE devices,  including pediatric HDE devices. One manufacturer organization stated  that FDA has provided no general guidance to manufacturers regarding  the type or level of evidence that must be developed to demonstrate that  an HDE device meets the probable benefit standard. According to the  organization, this lack of guidance ultimately hinders the use of the HDE  program as a pathway to market devices that treat or diagnose diseases  and conditions that affect fewer than 4,000 patients, including pediatric  patients. According to stakeholders, difficulties in obtaining insurance  coverage for HDE devices are also a barrier to development because  HDE devices are approved by demonstrating safety but not effectiveness.", "Although the two manufacturers\u2019 representatives we spoke with reported  experiencing frustration with the HDE approval process, they noted that  overall, their interaction with FDA reviewers was positive in that FDA  responded to their questions in a timely manner and provided specific  guidance where necessary.", "Finally, stakeholders stated that individuals with innovative ideas for new  pediatric medical devices do not necessarily know what steps to take to  bring their ideas for pediatric medical devices to the market, and it would  be helpful to connect these individuals with manufacturers and to help  them navigate the device development and regulatory process.  Individuals with ideas for medical devices range from engineers to  clinicians, who often need to work together to develop and manufacture a  pediatric medical device. In addition, it is necessary to have funds to  sustain development and an understanding of how to navigate the  regulatory process. A commonly cited example of the challenges faced by  pediatric device innovators is the experience developing the titanium rib,  which took about 14 years to develop before it was approved for the  market in part because its inventor, a physician who saw the need for  such a device, did not have the information or resources to navigate the  development and regulatory process. FDA officials and other  stakeholders reported that the pediatric device consortia have helped to  address this barrier. In addition, FDA officials reported that other efforts  by FDA to organize early meetings before device manufacturers submit  applications to clarify required clinical information and meetings with  groups such as the pediatric orthopedic surgeons have also helped  device innovators navigate the device development and regulatory  process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Pediatric Device Consortia Have Assisted over 100 Device Projects; Many Were in Early Development", "paragraphs": ["The pediatric device consortia reported assisting 107 pediatric device  projects\u2014that is, projects to develop new pediatric devices\u2014in the first   2 years of the demonstration grant program.

The assistance provided  depended on the device\u2019s phase of development. For example, for a  device in the concept phase a consortium could assess its scientific merit  to see if there is a need for the device or if it makes sense to develop it;  for devices that were further along, a consortium could help produce  prototypes.

Although stakeholders identified barriers to developing and receiving FDA  approval to market pediatric medical devices, programs such as the  pediatric device consortia can foster an environment for device innovators  to share ideas and advance the development of pediatric medical  devices. The number of devices that the pediatric device consortia have  supported through the early phases of development and the positive  feedback from stakeholders indicate that pediatric devices are being  developed. Further, the increase in the number of HUD requests and  designations for devices that treat pediatric populations since FDAAA was  enacted indicate potential for development of additional pediatric HDE  devices in the near future. Over the past 10 years, it has taken a few  years for a manufacturer to submit an HDE application and receive FDA  market approval after receiving HUD designation; therefore the profit  eligibility incentive for pediatric HDE devices may have induced an  increase in the number of pediatric HUD requests.", "Although the future for pediatric device development may be promising,  FDA lacks reliable and timely information on pediatric devices approved  for the U.S. market.
