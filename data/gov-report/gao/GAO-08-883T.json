This testimony discusses (1) U.S. efforts to develop a capable ANP; (2) challenges that affect the development of a capable ANP; and (3) GAO analysis of U.S. efforts to develop a coordinated, detailed plan for completing and sustaining the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), which comprise the ANP and the Afghan National Army (ANA). This statement is based on a concurrently issued GAO report titled Afghanistan Security: Further Congressional Action May Be Needed to Ensure Completion of a Detailed Plan to Develop and Sustain Capable Afghan National Security Forces, GAO-08-661 (Washington, D.C.: June 18, 2008)."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although the ANP has reportedly grown in number since 2005, after an investment of more than $6 billion, no Afghan police unit (0 of 433) is assessed by Defense as fully capable of performing its mission and over three-fourths of units (334 of 433) are assessed at the lowest capability rating. In addition, while the ANP has reportedly grown in number to nearly 80,000 personnel, concerns exist about the reliability of this number. Several challenges impede U.S. efforts to develop capable ANP forces. First, the shortage of police mentors has been a key impediment to U.S. efforts to conduct training and evaluation and verify that police are on duty. Second, the ANP continues to encounter difficulties with equipment shortages and quality. Third, the ANP faces a difficult working environment, including a weak Afghan judicial sector and consistent problems with police pay, corruption, and attacks by insurgents. Defense has recognized challenges to ANP development and, in November 2007, began a new initiative called Focused District Development--an effort to train the police as units--to address them. This effort is too new to fully assess, but the continuing shortfall in police mentors may put the effort at risk. Despite a 2005 GAO recommendation calling for a detailed plan and a 2008 congressional mandate requiring similar information, Defense and State have not developed a coordinated, detailed plan with clearly defined roles and responsibilities, milestones for completing and sustaining the ANSF, and a sustainment strategy. In 2007, Defense produced a 5-page document intended to address GAO's 2005 recommendation. However, the document does not identify the role or involve the participation of State--Defense's partner in training the ANP. Further, State has not completed a plan of its own. In the absence of a coordinated, detailed plan that clearly defines agency roles and responsibilities, a dual chain of command exists between Defense and State that has complicated the efforts of mentors training the police. Defense's 5-page document also contains few milestones, including no interim milestones that would help assess progress made in developing the ANP. Without interim milestones, it is difficult to know if current ANP status represents what the United States intended to achieve by 2008. In addition, Defense's 5-page document lacks a sustainment strategy. Without a detailed strategy for sustaining the ANSF, it is difficult to determine how long the United States may need to continue providing funding and other resources for this important mission."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss U.S. efforts to assist in the  development of Afghan National Police (ANP) forces and the  establishment of rule of law in Afghanistan.

According to Defense, an improved police force  is vital to stabilizing and maintaining security throughout Afghanistan. U.S.  support for the ANP began in 2002 and increased significantly in 2005 in  response to deteriorating security in Afghanistan and concerns that ANP  development was proceeding too slowly.

Germany  volunteered to lead the police reform effort; however, due, in part, to  Afghanistan\u2019s pressing security needs and concerns that the German  training program was moving too slowly, the United States expanded its  role in the police training effort in 2005\u2014including involvement, for the  first time, of the U.S. Department of Defense, as well as increased funding.  In May 2007, the Afghan government and its international partners  approved an interim increase in the number of police forces from 62,000 to  82,000, to be reviewed every 6 months. The force structure for the police  includes Ministry of Interior headquarters and administrative staff,  uniformed police personnel, and several specialized police units. (See app.  I for further details on the force structure and functions of the ANP.)", "In addition to enforcing the rule of law, the role of the ANP is to protect  the rights of citizens, maintain civil order and public safety, control  national borders, and reduce the level of domestic and international  organized crime, among other activities. Also, the deterioration in  Afghanistan\u2019s security situation since 2005 has led to increased ANP  involvement in counterinsurgency operations, resulting in additional  training in weapons and survival skills and counterinsurgency tactics.", "U.S. efforts to organize, train, and equip the ANP are directed by Defense  through its Combined Security Transition Command\u2014Afghanistan (CSTC- A), with support from State, which provides policy guidance to the effort  and oversight of civilian contractors implementing police training courses.  The primary U.S. contractor involved in training the ANP is DynCorp  International.", "From 2002 to 2008, the United States provided about $16.5 billion to train  and equip the ANSF, including about $6.2 billion for the ANP (see table 1).  Over 40 percent (about $2.7 billion) of funds for training and equipping the  ANP were provided in fiscal year 2007, in an effort to accelerate ANP  development and enhance its capability in response to increased levels of  violence and insurgent activity.", "Defense has developed criteria\u2014called capability milestones (CM)\u2014to  assess police and army capability.

According to Defense reporting as of April 2008, the expected date for  completion of a fully capable Afghan police force is December 2012.

Despite this reported increase in police manning, it is difficult to  determine the extent to which the police force has grown. As we noted in  May 2007, the Afghan Ministry of Interior produces the number of police  assigned and the reliability of these numbers has been questioned. A  Defense census undertaken since our May 2007 report to check the  reliability of ministry payroll records raises additional concerns about  numbers of police reportedly assigned. In September 2007, Defense  reported that it was unable to verify the physical existence of about 20  percent of the uniformed police and more than 10 percent of the border  police listed on the ministry payroll records for the provinces surveyed.  Because Defense\u2019s census did not cover all 34 Afghan provinces, these  percentages cannot be applied to the entire police force.

As of April 2008, only about 32 percent (746 of 2,358) of required  military mentors were present in country. Due to this shortage of military  mentors to provide force protection, movement of available civilian  mentors is constrained. According to Defense officials, the shortfall in  military mentors for the ANP is due to the higher priority assigned to  deploying U.S. military personnel elsewhere, particularly Iraq.", "Defense officials identified the continuing shortfall in police mentors as an  impediment to U.S. efforts to develop the Afghan police in three areas.", "First, senior Defense officials, including the commanding general of CSTC- A, stated that the ongoing shortfall in police mentors has been the primary  obstacle to providing the field-based training necessary to develop a fully  capable police force. Second, while Defense recently introduced a monthly  assessment tool to be used by mentors to evaluate police capability and  identify areas in need of further attention, CSTC-A identified extremely  limited mentor coverage as a significant challenge to using this tool. Third,  the shortage of available police mentors has impeded U.S. efforts to verify  the number of Afghan police on duty. For example, as of April 2008,  Defense could not verify whether any police were reporting for duty in 5 of  Afghanistan\u2019s 34 provinces due to the lack of mentors. Without sufficient  police mentors present to conduct field-based training and evaluation and  verify police manning, the development of fully capable, fully staffed  Afghan police forces may continue to be delayed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Police Continue to Face Difficulties with Equipment Shortages and Quality", "paragraphs": ["As of February 2008, shortages remained in several types of police  equipment that Defense considers critical, such as trucks, radios, and body  armor.

In addition, 81 percent (42 of 52) of weekly reports  contained examples of limited police ability to account for the equipment  provided to them. In July 2007, CSTC-A initiated efforts to train the police  in basic supply and property accountability procedures. According to  CSTC-A, equipment is no longer being issued to police districts unless the  districts\u2019 property officers are first trained. For example, according to  Defense, more than 1,500 trucks have been on hand and ready for issue  since late 2007 (see fig. 2), but the Afghan Minister of Interior has delayed  distribution of these vehicles until adequate accountability procedures are  established in the target districts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Police Face Problems with Weak Judicial Sector, Pay, Corruption, and Attacks", "paragraphs": ["Establishing a working judiciary in Afghanistan based on the rule of law is a  prerequisite for effective policing.

While  Defense and State have both cited improvements in coordination since our  August 2007 visit to Afghanistan, a coordinated plan that clearly states the  various agencies\u2019 roles and responsibilities would nonetheless be  beneficial given the continuous turnover of U.S. government staff.
