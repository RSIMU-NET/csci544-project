The F-35 is critical to long-term recapitalization plans as it is intended to replace hundreds of existing aircraft. This will require a long-term sustained funding commitment. Total U.S. investment is nearing $400 billion to develop and procure 2,457 aircraft through 2037. Fifty-two aircraft have been delivered through 2012. The F-35 program has been extensively restructured over the last 3 years to address prior cost, schedule, and performance problems. GAO's prior reviews of the F-35 made numerous recommendations to improve outcomes, such as increasing test resources and reducing annual procurement quantities.", "This report, prepared in response to the National Defense Authorization Act for 2010, addresses (1) F-35 program performance during 2012, including testing, technical risks, and software; (2) manufacturing performance indicators, production results, and design changes; and (3) acquisition and sustainment costs going forward.

Two objectives on aircraft deliveries and a corrective management plan were not met. Also in 2012, the program conducted more developmental flight tests than planned and made considerable progress in addressing critical technical risks, such as the helmet-mounted display. With about one-third of development flight testing completed, much testing remains to demonstrate and verify F-35 performance. Software management practices are improved, but with significant challenges ahead as software integration and testing continue to lag behind plans.", "Manufacturing and supply processes are also improving--indicators such as factory throughput, labor efficiency, and quality measures are all positive. While initial F-35 production overran target costs and delivered aircraft late, the latest data shows labor hours decreasing and deliveries accelerating. The program is working through the continuing effects from its concurrent acquisition strategy that overlapped testing and manufacturing activities. For example, the program is continuing to incur substantial costs for rework to fix deficiencies discovered in testing, but the amount of rework needed on each aircraft is dropping.", "Going forward, ensuring affordability--the ability to acquire aircraft in quantity and to sustain them over the life cycle--is of paramount concern. With more austere budgets looming, F-35 acquisition funding requirements average $12.6 billion annually through 2037. The new F-35 acquisition baseline incorporates the Department of Defense's (DOD) positive restructuring actions taken since 2010, including more time and funding for development and deferred procurement of more than 400 aircraft to future years. These actions place the F-35 program on firmer footing, although aircraft will cost more and deliveries to warfighters will take longer. The program continues to incur financial risk from its plan to procure 289 aircraft for $57.8 billion before completing development flight testing. Meanwhile, the services are spending about $8 billion to extend the life of existing aircraft and to buy new ones to mitigate shortfalls due to F-35 delays."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations in this report.

The program was  rebaselined in 2004 following weight and performance problems and  rebaselined again in 2007 because of additional cost growth and  schedule slips. Following an extensive department-wide review, the  Secretary of Defense in February 2010 announced a major restructuring  of the program due to poor cost and schedule outcomes and continuing  problems. DOD added time and money for development, provided  additional resources for testing, and reduced the number of aircraft to be  procured in the near-term. In March 2010, the department declared that  the program exceeded critical cost growth thresholds established by  statute\u2014a condition known as a Nunn-McCurdy breach\u2014and  subsequently certified to the Congress in June 2010 that the F-35  program should continue. Due to the cost breach, the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics rescinded the  program\u2019s approval to enter system development and DOD began efforts  to establish a new acquisition program baseline. The department  continued restructuring actions during 2011 and 2012 that added more  cost, extended schedules, and further reduced aircraft procurement  quantities in the near-term. The quantity of F-35 aircraft to be procured in  total was not changed, but restructured plans have deferred to future  years the procurement of 410 aircraft originally planned to be procured  through 2017 based on the 2007 revised baseline.

DOD and contractor officials also expressed confidence that  contracts for the 6th and 7th annual buys will be negotiated by this  summer and reflect similar performance. The first four LRIP contracts,  however, over-ran their target costs, in total by $1.2 billion. According to  program documentation, the government\u2019s share of the total overrun is  about $756 million under the sharing incentive provisions in these  contracts. Cost increases range from 6.5 percent to 16.1 percent more  than negotiated costs.

Figure 3 tracks  actual delivery dates against the dates specified in the contracts.  Deliveries were late an average of 11 months compared to the contracted  dates, but the data shows that the delivery rate has improved  considerably. For example, the first two production aircraft were late 16  and 15 months, respectively, whereas the last two delivered were each 2  months late. Fluctuations in some deliveries during mid-2012 are impacts  from the labor strike last summer that the contractor does not expect to  continue. Other factors contributing to late deliveries include design  changes to the aircraft; traveled work; scrap, repair, and rework hours;  and parts shortages.", "In addition to contract cost overruns, the program is incurring substantial  costs to retrofit (rework) produced aircraft needed to fix deficiencies  discovered in testing. These costs are largely attributable to the  substantial concurrency, or overlap, between testing and manufacturing  activities. The F-35 program office projects rework costs of about $900  million to fix the aircraft procured on the first four annual procurement  contracts. On average, rework adds about $15.5 million to the price of  each of the 58 U.S. aircraft under these contracts.", "Substantial rework costs are forecast to continue through the 10th annual  contract (fiscal year 2016 procurement), but at decreasing amounts  annually and on each aircraft. The program office projects about $827  million more to rework aircraft procured under the next 6 annual  contracts. Government liability for these costs depends on share ratios to  be negotiated. The government and Lockheed Martin reached agreement  under the LRIP 5 contract that costs for known changes due to  concurrency will be shared 50/50.  Other cost overruns under this  contract will be shared 55/45 until the contract ceiling is reached, at which  point the contractor assumes total responsibility for overruns. The lagging  cost and schedule performance on the first four production contracts and  the high costs of rework can be largely attributed to the continuing effects  of the F-35\u2019s highly concurrent acquisition strategy. The program started  manufacturing aircraft before designs were stable, before establishing  mature manufacturing processes, and before sufficiently testing the  design and aircraft performance. A November 2011 report on  concurrency by senior level DOD officials confirms these observations.  The report states that F-35 testing continues to find technical issues with  significant design and production impacts and requiring rework on  produced aircraft. It expresses a lack of confidence in the design stability  that was lower than expected given the quantities of aircraft procured and  potential for more rework costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Aircraft Design Changes Continue to Impact Efficiency and Add to Risk", "paragraphs": ["Even with the positive trends in manufacturing, cost, and schedule  discussed above, the government continues to incur risk by procuring  large quantities of aircraft with the majority of testing still ahead.
