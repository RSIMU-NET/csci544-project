GAO analyzed NIH data and interviewed officials at NIH, six universities, and other stakeholders. Universities were selected based on the number of grants and amount of funding received from NIH and their negotiated indirect cost rates."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2012, indirect cost reimbursements from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to universities increased slightly faster than those for direct costs, but increased notably faster during some periods. Specifically, from fiscal years 2002 to 2012, indirect costs increased 28.1 percent while direct costs increased 27.0 percent. However, for the fiscal years 2003 to 2012, indirect costs increased notably faster than direct costs, at 16.9 percent and 11.7 percent, respectively. In more recent years, annual changes were generally small but consistent. This increase occurred during a time when growth in NIH's budget for extramural research slowed to 5 percent from fiscal years 2008 to 2012, compared to about 21 percent from fiscal years 2002 to 2007. In fiscal year 2012, about 10 percent of the universities (50 out of about 500) receiving NIH extramural research funding received almost 70 percent of all indirect cost reimbursement provided to universities. Higher indirect cost rates tended to be associated with universities located in high-cost-of-living areas and privately owned universities.", "Stakeholders--university officials, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) officials, and others--whom GAO interviewed identified several key factors that may lead to increases in reimbursements for indirect costs provided to universities. Some stakeholders reported that reimbursements for one part of indirect costs--the facilities component--help to support research innovation by providing funding for the development and maintenance of state-of-the-art research facilities. However, officials in HHS's Division of Cost Allocation, which is responsible for determining indirect cost rates, stated that the uncapped facilities component of the indirect cost rate provides universities with few, if any, incentives for controlling these costs. For example, these officials noted that there is no limit on reimbursement for interest costs under the facilities component. This may encourage universities to borrow money to build new facilities, which could lead to building more new space than is necessary for research. Some stakeholders also noted that a 26 percent cap on the reimbursement rate for administrative costs--a second component of indirect costs--helps to control reimbursements for those costs; however, they reported it does not account for the recent increases in costs, such as those for regulatory reporting requirements and changing research needs that require advanced medical and information technologies that are considered administrative.", "The combination of these trends and factors results in indirect costs growing at a faster rate than direct costs. Indirect costs are one-fifth of NIH's total budget--or $6.2 billion in fiscal year 2012--but NIH officials reported that they have not taken steps to assess the significance of future indirect cost growth for universities, or planned for options that might address these trends or factors--in part because they view increases in indirect costs as having been modest. However, factors suggest that indirect costs could increase more quickly in the future. Over the long term, they could lead to a reduction in the number of research grants that could be funded, thus potentially affecting scientific discoveries and knowledge."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that NIH assess the impact of growth in indirect costs on its mission, including, as necessary, planning for how to deal with potential future increases in indirect costs that could limit the amount of funding available for total research.

Because indirect costs cannot be specifically attributed to a  particular research grant, they are charged via an indirect cost rate that is  applied to certain direct costs for each awarded grant. Each university  negotiates an indirect cost rate, based on information such as the amount  of physical space used for conducting research. Most universities  negotiate their indirect cost rate with HHS\u2019s Division of Cost Allocation  (DCA). Generally, the rate stays in effect for 2 to 4 years, at which time a  new proposal is developed and the rate is renegotiated.

Moreover, NIH has not developed a plan for how to deal with  potential continuing increases in indirect costs for universities. Instead,  HHS indicated that, in past years, increases in indirect costs have been  proportionally consistent with increases in direct costs, and therefore,  there is not an immediate risk to NIH\u2019s research portfolio. While the draft  report acknowledged that indirect costs have remained a stable  percentage of NIH\u2019s overall research costs, it also noted that, for  universities\u2014which received almost two-thirds of NIH\u2019s funding for  extramural research\u2014indirect costs increased notably faster than direct  costs during some recent periods. Further, as indicated in the draft report,  there are multiple indications that, for universities, indirect costs are likely  to increase at a faster rate in the future, so past stability may not be  sustained in future years. We remain convinced that increases in indirect  costs could have an effect over the long term on the number and size of  research grants that could be funded, thus posing a risk to scientific  discoveries and knowledge.", "In addition, in its comments, HHS included an analysis of indirect costs  over the past decade for its overall extramural research portfolio. This  analysis was different from our analysis because it focused generally on  extramural research rather than specifically on university research. As  noted in the draft report, our research questions were focused specifically  on universities. Moreover, as institutions of higher education, universities  generally have a broader focus on education than research institutions.  Further, as noted in the draft report, universities are subject to OMB  Circular No. A-21 and their administrative costs are capped, unlike other  research institutions. Because of the unique issues that universities face,  our analysis of indirect costs excluded nonuniversity research institutions  to avoid the possibility of data from these other NIH grantees masking  trends for universities, which are the recipients of the largest portion of  NIH\u2019s grant funding.", "Finally, HHS stated that we did not provide an opportunity for the  department to provide input on our review of NIH\u2019s assessment of the  potential impact of indirect costs on NIH\u2019s research mission. We disagree  with this characterization. NIH provided input on this issue to us during  three separate meetings. For all three meetings, we provided discussion  questions in advance. During one of the meetings, we and NIH officials  discussed the key facts that were to be included in the draft report,  including this issue. In addition, we offered NIH officials the opportunity to  provide additional information in writing, as appropriate.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date. At that time, we will send copies of this report to the  Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Director  of the National Institutes of Health, and other interested parties.
