CBP's National Targeting Center (NTC), the primary entity responsible for these analyses, conducts traveler data matching which assesses whether travelers are high-risk by matching their information against U.S. government databases and lists, and rules-based targeting, which enables CBP to identify unknown high-risk individuals. CBP operates multiple predeparture programs that use the results of NTC's analyses to help identify and interdict high-risk travelers before they board U.S.-bound flights. CBP officers inspect all U.S. bound travelers on precleared flights at the 15 Preclearance locations and, if deemed inadmissible, a traveler will not be permitted to board the aircraft. CBP also operates nine Immigration Advisory Program (IAP) and two Joint Security Program (JSP) locations as well as three Regional Carrier Liaison Groups (RCLG) that allow CBP to work with foreign government and air carrier officials to identify and interdict high-risk travelers. Through these programs, CBP may recommend that air carriers not permit such travelers to board U.S.-bound flights.", "CBP data show that it identified and interdicted over 22,000 high-risk air travelers in fiscal year 2015 through its predeparture programs. CBP officers at Preclearance locations determined that 10,648 of the approximately 16 million air travelers seeking admission to the United States through such locations were inadmissible. Similarly, CBP, through its IAP, JSP, and RCLG locations, made 11,589 no-board recommendations to air carriers for the approximately 88 million air travelers bound for the United States from such locations. While CBP's predeparture programs have helped identify and interdict high-risk travelers, CBP has not fully evaluated the overall effectiveness of these programs using performance measures and baselines. CBP tracks some data, such as the number of travelers deemed inadmissible, but has not set baselines to determine if predeparture programs are achieving goals, consistent with best practices for performance measurement. By developing and implementing a system of performance measures and baselines, CBP would be better positioned to assess if the programs are achieving their goals.", "CBP plans to expand its predeparture programs where possible, though several factors limit its ability to expand to all priority locations. In May 2015\u2014after soliciting interest among foreign airport authorities and scoring interested airports using risk and other factors\u2014CBP stated it would begin Preclearance expansion negotiations with 10 priority airports in 9 countries. As of November 2016, CBP had not completed the process required to begin operations in any locations prioritized for expansion, but had reached agreement with one location at which Preclearance operations could begin as early as 2019. According to senior CBP officials, Preclearance expansions are lengthy and complex processes because host governments and airports must be willing to allow for a Preclearance location, and CBP's Preclearance expansion strategy relies on partnering with airports that are willing to pay for the majority of operational costs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CBP develop and implement a system of performance measures and baselines to evaluate the effectiveness of its predeparture programs and assess whether the programs are achieving their stated goals.

DHS\u2019s  U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the federal agency with  primary responsibility for securing U.S. borders and processes all  travelers on U.S.-bound flights. In fiscal year 2015, CBP processed more  than 104 million U.S.-bound air travelers. CBP\u2019s efforts start before air  travelers enter a foreign port of embarkation\u2014including when an  individual applies for U.S. travel documents, or reserves, books, or  purchases an airline ticket\u2014and continue during travel up until officers  from CBP\u2019s Office of Field Operations (OFO) determine whether to admit  travelers into the United States at U.S. ports of entry (POE). CBP  implements multiple air predeparture programs designed to interdict high- risk individuals, such as foreign fighters and potential terrorists, human  traffickers, drug smugglers, and otherwise inadmissible persons, before  they board U.S.-bound aircraft. CBP officers assigned to these programs  query traveler data against government databases (referred to as vetting),  conduct in-person interviews of travelers at foreign airports (referred to as  interviewing), and conduct full examinations of travelers and their  belongings at foreign airports to determine admissibility to the United  States (referred to as inspecting), as appropriate. U.S.-bound travelers  are vetted, interviewed, or inspected prior to boarding flights, although not  all U.S.-bound travelers undergo all three processes. In fiscal year 2015,  CBP data indicate that more than 8,100 known or suspected terrorists, or  individuals with connections to known or suspected terrorists, attempted  to apply for travel to the United States or board U.S.-bound flights.

Moreover, according to the Director of National Intelligence, the  November 2015 attacks in Paris, France, which killed 130 people, were  conducted, in part, by European foreign fighters returning from Syria.  Furthermore, airport and air travel security remains a pressing current  issue, as evidenced by the October 2015 bombing of a Russian airliner in  the Sinai, Egypt, which killed all 224 passengers onboard, as well as the  March 2016 airport attack in Brussels, Belgium, which killed 32 people.", "You asked us to review CBP\u2019s air predeparture programs and CBP\u2019s  plans to expand them.

CBP\u2019s  predeparture programs use the results of NTC\u2019s efforts to identify and  interdict high-risk individuals destined for the United States while they are  still overseas. Specifically, CBP operates three air predeparture programs  that are responsible for all U.S.-bound air travelers\u2014Preclearance; the  Immigration Advisory Program (IAP) and Joint Security Program (JSP);  and the regional carrier liaison groups (RCLG).

As of  April 2016, CBP operates 15 air Preclearance locations in six countries.  Through the Preclearance program, uniformed CBP officers at a foreign  airport exercise U.S. legal authorities to inspect travelers and luggage  and make admissibility determinations prior to an individual boarding a  plane to the United States. According to CBP officials, an inspection at a  Preclearance location is the same inspection an individual would undergo  at a domestic POE, and officers conducting Preclearance inspections  exercise the same authority as officers at domestic POEs to approve or  deny admission into the United States. As a result, travelers arriving at  domestic air POEs from Preclearance locations do not have to be re- inspected upon entry or if they are connecting to a domestic flight. In  fiscal year 2015, CBP had about 600 staff located in Preclearance  facilities around the world.", "Immigration Advisory Program (IAP) and Joint Security Program  (JSP). IAP and JSP operate at foreign airports. According to CBP  officials, under this program, unarmed, plain clothes CBP officers posted  at foreign airports partner with air carriers and host country government  officials to help prevent terrorists and other high-risk individuals from  boarding U.S.-bound flights by vetting and interviewing them before  travel. According to CBP program documentation, CBP established IAP  in 2004 to prevent terrorists, high-risk, and improperly documented  travelers from boarding airlines destined to the United States. Building on  the IAP concept, CBP established JSP in 2009 to partner with host  country law enforcement officials to identify high-risk travelers. CBP  officers at IAP and JSP locations have the ability to question travelers and  review their travel documents. They are to act in an advisory manner to  the air carriers and host governments and do not have authority to deny  boarding to individuals on U.S.-bound flights or fully inspect travelers or  their belongings. IAP and JSP officers are authorized by CBP to make  recommendations to airlines as to whether to board or deny boarding  (known as a no-board recommendation) to selected travelers based on  their likely admissibility status upon arrival to the United States.

According to NTC officials responsible for the  rules-based targeting program, unknown high-risk travelers pose the  greatest threat to the United States because their information is not  contained in lists of known high-risk individuals and are therefore more  difficult to detect. CBP identifies unknown high-risk individuals by  comparing their information against a set of targeting rules based on  intelligence, law enforcement, and other information. NTC officials stated  that these rules have identified potential foreign fighters or other high-risk  travelers. Within CBP, the NTC develops, modifies, and implements the  targeting rules in ATS. On the basis of our interviews and reviews of CBP  documentation, we found that when designing or implementing any new  rules, NTC, in coordination with other partners at CBP, engages in a  multiple-step assessment and review process to ensure that the proposed  rule will meet its intended purpose and not impose an unjustifiable impact  on legitimate travelers.

Moreover, according to  CBP officials, information sharing through the JSP program has led to  enhanced coordination and targeting efforts to include taking action  against international drug, currency, and human smugglers, and known or  possible suspected terrorists. Similarly, during our site visits to three IAP  locations in Europe, foreign law enforcement officials we spoke with told  us that information sharing generally occurs informally between IAP  officers and host government officials rather than through formal channels  due to host country privacy concerns about formal information sharing  arrangements with other governments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Gathering Information to Improve NTC Targeting Efforts", "paragraphs": ["According to senior CBP officials, all of CBP\u2019s predeparture programs  provide key information that helps to improve NTC\u2019s targeting efforts and  also supports larger U.S. government information gathering efforts on  high-risk individuals and threats to the United States (see fig. 6). For  example, according to CBP data, in fiscal year 2015, CBP\u2019s predeparture  programs allowed CBP to identify thousands of previously unknown high- risk individuals and of these, CBP nominated more than 1,500 for  inclusion in the TSDB.", "According to senior CBP officials, CBP officers stationed overseas in  Preclearance, IAP, or JSP locations have the opportunity to collect  information about travelers, their travel history, and any other pertinent  information while engaging with these individuals in conversation as part  of interviewing or inspecting them. Officials told us that the information  collected can be maintained and used for future targeting efforts if these  individuals travel to the United States again."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Travel Facilitation", "paragraphs": ["Air carrier and airport authority representatives, foreign government  officials, and CBP officials we interviewed reported that CBP predeparture  operations help to facilitate travel into the United States. For example,  CBP officials, as well as air carrier and airport authority representatives  told us that Preclearance operations ensure that all individuals aboard a  given plane have already been inspected and have been cleared for entry  into the United States. As a result, officials told us that this provides  airports with more domestic airport arrival gate options by allowing  international flights to arrive at domestic terminals that may not otherwise  be equipped to properly inspect international travelers. IAP and JSP also  provide travel facilitation benefits, according to IAP and JSP officers we  spoke with. For example, IAP and JSP officers assist U.S. citizens and  lawful permanent residents who have lost, stolen, or expired  documentation. Although U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents  can generally not be denied entry to the United States under U.S.  immigration law, air carriers will typically deny boarding to travelers  without proper documentation because the air carrier cannot verify  documentation and the legal status of the individual as admissible to the  United States. According to IAP and JSP officers, having a physical  presence at the airport enables them to reconcile an individual\u2019s identity  by accessing CBP databases and recommending to the air carriers that  they board the traveler. Further, U.S. embassy officials we interviewed in  Europe stated that IAP officers routinely assist embassy staff in verifying  travelers\u2019 identities and, because of their access to CBP databases, IAP  officers are able to facilitate travel for U.S. citizens and lawful permanent  residents even when the embassy is closed. For example, embassy  officials in Western Europe reported that IAP officers were instrumental in  facilitating the travel of the parents of the American students who  thwarted a terrorist attack on the Thalys train from Amsterdam to Paris in  July 2015. Not all of the families had the required travel documentation for  entry into France, and IAP officers worked with the Western European  government and air carriers to ensure their arrival and departure."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CBP Has Not Evaluated Overall Effectiveness of Air Predeparture Programs", "paragraphs": ["CBP has not evaluated the effectiveness of its predeparture programs as  a whole, including implementing a system of performance measures and  baselines to assess whether the programs are achieving their stated  goals. In a January 2016 white paper, CBP states that its strategic goal  for its predeparture programs is to achieve comprehensive and highest  level coverage at all high-risk air transit points to the United States with a  focus on using the programs to push the U.S. borders outward to  intercept and address potential threats at the earliest possible  opportunity. Other program-specific documentation that we reviewed  articulates similar, high-level predeparture program objectives, which are  primarily focused on enhancing national security, counterterrorism, and  travel facilitation. CBP has taken some initial steps to measure the  performance of its air predeparture programs by collecting data on  program activities. For example, CBP tracks a variety of data on the  activities across Preclearance, IAP, JSP, and RCLG locations, including  data on the numbers of travelers issued no-board recommendations or  deemed inadmissible; invalid travel documents seized; and No-Fly List  and TSDB encounters. According to CBP officials, on occasion, CBP has  used these data, among other inputs, to support adjustments to its  operations, including closing two IAP former locations where CBP  determined that high-risk traveler volume did not merit having a location.  On the basis of our analysis of CBP documentation and interviews with  program officials, CBP has not assessed the performance of these  programs on a regular basis, in part because it has not established  baselines for these measures. Therefore, CBP does not have anything  against which to compare the data to determine whether the programs  are achieving stated goals. Solely tracking increases or decreases in  program data, such as traveler volume or the number of invalid travel  documents seized, does not allow CBP to fully evaluate its predeparture  programs as such changes in the data may not be an indicator of  program success or increased efficacy.", "CBP officials told us that they have collected a large quantity of data and  statistics regarding the actions of their predeparture programs and have  done so since program inception for all programs. However, due to  changes in operational focus, technology updates, and the use of  separate data systems at predeparture program locations, CBP has not  collected consistent data across all of its predeparture programs. As a  result, CBP does not have baseline data on which to measure program  performance. However, CBP officials stated that they now have updated  and uniform data collection systems that are consistent across all  predeparture programs. As a result, CBP officials stated that they should  be able to identify performance baselines from fiscal year 2015 onward.  According to senior CBP officials, some of the results of CBP\u2019s  predeparture programs are not easily measured. For example, some  benefits, such as coordination and information sharing with host  governments, are invaluable but difficult to measure. Officials also noted  that relying on data alone may not always present the most accurate  picture of the true impact of predeparture programs because changes to  the travel process or other factors may impact the predeparture programs  in ways that are not fully captured by the data. However, on the basis of  our analysis of CBP\u2019s documentation, including official hearing  statements, and interviews with predeparture program officials, CBP uses  these data as indicators of the programs\u2019 success.", "According to GAO\u2019s Program Evaluation Guide, which articulates best  practices for program evaluation, a program evaluation is a systematic  study using research methods to collect and analyze data to assess how  well a program is working and why. Program evaluation is closely  related to performance measurement and analyzes performance  measures to assess the achievement of performance objectives or goals.  Evaluations answer specific questions about program performance and  may focus on assessing program operations or results. Evaluation can  play a key role in strategic planning and in program management,  providing feedback on both program design and execution. Moreover, in  accordance with GPRA, as updated by the GPRA Modernization Act of  2010, performance measurement is the ongoing monitoring and reporting  of program accomplishments, particularly towards pre-established goals,  and agencies are to establish performance measures to assess progress  towards goals. Agencies can use performance measurement to make  various types of management decisions to improve programs and results,  such as developing strategies and allocating resources, and identify  problems and take corrective action. Developing and implementing a  system of performance measures and baselines for each program would  help ensure that these programs are achieving their intended goals.

According to CBP, Preclearance  expansion is a significant homeland security priority. CBP has reported  that it aims to preclear 33 percent of all U.S.-bound air travelers by 2024.  Accordingly, in September 2014, CBP invited foreign airport authorities  interested in having the United States expand Preclearance operations to  their location to submit letters of interest. CBP received 25 letters of  interest from foreign airport authorities. Of the 25 airports, CBP selected  18 to rank, prioritize, and score for potential new air Preclearance  locations. CBP, in conjunction with TSA and considering input from  Department of State, conducted technical site visits and evaluations of  these airports. In particular, CBP and TSA assessed these airports based  on a variety of factors related to national security, travel facilitation, and  feasibility of operations, among other things. In May 2015, DHS  announced plans to enter into formal negotiations to expand  Preclearance to 10 airports in 9 countries. According to CBP  Preclearance officials, all 10 priority airports are valuable in supporting  CBP\u2019s predeparture mission.", "Opening a new Preclearance location requires the entry into force of an  international agreement between the United States and a foreign  government and requires the resolution of various diplomatic issues such  as the extent of the law enforcement capability of CBP officers within the  host country to include the carriage of service weapons, CBP officer  immunity or legal status within the host country, and other complex  issues. After reaching an agreement with the host country, expansion  timelines may change due to competitive pressures, facility readiness,  and other factors, according to CBP Preclearance officials. The Director  of Preclearance noted that, in accordance with the Trade Facilitation and  Trade Enforcement Act of 2015, CBP will provide any requisite  information and certifications to the appropriate Congressional  committees before entering an agreement into force with the government  of a foreign country to establish Preclearance operations. In May 2016,  CBP again invited interested airport authorities to submit a letter of  interest to participate in the Preclearance program by August 1, 2016.", "CBP officials told us that they also aim to expand IAP or JSP operations  to other airports where CBP has determined there is a potential threat to  the United States but Preclearance may not always be feasible.

For example, not all of the airports that responded to CBP\u2019s expansion  solicitation may be able to secure the necessary support of their  governments to enter into negotiations with the United States for  Preclearance operations. Multiple senior CBP Preclearance officials  stated that the willingness and readiness of the host government and  airport authority are key factors impacting the timeline of expansion. As a  result, CBP\u2019s negotiation and planning efforts are furthest along with two  countries that currently have willing governments and airport authorities,  according to CBP officials. However, CBP did not select these two  locations solely based on their score among the 10 priority locations that  CBP selected for potential expansion. CBP officials stated that expanding  to these locations does not preclude CBP from establishing Preclearance  operations at some of the other airports where the benefits to the United  States might be greater, as long as these other eight locations can meet  CBP\u2019s requirements. According to CBP\u2019s Preclearance evaluation report,  some high-priority airports that are interested in Preclearance may face  challenges in meeting such requirements. For example, airports that  provide service to the United States on multiple U.S. air carriers, such as  London Heathrow, will need to ensure that all U.S. carriers have access  to Preclearance services by, for example, reconfiguring terminals,  according to CBP Preclearance officials. Further, airport authorities and  host country governments in many locations are not interested and do not  support establishing a CBP Preclearance operation.", "Moreover, CBP plans to expand Preclearance to locations where airport  authorities agree to reimburse CBP for certain costs. For the first 14  Preclearance locations, CBP assumed all of the costs of Preclearance  operations\u2014including officer pay, travel costs, and other operational  costs. Beginning with Abu Dhabi, CBP determined that its model for new  Preclearance locations would include a requirement for costs to be  shared with the host airport authority. CBP\u2019s expenses for Preclearance  inspections in Abu Dhabi are reimbursed to about 85 percent of all  expenses. According to CBP officials, under this model, CBP is able to  extend its borders without having to pay the full costs of operations.  Airport authority officials we spoke with in Canada stated that they valued  having CBP Preclearance operations at their facilities, but noted that high  up-front development and implementation costs could be potential  impediments for other airport authorities. Because of the cost-sharing  model CBP has implemented, not all airport authorities may be willing or  able to accept Preclearance operations in their facilities.", "According to CBP officials and documentation, airport authorities\u2019 and  host countries\u2019 willingness to participate also affects CBP\u2019s efforts to  expand IAP and JSP operations, particularly concerns related to  sovereignty, such as CBP officer presence in the country and airport.  These officials also raised concerns about airside access, such as access  to areas within the airport, freedom of movement, and ability to interview  travelers.

In addition, according to CBP hiring and  attrition data, as of February 2016, about one percent of initial applicants  for a CBP OFO officer qualify. This means that CBP needs approximately  78,000 new applicants in fiscal year 2016 to meet its current officer gap.  Further, in April 2016, CBP officials testified that OFO\u2019s staffing model  estimates that the agency will need to hire an additional 2,107 officers  through fiscal year 2017 to account for growing volumes of trade and  travel. CBP\u2019s stakeholders, including several air carriers and air carrier  associations we met with, also raised concerns about the impact of  expanding Preclearance operations on domestic POEs because CBP  plans to initially staff new locations with officers from domestic POEs.", "CBP\u2019s Office of Human Resources Management has taken several steps  to address the agency\u2019s broader staffing gaps. In addition, in April 2016,  CBP officials testified that CBP has begun initiatives aimed at decreasing  the amount of time it takes for an applicant to complete the hiring  process, increased the number of recruiting events, and coordinated with  the Department of Defense to recruit qualified veterans and individuals  separating from military service. Further, senior Preclearance officials  stated that when staffing Preclearance locations for start-up operations,  CBP selects temporary duty staff from various ports so as not to deplete  the capacity of any one domestic POE. IAP and JSP also use temporary  duty staff from multiple POEs for start-up and to augment core staff  during seasonal peak travel. Further, a senior Preclearance official stated  that new Preclearance locations will not be operational until sometime in  fiscal year 2017 at the earliest and that, similar to the process in Abu  Dhabi, CBP will initially staff a new operation with a smaller number of  temporary duty officers and then gradually increase the number of  permanent staff at these locations. Moreover, according to a CBP budget  official, since the costs of new Preclearance positions will be mostly  reimbursed by the foreign airport authorities, CBP will be able to backfill  positions at domestic POEs that were vacated as a result of moving staff  to Preclearance locations.", "In addition, CBP has reported that implementing additional Preclearance  locations will reduce wait times at domestic air POEs and lead to more  efficient inspections. Specifically, CBP\u2019s 2016 white paper notes that  Preclearance operations will reduce wait times at some of the busiest air  POEs in the United States. In addition, CBP officials also stated that  Preclearance operations have led to increased airport traveler processing  capacity. However, according to CBP officials responsible for data  collection and analysis across OFO programs, CBP does not have  generalizable data or analyses on the effect of Preclearance expansion  on domestic wait times, so they could not provide us with data to  corroborate this statement. Further, according to CBP officials and an  airline official we met with, reductions in wait times may be short-term  because airlines and airports may add new international routes in place of  precleared flights. On the basis of our review of CBP documentation, we  could not determine the extent to which there is a causal relationship  between Preclearance operations and long-term, reduced wait times at  domestic POEs.

Specifically, CBP intends to require the host airport authority to reimburse  CBP for all of the agricultural and immigration inspection-related costs  associated with Preclearance operations. Further, CBP officials stated  that new Preclearance locations will generally be expected to provide the  facilities and equipment necessary for Preclearance operations.  Moreover, Preclearance officials stated that they are planning to use  authority provided to CBP under the Trade Facilitation and Trade  Enforcement Act of 2015, enacted in February 2016, to collect  Preclearance payments for start-up costs in advance of opening new  Preclearance facilities, and to collect reimbursement in advance of  incurring the costs for the provision of certain activities, such as  immigration or agricultural inspection activities. By using these two  strategies, Preclearance officials stated that they should be able to secure  airport authority funding for almost all activities associated with the  planning and operations of future Preclearance locations. Although CBP  prefers that the airport authority pay the majority of Preclearance costs,  CBP officials stated that its expansion decisions are not solely driven by  the costs CBP would have to incur to set up and maintain a Preclearance  location.
