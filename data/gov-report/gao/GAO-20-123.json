Specifically, they have numerous cybersecurity requirements for states to follow when accessing, storing, and transmitting federal data.", "GAO was asked to evaluate federal agencies' cybersecurity requirements and related assessment programs for state agencies. The objectives were to determine the extent to which (1) selected federal agencies' cybersecurity requirements for state agencies varied with each other and federal guidance, and (2) federal agencies had policies for coordinating their assessments of state agencies' cybersecurity.", "GAO reviewed four federal agencies that shared data with states and had assessment programs: CMS, FBI, IRS, and SSA. GAO compared, among other things, each agency's cybersecurity requirements to federal guidance and to other selected agencies' requirements; and reviewed federal agencies' policies for conducting assessments. In addition, GAO examined OMB's efforts to foster coordination among federal agencies. GAO also surveyed and received responses from chief information security officers in 50 out of 55 U.S. states, territories, and the District of Columbia to obtain their perspectives."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and Social Security Administration (SSA) each established requirements to secure data that states receive, these requirements often had conflicting parameters. Such parameters involve agencies defining specific values like the number of consecutive unsuccessful logon attempts prior to locking out the user. Among the four federal agencies, the percentage of total requirements with conflicting parameters ranged from 49 percent to 79 percent. Regarding variance with National Institute of Standards and Technology guidance, GAO found that the extent to which the four agencies did not fully address guidance varied from 9 percent to 53 percent of total requirements. The variances were due in part to the federal agencies' insufficient coordination in establishing requirements. Although the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Circular A-130 requires agencies to coordinate, OMB has not ensured that agencies have done so. Further, while federal agencies' variance among requirements may be justified in some cases because of particular agency mission needs, the resulting impact on states is significant, according to state chief information security officers (see figure).", "The four federal agencies that GAO reviewed either fully or partially had policies for coordinating assessments with states, but none of them had policies for coordinating assessments with each other. State chief information security officers that GAO surveyed reinforced the need to coordinate assessments by identifying impacts on state agencies' costs, including multiple federal agencies that requested the same documentation. Coordinating with state and federal agencies when assessing state agencies' cybersecurity may help to minimize states' cost and time impacts and reduce associated federal costs. Federal agencies reported spending about $45 million for fiscal years 2016 through 2018 on assessments of state agencies' cybersecurity."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making 12 recommendations to the four selected agencies and to OMB.

The Federal Information  Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA) and guidance from the Office  of Management and Budget (OMB) emphasize that federal agencies are  to use risk-based processes for information security. FISMA provides a  comprehensive framework for information security controls over  information resources and requires each agency to develop, document,  and implement an agency-wide information security program to provide risk-based protections for the information and information systems that  support the operations and assets of the agency.", "To protect and secure the sensitive information exchanged with states,  each federal agency that exchanges data has specific regulations,  guidelines, or other requirements for states to follow when accessing,  storing, and transmitting the data. Further, federal agencies have  established assessment programs to ensure that the state agencies  comply with their cybersecurity requirements.", "At your request, we evaluated federal agencies\u2019 cybersecurity  requirements and related assessment programs for state agencies. Our  specific objectives were to determine the extent to which (1) selected  federal agencies\u2019 cybersecurity requirements for state agencies varied  with each other and federal guidance, and (2) federal agencies had  policies for coordinating their assessments of state agencies\u2019  cybersecurity.", "To accomplish the objectives, we first selected a sample of federal  agencies for our review. To do so, we determined which of the 24  agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers Act (1) shared data with  state agencies; (2) had a standard, minimum set of cybersecurity  requirements to protect these data; and (3) conducted regularly  scheduled assessments of states\u2019 compliance with the requirements. We  identified four agencies that met these criteria: the Centers for Medicare  and Medicaid Services (CMS) within the Department of Health and  Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s (FBI) Criminal  Justice Information Services (CJIS) within the Department of Justice, the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) within the Department of the Treasury, and the Social Security Administration (SSA). The results of our review of  these four agencies are not generalizable to other federal agencies.", "For the first objective, we reviewed the National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-53 (Revision 4), to identify  cybersecurity controls and control enhancements that we could use as a  basis for comparing federal agencies\u2019 cybersecurity requirements for  state agencies. We specifically chose those controls and control  enhancements where organizations, such as the federal agencies we  selected, are to define specific values when tailoring their requirements.  Based on this criterion, we identified a nonprobability sample of 616 (out  of 1,682) cybersecurity controls and control enhancements for our review.", "Then, for each of the four selected federal agencies, we identified its  cybersecurity requirements that state agencies are to comply with when  exchanging data with the federal agency.

In addition, we identified practices recommended  by NIST related to federal agencies\u2019 coordination on assessments of  cybersecurity.", "Based on our reviews of these guidance documents, we identified two  broad areas of coordination that were relevant to federal agencies\u2019  assessments of state agencies\u2019 cybersecurity: (1) coordination with state  agencies when assessing states\u2019 cybersecurity and (2) coordination with  other federal agencies on the assessments of state agencies\u2019  cybersecurity.", "Using guidance from NIST that pertained to coordination on assessments  of cybersecurity and practices recommended by GAO for enhancing  coordination among federal agencies, we identified four supporting  activities that were common to each of these two areas of federal  agencies\u2019 coordination on cybersecurity assessments: assessment schedules and time frames, meeting and document requests,  security test plans, and  the use of findings from prior assessments.", "We then analyzed the selected federal agencies\u2019 policies and related  procedures for conducting assessments of state agencies\u2019 cybersecurity,  as discussed in relevant documentation, such as assessment  methodologies, pre-evaluation questionnaires, and report templates. In  doing so, we reviewed agencies\u2019 policies to identify whether there was  discussion of the four activities supporting the two areas of coordination  with state agencies and with other federal agencies.", "We determined that an agency  fully addressed an area of coordination if its policies included  discussion about coordination on all of the four supporting activities; partially addressed an area of coordination if its policies included  discussion of some, but not all, of the supporting activities; and did not address an area of coordination if its policies did not include  any discussion of the supporting activities.", "We supplemented our documentation review with interviews of cognizant  officials from FBI\u2019s CJIS Information Technology Management Section  and the CJIS Audit Unit; IRS\u2019s Office of Safeguards; CMS\u2019s Office of  Information Technology; and SSA\u2019s offices of General Counsel; Analytics,  Review, and Oversight; and Deputy Commissioner for Systems. We  discussed with agency officials our observations of variances in agencies\u2019  cybersecurity requirements for state agencies, as well as their policies for  coordinating with state agencies and other federal agencies when  assessing state agencies\u2019 cybersecurity. We also interviewed officials  from OMB\u2019s Office of E-Government and Information Technology to  discuss the extent to which federal agencies have coordinated on their  assessments of state agencies\u2019 cybersecurity.", "In addition, for both objectives, we administered a survey to the offices of  the Chief Information Officer and Chief Information Security Officer  (CISO) in the 50 states, District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam,  Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Several questions from our  survey requested that state CISOs provide their subjective views based  on a range of alternatives. For example, regarding the question on the  extent to which federal cybersecurity requirements varied, we asked state  CISOs to identify the extent of variation for three scenarios as very great,  great, moderate, slight, none, or unknown.

Coordinating to address variances in federal agencies\u2019  cybersecurity requirements could help to significantly reduce these costs.  The selected agencies will soon have an opportunity to coordinate on any  planned updates of their security policies that affect state agencies when  reviewing their security policies against expected revisions in NIST  guidance.
