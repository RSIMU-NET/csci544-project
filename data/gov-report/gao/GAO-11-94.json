Increased demand for public transportation can create opportunities and challenges for communities working to meet demand, improve service, and maintain transit systems, while operating within budgetary constraints. Transit agencies rely on a variety of funding sources, including federal, state, and local entities, and other sources, such as fares. The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Federal Transit Administration administers federal grant programs transit agencies can use to help meet ridership demand, such as for purchasing buses and modernizing rail systems. As requested, this report addresses (1) trends in transit ridership and services from 1998 through 2008, (2) challenges, if any, transit agencies faced during this period to address increased ridership and actions they took in response, and (3) factors that might affect future ridership demand and the ability of transit agencies to meet that demand. GAO analyzed data from the National Transit Database on transit ridership (i.e., passenger miles traveled), service (i.e., vehicle revenue miles), costs, and revenues; conducted interviews with 15 transit agencies operating heavy rail, light rail, and bus; interviewed federal officials and others; and reviewed prior GAO recommendations. DOT generally agreed with the report and provided technical comments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From 1998 through 2008, the most recent year for which complete data are available, transit ridership grew at a faster rate than transit service. Heavy rail experienced the greatest difference between growth in ridership and service compared with light rail or bus--heavy rail ridership outpaced the provision of service by about 18 percentage points during this period. Transit agency costs and revenues also increased overall from 1998 through 2008, but the relative shares of revenue sources changed. The share of federal funding remained steady while increases in state and local funding shares offset declines in the share of funding from other sources, such as passenger fares. In addition, in 1998 the federal government was the largest source of capital investment in transit; by 2008 local government provided the largest share. From 1998 through 2008, transit agencies faced challenges and took actions to address increased ridership demand. Specifically, agencies faced capacity constraints, including limitations of their vehicles (e.g., too few rail cars and buses) and their system infrastructure (e.g., platforms that were too short to accommodate longer trains). Transit agencies took steps to respond to increased demand, including: adjusting their service by modifying routes, fares, and hours of service; making new system investments, such as expanding fleets and extending platforms; and maintaining and updating existing infrastructure and vehicles. For example, New York City transit officials improved the signaling in their heavy rail system to increase frequency of service. Agencies experienced varying degrees of success in responding to increases in demand--some reported accommodating increases in ridership while others' success was limited. For example, a light rail agency reported that its service area did not keep pace with real estate development, and a bus agency turned away riders. Population growth and other factors are likely to increase future ridership demand, but cost increases and fiscal uncertainties could limit transit agencies' ability to meet this demand. Transit agency officials expressed concern about meeting future increases in ridership due to increased costs of expanding transit systems and maintaining aging infrastructure. Also, transit agencies' funding has been strained since 2008, as state and local funding has decreased with the economic downturn. This is significant because transit agencies previously relied on increases in state and local funding shares to offset decreases in other sources. Given this environment, along with fiscal difficulties facing the nation, it will be a challenge to effectively focus limited resources to maximize the positive effect on transit agencies' services. GAO and others have made recommendations to DOT, Congress, and others on options that could more effectively deliver federal surface transportation programs and help transit agencies address growing ridership. These options are under consideration and include: focusing resources on state of good repair, streamlining the delivery of federal grant programs, and incorporating performance accountability measures to maximize the impact of investments."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Demand for public transportation in the United States reached record  highs in 2008 and rose in the decade prior to 2008.

A variety of other funding sources also  support the provision of transit services, including assistance from state  and local entities, and sources such as passenger fares. To assist transit  agencies, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) within the Department  of Transportation (DOT) administers a variety of federal grant programs  that can be used to help meet ridership demand, such as grants for  purchasing buses and modernizing rail systems.

Transit agencies also rely on a variety of  other funding sources to help provide service, including assistance from  state and local entities, and other sources such as passenger fares. State  and local governments are ultimately responsible for executing most  federal transit programs by matching and distributing federal funding and  by planning, selecting, and supervising infrastructure projects in  accordance with federal requirements. In addition, in some cases, financial  assistance programs administered by the Federal Highway Administration  (FHWA), or jointly administered by FHWA and FTA, can also be used to  support transit agencies.

For example, those transit systems that had to add service  to accommodate growing ridership during this period, and finance the  associated costs, likely used state and local funding to supplement  decreases in other funding sources, including passenger fares. Since fares  collected from passengers typically do not cover the full cost of their  transit trips, these agencies essentially experienced a widening gap  between passenger fare revenue and costs as ridership increased. This gap  can significantly limit the ability of transit agencies to increase transit  service in response to rising demand. In almost all cases, expanding transit  service would require securing additional funding to bridge this gap.", "Upon closer examination of the components of transit funding sources,  the shares of revenue sources for operating and capital funding differ  slightly from the shares for total revenues mentioned previously. For  example:    Operating funding. Fare revenues were the largest source of operating  funding in 1998 and 2008; however, as shown in figure 4, the share of fare  revenues decreased considerably as a percentage of operating funding  during this time period (from about 38 percent to 31 percent).

More specifically, agencies faced  capacity constraints related to limitations of their vehicles (e.g., too few  rail cars and buses) and system infrastructure (e.g., platforms that were  too short to accommodate longer trains). In particular, several of the  heavy rail, light rail, and bus agencies we interviewed experienced  capacity constraints within existing vehicles as well as shortages of rail  cars and buses. For example, an official with the Ann Arbor  Transportation Authority said the agency did not always have the bus  capacity to accommodate increased demand, sometimes resulting in  overcrowding on buses. In San Francisco, the heavy rail system\u2019s  serviceable rail cars were in such high demand that they did not always  have enough time to undergo sufficient maintenance, which officials said  led to problems with vehicle reliability and a shortage of vehicles. TriMet,  which provides light rail services to the metropolitan area of Portland,  Oregon, was sometimes unable to meet demand for its services due to  vehicle shortages, such as prior to opening a new rail line and new rail  cars becoming available. Agency officials said that long lead times for  vehicle procurements limited their ability to respond to growing demand  in a timely manner, but that they eventually were able to procure  additional rail cars to satisfy passenger demand on the new line.

Most of the agencies that  reported infrastructure-related challenges from 1998 through 2008  provided heavy or light rail services. Infrastructure constraints, such as  those related to stations, tracks, and other facilities, posed challenges to  transit agencies. For example, from 1998 through 2008:    Chicago\u2019s heavy rail system faced challenges related to its platform  capacity. Due to the platform limitations of certain heavy rail stations,  Chicago Transit Authority officials could only operate six-car trains where  eight-car trains would have reduced congestion. These stations\u2019 platforms  were not long enough to accommodate passengers loading and unloading  from eight-car trains. As a result of capacity constraints at these stations,  the agency could not always meet passenger demand or allow all  passengers to board.", "Los Angeles County\u2019s heavy rail system ran out of parking spaces  immediately after opening parking lots at the northern end of one of its rail  lines.

Therefore, upgrading the  power system components so they could accommodate eight-car trains  was a significant challenge that agency officials addressed during the 10- year period in which they worked to expand the system\u2019s overall capacity.", "Table 2 summarizes these and other examples of infrastructure-related  challenges that heavy rail and light rail agencies faced when addressing  increased passenger demand from 1998 through 2008.", "During this time period, agencies also faced challenges related to  maintaining aging infrastructure. Heavy rail agencies in particular have  faced challenges related to aging infrastructure because their aging assets  have increasingly needed capital reinvestments, even as ridership has  grown. For example, officials from the Washington Metropolitan Area  Transit Authority said the agency needed to shift its focus from new  construction to maintenance during this time period, yet securing funds to  maintain existing assets proved more difficult than securing funds for new  projects. In addition, balancing scheduled maintenance with expanding  hours of service also proved challenging. Light rail officials, such as those  at Portland\u2019s TriMet, said they recognize that managing aging  infrastructure will take significantly more effort in the future. Currently,  the oldest section of TriMet\u2019s system is only 24 years old, which is  relatively new in comparison with some of the nation\u2019s oldest systems;  however, agency officials have already begun capacity planning in  preparation for the challenges to come during the next 20 years.", "Many of the transit agencies we interviewed faced budget and funding  constraints. In some cases, these constraints limited their ability to  increase services to accommodate additional riders. For example, from  1998 through 2008:    Balancing a constrained operating budget with increased demand for  services posed a challenge for Chicago\u2019s heavy rail system. During this  time period, the agency\u2019s funding sources\u2014including state capital bonds  and general revenues\u2014did not grow enough to fully cover the agency\u2019s  maintenance needs and personnel costs, according to transit officials.  Because public transit riders typically do not pay for the full cost of their  rides, increasing ridership further stressed the Chicago system\u2019s operating  budget, according to agency officials.

Agency officials ultimately compromised on their goal of  increasing service to every 15 minutes and increased service instead to  every 30 minutes.

For example, the light rail agency in Sacramento, California,  extended service hours during a period of high demand in 2008 when an  interstate highway in the area was under construction. During this time  period, which coincided with an increase in gas prices, there was standing  room only on the line that serviced that particular area and some riders  could not get onto a train.

Officials  from a local agency and community group said the transit agency met  demand within the city of Sacramento fairly well, and the system had  enough capacity to meet those riders\u2019 needs. However, they added that as  the area developed housing and employment centers outside the  downtown area, the agency was not always able to meet the needs of  commuters from outlying or newer-growth areas. Nor was the agency  always able to meet the needs of potential riders who chose to drive rather  than use public transit due to inconvenient transfers or a shortage of  transit services, according to the community group official.", "All five bus agencies we interviewed had limited success in meeting  ridership demand. Some agencies could not add the services needed to  accommodate increasing demand. Others had to turn away riders, while  others reported that their ability to expand to meet the needs of emerging  markets was limited. For example, a transit official from Ann Arbor\u2019s bus  agency said the agency was generally successful in meeting demand within  the city of Ann Arbor, but was not as successful in surrounding  communities due to funding constraints. Representatives of a local  community group and intergovernmental agency added that the agency  turned away riders during periods of high demand and service on many  routes was too infrequent. However, local officials, as well as community  and business groups, acknowledged the efforts the agency has made to  respond to increased ridership demand amidst funding and resource  challenges."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Demographic Changes Point to Future Increases in Ridership Demand, but Cost Increases and Fiscal Uncertainties May Limit Agencies\u2019 Ability to Meet Demand", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Population Increases and Other Demographic Trends May Increase Future Demand", "paragraphs": ["Estimates for future population growth and other demographic trends  point to potential increases in future ridership demand. According to U.S.  Census Bureau projections, the U.S. population will increase by 20.4  percent from 2010 to 2030. Demographic changes point to increases in  future demand as well.", "Trends in growing redevelopment and increased densities in the urban  core, as well as continued growth of housing and employment centers  near outlying suburban transit hubs, are expected to contribute to future  increases in ridership demand. Additionally, increased focus on transit- oriented development around transit stations in both urban and suburban  areas may also increase future ridership demand. For example, the  regional planning agency in the San Francisco Bay Area anticipates a  substantial amount of continued growth and redevelopment of San  Francisco\u2019s urban core. Transit agency officials also noted that while San  Francisco used to be the principal destination for employers, areas outside  of the city, such as Walnut Creek, Dublin, Pleasanton, and San Jose, are  increasingly attracting employment centers, which has increased traffic on  reverse commute routes. Furthermore, the transit agency is collaborating  with others to encourage transit-oriented developments near transit  stations. Property values have held steady near transit stations as  compared with declines in property values in other areas. For example,  according to transit agency officials, to date, property values in the city of  San Francisco were barely impacted by the housing downturn, whereas  areas further out with less access to transit were impacted more greatly,  indicating that people are starting to see the value of living near public  transit.", "Increases in the transportation-disadvantaged populations\u2014those who  must rely on public transit for their travel\u2014may also increase future  ridership demand. For example, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, in  2030, baby boomers aged 65 and older will comprise nearly 20 percent of  all U.S. residents. Transit officials that we spoke with said that individuals  may become increasingly transit-dependent as they age. Transit officials in  Ithaca, New York, anticipate a peak in their senior population starting  around 2020 and expect that as people retire, they may stop driving  personal vehicles, which may contribute to increases in transit ridership.  Also, according to transit officials in Portland, Oregon, the prominence of  the aging demographic will become more noticeable as the baby boomers  age \u201cin place\u201d (i.e., remain in the Portland metropolitan area). Over time,  officials said that accommodating the aging population on bus and light  rail services and providing transit services that are accessible,  comfortable, and safe will be challenging but critical. However, officials  added that accommodating the expected increase in seniors is an  important consideration for transit agencies, especially because  complementary paratransit service, the alternative for individuals unable  to use fixed-route transit service, is more expensive to provide per rider.  We previously reported that it is difficult for transit agencies to balance  providing complementary paratransit service with the increased cost of  accommodating a growing ridership. Additionally, increased densities in  urban areas may increase transit-dependent populations, where transit is a  mode of necessity for many city residents. In Dallas, Texas, and  Frederick, Maryland, transit agency officials also noted increases in the  low-income population, who rely upon transit to get to their jobs primarily  within the service sector, which they anticipate will increase transit  ridership demand in these areas.", "Transit agency officials and others with whom we spoke also identified an  expectation that discretionary riders will impact future increases in  ridership demand. Specifically, they expect that a younger demographic  will migrate into cities and increasingly use transit, consistent with their  quality-of-life preferences and environmental concerns. For example, Ann  Arbor business community representatives told us that an increasingly  younger workforce commutes from nearby communities where housing is  cheaper and prefers to take transit. According to transit agency officials in  Portland, Oregon, there is a growing younger population with certain  lifestyle expectations, including the ability to walk, bike, or take transit to  meet most of their transportation needs.", "Although transit agency officials anticipate future ridership increases, the  extent of this increase is sometimes difficult to determine. We previously  reported that some metropolitan planning organizations face challenges in  travel demand forecasting, including a lack of technical capacity and data  necessary to conduct complex transportation modeling required to meet  their planning needs. Some transit agency officials with whom we spoke  also noted that a lack of technical expertise and resources needed to  accurately forecast future ridership growth is a challenge. According to  FTA officials, difficulties transit agencies may have in assessing the  demand for existing or new services could affect their ability to meet  future demand. Specifically, if future ridership demand is not accurately  projected, transit agencies may not make the best investment of their  resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies\u2019 Increased Costs and Fiscal Uncertainties May Limit Their Ability to Meet Future Increases in Ridership Demand", "paragraphs": ["Transit agency officials expressed concern about their agencies\u2019 abilities  to meet future increases in ridership demand for two principal reasons:  increased costs and various fiscal uncertainties."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Increased Costs", "paragraphs": ["Future costs for transit agencies will increase because agencies must  continue to support system expansions and add capacity to accommodate  for increases in ridership demand, as well as address additional expenses  associated with maintaining a state of good repair for aging infrastructure.  According to FTA, aging capital assets drive increasing maintenance costs  and limit the ability to expand system capacity at a time of high demand.  FTA has also reported that roughly one-third (29 percent) of all transit  assets are in poor or marginal condition, implying that these assets are  near or have already exceeded their expected useful life and need  significant capital reinvestment for rehabilitation or replacement. Based  on FTA\u2019s most recent estimates, $77.7 billion is needed to bring all the  nation\u2019s transit systems into a state of good repair. In addition, an annual  average of $14.4 billion would be required to maintain the systems.", "Officials from heavy rail and light rail agencies with whom we spoke in  particular said they anticipate facing increasingly difficult challenges  related to maintaining a state of good repair and operating their systems as  they continue to age. For example, in Chicago, increasing ridership on the  heavy rail transit system placed a significant amount of stress on the  agency\u2019s operating budget. As a result, the agency deferred maintenance,  which in turn impacted its ability to meet demand due to service delays  and other maintenance-related problems on the aging system. Since 2008,  challenges related to the agency\u2019s operating budget have persisted, and,  starting in February 2010, the agency had to implement $100 million in  service cuts to help balance its budget. Also, officials from the heavy rail  agency in Washington, D.C., said the challenge of maintaining and  repairing their aging system increased from 1998 through 2008, and they  expect this trend to continue. Washington, D.C., transit officials said that  before 1998 the agency focused on constructing and expanding a new  system. In 1998, the system\u2019s 103 miles of track had not been completely  built, but the oldest part of the system was only 22 years old. However, by  2008, the oldest portion of the system was 32 years old and officials said  they needed to devote significant resources to maintaining the system.", "As compared with the majority of the large heavy rail systems, the  infrastructures of light rail systems are relatively newer. For example, the  oldest section of Portland, Oregon\u2019s, light rail system is 24 years old, as  compared with the heavy rail systems in Chicago and New York which are  over 100 years old. However, although officials at Portland\u2019s transit agency  said they have a robust capital maintenance program, they also said that  without an influx of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009  (Recovery Act) funding in 2009, which the agency specifically targeted to  help reduce a backlog of systems and vehicle maintenance, the transit  agency would have fallen further behind in its maintenance needs. For NJ  Transit, the light rail extension of the Newark line was financially  challenging because of the line\u2019s aging infrastructure. In order to extend  the line, the agency had to upgrade the entire track and signaling system,  while undergoing other maintenance-related expenses such as the  maintenance and rehabilitation of transit stations and vehicles, as well as  maintaining a general state of good repair of the system as a whole.", "Further, transit agency officials anticipated that increases in the costs  associated with providing paratransit services necessitated by projected  demographic changes, such as increases in the transit-dependent  population, would be a challenge looking ahead."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fiscal Uncertainties", "paragraphs": ["Due to operating deficits that states and localities currently face, state and  local governments may not be able to continue their past level of support  which may ultimately limit transit agencies\u2019 ability to meet future  increases in ridership demand. Officials from the agencies with whom we  spoke said that since 2008, the economic downturn has put a strain on all  sources of funding for transit agencies, particularly state and local sources  of funding. We have reported that states and localities face near-term  budget and long-term fiscal challenges that will grow over time. States\u2019  revenue shortfalls have been cushioned by the temporary infusion of  Recovery Act funds. For example, we found that officials in local  governments used Recovery Act funds to maintain services, retain staff  positions, or begin infrastructure and public works projects that otherwise  would have been delayed or canceled. However, local government officials  also reported they experienced revenue declines and budget gaps even  after incorporating Recovery Act funds in their budgets. Officials at some  localities reported that while these funds have helped to preserve services,  they still faced budget deficits for the remainder of fiscal year 2010 and the  next fiscal year. We also previously reported that state and local  governments face increasing fiscal challenges in the next 50 years and  these pressures have implications for federal programs. For example,  estimates of the costs to repair, replace, or upgrade aging infrastructure so  that it can safely, efficiently, and reliably meet current demands, as well as  expand capacity to meet increasing demands, top hundreds of billions of  dollars. The nation\u2019s transit infrastructure is owned, funded, and operated  by all levels of government. In this environment, all levels of government  will compete for resources to meet the demand for infrastructure  improvements, which may exceed what the nation can afford.", "As previously discussed, from 1998 through 2008, while overall transit  revenues (including operating and capital funding) increased, increases in  the share of state and local government funding offset decreases in the  share of other nonfederal funding sources, such as passenger fares. In  addition, while in 1998 the federal government was the largest source of  capital investment in transit, by 2008 this was no longer the case. Instead,  local government replaced the federal government as the largest source.  However, as state and local governments are currently facing budget  shortfalls, transit agency officials raised concerns that fiscal uncertainties  may limit their agencies\u2019 ability to meet future increases in ridership  demand. For example, the state of California eliminated all state transit  development assistance for state fiscal years 2009 and 2010 because of the  state\u2019s fiscal situation, and it has only been partially restored for 2011.  Officials from Merced County Transit in California said the bus agency\u2019s  biggest challenges will be insufficient operating funds due to the  elimination of state transit development assistance and a decrease in local  sales tax revenue, which will not allow for any bus service expansions.  Similarly, light rail officials from Sacramento Regional Transit, which also  operates in California, said the agency is struggling to survive the  economic downturn given a major cut in state transit assistance (which  was approximately $15 million to $16 million each year and nearly 10  percent of its total operating budget), declining local sales tax revenues,  and widespread state employee furloughs, which have impacted farebox  revenues. Additionally, according to transit agency officials we spoke  with, the uncertainty of federal funding levels with the pending surface  transportation reauthorization combined with anticipated decreases in  state and local funding poses challenges for long-term planning."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Options Exist to More Effectively Deliver Federal Surface Transportation Programs and Help Transit Agencies Meet Increased Ridership Demand", "paragraphs": ["We and others have reported on ways to more effectively deliver federal  surface transportation programs that could help transit agencies address  growing ridership demand amid fiscal uncertainties.

However, the nation faces mounting fiscal  difficulties and although demand on transit systems is expected to grow,  increased federal financial support is not something transit agencies can  count on. Therefore, the challenge is to focus the resources that are  available to effectively maximize the impact on transit agencies\u2019 services.  We and others have made recommendations to Congress and others about  how to restructure federal programs to better assist transit agencies and  the federal government in focusing scarce resources and addressing future  ridership demand, including:  focusing resources on maintaining the nation\u2019s rail and bus systems in a  state of good repair;    streamlining the delivery of federal grant programs and projects; and  incorporating performance accountability into federal programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "State of Good Repair", "paragraphs": ["A critical component of addressing future ridership demand is the need for  the federal government and transit agencies to focus on transit systems\u2019  state of good repair.

This could ultimately lead to a loss of riders due to resulting problems,  such as service delays and safety issues.", "According to FTA, bringing the nation\u2019s transit system to a state of good  repair, while at the same time planning for and implementing needed  service expansions to accommodate demand, will be a significant  challenge. Despite ongoing investment, many of the nation\u2019s vehicles and  much of its infrastructure are deteriorating. For transit riders, this  deterioration eventually leads to declining service reliability. For transit  operators, aging capital assets drive increasing maintenance costs and  limit the ability to expand system capacity at a time of high demand. The  President\u2019s fiscal year 2011 budget request included, for FTA, a new State  of Good Repair initiative for bus and rail transit agencies to bring  infrastructure into a state of good repair. The proposed initiative combines  two existing programs, namely the Fixed Guideway Modernization  Program (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5309(b)(2)) and the Bus and Bus Facilities Program  (49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5309(b)(3), 5318), and would provide $2.9 billion for fiscal  year 2011, an 8 percent increase over the combined programs\u2019 fiscal year  2010 level of funding. The President has submitted his budget request to  Congress. In addition, the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure of the U.S. House of Representatives issued A Blueprint for  Investment and Reform (Blueprint) in 2009, which is a summary of a  proposal for the pending reauthorization of the surface transportation  legislation. It focuses the majority of transit funding into four core  categories, one of which is to bring urban and rural public transit systems  to a state of good repair.", "Officials from the majority of transit agencies with whom we spoke  emphasized the importance of maintaining a state of good repair in order  to meet future increases in ridership demand. However, agency officials  pointed out it is easier to procure additional federal funding to support  new transit capital projects than to obtain funding to help maintain their  existing vehicles and infrastructure. Transit agency officials explained that  their agencies rely on annual federal transit formula funds to address  ongoing needs, but additional federal funds available beyond those yearly  allocations are focused on new capital investments as opposed to  maintaining a state of good repair. Further, when asked how federal grants  could be improved to better help transit agencies address ridership  demand, agency officials reported that flexibility in how funding could be  used, either for capital or operating purposes based on an agency\u2019s needs,  would be particularly helpful for efforts to maintain a state of good repair  and other core capacity issues. Transit agency officials also indicated that  if their systems\u2019 state of good repair needs are not met and infrastructure  maintenance is deferred, they will not be able to efficiently and effectively  address future ridership demand.", "Further, the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study  Commission, which was required by SAFETEA-LU to study and identify  key areas for federal focus for the nation\u2019s surface transportation system,  concluded that the area of highest priority\u2014and the foundation for all of  the report\u2019s other recommendations\u2014was to bring the nation\u2019s  infrastructure, including transit assets, into a state of good repair.  Specifically, the Commission stated that states, local governments, and  other entities must develop, fund, and implement a program of asset  maintenance and support over the useful life of the asset in order to assure  the maximum effectiveness of federal capital support. According to FTA,  currently only a few transit agencies actively maintain transit asset  inventories for capital planning purposes and there is no federal reporting  requirement for transit assets except for vehicles. However, FTA officials  added that while some data on fixed infrastructure are collected in the  NTD, they are limited in scope. FTA also noted that a comprehensive and  effective asset management program could help transit agencies establish  organizational state of good repair objectives, assess the magnitude of the  issue, better coordinate agency planning and decision-making functions,  and ultimately help transit agencies prioritize their most critical needs,  especially with scarce funds for state of good repair and deferred  maintenance backlogs. Additionally, the Senate report accompanying the  fiscal year 2010 appropriations bill for the Department of Transportation  (DOT), directed FTA to take a leadership role in improving the use of asset  management practices among transit agencies. According to FTA  officials, in response to this congressional direction, FTA is undertaking a  new initiative to provide technical assistance and develop new data  resources to help transit agencies improve their asset management  practices. FTA officials added that this initiative is intended to promote a  better understanding of how the industry can achieve state of good repair  goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Streamlining the Delivery of Federal Grant Programs and Projects", "paragraphs": ["We and others have recommended that the current federal grant approval  process for large transit capital projects be simplified and streamlined to  speed up project delivery and reduce costs. This includes streamlining the  delivery of federal transportation grant programs such as the New Starts  project planning and development approval process and the required  environmental reviews. The New Starts program is the primary federal  source for major transit capital investments for construction of new fixed  guideway systems or extensions to existing systems. Transit agency  officials indicated that New Starts funding helped their agencies address  increases in ridership demand. However, officials from nearly half of the  heavy and light rail transit agencies with whom we spoke also said it  would be helpful if the federal grant process were more streamlined and  efficient. Agency officials explained that the development and approval  process for large transit capital projects can be lengthy. Further, the  process can become more difficult as agencies are concurrently trying to  use the finite resources they have to accommodate growing demand.", "In prior work, we recommended that DOT assess streamlining options,  such as combining project phases, for the New Starts program. We also  recommended that DOT seek legislative changes, if necessary, to  implement options to expedite the New Starts process. DOT agreed with  our recommendations noting that the options identified are consistent  with the options that FTA has been discussing with transit stakeholders  and congressional staff. However, while each option could help expedite  the process, each option has advantages and disadvantages to consider.  For example, each option would likely require certain trade-offs, namely,  potentially reducing the level of rigor in the evaluation process in  exchange for a more streamlined process. As we have previously  reported, the length of the New Starts process is due, at least in part, to the  rigorous and systematic evaluation and rating process required by law.  The rigor of the program is intended to help FTA hold transit agencies  accountable for results, maximize the benefits of each dollar invested, and  ensure that the federal obligation to the project is not affected by cost and  schedule overruns. Our previous work has also identified delays in the  New Starts project development process due to FTA\u2019s project  management oversight. According to some project sponsors, in some  cases, addressing additional oversight requirements has increased the time  and resources required by the project sponsor which also increases total  project costs. However, finding the right balance between protecting  federal investments through project management oversight and advancing  large transit capital projects through the project development process is  difficult. In addition, transit agencies currently work within the statutory  and regulatory constraints of the New Starts program, and streamlining  can only be done within these confines or through legislative changes.", "The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the U.S. House of  Representatives\u2019 Blueprint also proposes that the New Starts program be  restructured to speed project delivery, ensure all benefits of the proposed  projects are fully evaluated, and provide a level playing field for local  decision making. In addition, to reduce unnecessary delays in the delivery  of transit projects, it proposes that an office within FTA be created to  improve the process by eliminating duplication in documentation and  procedures and expediting the development of projects through the  environmental review process, design, and construction.", "Furthermore, the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue  Study Commission notes that overall project delivery times and costs of  major transportation projects could be reduced by shortening the time to  complete environmental reviews in conjunction with other measures that  address conventional strategies for implementing projects once they clear  environmental review. Due to the rapid increase in construction costs in  recent years, delays in completing projects have become very expensive,  according to the Commission. The Commission identified two sources of  delay that should be addressed in the short term: redundancies in the  National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) process and delays  associated with obtaining permit approvals. We have previously reported  on the time taken to conduct environmental reviews of highway projects  and found that stakeholders identified various aspects of the  environmental review process they believed added more time than was  necessary. For example, some stakeholders said that federal agencies  lacked sufficient staff to handle their workloads and that meeting certain  statutory criteria are too time consuming."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incorporating Performance Accountability Measures", "paragraphs": ["Another way to focus scarce resources while addressing the challenges of  future ridership demand could be to incorporate greater performance and  accountability into federal programs to best achieve intended outcomes.  Most federal surface transportation programs lack a link between funding  and the performance of a transit system or grantee. We have previously  reported that federal transit grant programs\u2014as well as highway and  safety grant programs\u2014distribute funds through formulas that are  typically not linked to performance and, in many cases, have only an  indirect relationship to need. Furthermore, these programs generally are  not linked to the federal objectives they are intended to address, in part  due to the wide discretion granted to states and localities in using most  federal funds. To address these findings, we recommended that Congress  consider re-examining and refocusing surface transportation programs so  that they have goals with direct links to an identified federal interest and  role, making grantees more accountable through more performance-based  links between funding and program outcomes, among other things. In  some cases, the federal government and state and local grantees may have  different goals, and national priorities may not be considered by grantees  even when federal funding is involved. In prior work, we also  recommended that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget  work with agencies and Congress to encourage the use of performance  accountability mechanisms in grant design and implementation and  promote knowledge transfer among agencies and grantees.", "As we have previously reported, performance measures should vary  according to program goals and there is no \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d solution\u2014 careful consideration should be taken when implementing these  mechanisms. Nevertheless, we and other experts have identified key  criteria for developing performance measures that could be implemented,  for example, in transportation programs, including:    Develop a minimum set of performance measures that can be linked to a  limited number of high-level national goals and consistently applied across  state and local agencies.", "Develop measures that demonstrate progress over time, rather than  measures tied to short-term targets.", "Develop measures that emphasize incentives, training, and support, rather  than penalties, as a preferred way to advance performance.", "However, some surface transportation programs are moving toward using  performance measures in distributing grants. For example, the National  Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) administers the Section  408 grant program that provides funding for states\u2019 traffic safety data  systems and improvements, which better allow states to measure  transportation performance. To measure performance, a state, as part of  its required strategic plan, must develop goals, or desired outcomes, by  which to determine program success.", "We have recently reported that while some federal transit programs  distribute funds based partly on performance, opportunities to improve  grant recipients\u2019 performance accountability remain. For example, in  November 2010 we reported that one of six formula-based FTA transit  grant programs we reviewed\u2014the Urbanized Areas Formula Grant\u2014 allocated funding, in part, based on performance\u2014accounting for less than  5 percent of the total funding distributed through the six programs.  Assuming, for example, that a federal goal was to reduce the backlog of  state of good repair needs nationwide and optimize the performance of  existing systems\u2014actions which would help transit agencies meet  increased passenger demand\u2014then tracking specific outcomes through  performance measures that are clearly linked to program goals could  provide a strong foundation for holding grant recipients responsible for  achieving federal goals. In addition, implementing links between transit  funding and performance through the use of financial performance  accountability mechanisms could help create incentives for transit  agencies to improve their performance, and provide the means for  measuring overall program performance. For example, the National  Transportation Policy Project, a project of the Bipartisan Policy Center,  has recommended that Congress create a Performance Bonus Program  that would provide additional funds to states and metropolitan regions  based on demonstrated progress toward meeting national performance  goals. This program would assess how well states and metropolitan  regions reduce their backlog of system preservation needs and optimize  the performance of existing transit systems based on proposed  performance measures. Recipients could then use Performance Bonus  Program funds for any transportation purpose with few restrictions. As a  corrective measure, poorly performing states and regions would be  subject to greater federal scrutiny and review in the planning process for  their formula funds.
