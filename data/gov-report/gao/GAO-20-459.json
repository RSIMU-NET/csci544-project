In its 2017 report, the National  Transportation Safety Board also cited ongoing concerns regarding the  Coast Guard\u2019s reliance on third-party organizations to carry out some of  its vessel safety responsibilities. As a result of the EL FARO incident,  some in Congress have raised questions about the effectiveness of SMS  plans and the Coast Guard\u2019s oversight of third parties responsible for ensuring that SMS plans for applicable U.S.-flagged vessels are in  compliance with relevant international standards and federal regulations.", "The International Safety Management (ISM) Code was established in the  1990s to provide an international standard for the safe management and  operation of ships and for pollution prevention.

In  practice, the Coast Guard delegates principal SMS compliance activities  to third-party entities, called Recognized Organizations (ROs), as  authorized by federal law. Among their responsibilities, ROs are to  coordinate with vessel operators to review SMS plans, issue applicable  vessel certificates, and conduct SMS compliance audits at the company  level and aboard each vessel.

(2) To what extent do domestic commercial vessels\u2019 SMS plans identify  the potential for specific shipboard emergencies and include applicable  response procedures?", "To determine how the Coast Guard verifies that domestic commercial  vessels\u2019 SMS plans comply with federal regulations and conducts related  oversight of ROs, we reviewed and analyzed relevant Coast Guard  regulations, policies, and guidance to identify the key processes and  standards to be used for (1) evaluating SMS compliance during vessel  inspections, (2) documenting any deficiencies and taking applicable  enforcement actions, and (3) conducting oversight of ROs responsible for  SMS certifications and associated audits. We also reviewed relevant  criteria, such as the International Safety Management Code, as well as  related guidelines issued by the International Maritime Organization and  the International Association of Classification Societies. We also  obtained information from the Coast Guard\u2019s Marine Information and  Safety Law Enforcement database to identify the total number of SMS  deficiencies cited for U.S.-flagged vessels since April 2018 (when the  Coast Guard reported it began to collect such data). In addition, we  observed the Coast Guard performing two annual vessel inspections and  conducting oversight of an RO during an annual company SMS audit.  These observations cannot be generalized across all vessel inspections,  but they provided us with first-hand information on the procedures used  and the standards applied by the ROs. Further, we interviewed relevant  Coast Guard officials and representatives of two ROs\u2014the American  Bureau of Shipping and DNV-GL\u2014that, collectively, account for over 99  percent of the SMS certificates issued to U.S.-flagged vessels on the  Coast Guard\u2019s behalf.", "To determine the extent to which SMS plans for domestic commercial  vessels identify the potential for specific shipboard emergencies and  include applicable response procedures, we obtained and reviewed a  nongeneralizable sample of 12 SMS plans representing five different  vessel types (general cargo/container, chemical/oil carrier, offshore  supply/support, towing/tugboats, and passenger ferries). To develop the  SMS plans sample, we obtained data from the Coast Guard identifying all  U.S.-flagged commercial vessels with a valid Safety Management  Certificate and grouped these into the five unique vessel types identified  above. We then used a random number generator to assign a value to all  vessels in each category and then sorted these lists from the highest to  the lowest number. We used this sorted list to select the top four to five  vessels from each category, for a total of 25 vessels. We determined that  the American Bureau of Shipping performs ISM certification services for  each of these 25 vessels, so we also selected three additional vessels  serviced by DNV-GL using the same random selection process to provide  us with information on a second RO.", "Given that the Coast Guard reported it does not maintain SMS plan  documents and that the plans may contain sensitive, proprietary  information, we worked through the American Bureau of Shipping and  DNV-GL to obtain copies of the SMS plans from the vessel operators on  our behalf. We received 11 SMS plans (or applicable excerpts) from the  American Bureau of Shipping representing 18 of the 25 vessels  selected. We also received one additional SMS plan from DNV-GL for a  total of 12 in our review sample. We reviewed each of these plans to  evaluate the extent to which they address the 21 specific shipboard  emergency scenarios contained in guidance issued by the Coast Guard in  April 2018. Results from our nongeneralizable sample cannot be used  to make inferences about the population of all SMS plans. However, we  believe that information from these SMS plans, combined with interviews conducted with Coast Guard and RO officials, provide useful insights into  the general composition of SMS plans and the extent that potential  emergency scenarios may be addressed within these plans across a  range of different vessel types.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2019 to April 2020 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

While the 12  SMS plans do not address all potential emergencies included in Coast  Guard guidance, the plans do address the broad, functional requirement  to identify potential shipboard emergencies and applicable response  procedures to address them, as required by the ISM Code and applicable  federal regulations. In reviewing the 12 SMS plans, we also found  variation among the specific scope and formats of the emergency  preparedness sections. Four of the 12 SMS plans are large documents  spanning hundreds of pages that incorporate various component  manuals. For example, one vessel operator provided a comprehensive  SMS plan document of nearly 600 pages that includes six different  procedural manuals covering the following issues: Management, Vessel,  Safety, Environmental, Cargo Operations, and Emergency Response. For  the other eight SMS plans we reviewed, the vessel operators provided us  with either a stand-alone manual specifically addressing shipboard  emergency preparedness and response procedures, or individual  chapters and excerpts that included this information. According to Coast  Guard and RO officials, the ISM Code does not require a specific format  or level of detail for SMS plans and, rather, allows vessel operators  flexibility to choose how they will implement and document SMS  requirements based on their specific operations and business processes.", "In addition to reviewing the SMS plans for content and format, we also  reviewed each of the 12 SMS plans (or excerpts) to determine the extent  to which they address 21 different potential shipboard emergencies  identified in 2018 Coast Guard guidance related to the application and  implementation of the ISM Code (see table 1). The number of unique,  potential shipboard emergency scenarios addressed in the SMS plan  documents we reviewed generally range from five to 16. Ship routing  procedures related to heavy weather, which is an emergency scenario  highlighted in the EL FARO investigative report, is clearly identified in five  of the 12 SMS plans reviewed. However, one additional SMS plan makes  reference to a separate heavy weather plan that was not included in the  primary SMS plan documents that we reviewed. The most frequently  addressed shipboard emergency scenarios\u2014that are addressed in at  least 10 of the 12 SMS plans we reviewed\u2014are Fire, Collision,  Grounding, Abandon Ship, and Man Overboard. In addition, 10 of the 12  SMS plans we reviewed also identify additional potential emergency  shipboard scenarios not included in the 2018 Coast Guard guidance,  such as breakaway from dock, emergency towing, or confined space  rescue.", "While none of the SMS plans that we reviewed specifically address all 21  potential shipboard emergencies identified in the 2018 Coast Guard  guidance, the guidance states that it is not a substitute for applicable legal  requirements, nor is it itself a rule. According to officials from the two ROs  with whom we discussed this program, their auditors are provided the  2018 Coast Guard guidance to use as part of their SMS audit criteria.  The officials noted, however, that their auditors may be limited to issuing  an \u201cobservation\u201d to the vessel operator if any potential shipboard  emergency listed in Coast Guard guidance is not addressed in SMS plan  documents. Under the ISM Code, an \u201cobservation\u201d is not the same as  an SMS \u201cnonconformity,\u201d which would require specific corrective action.  Officials from one RO noted that any nonconformities identified would  need to be based on specified mandatory requirements, such as ISM  Code provisions, U.S. statutes, or applicable U.S. or international  regulations, and not solely on the 2018 Coast Guard guidance.", "In addition to the fact that the emergencies listed in the guidance are not  required to be included in SMS plans, there are other factors to explain  why the SMS plans we reviewed may not address all 21 potential  shipboard emergency scenarios identified in the 2018 Coast Guard  guidance. Such factors include the following:  Size and nature of vessel operations. According to RO and Coast  Guard officials, not all of the 21 potential shipboard emergency scenarios  contained in the 2018 Coast Guard guidance are applicable for each type  of vessel or for all geographical operating areas. For example, specific  emergency procedures related to piracy or terrorism, cargo-related  accidents, helicopter rescue operations, or loss of key personnel may not  be necessary for towing vessels, given the nature of their operations, their  limited size, and the reduced number of crew required to operate that  type of vessel. Similarly, icing conditions would not be expected to be  included in the SMS plans for those vessels that operate solely in  temperate waters.", "Additional time may be needed to incorporate expanded potential  shipboard emergency scenarios into existing SMS plans. Although  the Coast Guard guidance identifying the 21 potential shipboard  emergency scenarios was issued in April 2018, vessel operators may still  be in the process of revising their SMS plans to include additional  potential shipboard emergency scenarios and applicable emergency  response procedures. For example, we observed that six of the 21  scenarios included in the 2018 Coast Guard guidance are not listed in  related guidance provided by the International Association of  Classification Societies. These six scenarios are among those observed  with the lowest frequency during our review of SMS plans. It is feasible  that information related to these scenarios\u2014such as loss of key  personnel, or loss of communications with a vessel\u2014may exist elsewhere  in vessel operators\u2019 SMS documents or in other vessel plans, but not  incorporated as potential shipboard emergency response scenarios as  proposed in the 2018 Coast Guard guidance. Along these lines, officials  from the ROs with whom we spoke also noted that, in accordance with  the ISM Code, they routinely use a sampling approach when conducting  annual company SMS audits, and would generally not review the entire  scope of an SMS plan each year. As a result of the sampling process,  the annual audits occurring since April 2018 may not have addressed any  potential \u201cobservations\u201d related to the expanded scope of potential  shipboard emergencies included in the Coast Guard guidance for SMS  plans.", "As noted previously, the ISM Code and corresponding U.S. regulations  and Coast Guard guidance allow vessel operators flexibility in how they  address SMS functional requirements, including the documentation of  potential shipboard emergencies and applicable response procedures in  their SMS plans. Following the EL FARO incident, in 2018 the Coast  Guard developed guidance to help inform vessel operators and ROs of  potential shipboard emergency scenarios to consider. However, similar to  the SMS-compliance and oversight practices used by comparable  agencies in other developed countries, we found that the Coast Guard  does not have a direct role in reviewing or approving vessel SMS plan  documents, including response procedures for potential shipboard  emergency scenarios. Rather, as described earlier, the Coast Guard  relies on periodic vessel inspections and oversight of ROs that perform  more rigorous ISM audits on the Coast Guard\u2019s behalf. Although the  Coast Guard has taken positive steps since 2018 to develop additional  guidance and increase the number of observations of RO audits and inspections, the extent to which these efforts will result in any specific  changes to the content of SMS plans by vessel operators in the future is  yet to be determined."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from DHS and the Coast  Guard.

In order  for a classification society to be recognized by the Coast Guard and  receive statutory authority to carry out delegated functions as a  Recognized Organization (RO), the classification society must meet  certain requirements, including having functioned as an international  classification society for at least 30 years and having established a history  of appropriate corrective actions in addressing vessel casualties and  deficiencies, among other things. With respect to safety management  systems (SMS), ROs\u2014once authorized by the Coast Guard\u2014are able to  perform SMS-related audits and issue SMS-related certifications and  documentation.", "The following information summarizes the key roles and responsibilities of  ROs related to International Safety Management (ISM) Code certification  services and the key activities that ROs perform to fulfill their delegated  SMS compliance functions on behalf of the Coast Guard.", "Interim verification. When a new company (i.e., vessel owner/operator)  is established, or an existing company wants to add a new vessel type to  its current Document of Compliance, the RO is to first verify that the  company has an SMS that complies with ISM Code requirements. If the  RO determines that the company is in compliance, it issues the company  an interim Document of Compliance (which applies to the entire  company) that is valid for up to 12 months.", "Initial verification. After receiving an interim Document of Compliance, a  company applies for ISM Code certification, and an RO conducts an SMS  audit of the company\u2019s shoreside management system that is to include a  visit to the company\u2019s physical offices. Following the satisfactory  completion of the audit and verification that the company\u2019s SMS has been  in operation for at least 3 months, the RO would issue the company a  Document of Compliance that is valid for 5 years.", "After the RO issues the Document of Compliance, the RO is to verify that  the company\u2019s SMS has been functioning effectively for at least 3 months  for each of the vessels for which the company is seeking a Safety  Management Certificate. A Safety Management Certificate is vessel- specific and may only be issued to a vessel if the company holds a valid  Document of Compliance. To perform the initial verification, the RO is to  assess each vessel to determine if the company\u2019s SMS is being  employed effectively on that vessel.", "Annual or intermediate verification. The RO is responsible for verifying  a company\u2019s Document of Compliance every year and for verifying the  company\u2019s Safety Management Certificates at least once during the 5- year period covered by the issued certificates. ROs generally verify  Safety Management Certificates between 2 and 3 years after their  issuance. Annual and intermediate verifications are opportunities for the  RO to verify whether the company has taken appropriate actions to  sufficiently address any deficiencies the RO may have identified during  previous audits.", "Renewal verification. Up to 3 months before a company\u2019s Document of  Compliance or a vessel\u2019s Safety Management Certificate expires, the RO  is to conduct a renewal verification. The renewal verification is to address  all elements of the SMS, including activities required under the ISM code.", "Additional Verification. The Coast Guard may also require additional  verification to ensure that an SMS is functioning effectively\u2014for example,  to make sure that the company has sufficiently implemented appropriate  corrective actions to address any identified deficiencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Coast Guard\u2019s Process for Evaluating Safety Management System Deficiencies and Corrective Action Options", "paragraphs": ["This appendix provides summary information on the Coast Guard\u2019s  process for evaluating safety management system (SMS) deficiencies  and corrective action options if a Coast Guard marine inspector identifies  any SMS-related deficiencies during a vessel inspection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Key Performance Indicators for Assessing Recognized Organizations", "paragraphs": ["In mid-2018, Coast Guard officials identified 10 key performance  indicators to be used to evaluate the performance of Recognized  Organizations (RO).
