The agency has begun to take steps to respond to three of the report's six recommendations: improve interagency collaboration, create an advisory subcommittee for Native American veterans, and conduct a needs assessment. To increase collaboration, DOL has conducted several listening sessions with tribal leadership and begun collaborating with agencies that serve veterans, including the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs, to learn more about how to better serve Native American veterans. With regard to an advisory subcommittee, DOL is developing a proposal to establish a subgroup for Native American veterans on its existing veterans' employment and training advisory committee, and is considering appointing a representative from the Native American veterans' community to serve on that committee. To assess need, DOL has identified a potential source for data within DOD that provides race and ethnicity and address information for returning veterans that could help better target visits to tribal land, but its plans to acquire these data are still being negotiated and could take time to finalize. However, DOL has taken little to no action on recommendations to increase outreach, pursue program flexibility, and boost economic development. DOL officials told us that leadership transitions and budget challenges have contributed to their limited response to date. In addition, since delivering the report in 2010, DOL has not developed a strategy that specifically establishes roles and responsibilities, goals, costs, and time frames for implementation of the report's recommendations.", "DOL could build on its efforts to implement the report's recommendations, even in a constrained budget environment. For example, DOL could expand the collaboration it has begun with other agencies that serve Native American veterans on tribal land, such as the Department of Education (Education). GAO site visits indicated that some Native American veterans received employment services from a vocational rehabilitation program administered by Education. DOL can consider partnering with this program. DOL could also identify and disseminate lessons learned from states that have collaborated with other agencies and tribal governments. For example, a DOL program in Montana has leveraged other agency resources, such as collaborating with the VA Vet Center to provide both health and employment services to Native American veterans in remote tribal areas using mobile units, an approach that may be applicable in other states. To boost economic development, DOL could review information from its existing grants and guidance on economic development to disseminate to DOL grantees that serve Native American veterans."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOL develop a written strategy to implement the 2010 recommendations that incorporates roles and responsibilities, goals, costs, and time frames.

An official from SBA agreed that additional collaboration  would improve self-employment training opportunities for Native American  veterans. In addition, DOL can leverage state level collaborations with  other agencies and tribal governments. For example, during our site visits  we learned that some DVOPs and LVERs have leveraged other federal  and state agencies\u2019 resources to help serve Native American veterans.  For instance, in one state, a DVOP that serves Native American veterans  in remote communities joined VA\u2019s mobile units to provide both health  and employment services to Native American veterans to reduce travel  time and reach additional veterans.

Options may exist for DOL to develop or obtain  better data to assess the needs of Native American veterans returning to  tribal land. Currently, no mechanism that we could identify exists to share  data with tribes on the number and timing of Native American veterans  returning to tribal communities. In the absence of timely data on the  population of Native American veterans who need employment and  training services, state agencies and JVSG staff must try to gauge and  meet needs in other ways. DOL could develop or obtain better data on  Native American veterans returning to tribal land by coordinating with  DOD and VA or other agencies that maintain contact information on  recently separated veterans. Specifically, according to a DOD official,  DOD data on separating servicemembers are shared with VA, which  modifies the data for its own purposes and then shares the data with state  veterans\u2019 agencies. According to this official, the data include fields for  ethnicity, including Native American ethnicities. As a result, the data that  state veterans agencies receive from VA may be helpful to DOL in  identifying recently separated Native American veterans.", "Outreach. DOL can leverage the outreach activities conducted by state  and local entities. For example, JVSG staff in several states have  conducted training sessions in tribal communities focused on veterans\u2019  transition to civilian life, while other JVSG staff have built on a VA  initiative that trains volunteers in tribal communities to educate veterans  about employment and training services available to them. In addition,  some tribal officials and Native American veterans told us that some  veterans prefer in-person outreach. To this end, veterans outreach staff in  some states have been leveraging libraries and tribal colleges to conduct  outreach to tribal veterans.", "Program flexibility. Although few tribal officials and Native American  veterans we spoke with identified opportunities for additional program  flexibility in the JVSG program, DOL could consider ways to use existing  program flexibility to better serve veterans and enhance service delivery.  Specifically, DOL is considering plans to ask states to explicitly describe  their efforts to serve Native American veterans in their required JVSG 5- year grant operating plans, which could help ensure that states consider  the needs of Native American veterans when preparing their plans.  However, to date, DOL has not established a time frame for completion.

In the past, DOL, through its  Employment and Training Administration (ETA), has awarded grants that  have aligned employment and training grants with economic development  needs. Recent grantees have included tribal entities. For example, ETA  awarded a grant to a tribal college to train workers, foster business  development and promote entrepreneurship on tribal land. DOL has an  opportunity to review such grants to disseminate lessons learned on the  extent to which Native American veterans participated in and benefited  from grant-funded activities, as well as opportunities to incorporate  economic development principles into existing grants. For example,  DINAP recently visited an Arizona tribe to identify lessons learned on its  progress in implementing a grant that aims to increase job opportunities  for veterans and others in occupations that reflect employers\u2019 need for  skills, according to ETA officials.

Regarding our first  recommendation, DOL noted that it is working to develop a written  strategy to implement the 2010 recommendations. However, DOL noted  that it must first develop a better understanding of the extent of  unemployment and training gaps on reservations nationwide, among  other pieces of information, to establish a more comprehensive plan of  action, and cited the need for an update to the Bureau of Indian Affairs  (BIA) report American Indian Population and Labor Force Report\u2014last  published in 2005\u2014as key to developing its plan. To the extent that there  are obstacles to implementing the 2010 recommendations, such as  incomplete data, it is important that DOL proceed with developing a  written strategy that explicitly identifies such obstacles and proposes  ways to mitigate them.

At the federal level, DOL has reached out to initiate  collaboration with VA and BIA, but it currently has no plans to initiate  collaboration with other agencies that offer employment and training and  other support services to Native American veterans, such as Education,  HHS, SBA, or DOD.  For example, our site visits indicated that some  Native Americans veterans received employment services from  Education\u2019s Vocational Rehabilitation Services for American Indians with  Disabilities program.

However, to date, DOL has not made efforts to identify promising  practices to improve service delivery and disseminate them to other state  grantees. For example, during our site visits we learned that some DVOPs  and LVERs had made their own efforts to leverage agency resources and  partner with leaders in tribal communities:  In North Carolina, a LVER established relationships with the Eastern  Band of Cherokee Indians\u2019 veterans\u2019 service organization to begin to  bring services to veterans in the community.", "In Montana, a DVOP established a partnership with the mobile VA Vet  Center to provide both health and employment services to Native  American veterans in remote areas (see fig.).", "Possible Expansion of DOL Efforts (cont.)", "Improve Agency  Collaboration (cont.)", "JVSG staff in Montana visit the Crow Agency using a VA Vet Center mobile  unit, May 7, 2013.", "During our site visits, we also brought together tribal workforce and  veterans\u2019 agencies, and these meetings often served to initiate  discussions for future collaboration between them in specific areas, such  as the use of incentives for employers to hire veterans and assistance in  preparing resumes that explain veterans\u2019 military backgrounds and skills.  However, DOL has issued no guidance or technical assistance to its  Native American WIA Section 166 grantees to encourage collaboration  within tribal governments or to help them develop their own outreach  plans. DOL officials told us they expect to provide additional guidance in  this area beginning in 2014.", "Alaska, New Mexico, and North Dakota offer cultural competency training  to staff serving veterans, which some JVSG staff said was beneficial in  their efforts to serve Native American veterans. In addition, some Native  American veterans emphasized the importance to them of culturally- sensitive services.", "DOL Recommendation Status  The 2010 report recommended that DOL create an advisory committee  subgroup on Native American veterans\u2019 employment issues.DOL officials  told us that although VETS may offer proposals to the committee, the  ACVETEO members decide\u2014because the ACVETEO operates  independently\u2014whether to establish a new subgroup.", "According to agency officials, DOL is currently in the process of  developing such a proposal to present to the ACVETEO to establish an  advisory committee subgroup on Native American veterans. In addition,  DOL is considering appointing a representative from the Native American  veterans\u2019 community to participate on the DOL ACVETEO. However, DOL  has not specifically identified who they might appoint for this position.  Currently, the ACVETEO has members from VA, DOL, DOD, and SBA,  but does not have members from other agencies that provide employment  services to Native American veterans, like BIA and HHS.", "Possible Expansion of DOL Efforts  Our past work has stated that federal agencies have used a variety of  mechanisms to implement interagency collaborative efforts, including  establishing interagency work groups. In addition to including Native  American veterans on the ACVETEO, DOL has the opportunity to appoint  qualified individuals from other agencies that serve Native American  veterans, such as BIA, HHS, and Education.

Our past work suggests  that to establish effective work groups or other mechanisms for  collaboration, agencies should: define and articulate a common outcome; establish mutually reinforcing or joint strategies;  identify and address needs by leveraging resources; agree on roles and responsibilities; establish compatible policies, procedures, and other means to operate develop mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and report on results;  reinforce agency accountability for collaborative efforts through agency  plans and reports; and  reinforce individual accountability for collaborative efforts through  performance management systems.", "Recommendation Summary  The 2010 report recommended  conducting a needs assessment by  reviewing existing federal and state  programs and services available to  Native American veterans, in order  to identify unmet needs and  eliminate inefficiencies with the aim  of improving service delivery.", "DOL Recommendation Status  DOL has no plans to conduct a formal needs assessment of the  employment and training needs of Native American veterans. The cost  and complexity of such a project would likely be prohibitive, according to a  DOL official. However, regarding the recommendation to estimate the  number of Native American veterans on tribal land, a DOL official told us  that the agency is in the early stages of identifying potential data sources.  Specifically, DOL has identified a potential source for data within DOD that  provides race and ethnicity as well as address information for returning  veterans that could help DVOPs and LVERs target their visits to tribal  land, but its plans to acquire these data are still being negotiated and  could take time to finalize. In the interim, DOL has identified data from VA  that, while not comprehensive, might in the short term, provide an  estimate of the number of Native American veterans on tribal land.   Regarding outcome data, DOL does not collect data on veterans served  by the JVSG program by race or ethnicity. However, according to a VETS  official, DOL is planning a comprehensive review of its approach to  tracking veterans\u2019 data. Although DOL does collect data on Native  American veterans served by its WIA programs, it does not track those  served on tribal land. transition to civilian life by  providing them with a job  placement and training plan  and with a list of available  resources.", "With regard to the recommendation on job placement and training plans,  currently, all servicemembers develop such Individual Transition Plans  through mandatory participation in the Transition Assistance Program  (TAP), which is currently being revised. However, although DOL provides  information through TAP that could help veterans returning to their  communities, such as how to access DVOPs and LVERs at American Job  Centers, as of July 2013, due to changes in agency priorities, DOL had no  plans to include contact information for WIA Section166 grantees, which  could help Native American veterans returning to tribal land. According to  a DOL official, providing this level of information during TAP sessions,  which are applicable to all veterans, would be impractical. Additionally, as  of July 2013, a DOL official acknowledged that there are no specific  changes to TAP that focus on Native American veterans. However, DOL  told us that there will be overarching changes to the TAP program that will  aid all transitioning servicemembers.", "Regarding service delivery, DOL requested and received information in  November 2012 about DVOPs\u2019 and LVERs\u2019 services to Native American  veterans, but to date, has not fully reviewed this information to identify  promising practices that could improve services for these veterans.", "Assess Needs (cont.)", "Possible Expansion of DOL Efforts (cont.)  employment and training services. Furthermore, both tribal administrators  and officials at the state level identified various data sources that they  used to estimate the number of veterans living on tribal land, including  2002 Census data, and tribal veterans and health agencies\u2019 data. Such  data, however, may not reflect the need for employment and training  services. For example, tribal health agency data are likely to reflect Native  American veterans\u2019 needs for medical care, not necessarily for  employment and training services, and not necessarily the needs of  recently separated veterans.", "In the absence of timely data on the population of Native American  veterans who need employment and training services, state agencies and  JVSG staff must try to gauge and meet needs in other ways. For example,  in North Dakota, the state workforce agency provides pamphlets on JVSG  services to the state veterans\u2019 agency for inclusion in welcome packets for  returning veterans. In another state, a LVER who has recently begun  working with one tribe told us that he plans to gauge demand for his  services based on attendance when he visits the tribe.", "DOL has an opportunity to develop or obtain better data on Native  American veterans returning to tribal land by working with other federal  agencies. Specifically, according to a DOD official, DOD data on  separating servicemembers are shared with VA, which modifies the data  for its own purposes and then shares the data with state veterans\u2019  agencies. According to this official, the data include fields for ethnicity,  including Native American ethnicities. As a result, the data that state  veterans agencies receive from VA may be helpful in identifying recently  separated Native American veterans. However, until DOL reaches a data- sharing agreement with either DOD or the VA, better data will not be  available to state workforce agencies or the DVOPs and LVERs they  employ. Recognizing the potential benefits, the DVET for Montana said he  is seeking access to these data from the state\u2019s veterans\u2019 agency, through  a proposed Memorandum of Understanding.", "DOL also has an opportunity to identify and disseminate lessons learned  about states\u2019 efforts to provide short transition briefings tailored to the  needs of Native American veterans. DVOPs and LVERs have identified  opportunities to deliver such customized transition briefings for Native  American veterans in at least two states. In New Mexico and North  Dakota, DVOPs and LVERs have provided abbreviated transition briefings  to tribal communities. In our site visits, when we asked about the potential  value of such customized transition briefings, some Native American  veterans expressed interest in such an approach. Additionally, in one  state, DVOPs and LVERs try to reach Native American veterans through  welcoming ceremonies, according to that state\u2019s DVET.", "DOL Recommendation Status  The 2010 report recommended that DOL launch a communications  program focused on outreach to Native American veterans on tribal land  by establishing a public information campaign to share information about  VETS programs through the use of the web, direct mail, newspapers, and  social media. However, DOL officials told us that they have not initiated  such a campaign due to budget constraints, but are currently exploring low  cost options for conducting outreach.", "Although DOL officials report participating in tribal conferences and tribal  events at the state level, many of the tribal veterans and workforce  program officials and veterans we spoke with were unaware or had limited  awareness of services offered by the JVSG program.", "Possible Expansion of DOL Efforts  There may be additional opportunities for DOL to expand its proposed  approach to outreach without the use of a large scale public information  campaign. DOL has an opportunity to take a more comprehensive  strategy and expand outreach efforts that leverage existing state and local  level efforts. Expanded efforts could help to raise awareness of VETS  programs for Native American veterans on tribal land while minimizing  additional costs.", "DOL may have an opportunity to learn from the activities of DVOPs and  LVERs in certain states who have conducted targeted outreach. For  example, in one state, a LVER shared information about services  available to veterans through an article in a local newspaper. Several  states we visited make employment and other resources available to  veterans and employers accessible through a website. For example,  according to state officials, New Mexico provides access for jobseekers,  including those living in remote areas, by creating a virtual one-stop that  offers certain services online. facilitate the sharing of  information and data on  available resources among  tribal leadership and other  government entities engaged  in workforce development  programs on tribal lands  throughout the country.", "Some tribal officials and Native Americans veterans told us that some  veterans prefer in-person outreach. To this end, veterans outreach staff in  some states have been leveraging libraries and tribal colleges to conduct  outreach to tribal veterans. Conversely, other Native American veterans  we spoke with suggested that in order to reach younger veterans, DOL  should consider employing social media to raise awareness of  employment and training services among veterans on tribal land.", "DOL has an opportunity to encourage states to leverage VA\u2019s Tribal  Veterans Representatives (TVRs), who are volunteers based on tribal land  trained by VA to provide veterans with information about available  benefits, to enhance the outreach efforts of DVOPs and LVERs. For  example, Alaska state officials said that DVOPs and LVERs coordinated  with TVRs to schedule outreach visits. As a result, officials reported  improved participation in outreach events and better relations with Alaska  Native communities.  A similar volunteer-based initiative exists in Hawaii.", "DOL Recommendation Status  DOL has not pursued the report\u2019s proposal to explore the possibility of  DVOPs and LVERs living and working on tribal land, citing the flexibility of  the JVSG program that states already have under current law.  Specifically, states now employ DVOPs and LVERs as they deem  appropriate and efficient, subject to DOL\u2019s approval. Further, DOL  guidance emphasizes that states have flexibility to assign and place  DVOPs and LVERs to best address each state\u2019s unique needs.", "The 2010 report suggested that DVOPs and LVERs live and work on tribal  land and included the proposal that they focus their work on the tribal  level, rather than the state level. However, JVSG grant amounts appear  unlikely to support a full-time focus on tribal land, even for the largest  tribes, and such an approach appears impractical for smaller communities.  For example, in Alaska, JVSG funds support 4.5 DVOP and LVER staff,  who are collectively responsible for outreach to 225 Alaska Native  communities (an average of 50 each). In Alaska, each DVOP and LVER is  assigned a region of the state, and they told us that they try to visit their  assigned region at least twice a year. As in all other states, they also must  balance these efforts with their efforts to serve other veterans because  under current law, the JVSG grants flow to states to support activities on  behalf of all eligible veterans in each state. A DOL official described the  challenge as making optimum use of limited resources.", "Nevertheless, with regard to flexibility in general, a DOL official  emphasized the importance of recognizing the substantial diversity among  Native American communities. With regard to additional flexibilities that  could help meet the needs of Native American veterans living on tribal  lands, DOL has indicated that it is open to identifying any such  opportunities that exist under current law, although to date it has taken  little action in this area. explore the possibility of  assigning DVOPs and LVERs  to live and work on tribal  land; and  identify available flexibilities  to meet the needs of Native  American veterans living on  tribal lands, including any  additional flexibilities identified  through consultation with  Native American organizations  and tribal councils.", "Possible Expansion of DOL Efforts  During our site visits, regarding JVSG program flexibility, few state-level  officials and tribal leaders identified opportunities for additional flexibility as  a primary concern, except for officials and veterans from several tribes,  who suggested that JVSG grant funds go to tribes as well as states, which  is not possible under current law. Additionally, for example, two tribes  favored establishing funding that would be specifically reserved for  veterans within DOL\u2019s WIA Section 166 program, one advocated for  broadened eligibility to allow more veterans to participate in that program,  and two suggested streamlining application procedures for DOL\u2019s  programs to raise participation. Some of these proposed changes might  require statutory changes. However, a few state-level officials, tribal  leaders and administrators, and Native American veterans also expressed  the view that a one-size-fits-all approach would be generally ill-advised,  given state and tribal differences.", "Allow Flexibility (cont.)", "Possible Expansion of DOL Efforts (cont.)  Nevertheless, DOL has an opportunity to consider ways to use existing  program flexibility to better serve veterans and encourage better outreach  and service delivery. Specifically, DOL is considering plans to ask states  to explicitly describe their efforts to serve Native American veterans in  their JVSG 5-year grant operating plans, which could help ensure that  states consider the needs of Native American veterans when preparing  their plans. However, to date, DOL has not established a time frame for  completion.", "Report Summary  The 2010 report identified the need  for economic development on tribal  land as a major problem, and noted  that, in the absence of job  opportunities, providing  employment and training services  alone may simply frustrate  jobseekers.", "DOL Status  DOL officials told us they had taken no action on this issue and  emphasized that, with regard to economic development, DOL\u2019s focus is on  the role that skills can play.", "While noting that economic  development programs are outside  VETS\u2019s authority, the report noted  that economic development should  be a major focus across federal  programs addressing employment  concerns for Native American  veterans.", "Possible Expansion of DOL Efforts  DOL has an opportunity to better understand and support economic  development on tribal land by reviewing its existing grants and guidance  on this topic and identifying lessons learned to disseminate to JSVG state  and WIA Section 166 grantees. DOL, through ETA, has taken steps to  boost economic development generally by aligning some of its  discretionary grants with local demand for skills, and by issuing guidance  on economic development and entrepreneurship.", "In the past, DOL has awarded grants that have aligned employment and  training with economic development. ETA has awarded some of its recent  grants to Native American entities, and some grants included veterans  (see appendix III). DOL has an opportunity to review such grants for  lessons learned on how to incorporate economic development principles  into existing grants for tribal veterans. For example:  the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona was awarded a grant to  develop career pathways, a sequenced training approach that  supports career progression, including a career pathway for veterans;  and  success stories, share best  practices, and provide  benchmark information to other  tribes; and", "United Tribes Technical College in North Dakota was awarded a grant  to train workers, foster business development, and promote  entrepreneurship in 19 tribes across 3 states, under a collaborative  program that also involved the Small Business Administration (SBA)  and the Department of Commerce. sponsor and fund training  and education for business  start-ups and entrepreneurs on  tribal land.", "Additionally, in 2007, ETA issued guidance to highlight allowable and  prohibited activities under WIA related to economic development, and in  2010, it issued guidance on the use of WIA funds to support  entrepreneurship training.
