In 2015,  1.85 million such households experienced  worst-case housing needs, including  unaffordable rents. The report noted that low- income older households that rely on fixed  incomes rather than wages may be less likely  to benefit from economic recovery trends that  raised incomes for others in recent years.", "In recent years, HUD and USDA have lost subsidized housing stock.  Losses can happen under several scenarios, including when federal  rental assistance contracts expire, federally subsidized mortgages reach  maturity or are paid off and owners convert the units to market-rate  rentals, or units fall into disrepair. In its fiscal year 2014\u20132018 strategic  plan, HUD reported that its public housing stock faced a capital needs  backlog, estimated at $26 billion, which would be difficult to meet given  federal fiscal constraints.
