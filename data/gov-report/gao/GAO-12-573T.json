Further, this case study provides an example of the types of problems  that may exist but go undetected because of the lack of independent  assessments of the reported information. As we previously testified  before this Subcommittee,auditors provide a valuable independent validation of agencies\u2019 efforts to  report reliable information under IPIA. Independent assessments can also  enhance an agency\u2019s ability to identify sound performance measures,  monitor progress against those measures, and help establish  performance and results expectations. Without this type of validation or  other types of reviews performed by GAO or agency OIGs, it is difficult to  reliably determine the full magnitude of deficiencies that may exist  governmentwide in agencies\u2019 IPIA implementation efforts. For example,  our case study of the Foster Care program found that although ACF had  established a process to calculate a national improper payment estimate,  the estimate was not based on a statistically valid methodology and  consequently did not reflect a reasonably accurate estimate of the extent  of Foster Care improper payments. Further, without accurate data, the   separate assessments conducted by agency  validity of the Foster Care program\u2019s reported reductions in improper  payments was questionable, and ACF\u2019s ability to reliably assess the  effectiveness of its corrective actions was impaired.", "For programs administered at the state level such as Foster Care, OMB  guidance provides that statistically valid annual estimates of improper  payments may be based on either data for all states or on statistical data  from a sample to generate a national dollar estimate and improper  payment rate. In this case, ACF took its existing Title IV-E Foster Care  program eligibility review process, already in place under the Social  Security Act, and also used it for IPIA estimation. ACF provides a national  estimated error rate based on a rolling average of error rates identified in  states examined on a 3-year cycle. As a result, ACF\u2019s IPIA reporting for  each year is based on new data for about one-third of the states and  previous years\u2019 data for the remaining two-thirds of the states. To  calculate a national estimate of improper payments, ACF uses error rates  that span a 3-year period of Title IV-E eligibility reviews in the 50 states,  the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. ACF applies the percentage  dollar error rate from the sample to the total payments for the period  under review for each state.", "ACF\u2019s methodology for estimating Foster Care improper payments was  approved by OMB in 2004 with the understanding that continuing efforts  would be taken to improve the accuracy of ACF\u2019s estimates of improper  payments in the ensuing years. ACF, however, has since continued to  generally follow its initial 2004 methodology. When compared to federal  statistical guidance and internal control standards, we found it to be  deficient in all three phases of its fiscal year 2010 estimation  methodology\u2014planning, selection, and evaluation\u2014as summarized in  table 3. These deficiencies impaired the accuracy and completeness of  the Foster Care program improper payment estimate of $73 million  reported for fiscal year 2010.", "Planning. ACF\u2019s annual IPIA reporting for the Foster Care program did  not include about two-thirds of program expenditures, as shown in figure  1. Specifically, the estimate included improper payments for only one type  of program payment activity\u2014maintenance payments\u2014which, for fiscal  year 2010, represented 34 percent of the total federal share of  expenditures for the Foster Care program. Administrative and other  payments, such as those related to the operation and development of the  Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System (SACWIS), were  not considered in ACF\u2019s IPIA estimation process and thus were not  included in the Foster Care program improper payment estimate. OMB\u2019s  December 2004 approval of ACF\u2019s proposed methodology included an  expectation that ACF would develop a plan and timetable to test  administrative expenses by April 2005. ACF has conducted various pilots  in this area since 2007 with the goal of ensuring that improper payment  data for administrative costs are sufficiently reliable and valid without  imposing undue burden on states. Although ACF expects to estimate for  administrative improper payments and recognizes the importance of  doing so, it has not yet taken action to augment its existing methodology.", "Selection. The population of data from which ACF selected its sample\u2014 the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System  (AFCARS)\u2014were not reliable because ACF\u2019s sampling methodology  did not provide for up-front data quality control procedures to (1) ensure  that the population of cases was complete prior to its sample selection  and (2) identify inaccuracies in the data field used for sample selection.  Specifically, ACF had to replace a high percentage of cases sampled  from the database of Foster Care cases for the fiscal year 2010 reporting  period because of inaccurate information in AFCARS.", "Of the original 4,570 sample cases ACF selected for testing in its  primary and secondary reviews for fiscal year 2010, 298 cases  (almost 7 percent) had to be replaced with substitutes because the  selected cases had not received Title IV-E Foster Care maintenance  payments during the period under review.", "Of the 298 over-sampled cases used to replace the cases initially  selected, 63 cases (more than 21 percent) then had to be replaced  again because those cases had also not received Title IV-E Foster  Care maintenance payments during the period under review.", "Further, although we were able to determine how many sampled (or  over-sampled) cases had to be replaced because available records  showed no Title IV-E payment was received during the reporting  period, neither GAO nor ACF were able to determine the extent to  which the opposite occurred\u2014cases that had received a payment  (and therefore should have been included in the sample population)  had not been coded as receiving Title IV-E payments.", "Without developing a statistically valid sampling methodology that  incorporates up-front data quality controls to ensure complete and  accurate information on the population, including payment data, ACF  cannot provide assurance that its reported improper payment estimate  accurately and completely represents the extent of improper maintenance  payments in the Foster Care program.", "Evaluation. Although ACF\u2019s methodology identified some errors related  to underpayments and duplicate or excessive payments, it did not include  procedures to reliably determine the full extent of such errors. In its fiscal  year 2010 agency financial report, ACF reported that underpayments and  duplicate or excessive payments represented 19 percent and 6 percent,  respectively, or 25 percent of the errors that caused improper payments.  However, the extent of underpayments and duplicate or excessive  payment errors identified varied widely by state, and in some instances  were not identified at all. For example, ACF did not identify  underpayments in 31 of 51 state eligibility reviews and did not identify  duplicate or excessive payments in 36 of 51 state eligibility reviews.did not assess the validity of the reported data. However, the absence of  such errors for some states seems inconsistent with the general  distribution of errors reported elsewhere. Further, the lack of detailed   We  procedures for identifying any such payment errors may have contributed  to the variation or to whether the teams found any errors. The purpose of  the eligibility reviews is to validate the accuracy of a state\u2019s claim for  reimbursement of payments made on behalf of eligible children or the  accuracy of federal financial assistance provided to states. Without  detailed procedures to guide review teams in the identification of  underpayments and duplicate or excessive payments, ACF cannot  provide assurance that it has identified the full extent of any such errors in  its Foster Care program.", "The weaknesses we identified in ACF\u2019s methodology to estimate  improper payments in the Foster Care program also impaired its ability to  reliably assess the extent to which its corrective actions reduced Foster  Care program improper payments. For example, although ACF has  reported significantly reduced estimated improper maintenance  payments, from a baseline error rate of 10.33 percent for 2004 to a 4.9  percent error rate for 2010, the validity of ACF\u2019s reporting of reduced  improper payment error rates is questionable because the previously  discussed weaknesses in its estimation methodology impaired the  accuracy and completeness of the reported estimate and error rate. In  addition, we found that ACF\u2019s ability to reliably assess the extent to which  its corrective actions reduced improper payments was impaired by  weaknesses in its requirements for state-level corrective actions. For  example, ACF used the number of cases found in error rather than the  dollar amount of improper payments identified to determine whether a  state was required to implement corrective actions. ACF required states  to implement corrective actions through a program improvement plan, if  during the Title IV-E primary eligibility review, a state was found to have  an error rate exceeding 5 percent of the number of cases reviewed. We  identified six states that were found substantially compliant in their  primary eligibility reviews as their case error rates were below the  established 5 percent threshold. However, the dollar-based improper  payment rates for those six states ranged from 5.1 percent to 19.8  percent\u2014based on the percentage of improper payment dollars found in  the sample. Because dollar-based improper payment rates are not used  in applying the corrective action strategy, ACF\u2019s method cannot  effectively measure states\u2019 progress over time in reducing improper  payments. It also cannot effectively help determine whether further action  is needed to minimize future improper payments. This limits the extent to  which states are held accountable for the reduction of improper payments  in the Foster Care program.", "Our report released today includes seven recommendations to help  improve ACF\u2019s methodology for estimating improper payments for the  Foster Care program and its corrective action process. In commenting  on our draft report, HHS agreed that its improper payment estimation  efforts can and should be improved, generally concurred with four of our  recommendations, and agreed to continue to study the remaining three  recommendations.

Analyses and reporting on the extent to  which agencies are participating in data sharing activities, and  additional data sharing efforts that agencies are currently pursuing or  would like to pursue, are other important elements that merit  consideration as part of future strategies to advance the federal  government\u2019s efforts to reduce improper payments.", "For example, Labor reported that its Unemployment Insurance  program utilizes HHS\u2019s National Directory of New Hires database to  improve the ability to detect overpayments caused by individuals who  claim benefits after returning to work\u2014the largest single cause of  overpayments reported in the program. In June 2011, Labor  established the mandatory use of the database for state benefit  payment control no later than December 2011. Labor also  recommended operating procedures for cross-matching activity for  national and state directories of new hires.", "GAO, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, GAO/AIMD-00-21.3.1  (Washington, D.C: November 1999). identifying opportunities for streamlining or changing the eligibility or  other program control requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementing Effective Detective Controls to Identify and Recover Overpayments", "paragraphs": ["Although strong preventive controls remain the frontline defense against  improper payments, agencies\u2019 improper payment reduction strategies  could also consider actions to establish additional effective detection  techniques to quickly identify and recover those improper payments that  do occur. Detection activities play a significant role not only in identifying  improper payments, but also in providing data on why these payments  were made and, in turn, highlighting areas that could benefit from  strengthened prevention controls. The following are examples of key  detection activities to be considered.", "Data mining. Data mining is a computer-based control activity that  analyzes diverse data for relationships that have not previously been  discovered. The central repository of data commonly used to perform  data mining is called a data warehouse. Data warehouses store tables  of historical and current information that are logically grouped. As a  tool in detecting improper payments, data mining of a data warehouse  can enable an organization to efficiently identify potential improper  payments, such as multiple payments for an individual invoice to an  individual recipient on the same date, or to the same address. For  example, in the Medicare and Medicaid program, data on claims are  stored in geographically disbursed systems and databases that are  not readily available to CMS\u2019s program integrity analysts. Over the  past decade, CMS has been working to consolidate program integrity  data and analytical tools for detecting fraud, waste, and abuse. The  agency\u2019s efforts led to the initiation of the Integrated Data Repository  (IDR) program, which is intended to provide CMS and its program  integrity contractors with a centralized source that contains Medicaid  and Medicare data from the many disparate and dispersed legacy  systems and databases. CMS subsequently developed the One  Program Integrity (One PI) program,analytical tools by which these data can be accessed and analyzed to   a web-based portal and set of  help identify any cases of fraudulent, wasteful, and abusive payments  based on patterns of paid claims.", "Recovery auditing. While internal control should be maintained to  help prevent improper payments, recovery auditing could be included  as a part of agencies\u2019 strategy for identifying and recovering  contractor overpayments. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006  required CMS to implement a national Medicare recovery audit  contractor (RAC) program by January 1, 2010. HHS reported that the Medicare Fee-for-Service recovery audit  program identified $961 million in overpayments and recovered $797  million nationwide. Further, the Medicaid RAC program was  established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.  Under this program, each state is to contract with a RAC to identify  and recover Medicaid overpayments and identify any underpayments.  The final regulations provided that state Medicaid RACs were to be  implemented by January 1, 2012. Similar to the Medicare RACs,  Medicaid RACs will be paid on a contingency fee basis\u2014a percentage  of any recovered overpayments plus incentive payments for the  detection of underpayments.", "Pub. L. No. 109-432, div. B., title III, \u00a7 302, 120 Stat. 2922, 2991-92 (Dec. 20, 2006),  codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ddd(h). drafted language to address the issue and is working to publish a  notice of proposed rule making to amend its regulation.", "In another instance, USDA reported that Section 281 of the  Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 precluded the  use of recovery auditing techniques because Section 281 provides  that 90 days after the decision of a state, county, or an area  committee is final, no action may be taken to recover the amounts  found to have been erroneously disbursed as a result of the decision  unless the participant had reason to believe that the decision was  erroneous. This statute is commonly referred to as the Finality Rule.  As part of its annual improper payments reporting, USDA did not cite  an alternative approach for implementing a recovery auditing strategy.", "Federal-state incentives.  Another area for further exploration for  agencies\u2019 improper payment reduction strategies is the broader use of  incentives for states to implement effective detective controls.  Agencies have applied limited incentives and penalties for  encouraging improved state administration to reduce improper  payments. Incentives and penalties can be helpful to create  management reform and to ensure adherence to performance  standards.", "Chairman Carper, Ranking Member Brown, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
