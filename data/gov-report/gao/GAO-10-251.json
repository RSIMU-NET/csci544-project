At the request of the Speaker of the House, this report determines (1) which U.S. agencies were responsible for the public release of this information and why the disclosure occurred, and (2) what impact, if any, the release of the information has had on U.S. national security. In performing this work, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) analyzed policies, procedures, and guidance for safeguarding sensitive information and met with officials from four executive branch agencies involved in preparing the document, the White House, the House of Representatives, and GPO."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While no single U.S. government agency or office was entirely responsible for the public disclosure of the draft declaration, all of the agencies and offices involved in preparing and publishing the draft declaration share some responsibility for its release. GAO identified several points during the life cycle of the draft document where problems in the process occurred. First, none of the agencies that prepared the draft declaration--the Departments of Energy (DOE) and Commerce, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)--took the added precaution of ensuring that the consolidated draft they helped prepare had a U.S. security designation on each page of the document. Rather, the final version of the document, which they all reviewed, was marked only with the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) designation--\"Highly Confidential Safeguards Sensitive.\" This marking has no legal significance in the United States. Second, the Department of State, which prepared the draft declaration for transmittal to the White House, sent a transmittal letter to the National Security Council indicating that the contents of the draft declaration should be treated as Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU). Not all federal agencies use this particular marking and, therefore, the marking created confusion for other executive and legislative branch offices that subsequently received the draft declaration on whether the information could be published. Third, the National Security Council, which reviewed the draft declaration on behalf of the White House, did not provide explicit and clear instructions on how to handle the draft declaration to the White House Clerk's Office. Fourth, the legislative branch offices which reviewed and then transmitted the document to GPO for publication--the House of Representatives' Parliamentarian and Clerk's Office--determined incorrectly, in GAO's view, that the document could be published. Officials from these congressional offices were not familiar with the phrase \"Sensitive but Unclassified\" and did not know how to safeguard that information. Finally, GPO, which proofread and processed the document for publication, did not raise any concerns about the document's sensitivity. GAO believes it is important to correct these problems as soon as possible because the United States is required to submit a declaration to IAEA annually. The public release of the draft declaration of civilian nuclear sites and nuclear facilities does not appear to have damaged national security, according to officials from DOE, NRC, and Commerce. Commerce, DOE, and NRC did not assess the national security implications of the draft declaration's public release because these agencies--plus the Department of Defense--had reviewed the list of civilian nuclear facilities and related activities prior to transmitting it to the White House and Congress to ensure that information of direct national security significance was not included. Information in the draft declaration was limited to civilian nuclear activities, and most nuclear-related information was publicly available on agency Web sites or other publicly available documents. However, according to officials from all of the agencies responsible for compiling this information, the information consolidated in one document made it sensitive and, thus, it should never have been posted to GPO's Web site."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["On May 7, 2009, the Government Printing Office (GPO) published a 266- page document on its Web site that provided detailed information on  civilian nuclear sites, locations, facilities, and activities in the United  States. The document described, among other things, nuclear activities at  Department of Energy (DOE) facilities such as Los Alamos, Lawrence  Livermore, and Oak Ridge National Laboratories. The document also  included 14 diagrams of buildings or facilities, 2 of which were marked  Official Use Only (OUO). For example, the document provided the  building and vault numbers where highly enriched uranium is stored at the  Y-12 nuclear production facility near Oak Ridge National Laboratory, as  well as a diagram showing the layout of the part of the building where the  material is stored. According to DOE officials, this information was  sensitive because it identified the specific building and vault number, but  no classified information was revealed because the diagram does not show  a map of the entire Y-12 facility and information about the storage area at  Y-12 was already publicly available.", "The document was a draft of a declaration being prepared pursuant to an  agreement known as the Additional Protocol with IAEA. The declaration  supplements information provided pursuant to the U.S. Safeguards  Agreement with IAEA by providing IAEA with a broader range of  information on U.S. nuclear and nuclear-related activities. Safeguards  allow IAEA to independently verify that quantities of nuclear material  declared to the agency have not been diverted for nuclear weapons uses.  The Additional Protocol allows IAEA to, among other things, access  locations containing nuclear material declared by a country. Within the  United States, the Additional Protocol allows IAEA to access a selected  number of facilities and locations containing nuclear material.", "This was the first time the United States had prepared and submitted a  declaration to IAEA, and the United States will now be required to submit  a declaration to IAEA every year. Sixty days before sending the  declaration to IAEA, the President is required to send the draft declaration  to Congress. Congress had received the first draft declaration on May 5,  2009. On June 1, 2009, the Federation of American Scientists, a nonprofit  group that reports on scientific and technological security issues,  discovered the draft declaration on GPO\u2019s Web site and posted it on the  Federation\u2019s Web site. On June 2, 2009, multiple media outlets began  reporting that the U.S. government had \u201caccidentally\u201d and \u201cmistakenly\u201d  posted a list of nuclear sites and a description of their nuclear activities on  GPO\u2019s Web site. For example, The New York Times reported that a  security official found the disclosure of the draft declaration \u201ca one-stop  shop for information on U.S. nuclear programs.\u201d In response to media  inquiries, GPO temporarily removed the document from its Web site, and  after consulting with the Clerk of the House of Representatives,  permanently did so.", "In addition to posting the draft report on its Web site, GPO printed over  900 copies of the document and shipped about 240 copies to Congress and  some federal agencies. GPO recalled these copies and, as of December 2,  2009, around 670 copies were secured in a safe in its security office.  However, it is possible that copies were downloaded from various Web  sites. The location of any such downloaded copies is unknown and cannot  be accounted for. As of October 2009, copies of the document could still  be found on a number of Web sites. We brought this matter to the  attention of State officials and provided them with internet addresses for  two such sites in late October 2009. A State official subsequently informed  us that the department was able to get at least one Web site to remove the  information.", "The disclosure of sensitive information on U.S. nuclear facilities and  activities raises concerns about procedures to properly handle and  safeguard such sensitive information. In this context, you asked us to  determine (1) which U.S. agencies were responsible for the public release  of this information and why the disclosure occurred, and (2) what impact,  if any, the release of the information has had on U.S. national security.", "To determine which U.S. agencies were responsible for the disclosure and  why the disclosure occurred, we analyzed the policies, procedures, and  guidance for safeguarding sensitive information from the departments of  Energy and State; the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC); the House  of Representatives Clerk\u2019s Office; and GPO. We also reviewed transmittal  sheets prepared by DOE, State, the House of Representatives\u2019 Clerk\u2019s  Office, and GPO to determine how the document was marked for security  purposes as it was distributed and prepared for publication. In addition, to  determine how each of these agencies and offices safeguarded and  transmitted the document, we interviewed officials from DOE; Commerce;  State; NRC; GPO (including the Inspector General\u2019s office); and the Clerk\u2019s  Office, Security Office, and the Office of the Parliamentarian in the House  of Representatives. In addition, we asked to meet with the officials from  the White House National Security Council and Executive Clerk\u2019s Office  who had handled and transmitted the draft declaration to Congress so that  we could obtain information directly from the individuals responsible for  reviewing and handling the document. The White House declined to make  these individuals available to us; instead, attorneys from the White House  Counsel\u2019s office met with those individuals and then conveyed information  to us.  To determine what impact the release of the information has had on  U.S. national security interests, we reviewed the draft declaration to  identify potentially sensitive nuclear sites and activities and then  interviewed officials from DOE, Commerce, State, and NRC to determine  whether any information of direct national security significance was  compromised and whether these departments took any actions to enhance  security at the declared sites, locations, and facilities.", "We conducted our work between June 2009 and November 2009 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.

The Additional Protocol, a separate agreement between the United States  and IAEA, supplements the United States\u2019 Safeguards Agreement with  IAEA. Under the Additional Protocol, the United States must provide  IAEA with a broader range of civilian nuclear and nuclear-related  information than that required under the Safeguards Agreement, such as  the manufacturing of key nuclear-related equipment; research and  development activities related to the nuclear fuel cycle; the use and  contents of buildings on a nuclear site; and exports of IAEA-specified,  sensitive nuclear-related equipment. The United States must also provide  IAEA with access, through on-site inspections, to resolve questions  relating to the accuracy and completeness of the information. As a nuclear  weapon state party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear  Weapons, the United States is not obligated by the Treaty to accept IAEA  safeguards or to implement an Additional Protocol. However, according to  U.S. officials, voluntarily adopting the Additional Protocol underscores  U.S support for IAEA\u2019s strengthened safeguards system and makes efforts  to encourage more countries to adopt the Additional Protocol more  effective and credible.", "In its act implementing the Additional Protocol, Congress prohibited the  inclusion of certain information: any classified information; any  information that would be deemed restricted data under the Atomic  Energy Act; and any information of direct national security significance  regarding any location, site, or facility associated with activities of the  Department of Defense or DOE. The act also provided that information  collected for the purposes of the Additional Protocol would be exempt  from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, which is the Freedom of Information  Act. Figure 1 shows a timeline of the U.S. implementation of the Additional  Protocol.", "The U.S. government classifies information that it determines could  damage the national security of the United States if disclosed publicly.  Beginning in 1940, classified national defense and foreign relations  information has been created, handled, and safeguarded in accordance  with a series of executive orders. Executive Order 12958, Classified  National Security Information, as amended, is the most recent. It  demarcates different security classification levels, the unauthorized  disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally  grave damage (Top Secret), serious damage (Secret), or damage  (Confidential).", "Federal agencies also place dissemination restrictions on certain  unclassified information. Federal agencies use many different designations  to identify this type of information. For example, DOE uses the designation  OUO, while State uses SBU. According to a May 2009 presidential  memorandum, there are more than 107 unique markings and over 130  different labeling or handling processes and procedures for documents that  are unclassified, but are considered sensitive. For example, according to  DOE officials, although OUO information is less sensitive than classified  information, OUO information may be shared with people lacking security  clearances provided that officials determine they have a \u201cneed to know.\u201d  These restrictions are used to indicate that the information, if disseminated  to the public or persons who do not need such information to perform their  jobs, may cause foreseeable harm to protected governmental, commercial,  or privacy interests.

We identified several points  during the life cycle of the draft document where problems occurred.  Specifically, we found that opportunities to improve the secure handling of  the document were missed because of the absence of clear interagency  guidance, different procedures across the agencies governing the handling  and marking of sensitive documents, poor decision making, and a lack of  training and adequate security awareness. These missed opportunities  occurred between February 2008 and May 2009. Several U.S. government  agencies played key roles in preparing and making important decisions  regarding the publication of the draft declaration: DOE, Commerce, State,  NRC, the White House (the National Security Council and Executive  Clerk\u2019s Office), the U.S. House of Representatives (Office of the  Parliamentarian, Office of Security, and the Clerk\u2019s Office), and GPO.

DOE collected information from national  laboratories and nuclear weapons production facilities. NRC, which  regulates the civilian use of nuclear materials, collected information from  NRC-licensed nuclear facilities, including four civilian nuclear power  plants previously selected by IAEA for the application of safeguards. DOE  and NRC provided nuclear-related information to Commerce on January  15, 2009, and March 18, 2009, respectively. Commerce collected  information from private nuclear-related industries not regulated by DOE  or NRC, such as the location, operational status, and production capacity  of conventional uranium mines. Commerce then consolidated all nuclear- related information from its offices, as well as from DOE and NRC, into a  draft U.S. declaration for final interagency approval and transmittal to  State. The process for collecting and consolidating this information from  the three agencies took several months.", "Commerce, in consolidating and formatting the information in the draft  declaration, did not mark the document with an official U.S. government  security marking. The only marking on the draft declaration was IAEA\u2019s  designation on the top of the document\u2014\u201cHighly Confidential Safeguards  Sensitive\u201d\u2014which has no legal significance in the United States. To  consolidate and properly format the information, Commerce established  and managed a central database, known as the U.S. Additional Protocol  Reporting System (APRS). IAEA provided a software program for this  database that standardizes the information sent to IAEA by each member  state and helps IAEA assess the completeness of the information. Before  transmitting data to Commerce or adding data to the APRS, each agency  reviewed the information it collected for accuracy, data consistency, and  national security concerns. Each agency also reviewed the information to  ensure that no classified information was being disclosed. The agencies  had agreed that the information in the U.S. declaration would not be  classified, as required by the U.S. Additional Protocol Implementation Act;  that an unclassified database could be used to process the information;  and that the data were sensitive and would be restricted to authorized  personnel only.", "When Commerce and NRC added information to APRS, IAEA-supplied  software automatically marked the top of each page of the draft  declaration as \u201cHighly Confidential Safeguards Sensitive.\u201d IAEA uses this  designation to ensure the document\u2019s appropriate handling and control.  According to IAEA officials, Highly Confidential Safeguards Sensitive  information is the agency\u2019s highest classification level. This type of  information, if released, could cause grave damage to IAEA interests.  When IAEA receives a document from a country with this classification, it  cannot publicly disclose the information in the document because, in some  instances, its release could disclose confidential business information,  create potential security issues, or identify reporting discrepancies  between countries. Distribution of this information is limited and released  on a need-to-know basis. Since this IAEA marking has no legal significance  in the United States, DOE, Commerce, and NRC treated the information as  OUO. These agencies use OUO markings to provide a warning that  information in a document is sensitive and is generally only to be released  to those with a need to know, regardless of their security clearance.", "DOE, NRC, and Commerce took steps to safeguard the information that  each contributed to the draft declaration. Specifically, before DOE and  NRC submitted data to Commerce in January and March 2009,  respectively:    DOE marked the top and bottom of each page it submitted to Commerce  with nuclear information from the national laboratories and production  facilities as OUO and added a statement that the information may be  exempt from public release under the Freedom of Information Act.", "NRC officials hand carried a compact disc containing its nuclear-related  information to Commerce, rather than electronically sending the  information.", "Commerce officials also safeguarded the information by password  protecting APRS and sending State the draft declaration through secure e- mail that included a transmittal letter explaining that the contents were  considered OUO. In addition, they hand carried a compact disc to State  that was marked with \u201cFor Official Use Only/Not For Public Release/IAEA  Highly Confidential Safeguards Protected\u201d hand written on the disc.", "Although each agency designated the information it contributed as OUO,  the document\u2014which was produced from each agency\u2019s contributions\u2014 did not have any U.S. government security markings.  The agencies  reviewed the draft declaration multiple times, but no agency marked the  pages containing information it had contributed to the full draft  declaration as OUO. Once all the information was consolidated, the 266- page document was not marked OUO or any other security designation  recognized in the United States that would have clearly indicated that the  data were sensitive, restricted to authorized personnel only, and not  releasable to the public. The only OUO markings were next to site  diagrams of two DOE facilities found on two different pages of the draft  declaration.", "According to Commerce officials, while the IAEA software template  automatically adds the IAEA designation, it does not add a U.S. security  designation to the top and bottom of each page and does not allow  Commerce to modify the IAEA designation or add U.S. security markings.  They stated that the only way to mark the draft document as OUO would  have been to print out each page, stamp the U.S. designation by hand, and  then scan the document back in as a new electronic file. Furthermore,  according to DOE officials, the agencies wanted to submit a draft  declaration to Congress that was identical to the final declaration  submitted to IAEA. Providing Congress with a draft declaration that had  both the IAEA and U.S. security markings would not have been an exact  representation of the declaration sent to IAEA. However, there were no  requirements in the U.S. Additional Protocol Implementation Act binding  U.S. agencies to submit a declaration free of any additional U.S. security  markings.", "Even after Commerce circulated the draft declaration to DOE, NRC, and  the Department of Defense for a final interagency review in late March  2009 to ensure no information of national security significance was  included in the draft before submission to State, agency officials did not  raise any concerns about the draft declaration\u2019s lack of a U.S. security  designation.

The National Security Council also did not  include a transmittal letter, as other executive branch agencies had, with  instructions on how to handle the draft declaration. Attorneys from the  Office of the White House Counsel provided two reasons why the National  Security Council did not feel it was necessary to take these additional  measures to protect the document from disclosure. First, counsel stated  that they did not think Congress would publish the report and the National  Security Council and the Executive Clerk\u2019s Office followed their standard  practice for transmitting unclassified documents, which does not involve  using a transmittal letter or modifying text in the presidential message.

According to the GPO Inspector General\u2019s report, GPO  employees who reviewed the scanned copy looked for page numbers and  format, without proofreading or reviewing the document text or markings.", "GPO officials told us that GPO rarely prints sensitive or classified  documents. They told us that GPO relies on its customers to identify  sensitive documents and notify it of special instructions, given the high  volume of print requests. However, the August 2009 GPO Inspector  General\u2019s report found that GPO does not have procedures for identifying  potentially sensitive documents and safeguarding them. In addition, most  employees had not received education or training for recognizing or  identifying sensitive documents or information.", "Although the GPO Inspector General found no wrongdoing on the part of  GPO or its employees, it made several recommendations to improve GPO\u2019s  process for handling sensitive information and preventing the inadvertent  disclosure of such information in the future. These recommendations  included    establishing a protocol with customer agencies on clearly identifying  sensitive information that may be published and developing written  procedures for handling such information;    establishing written procedures for verifying any requests for publishing  documents that are clearly identified or marked as being of a sensitive or  otherwise restricted nature;    updating GPO guidance to define \u201csensitive information\u201d and how to  specifically recognize, mark, and safeguard such information; and    developing and conducting ongoing training of GPO employees on how to  recognize, handle, and safeguard sensitive information and documents.", "During the course of our review, officials from several of the federal  agencies and offices told us that it would be helpful if there was a  standardized marking system for documents that are sensitive but are  unclassified. In fact, the term sensitive but unclassified was very confusing  for several officials who handled the draft declaration. To help clarify, a  May 2008 presidential memorandum had adopted the phrase \u201cControlled  Unclassified Information\u201d (CUI) as a single designation for all information  previously labeled SBU or with another similar marking. This  memorandum also charged the National Archives and Records  Administration with implementing a framework for CUI terrorism-related  information, which is not expected to be in place until 2013. Despite these  efforts, a May 27, 2009, presidential memorandum found that there is still  no uniformity across federal agencies on rules to implement safeguards for  information that is deemed SBU. The memorandum noted that agencies  use SBU as a designation for federal government documents and  information that are sufficiently sensitive to warrant some level of  protection, but that do not meet the standards for national security  classification. With each agency implementing its own protections for  categorizing and handling SBU material, the memorandum stated that  there are more than 107 unique markings and over 130 different labeling or  handling processes and procedures for SBU information. The 2009  memorandum directed the creation of a Task Force to review agencies\u2019  current procedures for categorizing and sharing SBU information, to track  the progress federal agencies are making to implement the framework for  CUI terrorism-related information, and to recommend whether the CUI  framework should be extended to apply to all SBU information."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Public Release of Draft Declaration Does Not Appear to Have Harmed National Security, According to DOE, NRC, and Commerce Officials", "paragraphs": ["The inadvertent public release of the draft declaration of civilian nuclear  sites and nuclear facilities does not appear to have damaged national  security, according to officials from DOE, NRC, and Commerce.

However, officials from all of the agencies that  compiled this information told us the information\u2014all of which was  considered unclassified\u2014was sensitive because it was consolidated into  one document and should never have been posted to GPO\u2019s Web site.  Commerce, DOE, and NRC did not formally assess the impact of the public  release of the information on U.S. national security. According to DOE,  NRC, and Commerce officials, it was not necessary to do so because the  agencies reviewed the list of civilian nuclear facilities and related activities  on multiple occasions to ensure that no information of direct national  security significance was included and that no classified information was  contained in the declaration prior to transmitting it to the White House  and Congress."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Consolidated List of Civilian Nuclear Facilities and Activities Contained in the Draft Declaration Is Considered Sensitive and Was Never Meant to be Made Public", "paragraphs": ["According to U.S. government officials, the draft declaration in totality  represents a consolidated list of hundreds of U.S. civilian nuclear facilities  and activities that never should have been publicly released. These  officials asserted that it could be potentially problematic if such a  consolidated list of facilities and activities found its way into the hands of  individuals who had malicious or malevolent intentions. For example,  agency officials told us, in several instances, the draft declaration  contained maps showing detailed diagrams of civilian reactor facilities or  buildings storing nuclear materials at national laboratories.", "The draft declaration included 14 diagrams of buildings or facilities, 2 of  which were marked OUO. For example, the declaration provided the  building and vault numbers where highly enriched uranium is stored at the  Y-12 nuclear production facility, as well as a diagram showing the layout of  the part of the building where the material is stored. According to DOE  officials, this information was sensitive because it identified the specific  building and vault number, but no classified information was revealed  because the diagram does not show a map of the entire Y-12 facility and  the specific location of a vault at the Y-12 complex. Of the other 12  diagrams, 1 was of a plutonium oxide storage area at DOE\u2019s Savannah  River site and 11 were of civilian nuclear facilities. The pages containing  these diagrams did not have any markings: Highly Confidential Safeguards  Sensitive, OUO, or any other U.S. designation.", "The 11 diagrams of civilian nuclear facilities accompanied information on  8 NRC licensed commercial sites\u20144 reactors and 4 fuel fabrication  facilities. For example, the draft declaration included a site map of the  Turkey Point reactor in Florida and a diagram identifying the building  where spent fuel is stored. According to NRC officials, the information and  diagrams related to the facilities in the draft declaration are not classified  because they do not specify the quantities and types of nuclear materials  held at these facilities. However, the information is sensitive because it  includes commercially sensitive data, such as the actual annual  production, rather than the more general and publicly available  information on how much material the facility is licensed to produce.", "According to DOE and State officials, the release of the information could  be problematic for the United States because other countries could  scrutinize the completeness and accuracy of the information and  potentially pressure IAEA to do more rigorous inspections of the facilities  listed. Inspections of nuclear facilities with nuclear materials and nuclear- related activities are the cornerstone of IAEA\u2019s data collection efforts and  provide the ability to independently verify information in countries\u2019  Additional Protocol declarations.

First, the national laboratories\u2019  counterintelligence, export controls, and security offices reviewed the  information submitted for the declaration. Second, the national  laboratories\u2019 site managers reviewed the information, and each site  manager certified to DOE that the national laboratory had completed  vulnerability assessments on the national security impact of releasing the  information to IAEA and that the facilities were ready for IAEA  inspections. Finally, program managers and security officers at DOE  headquarters reviewed the contents. According to DOE officials, at all  levels of review, officials from the national laboratories and DOE  concluded that no information detrimental to national security was  included in the document. NRC and Commerce reported information  about facilities\u2019 activities and locations that was mostly, if not all, publicly  available. State obtained additional confirmation from DOE, Commerce,  NRC, and the Department of Defense that the draft declaration contained  no classified or national security information before sending it to the  White House.", "According to agency officials, there was no requirement to conduct a  formal assessment of any possible security concerns arising from the  declaration\u2019s publication because classified information was not released.  A formal assessment is required only if there is a release of information  that could harm U.S. national security. DOE and NRC did seek assurances  after the release of the draft declaration from officials at the national  laboratories and civilian nuclear facilities that physical security at those  locations was sufficient. DOE asked the national laboratories to review  their security procedures and ensure that the facilities were secure. Based  on these assessments, DOE officials told us they did not increase security  at any site. NRC contacted every NRC licensee and agreement states with  licensees included in the draft declaration to notify them of the disclosure  of information. Agreement states notified their affected licensees. NRC  and agreement states\u2019 licensees reviewed their security procedures to  make sure there were no vulnerabilities. According to NRC, the only NRC  facility to express concern was Turkey Point in Florida because of its  spent fuel pool. NRC officials told us that the location of this facility was  already publicly disclosed, and satellite images show the building that  houses the spent fuel pool. Turkey Point operators reviewed their security  procedures and determined the procedures they had in place were  sufficient, even with the release of the draft declaration."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The draft declaration listing civilian nuclear sites and activities under the  terms of the Additional Protocol was the first of its kind prepared by the  United States for IAEA and sent to Congress for review. However, the  draft declaration contained sensitive civilian nuclear information that,  when taken in its totality, needed to be properly handled and safeguarded.  Protecting sensitive information from inadvertent public disclosure is a  critical function of all federal entities that possess, handle, or transmit  such information. Since the United States is required to submit a draft  declaration to Congress and then send the declaration to IAEA every year,  there is an opportunity to address the problems that occurred to ensure  that this inadvertent disclosure does not occur again.", "A more systematic, well-coordinated approach by all of the agencies that  handled the draft declaration would have reduced the chances of publicly  releasing sensitive information\u2014particularly if the document had been  clearly identified as not for public release. We found several critical points  where opportunities to improve safeguards over the document were  missed due to: the absence of clear interagency guidance, different  procedures across the agencies governing the handling and marking of  sensitive documents, poor decision making, and the lack of training and  adequate security awareness.", "No agency or office that was involved with the production or transmittal  of the draft declaration ensured that the final document was marked with  any U.S. security designation. DOE, NRC, and Commerce marked the  information they submitted for the draft declaration as OUO. However,  none of these agencies took the added precaution of ensuring that the  consolidated draft declaration maintained the OUO designation on each  page of the document once the IAEA marking was placed on the  document. Further contributing to the subsequent confusion over how to  handle the draft declaration was State\u2019s use of the SBU marking. Many  officials focused on the unclassified portion of the marking and  determined, incorrectly in our view, that the document could be made  public. We believe that it would have been a simple matter to clearly state  in the presidential message that the draft declaration was not meant for  public dissemination.", "Furthermore, the White House failed to take measures to ensure that the  draft declaration was not published. Attorneys from the Office of the  White House Counsel did not provide us with any written guidance on how  the National Security Council and the Executive Clerk\u2019s Office usually  handle documents that are unclassified, but are considered sensitive, such  as those marked SBU, that should not be publicly released.  However,  counsel did indicate that individuals with the National Security Council  and White House Clerk\u2019s office handled the draft declaration according to  White House practices. In our view, these practices, as best as we  understand them, are not sufficient to prevent similar problems from  occurring in the future.", "In addition, legislative branch officials did not properly safeguard the draft  declaration and did not properly handle the information. In particular, we  believe that the House of Representatives Security Office Director should  have been more directly involved in resolving conflicting and confusing  information regarding the classification of the draft declaration.  Conversely, the Executive Communications Clerk is to be commended for  taking actions to do everything in her power\u2014at her level of  responsibility\u2014to pursue the right course of action.", "Finally, in our view, GPO officials also share responsibility for the public  disclosure of the draft declaration. Although the August 2009 GPO  Inspector General\u2019s report assigns no wrongdoing to either GPO or its  employees, GPO officials should have had procedures in place to prevent  such a release from occurring.

NRC neither  agreed nor disagreed with our recommendations, but did provide technical  comments which we incorporated as appropriate.   In response to our  recommendation involving an interagency agreement to designate, mark,  and handle sensitive information provided to IAEA on U.S. nuclear sites  and activities, DOE noted that the interagency agreement would  specifically address the marking and handling of future draft declarations  and other documents provided to IAEA under U.S. safeguards agreements.   The interagency agreement will not address broader, governmentwide  standards on how to mark and handle all unclassified, but sensitive  information.  These standards will be developed by the Controlled  Unclassified Information Council or other entity designated by the  President.  This is consistent with our recommendation.  As we state in  our report, the interagency agreement should be a corrective action to  prevent the inadvertent public disclosure of sensitive information in future  draft declarations or other documents prepared for IAEA by multiple U.S.  agencies, rather than addressing broader, governmentwide standards on  how to mark and handle all unclassified but sensitive information.", "The House of Representatives\u2019 Sergeant at Arms did not comment on our  recommendations but provided three points of clarification regarding the  Office of Security\u2019s role in reviewing and transmitting the draft  declaration.  First, the House Sergeant at Arms stated that, contrary to  what we stated in our draft report, the House Security Office made no  determination as to whether the draft document could be published and  did not provide the House Clerk\u2019s office with any direction or legal advice  regarding this matter.  Second, according to the House Sergeant at Arms,  the House Security Office properly advised the House Clerk\u2019s office to  contact IAEA regarding the handling of the draft document.  Third, the  House Sergeant at Arms stated that the House Security Office did not need  to take control of the draft document, nor was the Security Office  requested to take control of the document.  In addition, the Security Office  does not have the authority to order a House of Representatives office or  entity to store a document with the Security Office.", "Regarding the first point, we believe that given the sensitive nature of the  draft document\u2014and commensurate with its role and responsibilities\u2014 the House Security Office should have, at a minimum, raised concerns  with the House Clerk\u2019s Office about publicly releasing 266 pages of  information on U.S. nuclear sites and activities and advised the House  Clerk not to print the document without explicit authorization from the  agencies that designated the information SBU.  While we do not dispute  the statement that the House Security Office did not provide any advice or  direction regarding the printing of the document, we believe that it would  have been appropriate for this Office to play a more assertive role because  the House Clerk sought advice and guidance in determining whether the  document could be printed.  However, based on these comments, we  modified the text of the report to reflect the claims made by the House  Security Office.  Specifically, we removed reference to the Security Office  on page 16 to avoid inferences that the Security Office provided direction  or legal advice to the Clerk\u2019s Office that it could print the document.", "Regarding the second point, the House Office of Security has  misconstrued what we stated in the draft report.  While there was nothing  inherently wrong with the Office of Security suggesting that the Clerk\u2019s  Office contact IAEA about the document, IAEA did not prepare, transmit,  or mark the document.  As we noted in our report, the U.S. agencies that  prepared the draft declaration placed the IAEA markings on the document.   The presidential message explained that the draft declaration was  prepared by the United States and would be submitted to IAEA.  Because  the IAEA markings on the document have no legal significance in the  United States, the presidential message further explained that information  in the document should be treated as SBU and was exempt from  disclosure.  IAEA was not the originating agency for the information.  As a  result, it continues to be our view that the Director of the House Office of  Security did not provide the correct advice to the House Clerk on who she  should contact to obtain authorization on releasing SBU information.", "Finally, regarding the matter of physical custody of the document, we do  not dispute Security Office\u2019s claim that it was not required\u2014nor did it have  the authority\u2014to take control of the document.  However, we believe that  it would have been prudent for that office to take physical control of the  document as a precautionary measure until a determination was made  concerning whether or not the document could be published.  The  Director of the Office of Security missed opportunities to prevent the  document\u2019s release and should have been more directly involved in  resolving conflicting and confusing information regarding the  dissemination of the draft declaration.

U.S. agencies used an IAEA-supplied software to  mark the document with the highest IAEA security marking to put  IAEA on notice, once it received the document, that it should be  properly safeguarded against disclosure.
