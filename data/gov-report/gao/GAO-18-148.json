However, a number of responses for the remaining investments were incorrectly reported due to agency error. Officials from 21 of the 24 agencies in GAO's review reported that challenges hindered their ability to implement incremental development, which included: (1) inefficient governance processes; (2) procurement delays; and (3) organizational changes associated with transitioning from a traditional software methodology that takes years to deliver a product, to incremental development, which delivers products in shorter time frames. Nevertheless, agencies reported that the certification process was beneficial because they used the information from the process to assist with identifying investments that could more effectively use an incremental approach, and using lessons learned to improve the agencies' incremental processes.", "As of August 2017, only 4 of the 24 agencies had clearly defined CIO incremental development certification policies and processes that contained: descriptions of the role of the CIO in the process; how the CIO's certification will be documented; and included definitions of incremental development and time frames for delivering functionality consistent with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance (see figure).", "In addition, OMB's fiscal year 2018 capital planning guidance did not establish how agency CIOs are to make explicit statements to demonstrate compliance with FITARA's incremental provisions, while the 2017 guidance did.

We presented the results of our data analysis to officials from  each agency\u2019s Office of the CIO and incorporated any changes to the  data as appropriate. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable  for the purpose of this report.", "We also presented a list of challenges identified during our past work on  incremental development to officials in the Office of the CIO at each of the  24 agencies involved with investment management and software  development activities. We then asked the officials to identify from the  list their top three challenges to delivering incremental functionality;  explain the actions they took to addresses the challenges; and describe  the outcomes. In addition, we also asked agency officials to identify any  challenges that were not included in the list, but which were among their  top three challenges. Lastly, we also asked the agencies in our review to  identify how the CIO utilized the information obtained during the process  of certifying investments\u2019 adequate incremental development to make  decisions regarding the agency\u2019s major IT investments.", "For the second objective, we analyzed the 24 agencies\u2019 CIO certification  policies and processes to determine whether they were consistent with  the provision in FITARA and OMB guidance.

This development technique has been  recognized in prior law since 1996 and in OMB guidance since 2000.", "By following an incremental development approach, agencies have the  potential to: deliver capabilities to their users more rapidly, giving them more  flexibility to respond to changing agency priorities;  increase the likelihood that each project will achieve its cost,  schedule, and performance goals; obtain additional feedback from users, increasing the probability that  each successive increment and project will meet user needs; more easily incorporate emerging technologies; and  terminate a poorly performing investment, with fewer sunk costs.", "Since 2000, OMB Circular A-130 has directed agencies to incorporate an  incremental development approach into their policies and ensure that  investments implement them. Further, since 2012, OMB has required  that functionality be delivered at least every 6 months.", "In addition, FITARA states that OMB is to require in its annual IT capital  planning guidance that covered agency CIOs certify that IT investments  are adequately implementing incremental development, as defined in  capital planning guidance issued by OMB.

In 2011, we identified seven successful  investment acquisitions and nine common factors critical to their  success. Specifically, we reported that department officials had  identified seven successful investments that best achieved their  respective cost, schedule, scope, and performance goals. Notably, all of  these were smaller increments, phases, or releases of larger projects. For  example, the Defense investment in our sample was the seventh  increment of an ongoing investment; Energy\u2019s system was the first of two  phases; the DHS investment was rolled out to two locations prior to  deployment to 37 additional locations; and Transportation\u2019s investment  had been part of a prototype deployed to four airports.", "Common factors critical to the success of three or more of the seven  investments were:  1.  Program officials were actively engaged with stakeholders.  2.  Program staff had the necessary knowledge and skills.  3.  Senior department and agency executives supported the programs.  4.  End users and stakeholders were involved in the development of  requirements.  5.  End users participated in testing system functionality prior to formal  end-user acceptance testing.  6.  Government and contractor staff were stable and consistent.  7.  Program staff prioritized requirements.  8.  Program officials maintained regular communication with the prime  contractor.  9.  Programs received sufficient funding.", "These critical factors help support OMB\u2019s objective of improving the  management of large-scale IT acquisitions across the federal  government.", "In May 2014, we reported on the status of incremental development at  five agencies (Defense, DHS, HHS, Transportation, and VA). We noted  that these agencies planned to deliver functionality for fewer than half of  the investments in 12-month cycles and that only about one-fourth of  these investments would deliver in 6-month increments, as required by  OMB. Additionally, OMB staff reported to us that they did not expect that  many investments would meet the 6-month requirement. Therefore, we  questioned whether a 6-month delivery requirement was an appropriate  government-wide goal and whether OMB should instead consider a 12- month time frame, as called for in its IT Reform Plan. Accordingly, we  recommended that OMB require projects to deliver functionality at least  every 12 months. OMB disagreed with our recommendation, asserting  that changing the requirement from 6 to 12 months would reduce the  emphasis on incremental development that it had been advocating and  that 6 months was an appropriate goal. However, we noted in our report,  agencies\u2019 plans to deliver functionality every 6 months was low and it  would not always be practical for certain types of investments to deliver  functionality every 6 months. We therefore continue to believe our  recommendation is appropriate.", "We also recommended that OMB develop and issue clearer guidance on  incremental development to ensure that it has the necessary information  to oversee the extent to which projects and investments are implementing  its guidance. OMB took action to address this recommendation and  issued capital planning guidance in fiscal year 2016 that requires  agencies to report on whether each of their projects has delivered a  production release every 6 months and to provide a rationale if  functionality is not being delivered. In addition, we recommended that the  five selected agencies\u2014Defense, DHS, HHS, Transportation, and VA\u2014 update and implement their associated policies. Most agencies agreed  with our recommendation or had no comment. As of September 2017,  Defense, DHS, Transportation, and VA have addressed our  recommendation.", "In February 2015, we added improving the management of IT acquisitions  and operations to our high-risk list, citing a lack of disciplined and  effective management and inconsistent application of best practices to  the successful acquisition of IT projects throughout the federal  government. In particular, we noted the critical importance of  implementing incremental development in order to reduce investment risk  and called on federal agencies to ensure that a minimum of 80 percent of  the government\u2019s major acquisitions deliver functionality at least every 12  months.", "In August 2016, we reported on the status of incremental development  and noted that, for fiscal year 2016, 22 agencies had reported on the IT  Dashboard that 64 percent of their software development projects would  deliver useable functionality every 6 months, as required by OMB.  However, shortcomings in OMB\u2019s guidance\u2014the lack of clarity regarding  the types of projects where incremental development would not apply,  and how the status of these nonsoftware projects should be reported\u2014 affected the accuracy of the data on the IT Dashboard. We therefore  recommended in August 2016 that OMB clarify its existing guidance  regarding what IT investments were and were not subject to requirements  on the use of incremental development and how CIOs should report the  status of projects that were not subject to these requirements. OMB did  not specifically agree or disagree with our recommendation, but stated  that it generally agreed with our report. In April 2017, OMB staff reported  that the agency had taken action and included language to address our  recommendation in its fiscal year 2018 guidance; however, an analysis of  that guidance showed that it still lacked direction on how CIOs are to  report the status of nonsoftware projects.", "In addition, for our August 2016 report, we reviewed seven departments\u2019  guidance and found that only three departments (Commerce, DHS, and  Transportation) had policies and processes to ensure that the CIO would  certify that IT investments were adequately implementing incremental  development in accordance with FITARA.

Two departments concurred with our recommendation, one  department disagreed, and one department did not comment. As of  August 2017, none of the four departments had taken action to address  the recommendation; as discussed later in the report.", "We issued an update to our high-risk report in February 2017 and noted  that, while progress has been made in addressing this high-risk area,  significant work remains to be completed. For example, as of December  2016, OMB and agencies had implemented 366 (or about 46 percent) of  the 803 open recommendations that we had made from fiscal years 2010  through 2015 related to IT acquisitions and operations.

Specifically,  OMB\u2019s fiscal year 2017 capital planning guidance states that certification  of incremental development applies to any investment that is developing  software or services, as noted in its definition of adequate incremental  development. In addition, staff in OMB\u2019s Office of E-Government and  Information Technology stated that a \u201cnot applicable\u201d response to the  question was only acceptable in cases where software development was  not occurring, such as an investment related to infrastructure or  technology refreshment of equipment.", "Staff in the Office of E-Government and Information Technology  acknowledged the need for more meaningful oversight of agencies\u2019 use of  incremental development and stated that, beginning in fiscal year 2018,  OMB will no longer require agencies to report CIO certification information  in their investments\u2019 major IT business cases or on the IT Dashboard.

Treasury officials noted  that they have been shifting staff to meet immediate needs;  augmenting teams with contractors, where possible; and hiring new  staff to fill critical open positions. Nevertheless, the officials said they  have had to slow work on four key projects and delay the launch of  other projects. In addition, the officials stated that they are relying on  contractors more to meet the agency\u2019s staffing needs.", "EPA officials noted that, as the agency transitions from using waterfall  software development approaches to Agile-based approaches, it  needs more skilled staff with experience in Agile development. These  officials stated that the agency\u2019s CIO had taken several actions to  address this challenge, including creating an Office of Digital Services  and Technical Architecture to promote Agile and user-centered  design, establishing a fellowship program to bring outside Agile  experts into the project teams, and creating a blanket purchase  agreement to allow agency project teams to purchase Agile  programming and consulting services.", "According to NRC officials, one of the greatest incremental delivery  challenges has been the difficulty of engaging sufficient business area  product owners and subject matter experts. For example, the officials  explained that, despite product owners\u2019 enthusiasm for increased  engagement with developers, the demands of the agency\u2019s core  mission work presents challenges for these owners in being available  for meetings related to Agile development activities. NRC officials  informed us that the agency had addressed the challenge by working  to establish a predictable, recurring schedule for product owner and  subject matter expert engagement on development projects, where  expectations are communicated to management about time  commitments.", "Further, agency officials from a number of the 14 agencies that  experienced this challenge reported varying approaches to implementing  new incremental development training. For example, Treasury officials  stated that the agency has developed in-house training for existing  developers to meet the needs of its modernized programs. Education  officials noted that the agency identified a select team of IT professionals  within the agency to receive formal training in incremental development  practices. Further, VA officials told us that its Enterprise Program  Management Office is focused on training IT personnel on incremental  development principles. Finally, SSA officials reported that the agency  had launched a training program that had sent hundreds of developers  through a 6-week boot camp program, which included courses in  incremental development and modern coding languages.", "Programs did not receive sufficient funding or received funding later  than needed. Officials from the Office of the CIO at nine agencies (GSA,  NASA, OPM, SSA, State, Treasury, USAID, USDA, and VA) reported  challenges associated with programs not receiving sufficient funding or  not receiving funding until late in the fiscal year. These challenges were a  result of changing funding priorities, budget cuts, and continuing  resolutions, which disrupted delivery schedules and required agencies to  delay, reprioritize, or discontinue the rollout of particular investments or  modernization activities. Agencies reported adopting various approaches  to overcome the challenges in this area, such as delaying project  schedules, developing alternate plans for delivering functionality, and  using flexible contracting strategies. For example:", "USDA officials reported that funding for a number of projects was not  available until late in the fiscal year, which impacted project  schedules. The officials stated that one component agency addressed  the funding delay by adjusting schedule start dates for projects  relative to the current fiscal year, which helped to improve schedule  projections.", "OPM officials told us that they had faced challenges in performing  work on incremental projects due to a lack of available resources  caused by delays in receiving funding. The officials stated that they  addressed this challenge by developing alternate plans to delivering  incremental functionality with a different scope or focus for the  system.", "VA officials reported that they faced challenges with funding IT efforts  that span multiple years. The officials noted that administrative  priorities often change over time, impacting the level of funding  approved in subsequent years to undertake incremental development  projects. To address this, officials noted that they used flexible  contracting strategies\u2014such as options that allow the government to  continue the contract only when funding is assured, adjusting a  contract\u2019s time frames to match a delay, adjusting schedules,  designing contracts so that a vendor is paid based on completion of  measured functionality, and using the change request process to  contribute funding to other projects.", "Treasury officials stated that the lack of a dedicated funding  commitment had led to difficulties in longer-term strategic planning for  IT improvements. The officials stated that resources assigned to  certain IT projects had to be leveraged for legislatively mandated  investments, causing project delays and pauses for these projects. As  a result, the officials reported that the agency had been reviewing  core initiatives and infrastructure programs, such as infrastructure,  hardware, and software refresh and process improvements, to  determine if they can scale back scope or lengthen schedules. The  officials said that at least one program has been formally paused.", "Projects experienced management and organizational challenges  that introduced delays. Officials from the Office of the CIO at seven  agencies (Commerce, Interior, NASA, NRC, NSF, SBA, and  Transportation) reported that management and organizational challenges  had introduced delays in delivering functionality to users. These  challenges included delays in testing and meeting delivery schedules due  to dependencies on other systems or projects and a lack of approved  software or appropriate equipment. Agency officials reported  implementing various approaches to overcome these challenges, such as  addressing external dependencies, tailoring development processes, and  providing waivers for the acquisition of software and hardware. For  example:", "Commerce officials reported that they faced organizational challenges  in meeting scheduled delivery time frames due to delays with another  project that was not ready for testing. In particular, the officials  reported that one of their systems was ready for testing but  experienced delays because the system had an interface with another  system that was not ready for testing. The officials said that the delay  in Commerce\u2019s ability to test its system resulted in missed delivery  milestones. In order to continue development, the project team  separately tested its system without including the interface  functionality.", "NRC officials reported that they had experienced delays in meeting  their incremental projects\u2019 delivery schedules due to dependencies on  multiple complex projects. These officials told us that the agency  addressed these delays by improving existing processes and  implementing a change control board and an enterprise test  development environment.", "SBA officials reported that delays were introduced when the agency  did not have necessary software and hardware available for  development activities. Officials noted that these challenges were a  result of the agency not maintaining an updated inventory of approved  software and developers not having access to laptops needed for  development activities. SBA officials stated that the agency addressed  the lack of approved software and equipment needed for incremental  development by processing a waiver to use software tools and  procuring laptops for the developers.", "Incremental development work was slowed by inefficient  governance and oversight processes. Officials from the Office of the  CIO at six agencies (DHS, HUD, NRC, State, USAID, and USDA)  reported that they had experienced challenges in developing projects  incrementally because they were required to follow agency processes  that were lengthy, inefficient, or not easily adaptable to a more rapid  incremental delivery release schedule. Agency officials also noted that a  lack of understanding among project staff regarding the benefits of  incremental development was a challenge. The officials reported  implementing new guidance and management processes to overcome  these challenges. For example:", "DHS officials reported that inefficient governance and oversight  processes had caused delays in obtaining necessary approvals for  moving projects forward. Specifically, these officials reported that the  agency\u2019s acquisition lifecycle framework did not allow for tailoring any  of its processes to accommodate Agile development. The officials  noted that these challenges were addressed with the publication of  updated lifecycle documents that incorporated incremental  development guidance into the agency\u2019s policies and procedures.", "HUD officials reported that the agency\u2019s internal approval process for  the Privacy Act System of Record Notice did not accommodate  incremental releases. Specifically, the agency\u2019s incremental  development process called for the release of functionality every 60  days, but the agency\u2019s Privacy Office required 90 to 180 days to  complete its approval process. HUD officials reported that the Office  of the CIO is collaborating with the Privacy Office to expedite the  existing approval process, and have proposed that a single system of  record notice be prepared for each incremental development project,  rather than one for each release.", "USAID officials reported that the time needed for defining and  incorporating changes in response to IT security and privacy  standards, processes, and artifacts provided before the system is  granted an Authority to Operate is a challenge. These officials  stated that the Office of the CIO has acquired additional  knowledgeable staff to support projects in the incorporation and  execution of security and privacy requirements.", "State officials reported that applying incremental development  principles to projects has been a challenge because agency  personnel have lacked a clear understanding of the benefits of  incremental development and how to apply incremental concepts to  unique project types. These officials reported that the agency was  updating its guidance and processes to place greater emphasis on the  importance of incremental development, and that the agency had  established a review process to ensure projects plan for implementing  incremental development.", "Project characteristics made rapid delivery of functionality  infeasible or impracticable. Officials from the Office of the CIO at six  agencies (Interior, Justice, Labor, SSA, Transportation, and Treasury)  reported that they believed rapid delivery of functionality was infeasible or  impracticable for projects that addressed human health and safety  concerns, had legislative mandates that established immovable delivery  time frames, were primarily for infrastructure deployment, were updates to  existing systems to address legal or other regulatory changes, or were  updates to legacy systems that utilize old programming languages.  However, none of the agencies identified solutions for these challenges  that enabled them to deliver functionality in the 6-month time frames  required by OMB. For example:", "Transportation officials noted that Federal Aviation Administration  projects, like those for its Next Generation Air Transportation  System, are unique and complex due to safety concerns that impact  the national airspace. As a result, these investments require years of  design, development, and testing, which officials believe precludes  using incremental approaches that must deliver usable functionality  every 6 months.", "Labor officials reported that certain projects, which are initiated in  response to an executive order or other external mandate, come with  required delivery time frames. This results in relatively short  development schedules that do not lend themselves to using an  incremental approach.", "Justice officials reported that several of the agency\u2019s investments  primarily dealt with the deployment of secure telecommunications,  data centers, and other network infrastructure, making it difficult to  translate that delivery into meaningful increments. Justice officials  stated that they did not deploy incremental development because the  projects were infrastructure projects.", "Treasury officials reported that the development and maintenance of  some major investments, such as the agency\u2019s legacy tax systems,  are not conducive to a 6-month delivery schedule due to the number  of modifications that must be made based on changes to the tax laws,  legislative mandates, and other system updates. Treasury officials  stated that the agency has established a mature governance process  for rolling out changes to these tax systems so there is only one  annual update to the systems.", "SSA officials stated that using an incremental software development  approach to modernize the agency\u2019s legacy applications was  challenging because the code for these applications was  unstructured, overly complex, heavily interdependent, and utilized old  programming languages. The officials stated that, in order to  modernize these legacy applications, the project teams had to break  programming changes into useful segments, streamline imbedded  business process requirements, and rewrite the code using modern  programming languages. As a result, the officials stated that these  activities could not, at least initially, deliver functionality in smaller  increments.", "Incremental development schedules were impeded by procurement  delays. Officials from the Office of the CIO at five agencies (Education,  HUD, Interior, OPM, and USDA) reported that they had experienced  challenges with meeting incremental development schedules due to  delays in getting contracts awarded or getting contract modifications  approved. To overcome this challenge, agency officials reported that they  negotiated with vendors and worked with the offices of procurement  within their agencies to reduce delays and ensure all paperwork was  completed in the time frames required. For example:", "Education officials reported that the agency uses contractors to  perform most of its software development work. These officials stated  that modifying existing contracts to require the use of incremental  development approaches had caused delays in getting vendors to  deliver functionality in 6-month increments. Education officials  reported that they had negotiated with vendors to restructure delivery  schedules in order to meet incremental delivery time frames.", "HUD officials reported that they had faced challenges in meeting  project schedules due to delays in getting paperwork approved by the  agency\u2019s procurement office, which was busy with end-of-year  activities. To address this, HUD officials stated that they collaborated  with the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer to ensure the project  teams submitted the required documentation for approval in advance  of the procurement office\u2019s end-of-year activities.", "OPM officials noted that they had faced challenges with adapting their  procurement process to use incremental approaches. The officials  stated that they worked with their Office of Procurement to incorporate  incremental development procurement methodologies in order to  reduce the time from contract initiation to award, as well as to reduce  the amount of contract documentation and its complexity.", "Programs did not have stable, prioritized requirements. Officials from  the Office of the CIO at five agencies (DHS, Justice, NSF, Transportation,  and VA) reported that maintaining stable requirements, including defining  a set of initial requirements, handling ongoing changes, and managing  stakeholder expectations regarding the scope of, and number of changes  to requirements, were challenges. To overcome these challenges,  agencies reported strengthening standards, implementing training and  coaching, and exercising better requirements and business practices. For  example:", "DHS officials stated that managing stakeholder expectations related  to requirements was challenging because product owners and  business users expected project requirements not to change once  they were developed, while development teams had planned for  requirements to change and be reprioritized over the course of the  project since the team was using an incremental approach. These  officials reported that they issued new guidance and offered  assistance and coaching for programs and projects to better identify  and document needs and requirements, while encouraging business  users to plan for and prioritize the backlog of items to be deployed  incrementally.", "Justice officials reported that it was a challenge to finalize the scope  of work for various projects because disparate stakeholders had  competing priorities which led to constant changes in the  requirements. The officials noted that, for one of the agency\u2019s  projects, the project team is currently establishing a process to obtain  consensus on stakeholder priorities in advance. For other projects,  Justice teams have sought or received training from experienced,  certified Agile experts in developing customer requirements.", "NSF officials reported that, when first establishing its incremental  development program, the agency had experienced challenges in  defining a stable set of priority requirements for the initial increments.  The officials told us that, to address this challenge, they elevated  customers to fill the leadership roles of the working groups that  provided the requirements to ensure the requirements of each  increment were well defined and clearly prioritized.", "VA officials reported that, while the agency has transitioned to Agile  development methods over the past several months, it still works  through challenges in developing detailed user stories with its  business partners, and reported many instances when a project was  undertaken without knowing the full scope of requirements. VA  officials reported that they took several actions to help address this  challenge, including introducing a new development methodology to  promote incremental development principles, and establishing an  account management office that works with business partners to  ensure detailed business cases are prepared prior to approval. They  also integrated more rapid prototyping into the planning stages as a  way to gather requirements and test assumptions early and cheaply.", "Organizational changes associated with the transition from a  traditional software methodology to an incremental development  methodology require time and resources. Officials from the Office of  the CIO at three agencies (EPA, GSA, and Labor) independently reported  challenges related to organizational changes, such as staff adapting to  the culture shift from being business customers to taking on a more active  role as product owners and project managers in the software  development process. For example:", "EPA officials stated that the agency had experienced challenges as  staff transitioned from using waterfall development practices to Agile  practices because there had been skepticism within the agency on  whether an Agile approach could meet the requirements for agency  systems. The officials stated that the CIO had established an office to  provide support to project teams that needed assistance in adopting  Agile approaches, created a community of practice group, and  developed guides and other maturity models to provide guidance on  the adoption of Agile methodologies.", "GSA officials explained that implementing incremental delivery has  required a culture shift for the agency\u2019s business customers who were  accustomed to having a different set of roles and responsibilities in  the traditional software development process than what is used in the  incremental development process. The officials stated that they have  worked to train their customers to better capture the vision of what  needs to be built and to be more active product owners and managers  in communicating with the development team. As a result, the officials  in the GSA Office of the CIO stated that they are enabling the  business customers to serve as better product owners. The officials  further stated that, by implementing this change, project staffs have  (1) defined and prioritized clearer requirements; (2) selected the  proper technical tools to support business needs; (3) worked with the  contracting office to develop better-defined contracting documents  and make contract awards; (4) identified dependencies associated  with development efforts; and (5) provided transparency on what work  has been completed, what work is planned, and the challenges  associated with the investments.", "Additionally, three agencies (Defense, Energy, and HHS) reported no  challenges with implementing incremental development. However,  officials from all three agencies discussed issues surrounding the use of  incremental development, both as part of this review and as part of our  prior work. In particular, Energy officials had told us that they had  projects that failed to adequately employ incremental development  practices, which required follow-up with program managers to identify  corrective actions. Also, both Defense and HHS officials have reported  facing management and organizational challenges, such as  dependencies on integrating changes with other systems, which impacted  the delivery of functionality every 6 months. Defense officials noted that  many of the agency\u2019s investments were complex and could not adhere to  a 6-month delivery schedule.", "Federal investments may continue to encounter increased cost and  schedule risks if agencies cannot adequately implement incremental  development approaches.

For  example, Energy, GSA, and SBA officials stated that they review projects  not using adequate incremental development in order to identify  necessary corrective actions, such as: (1) breaking out projects into  shorter duration activities; (2) implementing the use of investment  reviews, whereby funds are released incrementally upon completion of  clear success criteria; (3) developing major IT investment business cases  that outline project plans for incremental development; and (4) monitoring  new and existing investments to ensure delivery of capabilities within  schedule and cost thresholds.", "In addition, DHS, NASA, NRC, and SSA officials reported that the CIO  uses the information to make corrections to projects that are not  adequately implementing incremental development through such actions  as the CIO\u2019s office: (1) working with project team officials to convert  project activities to an incremental approach; (2) requiring any deviations  from approved releases of software development products to be  approved by the CIO; (3) requiring projects that deviate from the use of  adequate incremental development principles to be approved by the CIO;  and (4) determining which investments must use incremental  development, and requiring the projects to do so.", "Provide oversight of IT investments. Officials from the Office of the  CIO at seven agencies (Commerce, Interior, Labor, OPM, NSF, State,  and VA) stated that they use the information to provide oversight of IT  investments. In particular, Interior and NSF officials reported that their  CIOs use the information obtained during the performance measurement  baseline approval process to make decisions regarding the agency\u2019s  major IT investments. For Interior, officials stated that the types of  decisions the CIO may make include, but are not limited to, accelerating  delivery, reducing scope, or halting or terminating an IT project. For NSF,  officials stated that the decisions could result in changes to program  objectives or scope of individual projects under the program, redirection  of resources, changes to planned levels of expenditure, or  recommendations for corrective actions based on the evaluation.", "In addition, Commerce officials stated that investment data are reviewed  by the CIO on a monthly basis and, based on the status, can undergo  further scrutiny at a review board meeting or other CIO review process.

Second, the officials stated that  the NSF CIO is actively involved in the investment review process and did  not feel a policy was needed to describe these activities. Third, NSF  officials stated that it is their belief that policies are generally only required  to correct something which is not working. Lastly, NSF officials stated that  the agency\u2019s definition of an Agile sprint was its definition of incremental  development.

For example, EPA  officials stated that the agency has been focusing on standing up the  programs and structures needed to support incremental development  and, thus, had not prioritized developing a policy. In addition, EPA  officials stated that they had not developed a definition of functionality or  time frames, but that their guidance points to industry standards.", "SBA officials stated that, since the majority of the agency\u2019s investments  were in operations and maintenance, they did not see the need to have  policies or procedures for incremental development. In addition, HUD,  NASA, and USAID officials reported that their agencies were in the  process of finalizing policies, but had experienced delays due to the  number of stakeholder comments or limited staff resources.", "Lastly, Defense officials stated that they had included information in their  fiscal year 2018 budget submission guidance for component CIOs to  certify adequate incremental development and were working to  incorporate this process into their Financial Management Regulations,  which were to be finalized in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. However,  the officials stated that the agency\u2019s process is driven by its efforts to  comply with whatever process OMB requires in the annual capital  planning guidance and, thus, they would not have a separate certification  policy from the budget guidance.", "Additionally, Defense officials reported that, for their agency\u2019s  investments, delivery every 12 to 18 months was more appropriate than  the 6 months that OMB requires. Nevertheless, while Defense officials  may believe that 12 to 18 month delivery cycles may be more appropriate  for their work, OMB\u2019s guidance requires agencies to deliver functionality  at least every 6 months and does not allow for exceptions. We previously  recommended that Defense establish a policy on the CIO certification of  incremental development. Until this guidance is finalized, Defense may  not be able to ensure incremental development practices are adequately  implemented at the agency. We therefore continue to believe the  recommendation is appropriate.", "Annual CIO certification of incremental development is critical to ensuring  that agency CIOs exercise the proper authority and oversight over their  agencies\u2019 major IT investments. Having appropriate authority and  oversight helps to create IT systems that add value and are aligned with  agencies\u2019 missions, while reducing the risks associated with low-value  and wasteful investments. In the absence of clearly defined policies,  agencies continue to run the risk of failing to deliver major investments in  a cost-effective and efficient manner.", "We have previously made recommendations to Defense, Education,  HHS, and Treasury to establish CIO certification policies, but as noted in  this report, these agencies still have not yet finalized their guidance to  clearly detail their agencies\u2019 processes for certification. Therefore, we  continue to believe these recommendations are appropriate.", "Agencies that lacked finalized policies may not be able to meet their  reported time frames for finalizing their certification policies, since agency  officials have noted that their approval processes are quite lengthy, and in  some cases, the proposed dates for completion have changed several  times. In addition, several policies were still being developed. Therefore,  we cannot be assured that these documents will fully address the areas  we noted. Until the 20 agencies update or finalize processes and policies  for CIO certification, including defining the role of the CIO in the process,  describing how certification will be documented, and including definitions  of incremental development and delivery time frames consistent with  OMB guidance, they will not be able to fully ensure adequate  implementation of, or benefit from, incremental development practices.

However, since  the law was enacted in December 2014, OMB has taken three different  approaches to address this reporting requirement. Of the approaches,  one did not clearly and consistently provide agencies with the direction  needed to effectively implement this important provision and report the  status of certification.", "As previously noted, OMB\u2019s fiscal year 2017 IT capital planning  guidance (issued in June 2015) required each major IT investment to  respond to a question in the associated major IT business case regarding  whether the CIO certified the adequate implementation of incremental  development with either a yes, no, or not applicable. This reporting  approach required that agency CIOs provide an explicit statement  regarding the certification of adequate implementation of incremental  development for each major IT investment. Further, this approach allowed  for the status of CIO certification of each investment to be publicly  reported on the IT Dashboard via the investment\u2019s major IT business  case.", "However, OMB\u2019s capital planning guidance for fiscal year 2018 (issued  in June 2016) lacked clarity regarding how agencies were to address the  requirement certifying adequate incremental development. While the  2018 guidance states that agency CIOs are to provide the certifications  needed to demonstrate compliance with FITARA, there is no specific  reference to the provision requiring CIO certification of adequate  incremental development. As a result of this change, OMB placed the  burden on agencies to know and understand how to demonstrate  compliance with FITARA\u2019s incremental development provision. Further,  because of the lack of clarity in the guidance as to what agencies were to  provide, OMB could not demonstrate how the fiscal year 2018 guidance  ensured that agencies provided the certifications specifically called for in  the law.", "OMB staff explained that the changes to the fiscal year 2018 capital  planning guidance were made with the intent to rely on agencies\u2019 reported  responses on the IT Dashboard regarding the use of incremental  development by an investment\u2019s projects, rather than relying on an  agency\u2019s response to the yes, no, or not applicable question about the  status of an investment\u2019s certification of incremental development.", "Providing a clear and consistent approach for agencies to follow in  reporting the status of certification is critical to ensure that agencies are  able to comply with this key FITARA provision and to ensure that CIOs  are held accountable for the performance of their major IT investments.  OMB staff from the Office of E-Government and Information Technology  stated that the fiscal year 2019 guidance would be responsive to the  issues we raised.", "Accordingly, in August 2017, OMB issued its fiscal year 2019 guidance,  which addressed the weaknesses we identified in the previous fiscal  year\u2019s guidance. Specifically, the revised guidance requires agency CIOs  to make an explicit statement regarding the extent to which the CIO is  able to certify the use of incremental development, and to include a copy  of that statement in the agency\u2019s public congressional budget justification  materials. As part of the statement, an agency CIO must also identify  which specific bureaus or offices are using incremental development on  all of their investments.", "Agency CIO certification of the use of adequate incremental development  for major IT investments is critical to ensuring that agencies are making  the best effort possible to create IT systems that add value while reducing  the risks associated with low-value and wasteful investments.

However, a number of responses  for agency investments were incorrectly reported and it will be critical that  agencies continue to improve the accuracy of investment data reported  on the IT Dashboard. While we have previously made recommendations  to numerous agencies to improve the accuracy of reporting on the IT  Dashboard, issues with reporting remain, reinforcing the need for  agencies to ensure that accurate data are made available for the  oversight and management of their investments.", "In addition, while OMB issued guidance in June 2015, requiring agency  CIOs to define policies and processes for CIO certification, as of August  2017, only 4 of 24 agencies had established policies that clearly define  these processes. At this point, over 2 years since the law\u2019s enactment, it  is critical that agencies take action to put in place appropriate incremental  certification polices to ensure CIOs exercise the proper authority and  oversight over major IT investments, as required by law. Otherwise,  agencies run the risk of not realizing the benefits of incremental  development, as well as not implementing FITARA\u2019s requirement for  incremental development. While we previously made recommendations to  Defense, Education, HHS, and Treasury to establish CIO certification  policies, these agencies have still not yet finalized their guidance, and  therefore, we continue to believe these recommendations are  appropriate.", "Further, OMB has taken three different approaches to addressing  FITARA\u2019s reporting requirement for CIO certification and one did not  clearly and consistently provide agencies with the direction needed to  effectively implement this important provision and report the status of  certification.

This also helped Congress in its oversight of  agencies\u2019 FITARA compliance. In contrast, OMB\u2019s fiscal year 2018 capital  planning guidance was a step backward, and OMB could not demonstrate  how the guidance ensured that agencies provided the certifications  specifically called for in the law.

Specifically, OMB stated that our  report\u2019s \u201cfocus on the use of the term \u2018certification\u2019 was confusing in  that  appears to reference the term \u2018certify\u2019 [found in the  FITARA provision on the adequate use of incremental development],  and also seems to be a reference to the requirement that CIOs  \u2018approve\u2019 and define development processes.\u201d", "In our report, we discuss FITARA\u2019s requirement that OMB annually  issue capital planning guidance requiring agency CIOs to certify that  IT investments are adequately implementing incremental  development. We analyzed the guidance that OMB has issued to  meet this requirement over the past 3 years, and we evaluated  agencies\u2019 progress in implementing that guidance. In doing so, we  noted that OMB had also issued supplementary FITARA  implementation guidance in June 2015 that required agencies to  define policies and processes to ensure that the CIO certifies that IT  resources are adequately implementing incremental development.  Throughout our discussion, we clearly delineate between the  incremental development certification provided to OMB by an  agency\u2019s CIO and the agency\u2019s policies and processes that support  and inform that certification. As such, we believe we have used the  term \u201ccertification\u201d appropriately and consistently throughout our  report.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the  Secretaries and agency heads of the departments and agencies in this  report, and other interested parties.

We chose this date because it was the  final day updated fiscal year 2017 data from the agencies would be  publicly available until the release of the President\u2019s fiscal year 2018  budget submission.", "Initially, we analyzed the fiscal year 2017 data of major IT software  development investments that were planning to allocate at least 50  percent of their funding to development, modernization, and  enhancement activities. We then reviewed agency responses to the  question regarding CIO certification of adequate incremental development and eliminated any investment where the agency\u2019s rationale for choosing  \u201cnot applicable\u201d was due to the investment not undertaking software  development activities. In doing so, we identified a total of 166  investments from 21 agencies. Three agencies (National Aeronautics and  Space Administration, National Science Foundation, and U.S. Nuclear  Regulatory Commission) out of the 24 in our review did not have any  investments that met these criteria for fiscal year 2017. For the 21  agencies with major IT investments to review, we then determined the  total number of investments that agencies reported were certified by the  CIO for adequate incremental development. We also reviewed and  summarized agency responses reported on the IT Dashboard for  investments that did not have CIO certification.", "To help determine the reliability of the reported agency CIO certification  data on the IT Dashboard, we presented the results of our analysis of CIO  certification responses to officials from each agency\u2019s Office of the CIO  that were involved in investment management and software development  activities and solicited their input and explanations for the results. Two  agencies each provided an update on one of their investments, which we  have incorporated as appropriate. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of this report.", "In order to identify the challenges impacting the agencies\u2019 incremental  delivery of functionality, we developed a list of common challenges based  on our prior work, in which eight agencies reported that the following eight  challenges inhibited their delivery of functionality:  1.  project staff were over-utilized or lacked the necessary skills and  2.  programs did not receive sufficient funding or received funding later  3.  projects experienced management and organizational challenges that  introduced delays;  4.  development work was slowed by inefficient governance and  5.  project characteristics made rapid delivery of functionality infeasible or  6.  development schedules were impeded by procurement delays;  7.  programs did not have stable, prioritized requirements; and  8.  incremental development was impeded by select technologies.", "We sent the list of challenges to each of the 24 agencies and asked  officials from the Office of the CIO at each agency involved with  investment management and software development activities to identify  their top three challenges from this list that impacted their ability to deliver  incremental functionality for major IT investments. We also asked agency  officials to identify any challenges that were not included in the list, but  which were also among their top three challenges. Finally, we asked  agencies to explain what actions were taken to address the reported  challenges and describe the extent to which the challenges were  overcome.", "Because of the open-ended nature of the agencies\u2019 responses to our  questions, we conducted a content analysis of the information we  received in order to identify common challenges that impact agencies\u2019  ability to deliver incremental functionality. In doing so, team members  individually reviewed the challenges reported by agencies and assigned  them to various categories. Team members then compared  categorization schemes, discussed the differences, and reached  agreement on the final list of challenges by totaling the number of times  each challenge was mentioned. For those challenges that were prompted  by the list we provided to agencies, we reported challenges that were  identified by five or more agencies. Three agencies also identified a new  challenge that was not on our list, which we reported due to the number  of agencies reporting it as a challenge. Three of the 24 agencies in our  review (Departments of Defense, Energy, and Health and Human  Services) reported that they had no challenges with implementing  incremental development.", "We also asked the agencies in our review how the CIO utilized the  information obtained during the process of certifying investments\u2019  adequate incremental development to make decisions regarding the  agency\u2019s major IT investments. Because of the wide variety of responses  we received from agencies, we conducted a content analysis of the  information in order to identify ways the CIOs used the information. In  doing so, team members individually reviewed agencies\u2019 responses and  assigned them to various categories. Team members then compared  their categorization schemes, discussed the differences, and reached  agreement on the final characterization of ways in which agencies  benefited from the certification process.", "For our second objective, we analyzed the 24 agencies\u2019 policies and  processes governing the CIO certification of adequate incremental  development to determine whether those policies and processes were  consistent with FITARA. The provision states that OMB is to require in its  annual IT capital planning guidance that agency CIOs covered by the law  certify that IT investments are adequately implementing incremental  development. To assess this, we reviewed guidance issued by OMB on  the implementation of FITARA, and assessed agencies\u2019 documentation  of incremental development certification policies and processes against  GAO\u2019s IT investment management framework. This framework states  that an organization\u2019s policies and procedures should be clearly defined,  in that they provide details regarding the role of appropriate stakeholders  and the artifacts to document decisions made.", "Because of the wide variety of responses and documents we received  from agencies related to their incremental development certification  processes, we conducted a content analysis of the information in order to  determine compliance with OMB\u2019s guidance. In doing so, team members  individually reviewed agencies\u2019 responses and documents and assigned  them to various categories and sub-categories. Team members then  compared their categorization schemes, discussed the differences, and  reached agreement on the final characterization of compliance with OMB  guidance. In cases where agencies provided multiple policies or  documents, we followed up to clarify which portions were considered by  the agency to support the CIO certification requirement.", "In analyzing whether the agencies\u2019 policies on CIO certification met  FITARA, OMB, and GAO criteria, we assessed whether the policies  clearly defined the role of the CIO in the certification of adequate  incremental development, and described how CIO certification was  documented. We also reviewed agencies\u2019 incremental development  policies and processes to identify the agencies\u2019 definitions of incremental  development and time frames for delivering functionality to determine  whether they were consistent with OMB guidance. Agencies found to not  have a policy where the CIO process was clearly defined were evaluated  as such for one of two reasons: either the agency\u2019s formal policy did not  completely address our assessment criteria or the agency\u2019s policy had  not yet been finalized. For agencies that told us they had not yet finalized  a policy for certification, we asked them to explain the process, if any,  used by the agency to certify major IT investments for fiscal year 2017. In  addition, we interviewed staff from OMB\u2019s Office of E-Government and  Information Technology regarding its guidance to agencies related to  FITARA\u2019s incremental development certification provision.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2016 to November 2017  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
