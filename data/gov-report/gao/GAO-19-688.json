Due to an aging population more beneficiaries may need organizational payees in the future. These beneficiaries are among the most vulnerable because, in addition to being deemed incapable of managing their own benefits, they lack family or another responsible party to assume this responsibility. SSA reports that misuse of benefits by payees is rare, but its Office of Inspector General has identified cases of misuse that have harmed vulnerable beneficiaries. GAO was asked to review SSA's organizational payee program.", "This review examines, among other things SSA's process for approving payees and its monitoring efforts. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, policies, and guidance; analyzed SSA data from fiscal year 2018; analyzed the predictive statistical model SSA uses to select low-volume payees for on-site reviews; and interviewed SSA central office staff and regional, area, and field office staff in four regions selected for geographic diversity."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Social Security Administration (SSA) approves organizational payees\u2014such as nursing homes or non-profits that manage the Social Security benefits of individuals unable to do so on their own\u2014by assessing a range of suitability factors, such as whether the organizations have adequate staff to manage benefits for multiple individuals. However, GAO found that SSA's policy does not specify how to assess more complex suitability factors, such as whether an organization demonstrates sound financial management. Without clearer guidance, unqualified or ill-prepared organizational payees could be approved to manage benefits. Also, SSA does not currently require background checks for key employees of an organizational payee. In contrast, SSA requires background checks for individual payees\u2014such as a relative or friend of the beneficiary. A comprehensive evaluation could help SSA determine whether and how to expand their use of background checks to organizational payees.", "To ensure organizational payees are managing funds appropriately, SSA uses several monitoring tools, including resource-intensive onsite reviews. Certain organizational payees, such as those that charge fees for their services or have 50 or more beneficiaries (high-volume), receive onsite reviews every 3 to 4-years. In contrast, payees that serve fewer than 50 beneficiaries (low-volume)\u2014the vast majority\u2014are selected for review based on their estimated likelihood of misusing beneficiary funds, and a relatively low percent of them receive onsite reviews (see figure). SSA uses a predictive statistical model to identify higher risk low-volume payees, but the model's effectiveness cannot be fully assessed by GAO or others due to missing documentation on how it was designed. SSA officials said they will update the model in the future, but do not have a time frame for doing so. Establishing such a time frame and documenting design decisions are key steps toward assessing the model's effectiveness.", "Another way SSA oversees organizational payees is by reviewing their annual accounting forms, but shortcomings exist in SSA's review of the form and in the form's content and design. For example, SSA lacks timeframes for following up on missing or problematic forms. Also, the accounting form does not capture complete information on whether payees co-mingle beneficiaries' funds in collective accounts, which can limit SSA's ability to monitor those risk-prone accounts. Establishing timeframes and revising the form could enhance the effectiveness of the annual accounting form as an oversight tool."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making nine recommendations in this report, including that SSA: clarify how to assess complex suitability factors; assess requiring background checks for organizational payees; establish a timeframe for reviewing the predictive model and document design decisions resulting from that review; and establish timeframes for, and conduct revisions of the accounting form. SSA agreed with all nine recommendations and provided technical comments that GAO incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2018, the Social Security Administration (SSA) paid over $1  trillion in retirement and disability benefits to over 67 million individuals.  Due to age or disability, some of these individuals are unable to manage  their benefits on their own or to direct someone else to manage them, so  SSA may assign a representative payee to do this for them. Generally,  when a family member or friend is not available to serve as the  representative payee, SSA allows certain organizations\u2014such as  community-based non-profit social service agencies; nursing homes; or  government agencies\u2014to serve this role. In 2018, SSA reported that  33,197 organizational representative payees served approximately  952,000 beneficiaries. The number of beneficiaries needing  organizational payees\u2014who are particularly vulnerable among  represented beneficiaries because they lack family or friends to manage  their benefits in order to meet their most basic needs\u2014could swell in the  coming years as the large generation of baby boomers retires and people  live longer. SSA generally relies on its network of field offices throughout  the country to approve and communicate with representative payees.", "Although SSA reporting shows that misuse of benefits by organizational  payees is rare, SSA\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) has reported that  some cases of misuse and ill treatment by these organizations have  resulted in significant harm to the vulnerable beneficiaries they are  supposed to protect. For example, SSA\u2019s OIG testified in 2017 that the  owner of an organizational payee had used beneficiary funds to purchase  properties and for the business\u2019 use, while at the same time many  beneficiaries the organizational payee served were living in poor  conditions or homeless. In light of the important role organizational  payees play in ensuring that basic needs of vulnerable SSA beneficiaries  are met, you asked us to review SSA\u2019s organizational payee program.  This report examines how SSA: (1) approves organizations to be  representative payees, (2) communicates with organizational payees, and  (3) oversees these organizations.", "To address all three objectives, we reviewed relevant federal laws and  regulations and SSA policies and guidance. We also interviewed SSA  officials in its central office and staff in four regional offices that we  selected to reflect a range in the number of states and organizational  payees they collectively oversee, and to represent a range of geographic  locations. Within those regions, we interviewed staff at four area offices  and a total of eight field offices (in seven states) that were selected to  include both metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas. These interviews  with regional, area, and field office staff are intended to obtain  perspectives from SSA officials in different parts of the country and are  not intended to be representative of all SSA field offices or field office  staff. We also analyzed program data, including the number and type of  organizational payees and the number of beneficiaries they serve. We  assessed the reliability of these data by reviewing relevant documentation  and interviewing SSA staff knowledgeable about the systems used to  collect and maintain the data, and we determined the data were  sufficiently reliable for our use.", "To obtain overall perspectives on the program, we interviewed staff of the  Social Security Advisory Board, representatives of an SSA managers\u2019  association, and an organizational payee association. In addition, we  interviewed representatives of advocacy groups for the aged, persons  with physical disabilities, and persons with mental illness regarding their  constituents\u2019 experiences with SSA\u2019s organizational payee program.", "To determine how organizations are approved to be representative  payees, in addition to interviewing officials at each field office we visited  about their role in the application process, we reviewed information SSA  maintained for up to six organizational payees at each visited field office,  where available. Specifically, at each visited field office we reviewed up to  two applications that SSA approved and up to two that SSA denied within  the last 5 years. At each visited field office we also reviewed files for up to  two organizational payees that closed or were terminated within the last 5  years. We selected the most recent approval, denial, and termination files  that were available.", "To understand how SSA communicates with organizational payees, we  reviewed program guidance and visited eight organizational payees\u2014one  in the local area of each field office we visited. We also interviewed SSA  officials at the central office and at the four regional and area offices.", "To review SSA\u2019s oversight of organizational payees\u2014including onsite  reviews and other monitoring tools\u2014we reviewed program guidance and  interviewed SSA officials at its central office and the four regional and  area offices. The onsite review process changed in 2018, when  legislation was enacted requiring SSA to award annual grants to state  protection and advocacy systems to conduct onsite reviews of  representative payees. To understand SSA\u2019s new onsite review process,  we reviewed agency documents that describe the roles and  responsibilities of key players in the new process and interviewed SSA  officials and representatives of the National Disability Rights Network  about the status of its implementation. However, we did not assess the  efficacy of the new onsite review process because we determined it was  too early in its implementation. We analyzed the predictive model SSA  uses to select low-volume organizational payees for onsite reviews by  reviewing available documentation on its development and interviewing  SSA officials.", "To determine the extent to which organizational payees are reviewed and  the outcomes of those reviews, we analyzed fiscal year 2018 program  data from SSA and reviewed SSA\u2019s annual reports to Congress. To learn  how frequently organizational payees closed or were terminated, we  obtained data from SSA. We determined SSA data used in this report\u2014 including the extent of onsite reviews conducted by organizational payee  type, the number of organizational payee terminations, and outcomes  reported to Congress\u2014were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.

SSA considers it  acceptable if the funds are used for the beneficiary\u2019s current  maintenance, which includes the costs of food, shelter, clothing, and  medical care. After the representative payee has used the funds  consistent with these guidelines, any remaining amounts must be  conserved or invested on behalf of the beneficiary.", "Organizational payees are responsible for keeping records of SSA  payments made to them on behalf of each beneficiary and the  expenditures for each beneficiary. All organizational payees participate in  onsite reviews and\u2014except for state mental institutions participating in  State Onsite reviews\u2014are also required to file an annual accounting form  to show how benefit payments were used and any amounts that were  saved. Organizational payees also are required to notify SSA of certain  changes or situations, including:  changes that may affect the beneficiary\u2019s eligibility for benefits or the  benefit amounts, such as when the beneficiary, or the beneficiary\u2019s  spouse, dies; and when the beneficiary moves or is unable to be  contacted or located, starts or stops working, or no longer needs a  payee; when organizational payees learn that one or more of their employees  has stolen a beneficiary\u2019s funds or determines they can no longer  serve as the payee for any reason; and when payees establish an account that mingles funds from multiple  beneficiaries in one account\u2014referred to as collective accounts\u2014 because these accounts must be approved before use.", "The process for administering the representative payee program is  guided largely by requirements in statute and SSA regulations, which  SSA communicates through its Program Operations Manual System  (POMS). Recent changes to the program\u2014including the new onsite  review process\u2014reflect requirements established by the Strengthening  Protections for Social Security Beneficiaries Act of 2018. For example,  the Commissioner of SSA must now: (1) reassess representative payee  selection and replacement policies, (2) award annual grants (totaling at  least $25 million nationwide) to each state\u2019s protection and advocacy  system to conduct onsite reviews of representative payees, and (3)  award annual grants to a national association that can provide state  protection and advocacy systems with training, technical assistance, and  administrative oversight.

Field offices review and approve organizations\u2019  applications to become representative payees, serve as the point of  contact when organizations report changes to beneficiary or organization  information, and play a role in monitoring and overseeing representative  payees.", "SSA policy describes the required process for designating a  representative payee for a beneficiary whom SSA staff have determined  to be incapable of managing his or her benefits. First, organizations  apply to serve as a payee for specific individuals. Second, SSA staff  review applications to assess if the organization is qualified to serve as a  payee and is the most suitable payee for the individual beneficiary.  Additional qualifications are assessed when organizations apply to collect  fees for their payee services. For example, SSA requires that all fee-for- service applicants have already served at least five beneficiaries for a full  calendar month or more, and that non-governmental agencies be  licensed and bonded.", "Once approved, organizational payees are subject to ongoing SSA  oversight. SSA reviews annual accounting forms from organizational  payees on each of the beneficiaries they represent. The accounting  forms are used to monitor how the payee spent or saved benefits on  behalf of the beneficiary; identify situations where payment to a payee  may no longer be appropriate; or determine if the payee is no longer  suitable. In addition to reviewing accounting forms annually, every 3 years  SSA must review collective accounts established by organizational  payees.", "Whether or not additional oversight in the form of an onsite review is  provided, and the frequency of that oversight, generally depends on the  organizations\u2019 characteristics (see table 1). Certain types of  organizational payees\u2014such as high-volume, fee-for-service, and some  state mental institutions\u2014receive onsite reviews every 3 or 4 years. Low- volume organizational payees do not receive periodic reviews; rather SSA  selects some of these payees for onsite reviews based on their likelihood  of misusing beneficiaries\u2019 funds and may target additional organizational  payees because of an event that raises a question about the payee\u2019s  performance or suitability or because a protection and advocacy grantee  thinks that a review is warranted. SSA\u2019s purpose in conducting onsite  reviews is to: (1) ensure organizational payees perform their duties  satisfactorily, (2) deter misuse, (3) keep lines of communication open  between the organizational payee and the servicing field office, (4)  reinforce to the organizational payee their duties and responsibilities, and  (5) proactively address the needs of organizational payees."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Gaps in the Organizational Payee Approval Process Introduce Risks", "paragraphs": ["We identified several gaps in SSA\u2019s process for approving organizational  payees, including insufficient detail in SSA\u2019s policies, insufficient  documentation of suitability decisions, and absence of background or  credit checks on most organizational payees\u2014gaps that may increase the  risk of approving an unsuitable payee.

Organizations are generally  evaluated on the same suitability factors, whether they are a first-time  applicant, or applying to serve an additional beneficiary. Additional  requirements apply to organizations applying to collect fees (see  appendix II).", "Two factors used to determine the suitability of organizations that are  applying to be representative payees are straight-forward: (1) whether the  payee agrees to receive benefits via direct deposit and (2) whether the  payee uses protected accounts for beneficiary funds. However, other  suitability factors are more complex, such as whether the applicant: demonstrates sound financial management policies (i.e., has a history  of being current in its own financial obligations), demonstrates effective internal communication (i.e., good  communication between case management and financial  management components), has adequate recordkeeping systems to ensure that the client\u2019s needs  are met and benefits are properly administered.", "We found that SSA\u2019s policies on how to evaluate more complex issues do  not provide sufficient detail to ensure staff can fully assess an  organization\u2019s suitability. Staff at one of the eight field offices we visited  told us the policies can leave room for interpretation, and staff at three  field offices use additional guidance developed by field and regional  offices that elaborates on how to assess some of the more complex  issues in SSA\u2019s policies. For example, SSA\u2019s policy on what constitutes  sound financial management states that an organization should have a  history of being current in its own financial obligations. However, it  generally does not provide direction on how to verify that an organization  meets that requirement. Moreover, the policy lacks details on what staff  should do to conduct a deeper assessment of an organization\u2019s financial  management practices if they think further assessment is warranted.", "Similarly, SSA policy directs staff to consider whether an organization has  effective internal communication, which it defines as good communication  between the organization\u2019s case management and financial management  components. However, SSA\u2019s policy does not specify what actions  constitute effective communication, such as the frequency and method of  communication, type of information to be shared, and time frames for  transmitting information. According to federal internal control standards,  agencies should establish policies to document responsibilities for a  process\u2019s objectives and related risks and communicate these policies to  personnel so they can fulfill their assigned responsibilities. Although  SSA officials were able to point us to sections of agency policy that went  into more detail about some of these complex topics, these policies  pertain only to the few organizations that are applying to collect fees. In  the absence of specific guidance on how to consider factors when  assessing the suitability of all organizational payee applicants, SSA staff  may be approving some of them without a complete picture of their  financial health and ability to be good stewards of vulnerable  beneficiaries\u2019 money.", "According to central office officials, regions are generally given leeway to  create their own supplemental guidance documents based on SSA policy  to assist with training\u2014documents that may also serve as resources to  help staff interpret SSA policy. Officials in field and area offices told us  this supplemental guidance is generally made available to staff on internal  websites maintained by area or regional offices. Staff in three field offices  told us they use supplemental guidance to evaluate organizations. For  example, staff in one field office told us they use a supplemental list of  questions to interview organizational payee applicants. These  supplemental interview questions address some suitability factors in  greater detail than SSA policy. For example:", "SSA policy directs staff to consider whether the organization \u201chas  adequate staff and resources to serve its clients.\u201d The supplemental  guidance from a regional office includes five questions on the number,  type, relationships, and responsibilities of the staff; training and skills  of staff dealing with finances; and documentation.", "SSA policy directs staff to consider whether the organization \u201chas  adequate recordkeeping systems to ensure that the client\u2019s needs are  met and benefits are properly administered.\u201d The supplemental  guidance from a regional office includes nine questions on the  systems, records, procedures, and safeguards related to  recordkeeping.", "Staff in another field office told us they created a desk guide on a range of  topics related to individual and organizational payees that includes  supplemental guidance documents and excerpts from SSA policy. The  desk guide is a reference for all employees that work on payee issues  and is also used to train new employees.", "However, SSA lacks a process to ensure that supplemental guidance is  reviewed for compliance at the national level and that such guidance is  updated by the regional office in a timely manner. Officials told us that  because all regions are expected to follow SSA policy, central office staff  only review supplemental guidance when the regions request it.  Furthermore, SSA central office officials told us that although there is a  protocol for communicating policy updates to regional, area, and field  office staff, it is up to regions to refresh their own guidance. These  officials did not know how long it takes regions to incorporate policy  changes into regional guidance documents. As a result, field offices may  be using supplemental guidance that has not been updated to reflect  policy changes. For example, in a desk guide we reviewed, we identified  a policy excerpt that was not the most recent version of that policy.  Federal internal control standards stipulate that management should  periodically review policies and procedures for continued relevance and  effectiveness. Without processes to ensure that supplemental guidance  documents are reviewed for compliance or updated in a timely manner  when policy changes, decisions to approve organizational payees may be  made inconsistently across different regions and field offices.", "SSA officials told us in May 2019 that they are currently reevaluating the  agency\u2019s representative payee approval policies and procedures based  on feedback gathered through a forum hosted in September 2018 by the  Social Security Advisory Board and in response to a Federal Register  notice published in December 2018.

Specifically, of the 21 first-time application files we reviewed, 16  did not contain a note about the organization\u2019s suitability. Of the five  files that did contain such notes, three provided limited detail.

However, notes in these two approved applications did not include  any details regarding the prospective payee\u2019s suitability, such as  information about the facility or organization itself. Moreover, in two cases  where the payee was a creditor for the beneficiary, we found that SSA  staff had not documented why they approved these payees even though  they were creditors for the beneficiary. Applicants who are creditors for  beneficiaries are generally prohibited from serving as payees.

As previously noted, staff use  eRPS notes to document their assessment of: the beneficiary\u2019s capability, the payee applicant\u2019s suitability, and, in some cases, the beneficiary- payee relationship. However, while eRPS prevents field office staff from  approving a payee without first documenting their assessment of a  beneficiary\u2019s capability in a note, this automated safeguard does not  extend to the other note type. According to federal internal control  standards, agencies should clearly document significant events so that  that they are available for examination, and design their information  systems to obtain and process information that responds to the agency\u2019s  objectives and risks. Because eRPS allows SSA staff to approve a  payee without fully documenting the decision, SSA staff may not be able  to reference that information to inform future decisions about the  organizational payee. Specifically, SSA staff will not be as well-prepared  to make fully informed decisions about an organizational payee\u2019s  continuing eligibility, or whether the organizational payee should be  approved to manage benefits for additional vulnerable beneficiaries.

Staff at one field office said  that, for the only organizational payee that closed in the last several  years, they were involved in finding replacement payees for affected  beneficiaries before they terminated the organizational payee. However,  staff from two field offices told us that SSA is not always involved in  finding new payees. For example, staff at one of these field offices said  that when the state closed a nursing home in their jurisdiction, it was state  officials and not SSA who found new facilities for affected beneficiaries.  When these new facilities applied to serve as payee for their new  residents, SSA processed the applications (see sidebar). Staff at another  field office told us that before closing, some organizational payees  identified prospective payees for affected beneficiaries. In those cases,  payee staff submitted proposed payee changes to SSA, and SSA told  these prospective payees they must file an application to become the  approved payee. Officials in SSA\u2019s central office told us that staff  determine if the applicant is the most suitable payee before approving  them.", "According to SSA officials, in 2015, SSA enhanced its policy on what to  do when beneficiaries are affected by an organizational payee\u2019s closure  or termination. Specifically, national officials told us SSA added new  procedures for appointing a new payee in cases of immediate payee  termination and emphasized the narrow circumstances when it is  appropriate to temporarily suspend benefits. Officials told us these  changes were in response to a challenging experience terminating a large  organizational payee in 2014 that served nearly 1,000 beneficiaries.", "Despite this change to agency policy on replacing organizational payees  that are terminated or closed, SSA continues to face some challenges in  approving replacement payees. Specifically, SSA staff we interviewed  cited a number of challenges they had encountered, such as shortages of  local organizational payees and difficulties obtaining information from  terminated organizational payees. While these challenges may not apply  to all field offices, they provide examples of circumstances that can  complicate the process of reassigning beneficiaries.", "Lack of local organizational payees. Officials in some field and  regional offices said they lack sufficient organizational payees in their  local area. For example, staff in three field offices said many  organizational payees in their area only serve certain types of  beneficiaries, such as the elderly or individuals with developmental  disabilities or specific medical conditions. Staff in two field offices told  us they had unsuccessfully tried to recruit additional organizational  payees in their jurisdiction.

Officials from SSA\u2019s regional, area, and field  offices told us that it can be challenging to meet the agency\u2019s  requirement that non-governmental fee-for-service organizational  payees be community based. For example, staff at an SSA area  office told us that finding payees within the community is challenging  in sparsely populated and remote areas, such as along Maine\u2019s  border with Canada, where beneficiaries may not live near any  approved organizational payees. In March 2019, SSA updated the  policy on community presence for non-governmental fee-for-service  organizational payees to better specify what is required for a payee to  establish community presence, but it is not yet clear the extent to  which this update resolves field office concerns about remote areas.", "Difficulty locating beneficiaries. Officials in some field and regional  offices noted that they sometimes struggle to locate beneficiaries,  which hinders reassignment. Homeless beneficiaries, in particular,  can be difficult to find, according to staff in one regional office.", "Difficulty obtaining information from terminated organizational  payees. Officials in some SSA offices told us that they may lack  information necessary to complete the transfer of an affected  beneficiary to another payee. For example, staff in a regional office  said that terminated organizational payees may not always be  forthcoming about unspent beneficiary funds. Staff in another field  office told us that because a terminated organizational payee had not  maintained adequate records of beneficiaries\u2019 guardians, SSA staff  had to go to court to identify them before approving replacement  payees."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "SSA\u2019s Communication with Organizational Payees Varies and Payee Feedback Is Not Systematically Collected SSA Has Various Opportunities to Communicate with Organizational Payees", "paragraphs": ["SSA staff communicate with organizational payees at various points.

Given the extent to  which onsite reviews uncover misuse and other problems, the onsite  review is a crucial control for the representative payee program. Under  the new process, state grantees generally interview selected payees,  beneficiaries, and legal guardians or third parties; review financial records  for selected beneficiaries over a 12-month period; transmit findings from  their reviews to SSA; and, in some cases, follow up on deficiencies they  identify. State grantees also suggest additional payees to review  (beyond those targeted by SSA) if they think such a review is warranted.

According to SSA, the regional offices are responsible for compiling  information to facilitate grantees\u2019 onsite reviews that is not automatically  provided through SSA\u2019s system and for clarifying procedural and  technical information for the grantees. Regional offices also address and  resolve all deficiencies the grantees do not resolve, according to SSA.

Specifically, NDRN representatives said that while the process  of clearing grantees to access beneficiaries\u2019 personally identifiable  information has been efficient, there have been delays providing grantees  with access to SSA laptops, printers, and scanners. As a result of these  equipment delays, grantees started to conduct reviews on paper and then  input the information later, according to NDRN representatives, thus using  less efficient, manual processes. NDRN representatives also said that the  new onsite review process involves multiple handoffs between grantee  and regional office staff, which has contributed to bottlenecks at some  regional offices. Moreover, NDRN representatives noted that, in addition  to the reviews SSA originally assigned to the grantees, regional offices  have tasked them with conducting quick response checks. Because  these reviews have generally involved assessing a large number of  financial records and conducting many beneficiary interviews, and were  not anticipated in SSA\u2019s initial plan, NDRN representatives believe they  may affect the ability of some state grantees to complete the other  reviews SSA had initially planned. Lastly, an NDRN representative said  that the timeliness of SSA\u2019s responses to grantee feedback and concerns  (communicated from state grantees via NDRN) has diminished in recent  months. Specifically, the NDRN representative said that the computer  program SSA staff developed to enable NDRN to submit questions to the  agency was initially working well.

However, for the vast majority of organizations that are  low-volume payees (29,082 of around 33,700), SSA selects a subset of  payees to receive onsite reviews each year. As shown in figure 2, more  than half of the onsite reviews SSA conducted in fiscal year 2018 were for  low-volume payees (1,619 of 2,774 reviews). However, because there are  so many low-volume payees, only about 6 percent of these payees  received an on-site review. In contrast, the lower number of high-volume  onsite reviews conducted (767) covered about 25 percent of high-volume  payees.", "Given that only a fraction of low-volume payees are selected for onsite  review each year, it is critical that SSA effectively prioritize which payees  should receive onsite reviews so SSA can effectively allocate resources.  To this end, SSA uses a predictive statistical model it first implemented in  2012 to rank low-volume organizations based on their chance of misusing  beneficiary funds and selects for onsite reviews those organizations  identified as having the highest risk.

For example, the available  documentation does not explain in sufficient detail how SSA assembled  data on the target population; how SSA sampled organizational payees  for assessing characteristics; which variables SSA considered using to  help predict misuse but ultimately decided not to include; how, if at all, it  assessed or assured itself of the reliability of the data the model used;  and how it decided to account for multiple beneficiaries with the same  payee. An SSA official responsible for using the model said he was not  sure whether documentation existed but was not retained, because the  individuals who developed the model are no longer with the agency.  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards for federal censuses  and surveys\u2014which contain accepted practices (but not requirements) for  federal statistical efforts not officially covered by the standards\u2014call for  documentation that \u201cincludes those materials necessary to understand  how to properly analyze data\u201d and \u201creplicate and evaluate\u201d statistical  estimates. Moreover, federal internal control standards state that  effective documentation enables agencies to retain organizational  knowledge, mitigate the risk of having knowledge limited to a few  personnel, and communicate knowledge as needed to external parties,  such as external auditors. Due to the absence of key documentation,  neither SSA itself nor an external party is able to affirm whether, in  comparison to other approaches, SSA\u2019s predictive model is the optimal  approach to identify low-volume payees and beneficiaries with the highest  risk of misuse.", "SSA officials told us that they will revise the model at some point in the  future\u2014at which point they could improve the documentation\u2014but that  they do not have a formal plan to do so. SSA officials said they do not  have imminent plans to update the model because the pool of identified  misuse cases, which is driven by the number of onsite reviews  conducted, is too small.

Accepted practices for developing predictive  statistical models call for periodic re-estimation and re-validation, using  data that are current and applicable to the conditions in which the model  will be applied. Moreover, federal internal control standards call for  agencies to conduct ongoing monitoring of the design and effectiveness  of the internal control system including evaluations of control design.  SSA reported conducting ongoing assessments of the model\u2019s continued  effectiveness, and provided us with aggregate performance data for 2012  to 2016.

The SSA OIG\u2019s report  expressly looked at how data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS) might be used to evaluate the suitability of nursing  homes and found that these data would help SSA more effectively assess  the ongoing suitability of existing nursing home payees. Specifically, the  OIG used CMS data reflecting penalties and other signs of  underperformance to identify poorly-performing nursing homes that might  also be poorly executing their duties as payees.", "For instance, according to SSA policy documents, the form can help  SSA identify previously unreported changes to beneficiaries\u2019 addresses; identify  unapproved collective accounts; determine if certain beneficiaries\u2019 savings are too high to  qualify for benefits; or determine whether the organizational payee is authorized to charge  a fee, if the payee reports charging one. outcomes would significantly dilute the model\u2019s ability to detect misuse,  which they consider to be the most important goal of the representative  payee review process.", "Developing additional models to predict other types of poor payee  performance besides misuse (such as poor recordkeeping or payees\u2019  failing to meet beneficiary needs, which were identified in the OIG study)  could reduce SSA\u2019s reliance on a model for which the low number of  misuse findings affects the efficacy of ongoing performance assessments  and prevents timely updates. Since SSA has only identified 31 misuse  cases using the predictive model since 2012, decades may pass before  SSA has the approximately 5,300 misuse cases it wants in order to  formally evaluate the model, and before SSA and others can be assured  that low-volume payees are being optimally targeted for review.

In addition, SSA expects state grantees to follow up on accounting forms  as part of their onsite reviews. At the same time, one of SSA\u2019s stated  purposes for using the annual accounting form is to evaluate payee  suitability on a regular basis rather than relying on ad hoc interactions  between the payee and field office, or relatively infrequent periodic and  targeted reviews.

For example, SSA\u2019s  annual accounting form does not ask or remind organizational payees  about all collective account requirements, and as a result does not fully  support SSA\u2019s oversight efforts. Collective accounts are permitted under  SSA policy, but SSA reviews and approves them to ensure that payees  comply with SSA\u2019s policies and procedures. While the annual  accounting form asks payees whether they put any saved funds into a  collective account, the form does not ask whether the payee uses a  collective account for day-to-day expenses. Payees should disclose the  use of any collective account to SSA independent of the form but may  have neglected to, and SSA does not use the form to fully ascertain the  use of collective accounts. Consequently, SSA may not have up-to-date  information about all of the collective accounts that an organizational  payee might be using\u2014information that could help place these risk-prone  accounts on SSA\u2019s radar to initiate the approval process and provide  ongoing oversight. Federal internal control standards state that  agencies should design control activities to achieve objectives and  respond to risks. When SSA officials were asked why the annual  accounting form does not ask about all collective accounts, the officials  said this would be unnecessary because payees are required to notify the  field office if they wish to open such accounts. SSA also indicated that its  periodic and targeted onsite reviews will uncover collective account  issues for the highest risk payees.", "However, SSA finds many instances of unapproved collective accounts  during its onsite reviews, suggesting that organizational payees might not  be proactively reporting opening such accounts to SSA as required. For  example, in fiscal year 2018, SSA found unapproved collective accounts  in nearly 17 percent of the onsite reviews it conducted of organizational  payees (in 477 instances out of 2,882 reviews). Staff we interviewed from  one field office also said they have identified organizational payees with  unapproved collective accounts. Specifically, staff said they have  identified at least three payees with unapproved accounts, one of which  they identified when reviewing the payee\u2019s annual accounting form. This  suggests that some payees may be willing to report they have a collective  account, but not remember or understand their responsibility to seek  approval from SSA when they open such accounts. Although SSA\u2019s  accounting form includes reminders of various payee responsibilities, the  form does not include a reminder to all payees that they should notify  SSA when they establish collective accounts. Reminding payees of these  responsibilities could serve as a regular reminder for payees to notify  SSA about the existence of these accounts, and thereby help ensure SSA  provides regular oversight of them.", "Stakeholders have also identified shortcomings in the content and design  of the accounting form. For example, SSA currently provides payees\u2019 total  benefit amounts in the form, and asks payees to report how they spent  those benefits. In a 2007 review of SSA\u2019s representative payee program,  the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) reported that because SSA  preprints total annual benefit amounts on the annual accounting form, it is  easy for payees to report spending that matches the total provided by  SSA. Even if the amounts the payee reported were incorrect, SSA\u2019s  electronic check would not trigger further review of these responses as  long as the numbers added up. NAS further suggested that omitting this  information would reinforce payees\u2019 responsibility for keeping and  consulting their records. In light of this and other findings, NAS broadly  recommended redesigning the form to collect more meaningful data\u2014a  recommendation echoed by the Social Security Advisory Board in 2018.  When asked why SSA did not adopt NAS\u2019 recommendation, SSA  indicated to us that it believed that NAS signaled that other  recommendations were more important, and cited NAS\u2019 statement that  \u201cno form, by itself, is going to detect program misuse.\u201d At the same time,  NAS restated its recommendation to redesign the form twice in its report  and in each instance noted how the form could complement other  oversight efforts.", "Research also suggests that agencies can improve the quality of the data  they collect via forms by applying behavioral science insights. For  example, behavioral science research has shown that requiring a  signature at the beginning of an online form helps promote honest self- reporting and can lead to government savings.77,  Moreover, the Internal  Revenue Service has identified approaches based on behavioral science  insights for improving compliance and honest self-reporting, and for  encouraging people to make good choices when providing information.

In June  2013, SSA formed a task team to conduct a comprehensive review of the  representative payee program and develop recommendations. This effort  resulted in, for example, a new process of sharing misuse information  with the Department of Veterans Affairs. While this was a positive step,  the task team disbanded in 2014 because it had generated a set of  recommendations and SSA wanted to shift to implementing those  recommendations, according to agency staff. However, resulting actions  did not include a forum or system for continuously assessing lessons  learned from audits and reviews or identifying solutions that might have  addressed gaps we identified in this report. For example, we found that  SSA discovers many instances of unapproved collective accounts during  onsite reviews, but we have not seen documentation that SSA has  assessed the risk of unapproved collective accounts existing among low- volume payees that do not receive any regular scrutiny.

At that time, the staff person did not know whether they would be doing a  fraud risk assessment of the representative payee program specifically.  SSA subsequently reported in May 2019 that the agency has established  a schedule and business process for conducting its risk assessments,  including one on the representative payee program. According to SSA,  the fraud risk assessment will provide a comprehensive and strategic look  at the fraud risks facing the representative payee program and the  controls SSA has in place to mitigate those risks. SSA also reported it  plans to begin the assessment of the representative payee program in  October 2019, and update it every 3 years beginning in 2024 to determine  whether there have been any changes to the risks and whether additional  actions are required.

It is therefore crucial that  SSA take steps to shore up a range of gaps in how the agency evaluates,  supports, and oversees payees to better ensure beneficiaries are  protected.", "Carefully screening organizations applying to be representative payees is  key to proactively avoiding potential abuse. However, in the absence of  detailed and centrally-approved policy guidance on how to assess  complex suitability factors for approving payees, SSA cannot be sure that  field office staff are consistently and appropriately evaluating applicants\u2019  suitability. Also, until SSA updates its electronic system to ensure staff\u2019s  rationale for approving or denying payees is captured in accordance with  policy, SSA may not have the benefit of information to better monitor  payees and inform future suitability decisions. Lastly, without a  comprehensive plan, including timeframes, for evaluating if and how to  conduct background and credit checks to help staff vet organizational  payees\u2014as it does for individual payee applicants\u2014SSA may forgo  potentially valuable safeguards for further protecting vulnerable  beneficiaries.", "Once approved, organizational payees rely on SSA for information or  action in order to effectively carry out their responsibilities. Absent a  formal mechanism whereby feedback from payees on SSA services and  processes can be collected, compiled, and analyzed, SSA may not be  sufficiently aware of payee needs and frustrations, which in turn could  result in lost opportunities to either retain or recruit organizations willing to  serve this critical function, or make program improvements.", "To ensure payees are managing beneficiary funds appropriately, SSA  relies on a number of monitoring mechanisms, including onsite reviews.  Onsite reviews represent SSA\u2019s most thorough and resource-intensive  monitoring tool and must be appropriately targeted. Until SSA develops a  plan to periodically review the predictive model\u2019s design, considers  inclusion of additional relevant data in the current model or an alternative  model that predicts outcomes other than misuse, and documents any  subsequent design changes, the model\u2019s efficacy cannot be fully  assessed or ultimately improved upon, and SSA may not be effectively  targeting high-risk, low-volume payees for review. SSA may detect payee  performance problems by reviewing annual accounting forms for all  organizational payees; however, without a process to ensure prompt  follow-up, SSA cannot be sure staff resolve problems in a timely manner.  Moreover, mingling beneficiaries\u2019 funds in collective accounts can mask  misuse, and until SSA addresses gaps in the annual accounting form and  issues with eRPS, SSA cannot effectively monitor payees\u2019 use of such  accounts.", "Addressing gaps in existing processes could improve the integrity of  SSA\u2019s representative payee program and reduce risks to SSA\u2019s most  vulnerable beneficiaries, but may not be sufficient in light of challenges  posed by the nation\u2019s aging population, which could swell the number of  vulnerable beneficiaries that need payees.

We interviewed SSA officials in its central  office and staff in four regional offices that we selected to reflect a range  in the number of states and organizational payees they collectively  oversee and to achieve diversity in geographic location. Within those  regions, we visited eight field offices covering seven states, which were  selected to include both metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas that  maximized the number of files we would have available for our review  (see next paragraph). We also interviewed officials in one area office per  region\u2014two representing metropolitan area field offices, and two  representing non-metropolitan area offices that we visited.

Specifically, at each field office we reviewed up to  two applications that SSA had approved (either initial applications to  serve as representative payee or initial applications to collect fees); up to  two applications that SSA had denied (initial or to collect fees); and files  for up to two organizations that were terminated or closed in the past 5  years. In some cases, field offices we visited did not have the full number  of cases available, and we reviewed fewer files in those offices. We  selected the most recent approval, denial, and termination files that were  available.

We entered information on  selected organizations into a database called CLEAR and reviewed the  resulting reports for any indication of criminal history. Many of these  reports included the criminal history of individuals who are or may be  associated with the organizational payee, and we reviewed these with  particular focus on the crimes that bar individuals from serving as  individual payees. For those reports that contained an indication of  criminal history, we selected reports that indicated there may have been  federal crimes or felonies at the state or local level and attempted to  obtain court records to provide further insight into the nature of the crimes  and the outcome of the cases.
