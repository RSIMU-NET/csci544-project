Yet the mainstay of U.S. tanker forces--the KC-135 Stratotanker--is over 50 years old. It is increasingly costly to support and its age-related problems could potentially ground the fleet. As a result, the Air Force has initiated the $52 billion KC-46 program to replace the aerial refueling fleet. The program plans to produce 18 tankers by 2017 and 179 aircraft by 2027.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 requires GAO to annually review the KC-46 program through 2017. This report addresses (1) progress made in 2012 toward cost, schedule, and performance goals, (2) identified program challenges, and (3) program risk mitigation tools. To address these areas, GAO reviewed key program documents, discussed development plans and results with officials from the KC-46 program office, other defense offices, and the prime contractor, Boeing. GAO assessed the program's development schedule and technology risks. GAO also assessed the program's acquisition plan to determine compliance with acquisition legislation and acquisition best practices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The KC-46 program 2012 estimates for cost, schedule, and performance are virtually the same as last year's, with the contractor running very close to the planned budget and schedule. Development work is more than one-fourth complete and a successful preliminary design review was held on schedule in April 2012. In response to a prior GAO recommendation, the program now has fully implemented metrics to measure the progress toward its key performance parameters and expects to meet these requirements. There are two areas of concern regarding program cost: first, both the contractor and government estimate the cost of development will exceed the contract ceiling price of $4.9 billion (although government liability is capped at that ceiling); and second, the contractor has already allocated about 80 percent of the management reserves budget, primarily for identified, yet unresolved, development risks, with the bulk of work--about 5 years--remaining. GAO maintains that significant use of these funds early in a program may indicate problems. The program has not yet evaluated how the significant use of these funds early could impact future milestones.", "With development generally stable, the program is addressing, in varying degrees, some key challenges. First, defense, contractor, and federal aviation officials all identify the flight test schedule as a substantive concern. An integrated test team continues to evaluate and adjust flight test plans ahead of the 2015 start. Second, the contractor must still complete a significant number of engineering drawings needed for the upcoming critical design review; about three-fifths are complete and some lower level subsystem reviews are behind schedule. Third, the contractor is still in the process of relocating key personnel and establishing facilities needed for integrating defense equipment after deciding to close the original location. Additional work continues to more fully mature critical technologies, solidify software plans, address growth in aircraft weight, and ensure there are no design issues with the wing refueling pods and the boom refueling system. Program officials continue to monitor these issues to ensure they will not have major impacts.", "The KC-46 program acquisition strategy and contract type are effective mechanisms for mitigating risks. The use of a fixed price contract limits government cost risk and technology risk is lessened by converting a commercial derivative aircraft into the KC-46 tanker. The KC-46 master schedule, acquisition plan, and management framework favorably compare with best practices and acquisition reform legislation, with some exceptions. For example, the master schedule met 7 of 10 best practices criteria, but did not include and sequence all activities and could have incorporated a broader range of uncertainty, leaving room to improve the schedule so program success is not jeopardized."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Department of Defense (DOD) analyze the root causes for the rapid allocation of management reserves and improve the KC-46 master schedule.

It enables military aircraft to fly further, stay airborne longer, and  carry more weapons, equipment, and supplies than unrefueled forces.  KC-46 aircraft are expected to replace about two-fifths of the KC-135  Stratotanker fleet, currently the mainstay of the U.S. large tanker force.  This force is now over 50 years old on average and costs increasingly  more to maintain and support, with additional concerns that age-related  problems could potentially ground the fleet.

The Department of Defense (DOD) agreed. These lessons and  the data compiled by the program could be very illustrative and important  to decision makers to help guide and improve future defense acquisition  programs since the KC-46 is one of the few major programs to award a  fixed price incentive (firm target) (FPIF) development contract in recent  years. We also recommended that the KC-46 program manager fully  implement sound metrics for each of the aircraft\u2019s planned key  performance parameters, to help ensure that achievement of these  parameters can be appropriately measured as the program moves toward  production. Subsequently, the program office took steps to do so.", "This is our second annual report in which we (1) evaluate program  progress toward cost, schedule, and performance goals; (2) identify  design, manufacturing, testing plan, and technology challenges; and (3)  assess the extent the program has developed effective, appropriate  methods to contain and mitigate risks. We could not assess the  contractor\u2019s manufacturing processes because the program has only  recently completed its second year of development and it is too early for  this assessment. To conduct this work, we discussed plans and results  with the Air Force\u2019s KC-46 program office, other defense offices, and the  prime contractor, the Boeing Company (Boeing). We reviewed financial  management documents, program budgets, risk assessments, technical  performance indicators, flight test plans and data relating to the program\u2019s  cost, schedule, and performance.

The Air  Force expects to exercise contract options for the first production lot in  2015 and the second production lot in 2016, both needed for Boeing to  produce and deliver 18 operational aircraft in the final production  configuration by August 2017. In addition, all required training must be  complete, and the required support equipment, and sustainment support  in place by August 2017. Then the acquisition strategy calls for Boeing to  produce the remaining aircraft through year 2027 at a target rate of 15  aircraft per year. Separate competitions may occur for later acquisitions,  nominally called the KC-Y and KC-Z, to replace the rest of the KC-135  fleet and the KC-10 fleet (the Air Force\u2019s other large tanker).", "The KC-46 program\u2019s acquisition strategy is to convert a commercial  Boeing 767 airframe into a militarized aerial refueling tanker in two  phases. In the first, Boeing is modifying their 767 airframe with a cargo  door and an advanced flight deck display borrowed from the new Boeing  787 aircraft and calling this modified version the 767-2C. In the second,  the 767-2C airframe will be further militarized by adding the air refueling  capabilities, an air refueling operator station that includes panoramic  three-dimensional displays, and threat detection and avoidance systems.  Figure 1 depicts how the 767-2C aircraft is to be configured into the KC- 46 tanker.", "The new KC-46 tanker is expected to be more capable than the KC-135 it  replaces in several respects. It will have a modernized KC-10 tanker  refueling boom integrated with a fly-by-wire (computer assisted) control  system and a permanent hose and drogue refueling system that will  enable both types of refueling to be employed on the same mission.KC-135 has to land and switch equipment to transition from one mode to  another. Also, the KC-46 is expected to be able to refuel in a variety of  night-time and covert mission settings and will have countermeasures to  protect it against infrared missile threats. Designed with more refueling  capacity, improved efficiency, and increased cargo and medical  evacuation capabilities than its predecessor, the KC-46 is intended to  provide aerial refueling to Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and allied  aircraft. Appendix II compares, in more detail, the current capabilities of  the KC-135 with the planned capabilities of the new KC-46 tanker.", "The KC-46 program is one of only a few major weapon system programs  in recent years to employ a fixed price development contract. In the past,  DOD has typically used cost-reimbursement contracts in which the  government pays all allowable costs incurred by the contractor. Recent  legislation and defense policy now emphasize the use of fixed price  development contracts, where warranted, to limit the government\u2019s  exposure to cost increases. Defense officials believe that a fixed price  development contract is appropriate for this program because KC-46  development is considered to be a relatively low-risk effort to integrate  mostly mature military technologies onto a well-defined commercial  derivative aircraft."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "KC-46 Program Cost, Schedule, and Performance Estimates Remain Unchanged but There Are Some Concerns as Development Progresses", "paragraphs": ["The KC-46 program estimates for cost, schedule, and performance are  essentially unchanged from last year.

Officials said that the February 2011 cost  estimate remains the program of record and that these funding additions  will be returned to DOD. The program also completed a major schedule  milestone in April 2012 with a successful PDR that determined no major  design changes were needed. The PDR is an important risk reduction  activity as the program moves into integration and manufacture of the KC- 46.

The total procurement cost estimate of $40.4 billion  is to procure 175 production aircraft, initial spares, and other support  items as priced in contract options.

Boeing reports  it is running very close to its budget for cost and schedule. Minimal  schedule delays to this point are attributed primarily to design difficulties  with the aerial refueling system, hardware deliveries for the system  integration labs, and configuration changes to the commercial platform  needed to accommodate military specific hardware. DOD officials do not  expect these delays to affect the completion of critical tasks that  ultimately determine whether Boeing can meet the required delivery date  in the development contract. While the schedule delays are relatively  small, studies of more than 700 defense programs have determined there  is limited opportunity for a program to get back on schedule once they are  more than 15 to 20 percent complete. Also, the pace of development  work is expected to accelerate. So far, on average, about $60 million  worth of work has been completed per month, but over the next year  more than $100 million worth of work per month is planned.", "The program office currently projects that the KC-46 aircraft will meet the  requirements of all nine key performance parameters by the end of  development. These parameters are system characteristics considered  critical or essential to developing an effective military capability. Satisfying  these parameters will ensure that the KC-46 will be able to accomplish its  primary mission of providing worldwide, day and night, adverse weather  aerial refueling as well as its secondary missions. Several of these  parameters address performance characteristics that are limited or do not  exist in the current tanker fleet. For example, only 8 KC-135 aircraft have  the capability to receive fuel from another aerial refueling tanker while  airborne. At times this limits the range of the tanker force and lessens the  efficient use of assets. The Air Force hopes to address this by enabling  the entire KC-46 fleet to receive fuel from other tankers. Appendix III  describes the key performance parameters for the KC-46 program.", "Our report on the KC-46 last year noted that the program had yet to fully  implement specific metrics needed to measure progress against these  parameters. As a result, we recommended it do so as soon as possible  to help ensure that progress toward meeting these parameters can be  appropriately measured.

KC-46 program officials told us the majority of preliminary and critical  design reviews for components and subsystems used on the commercial  767-2C aircraft are conducted as Boeing internal events, with the Air  Force participating but not leading these reviews. Also, officials told us  they do not receive regular status updates for some types of contractor  data, including engineering design drawings. Officials from the Defense  Contract Management Agency, which oversees the KC-46 development  contract, also told us their typical oversight of defense contracts involving  commercial items is more constrained compared to its oversight of unique  military weapon systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Development Schedule Mostly Meets Best Practices for Schedule Estimating", "paragraphs": ["The KC-46 program\u2019s schedule substantially meets the 10 best practices  we have identified as being associated with effective schedule  estimating.

While lags are included  in a schedule to denote the passage of time, the KC-46 schedule  provided few details on the reasons why such a large number of lags  are included in their schedule. We also found a large number of  constraints built into the schedule that are being used to control the  timing of activities. Program officials stated these time constraints  represent the contractor\u2019s resource availability but they also prevent  activities from starting sooner than planned to take advantage of time  savings realized on earlier activities. It also requires constant manual  upkeep of the schedule, increasing the likelihood of errors.", "Third, while the program office adhered to the best practice that a risk  analysis be conducted on its planned schedule and even conducted a  second revised schedule risk analysis after our initial assessment, we  report this best practice as partially met. Our initial assessment found  that the original program office schedule risk analysis may not have  factored in enough risk into the contractor\u2019s activity duration  estimates, and assumptions used to conduct the risk assessment  were not fully documented. Nor did it account for the correlation  between activities, that is, the degree to which the duration of some  related activities may vary together.
