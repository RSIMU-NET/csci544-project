GAO was asked to review IRS\u0092s second offshore program, the 2009 OVDP. This report (1) describes the nature of the noncompliance of 2009 OVDP participants, (2) determines the extent IRS used the 2009 OVDP to prevent noncompliance, and (3) assesses IRS\u0092s efforts to detect taxpayers trying to circumvent taxes, interests, and penalties that would otherwise be owed. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed tax return data for all 2009 OVDP participants and exam files for a random sample of cases with penalties over $1 million; interviewed IRS Offshore officials; and developed and implemented a methodology to detect taxpayers circumventing monies owed."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As of December 2012, the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) four offshore programs have resulted in more than 39,000 disclosures by taxpayers and over $5.5 billion in revenues. The offshore programs attract taxpayers by offering a reduced risk of criminal prosecution and lower penalties than if the unreported income was discovered by one of IRS's other enforcement programs. For the 2009 Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program (OVDP), nearly all program participants received the standard offshore penalty--20 percent of the highest aggregate value of the accounts--meaning the account value was greater than $75,000 and taxpayers used the accounts (e.g., made deposits or withdrawals) during the period under review. The median account balance of the more than 10,000 cases closed so far from the 2009 OVDP was $570,000. Participant cases with offshore penalties greater than $1 million represented about 6 percent of all 2009 OVDP cases, but accounted for almost half of all offshore penalties. Taxpayers from these cases disclosed a variety of reasons for having offshore accounts, and more than half of them had accounts at Swiss bank UBS.", "Using 2009 OVDP data, IRS identified bank names and account locations that helped it pursue additional noncompliance. Based on a review of cases, GAO found examples of immigrants who stated in their 2009 OVDP applications that they were unaware of their offshore reporting requirements. IRS officials from the Offshore Compliance Initiative office said they have not targeted outreach efforts to new immigrants. Using information from the 2009 OVDP, such as the characteristics of taxpayers who were not aware of their reporting requirements, to increase education and outreach to those populations could promote voluntary compliance.", "IRS has detected some taxpayers with previously undisclosed offshore accounts attempting to circumvent paying the taxes, interest, and penalties that would otherwise be owed, but based on GAO reviews of IRS data, IRS may be missing attempts by other taxpayers attempting to do so. GAO analyzed amended returns filed for tax year 2003 through tax year 2008, matched them to other information available to IRS about taxpayers' possible offshore activities, and found many more potential quiet disclosures than IRS detected. Moreover, IRS has not researched whether sharp increases in taxpayers reporting offshore accounts for the first time is due to efforts to circumvent monies owed, thereby missing opportunities to help ensure compliance. From tax year 2007 through tax year 2010, IRS estimates that the number of taxpayers reporting foreign accounts nearly doubled to 516,000. Taxpayer attempts to circumvent taxes, interest, and penalties by not participating in an offshore program, but instead simply amending past returns or reporting on current returns previously unreported offshore accounts, result in lost revenues and undermine the programs' effectiveness."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Among other things, GAO recommends that IRS (1) use offshore data to identify and educate taxpayers who might not be aware of their reporting requirements; (2) explore options for employing a methodology to more effectively detect and pursue quiet disclosures and implement the best option; and (3) analyze first-time offshore account reporting trends to identify possible attempts to circumvent monies owed and take action to help ensure compliance.

There is no precise estimate of how  much money the U.S. Treasury loses due to unreported income from  offshore accounts. Former Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner  Charles O. Rossotti said at a congressional hearing in 2002 that he  believed offshore noncompliance to be several tens of billions of dollars,  but did not have a precise number. IRS has been limited in its ability to  uncover and pursue taxpayers with unreported offshore accounts by  traditional means, in part because the reporting requirements that apply  to domestic financial institutions do not generally apply to foreign  institutions.", "Since 2003, IRS has carried out four offshore voluntary disclosure  programs, collectively referred to in this report as \u201coffshore programs,\u201d  that offer incentives for taxpayers to disclose their offshore accounts and  pay delinquent taxes, interest, and penalties.

Another technique is for  taxpayers to declare existing offshore accounts for the first time with their  current year\u2019s tax return, but not amend prior year returns.

We also interviewed  IRS officials from the Offshore Compliance Initiative office about actions  taken to identify and target additional offshore noncompliance. To assess  IRS\u2019s efforts to detect quiet disclosures, we used IRS tax return data from  the tax years covered by the 2009 OVDP, tax year 2003 through tax year  2008, to identify potential quiet disclosures and compared our results with  those from IRS.

U.S.  taxpayers must report whether they have offshore accounts on Schedule  B of IRS Form 1040 and pay taxes on income from the offshore accounts  at their individual tax rates. Some taxpayers with large offshore account  balances are also required to report additional account information, such  as the name and location of their bank, by filing a form TD F 90-22.1,  Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR). Failure to report  the existence of offshore accounts or pay taxes on these accounts can  lead to civil and criminal penalties.", "U.S. financial institutions are required to submit to IRS information returns  that report income earned by account holders. IRS uses the information  to check whether taxpayers are reporting investment earnings and other  income correctly. Unlike the reporting requirements for U.S. financial  institutions, there has been no reporting regime for foreign financial  institutions, and this lack of information has limited IRS\u2019s ability to ensure  taxpayers were reporting offshore income accurately (see fig. 1). IRS has  begun implementing provisions of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance  Act (FATCA), which requires, beginning in 2015, U.S. financial institutions  to withhold a portion of certain payments made to foreign financial  institutions that have not entered into a specific agreement with IRS to  report information on their U.S. clients. It is expected that IRS will use  this information to identify noncompliant taxpayers. While IRS officials do  not anticipate that FATCA will replace the offshore programs, they do  believe that future programs may shift in focus to identifying promoters of  offshore tax schemes that are not associated with the financial institutions  that will be subject to FATCA reporting requirements.", "IRS\u2019s offshore programs were designed to encourage taxpayers with  undisclosed income from offshore accounts to become current with their  tax liabilities. Although the offshore programs differed in details, all four  followed a cycle similar to the one illustrated in figure 2. The offshore  programs fit into IRS\u2019s larger compliance efforts, which are intended to  both detect noncompliance and to encourage voluntary compliance, in  part by minimizing the burden for taxpayers to understand their tax  obligations and file tax returns every year.", "While open and intended to attract all noncompliant taxpayers with  offshore accounts, the four offshore programs to date all started with IRS  identifying a particular group of taxpayers suspected of having unreported  offshore accounts. The group might be account holders at a particular  bank or in a particular country. Sometimes IRS obtains such information  from whistleblowers. In 2007, a whistleblower provided details to the  U.S. government about how his employer, Swiss bank UBS, was actively  assisting and facilitating U.S. taxpayers\u2019 concealment of taxable income.(See app. II for more information on the UBS whistleblower.) IRS may  also use information gathered through prior offshore programs to identify  other banks or countries where U.S. taxpayers may be hiding offshore  income.", "The next step is to learn the identities of some of the taxpayers suspected  of noncompliance. One technique is to use John Doe summonses. In 2008, prior to the announcement of the 2009 OVDP, a federal court  granted IRS permission to serve a John Doe summons to UBS for  information on its U.S. customers. As a result of the summons, and  subsequent government negotiation and agreement, UBS turned over  information on approximately 4,450 accounts held in Switzerland by U.S.  persons. This was a partial list of all U.S. UBS account holders with  accounts in Switzerland. In other cases, IRS has been able to get client  lists from promoters of offshore tax evasion schemes.", "In order to encourage program participation, IRS publicizes the fact that it  knows, or soon will know, the names of some offshore account holders.  IRS also publicizes the terms of its offshore programs, which offer  incentives to taxpayers who voluntarily disclose their accounts before IRS  learns about them. As described later, the offshore programs offer a  reduced risk of criminal prosecution, and lower penalties than taxpayers  could receive if unreported offshore accounts were discovered in an audit.  In this report we refer to the reduced penalty offered as part of an  offshore program as the \u201coffshore penalty.\u201d In the 2009 OVDP the  offshore penalty was typically 20 percent of the highest aggregate value  of the unreported offshore accounts between 2003 and 2008.", "Provided that they meet certain criteria, taxpayers are accepted into one  of IRS\u2019s offshore programs by responding to IRS questions about the  nature of their offshore noncompliance in an application letter and filing  amended or late tax returns and FBARs. (See app. III for sample  application letters.) Investigators from IRS\u2019s Criminal Investigation  division generally review applications to verify that taxpayers are not  already under investigation, that the offshore income was from legal  sources, and that the taxpayer has made a complete and truthful  disclosure. Taxpayers\u2019 amended or late returns that are submitted as part  of an offshore program are reviewed and certified by IRS examiners who  calculate the delinquent taxes, interest, and penalties, and who may  request additional documents and information from taxpayers.", "Taxpayers who did not participate in an offshore program but are known  to IRS (perhaps because they were on the list of names IRS identified in  Step 2) run the risk of being audited outside of an offshore program.  These taxpayers could be subject to substantially greater penalties and  increased risk of criminal prosecution. Since 2009, IRS and the  Department of Justice (DOJ) have publicized more than 40 prosecutions  of UBS clients and UBS bankers.", "Through data mining, or analyzing, information from offshore program  application letters, and reviewing the case files of program participants  and auditing nonparticipants, IRS is able to identify new groups of  taxpayers suspected of hiding income offshore. IRS can then choose to  continue offering offshore programs and encourage these newly identified  groups of taxpayers, as well as all taxpayers with unreported offshore  accounts, to disclose their accounts voluntarily, repeating the cycle  illustrated in figure 2. For example, taxpayers that participated in the 2009  OVDP named other Swiss banks and financial advisors who had assisted  them with hiding offshore income. As a result, IRS and DOJ took actions  to compel other Swiss banks to name their U.S. customers. To date,  some Swiss banks have announced that they are cooperating with U.S.  government investigations. One Swiss bank ceased operating after it  pleaded guilty to helping U.S. taxpayers hide income offshore and agreed  to pay approximately $74 million in fines, restitution, and civil forfeiture.

The offshore programs offer participating  taxpayers a lower penalty than they could have been subject to if IRS had  discovered their offshore account outside of the program. According to  IRS, the offshore penalty is in lieu of all other liabilities for tax, interest,  and penalties that IRS would not pursue. Taxpayers that do not  participate in an offshore program could potentially face penalties that  total more than 100 percent of the value of their unreported offshore  accounts. These penalties could include FBAR, accuracy-related and/or  delinquency, fraud, and foreign information return penalties.", "Most of the offshore programs also offered taxpayers mitigated penalties  at lower rates, generally for taxpayers with small accounts or accounts  that were not accessed, also shown in table 1.", "Many offshore accounts were presumably open for decades, something  that we confirmed in our review of 2009 OVDP cases, but practical  reasons prevented IRS from auditing and collecting unpaid taxes from all  of those years.

As a result, the penalty  has been described by tax practitioners as \u201crough justice,\u201d in part  because the amount in an account might include decades of tax-free  buildup.

The 2012 program is, at present, open  ended. In each program, delinquent taxes and interest were assessed  and collected for a limited number of prior years, which varied from four to  eight tax years. Taxpayers were typically assessed accuracy-related  and/or delinquency penalties for the delinquent taxes assessed in an  offshore program, in addition to the offshore penalty described earlier.", "Despite the significant risks of not coming forward through one of IRS\u2019s  offshore programs, some taxpayers decide to do nothing and remain  noncompliant. Other taxpayers have attempted to disclose their offshore  accounts without paying all the delinquent taxes, interest, and penalties  required by the programs. In a quiet disclosure, taxpayers file amended  tax returns for all or some of the tax years covered by an offshore  program, and report the income from the previously unreported accounts.  The taxpayers would generally pay interest and either accuracy-related or  delinquency penalties on the newly reported income, but would avoid the  higher offshore penalty. At the same time, taxpayers attempting quiet  disclosures would file late FBARs, if they had not previously filed FBARs,  or amended FBARs, if they had, to disclose the offshore accounts that  they had not previously reported. Taxpayers might also try to circumvent  some of the taxes, interest, and penalties that would otherwise be owed  in offshore programs by reporting the existence of any offshore accounts  and any income from the accounts on their current year\u2019s tax return,  without amending prior years\u2019 returns. These taxpayers would also likely  disclose the existence of the accounts by filing FBARs for the current  calendar year. This filing would appear similar to the opening of a new  account. Such a taxpayer would avoid paying any delinquent taxes,  interest, or penalties, unless audited.
