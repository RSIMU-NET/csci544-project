Agents may also assist consumers in the application process.", "Consumers may also purchase insurance by contacting carriers directly. In many states, dominant carriers have high name recognition and may focus marketing activities directly on individual consumers. Representatives from several Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans and large HMOs we visited such as Kaiser and FHP told us they regularly use television, radio, or print advertising to target individual consumers. Consequently, most of the individual market business for these carriers is generated through direct contact with applicants. Indemnity carriers, like Mutual of Omaha and Time Insurance, rely on agents to generate most of their individual market business.", "Another important access route for individual consumers is through a business or social organization. Organizations such as chambers of commerce, trade associations, unions, alumni associations, and religious organizations may offer insurance coverage to their members. Through the pooled purchasing power of many individuals or small employers, associations can negotiate with carriers for competitively priced products that they then offer their members. For example, a small-employer health care purchasing group in Arizona offers its products to the self-employed.", "Through this program, self-employed people have access to coverage on a guaranteed-issue, community-rated basis with premium adjustments permitted only for age and geography. Other arrangements make use of individuals\u2019 common affiliation to increase access to health insurance for individuals. For example, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Dakota has made arrangements with essentially all the banks in the state to allow depositors to obtain coverage by having their premiums deducted directly from their bank accounts. In operation since the 1960s, this bank depositors plan covers about 76 percent of the carrier\u2019s individual enrollees in the state.", "Individuals leaving most employer-sponsored group plans have access to two different types of coverage. First, federal law requires carriers to offer individuals leaving group coverage the option of continuing to purchase that coverage at no more than 102 percent of the total policy cost for up to 18 months. Required by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1985, the law applies to employer groups of 20 or more. Some state laws extend similar requirements to groups of fewer than 20. Secondly, several states require carriers to offer individuals a product comparable to their group coverage on a guaranteed-issue basis. Conversion coverage tends to be very expensive, however. Because those who elect to purchase conversion coverage tend to be in poorer health than those who do not (a situation known as adverse selection), the premium prices are generally higher than for comparable individual market products.", "Finally, those determined by carriers to be uninsurable in the insurance market may be able to purchase coverage through a state high-risk program. Many states offer high-risk programs that provide subsidized coverage to uninsurable individuals at rates generally about 50 percent higher than what a healthy individual would pay in the private market.

Blues plans continue to be relatively important in the individual markets of many states. In six of the seven states we visited, the Blues were the largest single carrier in the individual market. In North Dakota and Vermont, the Blues had a 76 and 58 percent share, respectively, of the market for comprehensive individual market products. Nationally, about a quarter to a third of all individual enrollees obtained their coverage from a Blues plan in 1993.", "The HMO share nationally in the individual market is about half of what it is in the employer-sponsored group market, although it is increasing. In New York, for example, the HMO share of the individual health insurance market has increased from about 7 percent in 1992 to 40 percent in 1996. Partly in response to insurance reforms enacted there, at least one large individual market carrier withdrew its indemnity products altogether and replaced them with an HMO product, according to a New York trade association official. The trend in New York is expected to continue in response to recent state measures designed to encourage HMO participation in the individual market. In Illinois, a representative of one of the largest individual market carriers told us the carrier soon expects to introduce its first individual HMO product. In Colorado, an HMO plan is now the most popular product sold in the individual market.", "Finally, whereas the group market is dominated by large, national carriers such as Aetna and Prudential, carriers in the individual insurance market tend to be smaller or regional in focus.

Under employer-sponsored coverage, the range of available deductibles is narrower, and total out-of-pocket costs are capped at a lower level than under most individual market products. For plans offered by medium and large employers, annual deductibles are most commonly between $100 and $300, while limits on total out-of-pocket expenses are $1,500 or less for most employees. In the individual market, annual deductibles are commonly between $250 and $2,500, while limits on total out-of-pocket costs typically start at $1,200 and may exceed $6,000 annually.", "Insurance contracts require policyholders to contribute to the cost of benefits received. Under traditional, major medical expense plans, consumers must pay annual deductibles and coinsurance up to a specified total limit on out-of-pocket expenses. HMOs typically require consumers to make copayments for each service rendered until an annual maximum is reached. The cost-sharing arrangement selected by the consumer is a key determinant of the price of an individual insurance product. The more potential out-of-pocket expenses the consumer could incur, the lower the premium will be.

Table 3.3 illustrates examples of cost-sharing options available for selected commonly sold comprehensive products.", "Because consumers pay the entire cost of coverage, affordability is often of paramount concern. Consequently, consumers who perceive their risk of needing medical care to be minimal but want coverage in case of an accident or catastrophic illness may choose very high cost-sharing provisions to obtain the lowest possible premium. Other consumers, regardless of their health status, may only be able to afford insurance with very high cost-sharing provisions. Consumers who anticipate a greater likelihood of requiring medical care may be willing to pay higher premiums to protect themselves from large out-of-pocket expenses for coinsurance, deductibles, or copayments.", "Carrier and insurance department representatives with whom we spoke suggested that the level of consumer cost-sharing has been increasing in recent years, reflecting consumers\u2019 goal of keeping premiums affordable. One national carrier representative said that deductibles seem to be increasing every year. Among the carrier\u2019s new enrollees in 1995, 40 percent chose $500 deductibles, 50 percent chose $1,000 deductibles, and the remaining 10 percent chose deductibles from $2,500 to $10,000. A representative of another national carrier said that the premiums for its $250- and $500-deductible products had become too expensive and are thus no longer offered.", "State regulation also influences the range in cost-sharing options available to consumers. For example, under individual market reforms enacted in New Jersey, carriers are limited to offering only standard plans with prescribed ranges of cost-sharing options. All individual market products sold in the state are limited to deductibles of $150, $250, $500, or $1,000 for an individual enrollee.

For example, on the basis of past experience carriers anticipate that the likelihood of requiring medical care increases with age. Consequently, a 55-year-old in the individual market pays more than a 25-year-old for the same coverage. Similarly, females in this market may be charged a higher premium than males of the same age group because of the costs associated with pregnancy and the treatment of other female health conditions. These individuals, however, if in the group market, would usually pay the same amount as the other members of their group, regardless of their specific age or gender. Premiums may also vary geographically. In some states, premium prices are higher in urban areas than in rural areas because of higher medical costs. Likewise, smokers are expected to incur greater medical expenses than nonsmokers and are thus often charged higher premiums in the individual market.

On the questionnaire, applicants must indicate whether they or any family member to be included on the policy have received medical advice or treatment of any kind within their lifetime or within a more limited time frame, such as the previous 5 to 10 years, and whether they have experienced a broad range of specifically identified symptoms, conditions, and disorders.

Individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or other serious conditions, such as heart disease and leukemia, are virtually always denied coverage. We also found examples in which individuals with less severe conditions, such as attention deficit disorder and chronic back pain, could also be denied coverage by some of the carriers. Furthermore, at least two HMOs we visited almost always deny coverage to any applicant who smokes. Table 4.3 lists the estimated declination rates for some of the largest carriers we visited.", "Some officials suggested that these declination rates could be understated for at least two reasons. First, insurance agents are usually aware of which carriers medically underwrite and have a sense as to whether applicants will be accepted or denied coverage. Consequently, agents will often deter individuals with a health condition from even applying for coverage from certain carriers. In fact, officials from one carrier in Arizona told us that since agents discourage those who would not qualify for coverage from applying, their declination rate is not an accurate indicator of the proportion of potential applicants who are ineligible for coverage.", "Secondly, the declination rates do not take into account carriers that attach riders to policies to exclude certain health conditions or carriers that charge unhealthy applicants a higher, nonstandard rate for the same coverage. Thus, although a carrier may have a comparatively low declination rate, it may attach such riders and charge higher, nonstandard premiums to a substantial number of applicants. In fact, a national survey of insurers showed that 20 percent of all applicants were offered a policy with an exclusion rider, a rated-up premium, or both.", "The majority of the indemnity insurers we visited will add riders to policies that exclude certain conditions either temporarily or permanently. For example, knee injuries related to skiing accidents may be explicitly excluded from coverage as may be a more chronic condition such as asthma. Also, a person who suffers from chronic back pain may have all costs associated with treatment of that part of the body excluded from coverage. Similarly, some carriers we visited will accept an applicant with certain health conditions but will charge him or her a significantly higher premium to cover the higher expected costs. For example, an Illinois carrier charges 2 to 3 percent of its enrollees a nonstandard rate. This 2 to 3 percent, however, pays approximately double the standard rate.

Several carriers charged females a higher premium than males of the same age group because of the costs associated with the female reproductive system and pregnancy. For example, 25-year-old females in Illinois and Arizona paid $31 more each month than males of the same age for the same PPO coverage and $36 more each month for a fee-for-service plan in Colorado.

Absent state restrictions, carriers base coverage and pricing decisions on each individual\u2019s demographic characteristics and health status. Thus in most states, those who are older or in poor health may be charged significantly higher premiums or may be denied coverage altogether. Among those with coverage in the individual market, many may be underinsured. Increasingly sold are very high deductible plans with lower premiums but greater financial risk for consumers. Many consumers may purchase these plans because they cannot afford premiums otherwise, suggesting that, unlike under medical savings accounts, a reserve to pay the high deductibles may not exist. Some consumers can only obtain coverage that permanently excludes the very medical condition for which they are most likely to need care. And other consumers\u2014intentionally or unintentionally\u2014purchase limited benefit policies as their only source of coverage.", "Twenty-five states have recently passed legislative reforms for their individual health insurance markets and more are likely to follow. The reforms vary widely in scope from limited measures, such as those intended only to limit the length of preexisting condition waiting periods a carrier may impose, to comprehensive reforms requiring carriers to provide coverage to all who apply and use community rating to set premiums. Some states use other measures to increase individual market access or affordability, such as high-risk pools and insurers of last resort. At the federal level, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 is a recent example of federal legislation that will affect the individual health insurance market. The act guarantees access to the individual market to consumers with qualifying previous group coverage and guarantees the renewability of individual coverage. For the self-employed, the act authorizes federally tax-deductible medical savings accounts and increases the tax deductibility of health insurance. The importance of the individual insurance market to millions of Americans is a factor to be considered in weighing any further incremental measures to improve the accessibility and affordability of private health insurance."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
