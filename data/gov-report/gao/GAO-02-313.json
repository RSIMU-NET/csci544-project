Although AWG is not mandatory, by failing to use this tool--more than five years after the act's enactment and more than three years after the Department of the Treasury issued implementing regulations--agencies have missed an opportunity to maximize collection of delinquent debt. Agencies identified various reasons for not yet implementing AWG or for deciding not to do so, including the need to focus their resources on implementing the act's mandatory provisions. Although some agencies or programs may have valid reasons for not implementing wage garnishment, all of the larger programs that deal with individuals and that have a demonstrated risk of financial loss resulting from unpaid debt should have AWG as a viable debt collection option. Reliance on the Financial Management Service (FMS) to perform AWG as part of cross-servicing might be prudent for some agencies, provided the collection tool is used as early as practicable to maximize its collection potential. However, the act does not require that agencies refer debts for cross-servicing until they are more than 180 days delinquent, and FMS, which views wage garnishment as a tool of last resort, does not contemplate initiating AWG in most cases until the debt has been with FMS for at least 90 days. As a result, FMS's use of AWG could be significantly limited and delayed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["On October 10, 2001, we testified before your subcommittee on selected  federal agencies\u2019 implementation of the Debt Collection Improvement Act  (DCIA) of 1996. That law established a framework for improved federal  debt collection governmentwide using various debt collection tools.  One  of these tools is administrative wage garnishment (AWG), which DCIA  authorizes, but does not require, agencies to use.  This report provides  more detailed information on the extent to which nine large Chief Financial  Officers (CFO) Act agencies use or plan to use AWG to collect delinquent  nontax federal debt and our perspective on additional efforts that are  needed to make AWG a more effectively and commonly used debt  collection tool.", "In 1995, prior to the enactment of DCIA, debt collection experts testified  before your subcommittee that AWG can be an extremely powerful debt  collection tool, as the mere threat of its use is often enough to motivate  people to pay their delinquent debts.  This is significant given the large size  of the U.S. labor force and the reported $58 billion of delinquent debt held  by federal agencies as of September 30, 2000, the date for which the  most recent agency-certified data were available at the completion of our  fieldwork.", "AWG as authorized by DCIA, unlike court-ordered wage garnishment, does  not require that agencies obtain a court judgment to initiate garnishment.  Instead, AWG is an administrative process that requires that debtors be  notified of the government\u2019s intent to have their employer withhold  specified amounts from their wages, requires that debtors be given an  opportunity to either pay their debt in full or enter into a repayment  agreement under terms acceptable to the agency that holds the debt, and  gives debtors the right to request a hearing.  If the delinquent debtor does  not either pay the debt in full, enter into a repayment agreement, or request  a hearing, the agency may proceed to issue an order requiring the debtor\u2019s  employer to withhold up to 15 percent of the debtor\u2019s disposable pay and  transmit those moneys to the agency."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Over the past several years, the federal government has reported an  outstanding balance of delinquent debt in the range of $50 billion to  $60 billion.  DCIA reflected the Congress\u2019 recognition that timely and  effective agency debt collection efforts were needed to maximize  collections of delinquent debts owed to the federal government.  A central  theme of the legislation is that before discharging any delinquent debt  owed to any executive, judicial, or legislative agency, agencies should take  all appropriate steps to collect the debt.  Among the collection tools the act  authorized were administrative offset (withholding some or all of a federal  payment scheduled to be issued to the debtor), federal salary offset,  referral to PCA contractors, referral to agencies operating a debt collection  center, reporting delinquencies to credit reporting bureaus, and  administratively garnishing the wages of delinquent debtors.", "Some DCIA-authorized debt collection tools are mandatory, while others  are discretionary.  AWG, one of the discretionary tools, is a process  whereby an employer withholds amounts from an employee\u2019s wages and  pays those amounts to the employee\u2019s creditor in satisfaction of a  withholding order. Prior to the enactment of DCIA, agencies generally  were required to obtain a court order before garnishing the wages of  nonfederal employees. DCIA authorizes agencies to administratively  garnish up to 15 percent of a debtor\u2019s disposable pay to satisfy delinquent  nontax debt owed to the United States.  Under a separate statute,  Education has had authority since 1993 to garnish up to 10 percent of the  disposable pay of debtors who have defaulted on student loans.", "Treasury\u2019s FMS is responsible for promulgating regulations to implement  AWG and other debt collection tools authorized by DCIA.  In May 1998, 2  years after the act was passed, Treasury issued final regulations that  provide agencies with an overall framework for implementing AWG.  The  regulations authorize agencies to begin the AWG process as debt becomes  delinquent, but they do not stipulate when in the collection cycle this tool  may be used.  According to the regulations, any federal agency that  administers a program that might result in a delinquent nontax debt owed  to the federal government and any agency that pursues recovery of such  debt may administer AWG. Therefore, agencies holding delinquent debt  may administer AWG in-house; they may authorize a debt collection  agency, such as FMS, to administer AWG on their behalf as part of cross- servicing operations; or they may do both.  To assist agencies in  implementing AWG, Treasury issued AWG Form 329, known as the AWG  package, in November 1998.  The package includes a Letter to Employer &  Important Notice to Employer, Wage Garnishment Order, Wage  Garnishment Worksheet, and Employer Certification.  In February 1999,  FMS issued \u201cInstructions to Federal Agencies for Preparing AWG Forms.\u201d", "As is the case with other debt collection tools, Treasury\u2019s regulations  dealing with AWG provide for due process for debtors.  The regulations  require that at least 30 days before initiating wage garnishment  proceedings, agencies notify delinquent debtors in writing of the nature  and amount of the debt and of the agency\u2019s intention to collect through  deductions from pay.  The notification must also include an explanation of  the debtor\u2019s rights regarding the proposed action.  These rights include the  opportunity to inspect and copy agency records related to the debt, to enter  into a written repayment agreement with the agency, and to request a  hearing concerning the existence or amount of the debt or the terms of the  proposed repayment schedule under the garnishment order.", "An agency must provide a debtor with a hearing before it issues a  garnishment order if the agency receives the debtor\u2019s written request for a  hearing on or before the 15th business day following the mailing of the  notice.  If a debtor does not make a timely request for a hearing, the agency  is to send a withholding order to the debtor's employer within 30 days after  the debtor fails to make a timely request for a hearing.  If the agency  receives a debtor\u2019s written request for a hearing after the 15th business day  following the mailing of the notice, the agency must still provide a hearing  to the debtor.  In such a case, however, the agency is not to delay issuing a  withholding order unless it determines that the delay in filing the hearing  request resulted from factors over which the debtor had no control or  receives information that it believes justifies delaying or canceling the  withholding order.", "Following receipt of a withholding order, employers are required to certify  to the agency certain information about the debtor, such as the debtor\u2019s  employment status and disposable pay available for withholding.  The  employer must deduct from all disposable pay paid to the debtor during  each pay period the amount of the garnishment, which is the lesser of  (1) the amount indicated on the garnishment order, up to 15 percent of the  debtor\u2019s disposable pay, or (2) the amount by which the debtor\u2019s disposable  pay exceeds an amount equivalent to 30 times the minimum wage. If  multiple garnishments from various sources are applied to one debtor\u2019s  wages, the total garnishments may not exceed 25 percent of the individual\u2019s  disposable pay.", "Once the agency has fully recovered the amounts owed by the debtor, the  agency is to send the debtor\u2019s employer notification to discontinue wage  withholding.  Agencies are to review their debtors\u2019 accounts at least  annually to ensure that garnishment has been terminated for accounts that  have been paid in full."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objective, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The objective of our review was to determine the extent to which certain  CFO Act agencies use or plan to use AWG as authorized by DCIA to collect  delinquent nontax federal debts.", "As previously noted, we surveyed nine federal agencies:  USDA, Education,  DOE, HHS, HUD, VA, EPA, SBA, and SSA.  Together, these agencies held  about $40 billion of delinquent nontax federal debt as of September 30,  2000, which represented more than 90 percent of all CFO Act agencies\u2019  reported delinquent nontax debt as of that date.", "We developed a survey instrument to obtain agency responses to a uniform  set of questions (see appendix I) and received completed surveys from all  nine surveyed agencies.  We reviewed agency responses and followed up  with cognizant agency officials, where necessary, to obtain any needed  clarifications or additional information.  Although we discussed certain of  the survey responses with agency officials by telephone or electronic mail,  we did not independently verify the reliability of all the information that  agencies provided.  We also conducted interviews with FMS officials  responsible for regulations, guidance, and cross-servicing operations  related to AWG and reviewed pertinent documents, including FMS\u2019s \u201cAWG  Operations & Procedures Manual\u201d and its \u201cPerformance Summary Report.\u201d", "We performed our work from March 2001 through September 2001 in  accordance with U.S. generally accepted government auditing standards.

Together, the surveyed agencies reported holding about  $23 billion in consumer delinquent debt as of September 30, 2000. This is  not to imply that AWG could be used to collect all such debt because  circumstances such as bankruptcy or appeals could limit the application of  this debt collection tool.  Eight of the nine surveyed agencies said that they  planned to adopt AWG as authorized by DCIA.  Four agencies expected to  implement AWG in-house and, to varying degrees, through FMS\u2019s cross- servicing program.  One of these agencies, Education, has been using AWG  in-house under separate statutory authority since 1993.  The four remaining  agencies indicated that they would not perform AWG in-house but would  authorize FMS to apply AWG to debts they referred to FMS for cross- servicing.  However, we found in previous work that agencies have not  been promptly referring all eligible debts to FMS when they become 180  days delinquent, as required by DCIA.  Prompt referral of eligible debts is  especially important for agencies that contemplate relying primarily on  FMS to conduct AWG through cross-servicing because FMS intends to  apply AWG as a tool of last resort, to be used only after all other collection  efforts have been exhausted.", "Use of AWG, whether in-house or at FMS, should likely yield a marked  increase in agency collections of consumer delinquent debt.  The increase  would result largely from AWG\u2019s effectiveness as leverage to obtain  payment in full, to secure a repayment plan, or to obtain full payment on a  compromised amount.  According to testimony by debt collection experts,  the mere threat of AWG is often enough to motivate repayment. These  experts based their testimony on experience at Education, which indicated  that employees did not want their employers to find out that they had  defaulted on their student loans.  As a result, according to the debt  collection experts, about 50 percent of the debtors notified of Education\u2019s  intent to use AWG made payment arrangements instead of allowing their  wages to be garnished."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Education\u2019s Use of Wage Garnishment under Separate Authority Has Increased Debt Collections", "paragraphs": ["According to Education officials and agency documents, collection of  defaulted student loans has increased dramatically since Education  implemented AWG in 1993 under the Higher Education Act, as amended.  Education indicated that it had collected more than $306 million in  principal and interest on defaulted student loans from fiscal year 1997  through March 2001 using 10 percent garnishment authority.  The primary  difference between AWG under DCIA and wage garnishment under the  Higher Education Act is that the Higher Education Act allows up to 10  percent of disposable pay to be garnished, while DCIA allows up to 15  percent of disposable pay to be garnished."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Surveyed Agencies Plan to Use AWG", "paragraphs": ["Eight of the nine surveyed agencies said they plan to implement AWG  under DCIA authority.  EPA, the ninth agency, determined that use of AWG  would not be cost-effective because of its limited applicability to the  agency\u2019s debts. According to agencies\u2019 survey responses and other  agency correspondence, all eight agencies expect to implement AWG by the  end of fiscal year 2003, as shown in table 1.  Agencies gave various reasons  for the delay in implementing AWG, including their need to focus priorities  on the mandatory provisions of DCIA, to develop the required AWG  regulations, and to complete the systems changes necessary to implement  AWG.", "As shown in table 1, four agencies we surveyed (USDA, DOE, HUD, and  VA) indicated that they plan to rely primarily on FMS to perform AWG as  part of cross-servicing.  DOE said that given due process requirements and  efficiencies of processing debts, the agency prefers that FMS perform  AWG.  HUD indicated that it uses FMS\u2019s cross-servicing program as its main  \u201cactive\u201d collection tool.  VA indicated that it views AWG as a collection tool  of last resort and stated that it would concentrate on its own established  methods of collection, such as internal offset and referral of debts to the  Treasury Offset Program.  Although USDA stated that it plans to rely  primarily on FMS to perform AWG, the agency did not comment on why it  preferred this course of action.  In addition, four of the surveyed agencies  (Education, HHS, SBA, and SSA) plan to implement AWG in-house and, to  varying degrees, through FMS\u2019s cross-servicing program.  The use of AWG  in conjunction with other debt collection tools, whether performed in- house or at FMS, can provide leverage to obtain payments from delinquent  debtors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FMS\u2019s Use of AWG Could Be Limited", "paragraphs": ["Depending on the nature of an agency\u2019s delinquent debt, relying on FMS to  apply AWG as part of cross-servicing may be the best approach.  FMS\u2019s  incorporation of AWG into the cross-servicing program would undoubtedly  improve its collection success and make its cross-servicing collection  efforts more comprehensive.  However, relying primarily on FMS to  perform AWG has definite limitations.  First, not all delinquent debt  reported by agencies as eligible for cross-servicing has been promptly  referred to FMS in the past, and debt that has been referred has often been  well beyond DCIA\u2019s 180-day delinquency threshold.  Second, under FMS\u2019s  cross-servicing program, AWG is considered to be a collection means of  last resort and will therefore be used far into the debt collection process.  To maximize the debt collection potential of AWG for debts referred to  FMS for cross-servicing, agencies should send eligible debts to FMS  promptly\u2014even, when practicable, prior to the 180-day delinquency  threshold. As we stated in our October 2001 testimony, debt collection  experts have testified that AWG can be an extremely powerful debt  collection tool, as the mere threat of AWG is often enough to motivate  debtor repayment.", "Although debt referred for cross-servicing was not reported to Treasury on  the Report on Receivables separately by consumer and commercial debt,  the four surveyed agencies that plan to rely primarily on FMS for AWG  implementation (USDA, DOE, HUD, VA) together reported having referred  only $288 million of about $690 million of all types of debt that they  reported as eligible for cross-servicing as of September 30, 2000. For  example, as discussed in our October 2001 testimony, the USDA agencies  we reviewed (the Rural Housing Service and the Farm Service Agency) had  not identified and promptly sent debts to FMS for cross-servicing.  Consequently, if AWG had been attempted only on delinquent debts  reported as referred for cross-servicing, substantial amounts of delinquent  debt would not have been subject to this debt collection tool.", "Because FMS views AWG as a collection tool of last resort, it is critical that  agencies relying on FMS to implement AWG refer debts promptly to FMS  for cross-servicing, even, when practicable, before they reach the 180-day  delinquency threshold.  According to the \u201cAWG Operations & Procedures  Manual\u201d developed by FMS for its PCA contractors, AWG is a tool to be  used after all other collection efforts have been exhausted.  FMS has taken  the position that AWG should generally be the collection tool of last resort  because AWG will only allow the government to receive up to 15 percent of  a person's disposable wages as long as the person is employed.", "The collection procedures FMS has provided to PCA contractors require  that they attempt first, to collect the entire debt by having the debtor pay  the debt in full with one payment; second, to establish an acceptable  payment plan that pays the debt in full; third, to establish an acceptable  one-time compromise agreement; and fourth, to establish a compromise  agreement that is paid off in 6 months.  The \u201cAWG Operations &  Procedures Manual\u201d does not incorporate the use of AWG in conjunction  with other debt collection tools as leverage to obtain payment in full, a  repayment plan, or a more favorable compromise amount and payment  schedule.", "The potential leverage of AWG and related collections may be delayed if  agencies do not refer debts to FMS as soon as possible.  Based on FMS\u2019s  established procedures for cross-servicing, debts agencies refer to FMS  would typically age at least another 90 days before issuance of the AWG  notice to the debtor and 120 days before issuance of the garnishment order  to the employer.  FMS first attempts to collect referred debts for 30 days at  its governmentwide debt collection center before referring the debt to a  PCA.  Assuming that FMS\u2019s cross-servicing activities operate in a manner  consistent with the schedule in its manual, after referral, debts would  generally remain with the PCA to be pursued using other collection tools  for another 60 days before the agency could request FMS\u2019s approval to mail  the AWG notice.  Debts would age another 30 days before the AWG package  could be sent to the debtor\u2019s employer.", "The four surveyed agencies that said they would rely primarily on FMS to  implement AWG (USDA, DOE, HUD, VA) do not forward debts to FMS for  cross-servicing until they are at least 61 days delinquent.  Some debts are  more than 180 days delinquent when they are sent to FMS.  In response to  our survey, USDA and DOE indicated that the delinquency timeframe for  referring debts to FMS varies by field office.  For DOE, debts range from 61  to 180 days delinquent at the time of referral to FMS.  USDA did not provide  the range of delinquency for debts referred to FMS.  HUD indicated that it  currently refers debts to FMS for cross-servicing when they are from 121 to  180 days delinquent.  VA indicated that it refers debts to FMS when they are  more than 180 days delinquent.  Since PCAs will typically use AWG as a  debt collection tool of last resort under FMS\u2019s cross-servicing program,  debts of agencies that rely primarily on FMS to implement AWG will be, at a  minimum, more than 150 days delinquent (i.e., 61 days at referral plus 30  days at FMS plus 60 days at the PCA) before the notice is sent to the debtor.  These debts will be more than 180 days delinquent (because an additional  30 days will transpire after the notice is mailed to the debtor) before wage  garnishment begins.  If the debtor requests a hearing within the required  time frame, wage garnishment could be delayed as much as 60 additional  days pending a hearing decision.", "It is important to note that, regardless of what the surveyed agencies told  us about when they are referring debts to FMS for cross-servicing, DCIA  does not require agencies to refer debts to FMS until they are 180 days  delinquent.  Moreover, as previously mentioned, agencies have not in the  past promptly referred all eligible debts that are 180 days delinquent to  FMS.  According to FMS data, as of September 30, 2001, more than 50  percent of debt referred for cross-servicing governmentwide was more  than 2 years delinquent at the time of referral.  As we have previously  testified, industry statistics have shown that the likelihood of recovering  amounts owed on a debt decreases dramatically as the age of the debt  increases.  Although FMS officials told us that the age of delinquency has  no bearing on what can be collected using AWG, this view ignores AWG\u2019s  potential to motivate debtors to pay their debt in full, to enter into a  repayment plan for the full amount, or to agree on a compromised amount.  The old adage that \u201ctime is money\u201d is very relevant to the application of  AWG to delinquent debts.  Therefore, whenever possible, eligible debts  should be referred promptly to FMS for cross-servicing, even prior to the  180-day delinquency threshold established by DCIA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Surveyed Agencies Lacked Comprehensive Implementation Plans and Regulations", "paragraphs": ["If AWG\u2019s potential for boosting collections on delinquent debts is to be  realized, agencies must develop clear implementation plans and  regulations that are consistent with those issued by Treasury.

Agencies should refer such debts prior  to the 180-day delinquency threshold when practicable.", "We also recommend that the commissioner of FMS modify FMS\u2019s \u201cAWG  Operations & Procedures Manual\u201d to incorporate the use of AWG in  conjunction with other debt collection tools, when practicable, as leverage  to obtain payments from delinquent debtors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["Each of the 10 agencies covered by our report responded to our request for  comments.  We received a combination of written and oral comments from  the 9 agencies we surveyed and written comments from FMS.  Letters with  comments from FMS, Education, HHS, HUD, SBA, SSA, and VA are  reprinted and discussed in further detail, when applicable, in the  appendixes.  Eight of the 9 agencies we surveyed either stated that they  agreed with our report or indirectly indicated some level of agreement by  describing their efforts to implement one or more of our recommendations.  Several of these provided updates to their responses to our survey  document that was in large part the basis for this report.  We modified our  report to reflect stated changes in how agencies expected to implement  AWG and any related schedule changes.  We also incorporated a number of  technical suggestions as appropriate.  The 9th agency, EPA, stated that  appropriate staff reviewed the report and the agency did not have any  comments.", "The only explicit disagreement on our recommendations was expressed by  FMS.  While saying it strongly agreed that agencies relying on FMS to  implement AWG should refer debts promptly to FMS for cross-servicing, it  disagreed with our recommendation concerning its timing and philosophy  in applying AWG.  We recommended that FMS modify its \u201cAWG Operations  & Procedures Manual\u201d to incorporate the use of AWG in conjunction with  other debt collection tools, when practicable, as leverage to obtain  payments from delinquent debtors.  FMS stated that PCA officials cannot  threaten an action unless they actually intend to take it and FMS policy  requires that AWG only be used when all other attempts at collection have  been exhausted.  FMS acknowledged that its policy does allow expedited  use of AWG in defined circumstances but said it continues to believe that  AWG should be used only when all other collection attempts have been  unsuccessful and the debtor has been given every opportunity to otherwise  resolve the debt.", "We did not recommend that FMS threaten debtors with the use of AWG  with no intention of using it.  Rather, if upon contacting the debtor, FMS  could not obtain payment in full or a satisfactory repayment agreement,  our view was that FMS or its PCA contractor could immediately initiate  AWG.  The intent would be to use AWG alone or in conjunction with other  debt collection tools to liquidate the debt.  Although FMS policy currently  prescribes that its PCAs use AWG only after all other collection efforts have  been exhausted, neither current law nor regulation contemplates that only  one collection tool may be used at a time.  In fact, the AWG regulations  specifically state that agencies may pursue other debt collection remedies  separately or in conjunction with AWG.  As stated in our report, viewing  AWG only as a collection tool of last resort ignores AWG\u2019s potential to  motivate debtors to pay their debt in full, to enter into a repayment plan for  the full amount, or to agree on a compromise amount.  In our view,  deferring the notice of intended use negates a major benefit mentioned by  experts on the utility of AWG.  Their main point was that invoking the  possibility of use could influence those who otherwise might not respond  to a request for payment, or to actually pay, to do so because they do not  wish employers to become aware that they have delinquent federal debt.", "FMS stated that it allows its PCAs under certain circumstances to initiate  the AWG process before the expiration of the 60-day period following  receipt of referred debt from other federal agencies.  Our recommendation  contemplates that such action should be the norm rather than the  exception.  As mentioned in our report, according to FMS data, more than  50 percent of debt referred for cross-servicing governmentwide as of  September 30, 2001, was more than 2 years delinquent at the time of  referral.  Moreover, agencies are not required to send debts to FMS until  they are more than 180 days delinquent.  Consequently, FMS in most cases  is not the first federal agency to attempt collection from or debt resolution  with the debtors because creditor agencies should be attempting to collect  their delinquent debts prior to sending them to FMS for cross-servicing.  For FMS to wait until it or its PCA contractors have exhausted all  collection efforts prior to initiating AWG by notifying the debtor that such  action will be taken greatly diminishes AWG\u2019s potential to help FMS  leverage payment from debtors who are significantly delinquent on their  obligations to the federal government and who likely had not cooperated  with the referring federal agencies in resolving their debts.", "Finally, while there may be differences of opinion on when FMS should  initiate AWG in its collection process, HUD in its comments on our report  spoke in favor of our recommendation to FMS that FMS should incorporate  the use of AWG in conjunction with other debt collection tools rather than  consider AWG as a collection tool of \u201clast resort.\u201d  In developing its own  implementation plan for AWG, HUD said that it expected that effective use  of AWG would be part of FMS\u2019s plan for servicing debt referred for cross- servicing.  In that light, HUD said that it would expect that those assigned  to cross-service debts would be encouraged to use AWG as a tool to obtain  voluntary payment.", "This view from HUD aptly summarizes our position and is a key aspect of  the reasoning behind our recommendation that FMS use AWG in  conjunction with other collection tools and not principally as a last resort.  For the reasons offered above, we continue to believe that FMS should  modify its \u201cAWG Operations & Procedures Manual\u201d and policy with regard  to the use of AWG.", "As agreed with your office, unless you announce its contents earlier, we  plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after its issuance  date.
