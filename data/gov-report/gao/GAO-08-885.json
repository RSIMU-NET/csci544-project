Some praise LBOs for creating new governance structures for companies and providing longer term investment opportunities for investors. Others criticize LBOs for causing job losses and burdening companies with too much debt. This report addresses the (1) effect of recent private equity LBOs on acquired companies and employment, (2) impact of LBOs jointly undertaken by two or more private equity funds on competition, (3) Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) oversight of private equity funds and their advisers, and (4) regulatory oversight of commercial and investment banks that have financed recent LBOs. GAO reviewed academic research, analyzed recent LBO data, conducted case studies, reviewed regulators' policy documents and examinations, and interviewed regulatory and industry officials, and academics."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Academic research that GAO reviewed generally suggests that recent private equity LBOs have had a positive impact on the financial performance of the acquired companies, but determining whether the impact resulted from the actions taken by the private equity firms versus other factors is difficult. The research also indicates that private equity LBOs are associated with lower employment growth than comparable companies. However, uncertainty remains about the employment effect--in part because, as one study found, target companies had lower employment growth before being acquired. Further research may shed light on the causal relationship between private equity and employment growth, if any. Private equity firms have increasingly joined together to acquire target companies (called \"club deals\"). In 2007, there were 28 club deals, totaling about $217 billion in value. Club deals could reduce or increase the number of firms bidding on a target company and, thus, affect competition. In analyzing 325 public-to-private LBOs done from 1998 through 2007, GAO generally found no statistical indication that club deals, in aggregate, were associated with lower or higher prices paid for the target companies, after controlling for differences in the targets. However, our results do not rule out the possibility of parties engaging in illegal behavior in any particular LBO. Indeed, according to securities filings and media reports, some large club deals have led to lawsuits and an inquiry into the practice by the Department of Justice. Because private equity funds and their advisers typically claim an exemption from registration as an investment company or investment adviser, respectively, SEC exercises limited oversight of these entities. However, in examining some registered advisers to private equity funds, SEC has found some control weaknesses but generally has not found such funds to pose significant concerns for fund investors. The growth in LBOs has led to greater regulatory scrutiny. SEC, along with other regulators, has identified conflicts of interest arising in LBOs as a potential concern and is analyzing the issue. Before 2007, federal financial regulators generally found that the major institutions that financed LBOs were managing the associated risks. However, after problems with subprime mortgages spilled over to other markets in mid-2007, the institutions were being exposed to greater-than-expected risk. As a result, the regulators reassessed the institutions' risk-management practices and identified some weaknesses. The regulators are monitoring efforts being taken to address weaknesses and considering the need to issue related guidance. While the institutions have taken steps to decrease their risk exposures, the spillover effects from the subprime mortgage problems to leveraged loans illustrate the importance of understanding and monitoring conditions in the broader markets, including connections between them. Failure to do so could limit the effectiveness and ability of regulators to address issues when they occur."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the past several years, an increase in buyouts of U.S. companies by  private equity funds has rekindled controversy about the potential impact  of these deals. Such funds borrow significant amounts from banks to  finance their deals\u2014increasing the debt-to-equity ratio of the acquired  companies and giving rise to the term \u201cleveraged buyouts\u201d (LBO). From  2000 through 2007, private equity funds acquired nearly 3,000 companies,  with a value totaling more than $1 trillion. Helping to fuel the increase in  LBOs has been a strong demand for private equity investments by pension  plans and other institutional investors and relatively low borrowing rates,  according to market observers. Some academics and others view such  LBOs as revolutionizing corporate ownership by creating new funding  options and corporate governance structures, as well as by providing  investors with attractive, longer term investment opportunities. However,  some labor unions and academics have a less favorable view\u2014criticizing  LBOs for harming workers, such as through job losses and lower benefits;  providing private equity fund managers with, in effect, a tax subsidy; or  burdening companies with too much debt.", "The operations of private equity firms and the funds that they manage  generally are subject to limited federal and state regulation, but the  transactions done by the funds may be subject to a number of federal and  state regulations depending on the nature of the transaction. LBOs  generally involve the takeover of a corporation. State corporation statutes  impose broad obligations and specific procedural requirements on a  corporation\u2019s board of directors with respect to the sale or change of  control of a corporation. For example, directors have an obligation to act  in the best interest of the corporation\u2019s shareholders, and the discharge of  that duty may require taking steps to resist a takeover that they reasonably  believe is contrary to the best interests of the corporation and its  shareholders. Also, in certain circumstances, directors are required to  maximize shareholder value and are precluded from considering the  interests of any groups other than the shareholders. Furthermore,  takeover transactions that involve proxy solicitations, tender offers, or  new securities offerings are subject to federal securities laws. Under the  Clayton Act, persons contemplating certain large takeover transactions  must give advance notice of the proposed transaction to the Federal Trade  Commission and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice  and wait a designated time before consummating the transactions.", "Around mid-2007, the credit markets for LBOs contracted sharply and  brought new LBO activity to a near standstill, especially for larger deals.  This contraction has raised significant challenges for some banks because  of their commitments to help finance pending LBOs but difficulties in  finding investors to buy such debt. Nonetheless, market participants  generally expect private equity-sponsored LBOs to continue to occur but  at slower rate in light of the billions of dollars that private equity funds  raised from investors in 2006 and 2007. Given that private equity- sponsored LBOs are expected to continue to be an important part of the  U.S. capital markets and your interest in the oversight of such activity, you  asked us to address the following objectives:    determine what effect the recent wave of private equity-sponsored LBOs  had on acquired companies and employment, based largely on a review of  recent academic research;   analyze how the collaboration of two or more private equity firms in  undertaking an LBO (called a club deal) could promote or reduce  competition, and what legal issues have club deals raised; review how the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has overseen  private equity firms engaged in LBOs under the federal securities laws; and review how the federal financial regulators have overseen U.S. commercial  and investment banks that have helped finance the recent LBOs.", "In addition, we provide information on pension plan investments in private  equity in appendix II and information on the tax treatment of private  equity firm profits in appendix III. We also present case studies to  illustrate various aspects of five LBOs in appendixes IV through IX.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed and analyzed relevant  examinations and related guidance and documents from the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), the Federal  Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY), the Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency (OCC), and SEC. We reviewed academic research that included  analysis of recent LBOs. We also analyzed merger-and-acquisition,  syndicated loan, and related data from Dealogic, which compiles data on  mergers and acquisitions, as well as the debt and equity capital markets.  Dealogic estimates that it captures about 95 percent of private equity  transactions from 1995 forward but is missing the value of some of the  deals when such information is unobtainable. We assessed the procedures  that Dealogic uses to collect and analyze data and determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We also analyzed relevant laws  and regulations, regulatory filings, speeches, testimonies, studies, articles,  and our reports. We interviewed staff representing the U.S. regulators  identified above and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the  Department of the Treasury, and the Department of Justice. We also  selected and interviewed representatives from 2 large commercial banks  and 3 large investment banks based on their significant role in helping to  finance LBOs; 11 private equity firms of various sizes to obtain the views  of small, medium, and large firms; 3 credit rating agencies that have  analyzed leveraged loans or recent LBOs; a trade association representing  private equity firms; 2 associations representing institutional investors that  invest in private equity funds; 4 academics who have done considerable  research on LBOs; 2 labor unions based on their concerns about private  equity-sponsored LBOs; and a consulting firm that analyzed the private  equity market. We selected five LBOs for in-depth case study to illustrate  various aspects of such transactions that ranged in size and scope of the  target companies, level and type of debt used to finance the transaction, or  degree to which the news media focused on the transaction. We  conducted this performance audit from August 2007 to September 2008 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. Appendix I provides a detailed description  of our objectives, scope, and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["A private equity-sponsored LBO generally is defined as an investment by a  private equity fund in a public or private company (or division of a  company) for majority or complete ownership. Since 2000, the number  and value of LBOs of U.S. target companies completed by private equity  funds have increased significantly, as shown in table 1. According to  market observers, three major factors converged to spur this growth: (1)  the increased interest in private equity investments by pension plans and  other institutional investors; (2) the attractiveness of some publicly traded  companies, owing to relatively low debt and inexpensively priced shares;  and (3) the growth in the global debt market, permitting borrowing at  relatively low rates. As discussed below, credit market problems surfacing  in mid-2007 have led to a significant slowdown in LBOs by private equity  funds.", "As the private equity industry has grown, private equity-sponsored LBOs  have become an increasingly significant subset of all merger-and- acquisition activity\u2014accounting for about 3 percent of the total value of  U.S. mergers and acquisitions in 2000 but growing to nearly 28 percent in  2007. In recent years, large buyouts of publicly traded companies, valued  in the tens of billions of dollars, have received considerable public  attention. Such deals, however, are not representative of most private  equity-sponsored LBOs. For example, among nearly 3,000 private equity- sponsored LBOs we identified from 2000 through 2007, the median deal  value was $92.3 million, according to Dealogic data. In addition, LBOs of  publicly traded companies (called \u201cpublic-to-private\u201d buyouts) accounted  for about 13 percent of the total number of buyouts during this period but  about 58 percent of the total value of the buyouts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Private Equity-Sponsored LBOs Have Evolved Since the 1980s", "paragraphs": ["Since the 1980s, private equity-sponsored LBOs have changed in a number  of ways. Some LBOs in the 1980s were called \u201chostile takeovers,\u201d because  they were done over the objections of a target company\u2019s management or  board of directors. Few of the recent LBOs appear to have been hostile  based on available data. Two private equity executives told us that their  fund investors, such as pension plans, typically do not want to be  associated with hostile takeovers. In such cases, the private equity  partnership agreements include a provision prohibiting the fund from  undertaking certain acquisitions. Another way in which the private  equity-sponsored LBOs have changed is that the scope of LBOs has  expanded to include a wider range of industries\u2014not only manufacturing  and retail\u2014but also financial services, technology, and health care. In  addition, private equity funds have expanded their strategies for enhancing  the value of their acquired companies. In the 1980s, LBO funds sought to  create value through so-called \u201cfinancial and governance engineering,\u201d  such as by restructuring a company\u2019s debt-to-equity ratio and changing  management incentives. Later, the acquiring firms sought to improve  operations to increase cash flow or profitability. Today, private equity  firms often use a combination of these strategies. Finally, the size of  private equity funds and buyouts has increased. For example, the 10  largest funds\u2014ranging in size from about $8 billion to $21 billion\u2014were  created since 2005, according to a news media report. Similarly, 9 of the 10  largest buyouts in history were completed in 2006 or later."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overview of an LBO Transaction by a Private Equity Fund", "paragraphs": ["As illustrated in figure 1, a typical private equity-sponsored LBO of a target  company and subsequent sale of the company takes place in several stages  and over several years.", "In the first stage, a private equity firm creates a private equity fund and  obtains commitments from investors (limited partners) to provide capital  to its fund. Later, when the firm undertakes buyouts, it calls on the  investors to provide the capital. Investors in private equity funds typically  include public and corporate pension plans, endowments and foundations,  insurance companies, and wealthy individuals. (See app. II for additional  information on the investment in private equity by pension plans.) As  shown in figure 2, private equity funds have increased their capital  commitments from around $0.4 billion (inflation adjusted) in 1980 to  nearly $185 billion (inflation adjusted) in 2007.", "In the second stage, the private equity firm identifies potential companies  for its fund to acquire. According to private equity executives, their firms  routinely research companies and industries to stay abreast of  developments and to identify potential acquisitions. Moreover, they make  regular contact with managers or owners of both potential targets and  other companies. Two private equity executives told us it can take years of  contacts before managers or owners might agree to sell. Further, private  equity firms can spend significant amounts of time and money to research  potential targets, including incurring costs for consulting and other  professional fees. In addition to using their own contacts, private equity  firms identify potential targets through investment banks, attorneys, and  other such intermediaries. Companies interested in selling frequently hire  investment banks or other advisers to help them sell their companies.", "In the third stage, the private equity firm obtains a loan commitment,  typically from commercial or investment banks, that it then uses to help  finance its fund\u2019s acquisition of the target company. A loan commitment is  a promise by the lender to make available in the future a specified amount  of credit under specified terms and conditions. Loans are an essential  component of an LBO because private equity firms typically contribute  through their funds only a fraction of the capital needed to complete a  takeover. The use of borrowed money, or debt capital, makes up the  difference. Importantly, the legal agreements supporting the debt financing  are often between the lender and target company, not the private equity  firm. In 2000, private equity LBOs were financed, on average, with 41  percent equity and 59 percent debt, according to a consulting firm report.  By 2005, LBOs became more leveraged, with the average deal financed  with 34 percent equity and 66 percent debt.", "Private equity executives told us they typically seek offers for loan  commitments from multiple banks in an effort to obtain the best terms  through competition. If its offer to buy a target company is accepted, a  private equity firm will select one of the loan commitment offers, which  the respective bank will fund at the time the acquisition is to be  completed. LBO loans commonly are syndicated loans\u2014meaning that they  are shared by a group of banks and other lenders. The lead bank finds  potential lenders and arranges the terms of the loan on behalf of the  syndicate, which can include commercial or investment banks and  institutional investors, such as mutual and hedge funds and insurance  companies. However, each lender has a separate credit agreement with  the borrower for the lender\u2019s portion of the syndicated loan. Further,  syndicated loans can be categorized as investment grade or leveraged  loans. Syndicated loans for LBOs typically are leveraged loans, reflecting  the lesser creditworthiness of the borrowers.", "In the fourth stage, after completing its buyout of the target company, the  private equity firm seeks to improve the financial and operational  performance of the acquired company. The aim is to increase the value of  the company, so that the private equity firm can sell the company (fifth  stage) at a profit and earn a return for its fund investors. (We discuss in  detail how private equity firms seek to improve the performance of their  acquired companies in the following section of this report.)", "In the fifth stage, the private equity firm exits its fund\u2019s investment by  selling its acquired company. Private equity funds typically hold an  acquired company from 3 to 5 years before trying to realize their return. A  private equity fund typically has a fixed life of 10 years, generally giving  the private equity firm 5 years to invest the capital raised for its fund and 5  years to return the capital and expected profits to its fund investors.  Executives told us they often have an exit strategy in mind when their  firms buy a company. The executives identified the following options to  exit their LBOs:    make an IPO of stock;    sell to a \u201cstrategic\u201d buyer, or a corporation (as opposed to a financial    sell to another private equity firm; or    sell to a \u201cspecial purpose acquisition company,\u201d which is a publicly traded  \u201cshell\u201d company that allows its sponsor to raise capital through an IPO for  use in seeking to acquire an operating company within a fixed time  frame."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Research Suggests Recent LBOs Have Generally Had a Positive Impact on the Financial Performance of Acquired Companies, but LBOs Were Associated with Lower Employment Growth", "paragraphs": ["Academic research on recent LBOs by private equity firms suggests that  the impact of these transactions on the financial performance of acquired  companies generally has been positive, but these buyouts have been  associated with lower employment growth at the acquired companies. The  research generally shows that private equity-owned companies  outperformed similar companies across certain financial benchmarks, but  it is often difficult to determine whether the higher performance resulted  from the actions taken by the private equity firms. Private equity  executives told us that they seek to improve the operations of their  acquired companies through various strategies, but some observers  question whether such strategies improve performance. Some evidence  suggests that private equity firms improve efficiency by better aligning the  incentives of management with those of owners. We also found some  evidence that recent private equity-sponsored LBOs were associated with  lower employment growth than comparable companies. However,  uncertainty remains about the impact of such buyouts on employment, in  part because, as one study found, target companies had lower employment  growth than their peers before acquisition."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Private Equity-Owned Companies Usually Outperformed Similar Companies Based on Several Financial Benchmarks", "paragraphs": ["Academic studies analyzing LBOs done in the 2000s suggest that private  equity-owned companies usually outperformed similar companies not  owned by private equity firms across a number of benchmarks, such as  profitability, innovation, and the returns to investors in IPOs. Recent  research finding that private equity-owned companies generally  outperformed other companies is consistent with prior research analyzing  earlier LBOs. However, it is often difficult to determine why the  differences in economic performance occur. Specifically, because private  equity firms choose their buyout targets, it is difficult to determine  whether the performance of the acquired companies after the buyout  resulted more from the characteristics of the chosen companies or actions  of the private equity firms. Executives of a private equity trade group told  us that private equity firms typically choose their targets from among four  general categories: (1) underperforming or declining companies; (2)  \u201corphan\u201d divisions of large corporations\u2014that is, a division outside a  company\u2019s core business that may be neglected as a result; (3) family  businesses, where family owners are looking to exit; and (4)  fundamentally sound businesses that nevertheless need an injection of  capital to grow. The executives also said that private equity firms may  specialize by industry. Other common limitations of academic studies are  samples of buyouts that are small or not representative of all LBOs,  resulting from the general lack of available data on private equity  activities. Moreover, most empirical work on buyouts in the 2000s is based  on European data because more data on privately held companies are  available in Europe.", "Comparing private equity-owned companies to other companies of similar  size in the same industry in the United Kingdom, one study found that  operating profitability was higher at private equity-owned companies.  Similarly, two studies, one of U.S. LBOs and the other of European LBOs,  found that growth in profitability was higher at companies owned by  private equity firms. A study of U.S. patents found that private equity- owned companies pursued more economically important innovations, as  measured by how often the patents are cited by later patent filings, than  similar companies. This finding also suggests that private equity-owned  companies are willing to undertake research activities that can require a  large up-front cost but yield benefits in the longer term. An analysis of 428  IPOs of private equity-owned companies in the United States between 1980  and 2002 found that they consistently outperformed other IPOs and the  stock market as a whole, over 3- and 5-year time horizons. A study of the  IPO market in the United Kingdom, covering 1992 to 2004, found that  returns on the first day of the offering of 198 private equity-owned IPOs  were on average lower than other IPOs, although 3-year returns (excluding  the first day) were higher than other IPOs. Regarding LBOs\u2019 potentially  broader impact on public equity markets, critics have expressed concern  about the loss of transparency when public companies are taken private,  since the bought-out companies cease making securities filings required of  publicly held companies. However, one study of LBOs and their exits  from 1970 to 2002 found that 6.3 percent of private equity-sponsored LBOs  were public-to-private transactions, but 11 percent of the exits, or sales, of  the acquired companies by private equity firms were accomplished  through an IPO. This study suggests that \u201creverse LBO\u201d transactions  resulted in more companies entering public markets during this period  than exiting following private equity acquisitions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Private Equity LBOs Seek to Enhance Performance through Techniques Such as Improving Management Incentives", "paragraphs": ["According to the standard economic rationale for buyouts, LBOs enhance  value because, among other things, the debt used to finance the buyout  forces management to operate more efficiently, and private equity owners  vary compensation schemes to better align management incentives with  owners. For example, greater debt can limit management\u2019s ability to  undertake wasteful investments because free cash flow is committed to  service the debt. Also, providing management with a higher ownership  stake in the company can link its compensation more closely to  shareholder returns. Academic research analyzing the share price  premium that private equity firms pay to shareholders over market prices  in public-to-private buyouts is consistent with this view. Studies have  shown that the buyout premium averages 20-40 percent over stock prices  preceding a takeover. In theory, the premium paid over market prices  should reflect the enhanced value private equity firms expect to realize  after a buyout. One study of UK buyouts estimated an average premium  of 40 percent, and found that higher premiums were associated with lower  recent share price performance, lower leverage, and lower management  equity stakes at target companies. A study of buyouts in European  countries reported an average premium of 36 percent and also found that  higher premiums were associated with lower recent share price  performance at targets, as well as less concentrated ownership among  external shareholders. Finally, a study of U.S. buyouts done from 1995  through 2007 found average premiums of roughly 25 percent in public-to- private LBOs. Similarly, our analysis of public-to-private transactions  from the Dealogic database determined that the average premium paid to  shareholders in private equity-sponsored LBOs in the United States from  January 2000 through October 2007 was about 22 percent. Our analysis  also corroborated studies of European buyouts in finding that lower  premiums were associated with more concentrated ownership (in the  form of management or external shareholders) in U.S. publicly traded  companies prior to acquisition by private equity firms. On the whole, these  results suggest that private equity buyers anticipate greater value  enhancement in target companies when existing shareholders are more  dispersed and thus have less incentive to monitor or improve  performance.", "Executives from private equity firms told us that improving the financial  performance of their acquired companies is a key objective. The intent is  to allow the companies, when later sold during the exit phase of the  private equity cycle, to command a price sufficient to provide the desired  returns to a private equity fund\u2019s investors. The executives told us they use  strategies that include the following:  formulating strategic plans to monitor progress and performance; retooling of manufacturing or other operations for greater efficiency; reducing the workforce to cut costs;   acquiring other businesses that complement the acquired company\u2019s  reducing the cost of goods and supplies by consolidating purchasing;   selling nonperforming lines of business; and    developing new sources of revenue and improving marketing and sales for  good, but under-supported, products.", "We found that the private equity firms included in our case studies used  some of these strategies in an effort to improve the financial performance  of their acquired companies. For example, the private equity owners of  Samsonite sought to reinvigorate the company\u2019s image and products, in  part by creating a new label for higher priced luggage and implementing a  high-end marketing campaign. (See app. IX for discussion of this buyout.)  As another example, following their buyout of Hertz, the private equity  firms involved sought not only to reduce costs by buying more cars for the  company\u2019s fleet, rather than leasing them, but also to increase the  company\u2019s share of the leisure car rental segment partly by creating self- service kiosks for customers. (See app. VI for discussion of this buyout.)  Also, to increase revenues, the private equity owners of Nordco acquired a  competitor as an add-on acquisition. (See app. VIII for discussion of this  buyout.)", "According to the private equity executives, they typically do not become  involved in the day-to-day management of the acquired companies; rather,  they exercise influence at the board level, such as by setting policies and  goals. For example, after the Hertz takeover, the lead private equity firm  installed one of its partners as the Chairman of the board of directors.  However, executives said they will replace an acquired company\u2019s senior  management, if necessary. As owners of private companies, the executives  said they can make strategic decisions that might be more difficult for  public companies, given their focus on quarterly earnings performance.  ShopKo\u2019s new private equity owners, for instance, planned to spend about  $70 million annually\u2014up from about $35 million in the year before the  takeover\u2014to remodel the stores. (See app. VII for discussion of this  buyout.) Overall, the executives said that boosting their companies\u2019  performance rests more on improving operations and less on financial  engineering, such as the use of debt to leverage returns and the tax  deductibility of interest on such debt.", "Altering compensation schemes is another important strategy for  improving financial performance, according to the private equity  executives we interviewed. Executives of one private equity firm told us  that aligning incentives is a primary strategy they use to boost the  performance of their companies. The firm has acquired companies that  were divisions of larger companies, but the incentives of the division  management were tied to the performance of the companies, not to the  divisions. According to the executives, the key is providing management  with equity ownership in a specific area over which managers have  control. They note that when incentives are properly aligned, managers  tend to work harder and improve profitability. Similarly, in the Nordco  buyout, the private equity firm has sought to give the management team an  opportunity to own a significant portion of the company and expects  management to own 30 percent of the company by the time it exits the  investment.", "Another area that has received considerable attention has been the use of  debt by private equity firms. Overall, several executives told us that  boosting their companies\u2019 performance rests more on improving  operations and less on financial engineering, but we did not independently  assess such assertions. Private equity executives told us debt financing  plays an important role in private equity transactions, but it is not in their  interest to overburden a target company with debt. According to the  executives, if an acquired company cannot meet its debt payments, it risks  bankruptcy; in turn, the private equity fund risks losing the equity it has  invested. If that happens, the private equity fund will be unable to return  profits to its limited partner investors. Moreover, such a failure would  cause reputation damage to the private equity firm, making it harder for  the firm to attract investors for its successor funds. While default rates on  loans associated with private equity have remained at historically low  levels, one credit rating agency found that being acquired by a private  equity fund increases default risk for some firms. However, the extent to  which LBO and other firms will suffer financial distress under the current  credit cycle remains to be seen.", "Some market observers question how and the extent to which private  equity firms improve their acquired companies. For example, a credit  rating agency acknowledged that private equity firms are not driven by the  pressure of publicly reporting quarterly earnings but questioned whether  the firms are investing over a longer horizon than public companies. A  labor union agreed, saying even if a private equity firm planned to hold an  acquired company from 3 to 5 years, that period would not be long enough  to avoid pressure to forego long-term investment and improvements. The  rating agency also questioned whether there was sufficient evidence to  support claims that private equity returns were driven by stronger  management rather than by the use of the then readily available, low-cost  debt to leverage returns. Similarly, a recent study estimates that private  equity firms do not earn their income primarily by enhancing the value of  their companies. The study, based on one large investor\u2019s experience  with, among other investments, 144 private equity buyout funds, estimated  that private equity firms earned about twice as much income from  management fees as from profits realized from acquired companies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Private Equity-Sponsored LBOs Were Associated with Lower Employment Growth, but Causation Is Difficult to Establish", "paragraphs": ["Our review of academic research found that recent private equity LBOs  are associated with lower employment growth than comparable  companies, but a number of factors make causation difficult to establish.  Labor unions have expressed concern about the potential for a buyout to  leave the acquired company financially weakened because of its increased  debt and, in turn, to prompt the private equity firm to cut jobs or slow the  pace of job creation. At the same time, job cuts may be necessary to  improve efficiency. One study of private equity LBOs in the United  Kingdom found that the acquired companies have lower wage and  employment growth than non-LBO companies. Research on U.S. buyouts  in the 1980s also found that LBOs were associated with slower  employment growth than their peers. In addition, a comprehensive study  of roughly 5,000 U.S. buyouts from 1980 to 2005 found that private equity- owned \u201cestablishments\u201d (that is, the physical locations of companies) had  slower job growth than comparable establishments in the 3 years after an  LBO, but slightly higher job growth in the fourth and fifth years. The net  effect of these changes is lower employment growth than comparable  establishments in the 5 years after the LBOs. Furthermore, private equity- owned companies undertake more acquisitions and divestitures and are  more likely to shut down existing establishments and open new ones. The  researchers noted that these results suggest private equity owners have a  greater willingness to restructure the company and disrupt the status quo  in an effort to improve efficiency. However, the study also found that  target establishments were underperforming their peers in employment  growth prior to acquisition. This suggests that LBO targets are different  from non-LBO companies prior to acquisition, making it difficult to  attribute differences in employment outcomes after acquisition to private  equity. Further uncertainty is due to the limited number of academic  studies of the impact of recent buyouts on employment and difficulty  faced by the studies in isolating the specific impact of private equity.", "Private equity executives told us that a chief concern generally is  improving efficiency, not necessarily job creation. For example,  executives from one private equity firm said that following an acquisition,  the acquired company eliminated 300 jobs after a $100 million spending  reduction in one department. Although jobs were lost, the executives said  it is important to realize that the goal was to produce an overall stronger  company. Executives from another private equity firm told us that  following an acquisition, employment fell when it closed some outlets. But  at the same time, jobs were created elsewhere when new outlets were  opened. One private equity executive told us that while his firm is  sympathetic to calls to do such things as offer health insurance to workers  at acquired companies, \u201cmarket economics\u201d sometimes stands as a barrier,  because to do so would produce unacceptably lower investment returns.  This challenge, however, is not unique to private equity-owned companies.  As illustrated by our case studies, strategies implemented after a buyout  can lead to either employment growth or loss. Of the five buyouts we  studied, two experienced job growth, while three experienced job losses  (see apps. V through IX).

Some have expressed  concern that club deals could depress acquisition prices by reducing the  number of firms bidding on target companies. However, others have  posited that club deals could increase the number of potential buyers by  enabling firms that could not individually bid on a target company to do so  through a club. In addition, sellers of target companies, as well as potential  buyers, can initiate club deals. In an econometric analysis of publicly  traded companies acquired by public equity firms, we generally found no  indication that club deals, in the aggregate, were associated with lower or  higher per-share price premiums paid for the target companies, after  controlling for differences among target companies. (A premium is the  amount by which the per-share acquisition price exceeds the then-current  market price; private equity buyouts of public companies typically take  place at a premium.)

These club deals involve two or more private  equity firms pooling their resources, including their expertise and their  investment funds\u2019 capital, to jointly acquire a target company. From 2000  through 2007, we identified 2,994 private equity-sponsored LBOs of U.S.  companies, based on Dealogic data, of which 493, or about 16 percent,  were club deals. These club deals accounted for $463.1 billion, or about 44  percent, of the $1.05 trillion in total LBO deal value we identified. As  shown in table 2, club deals have grown substantially both in number and  value since 2004, particularly club deals involving companies valued at $1  billion or more. Between 2000 and 2007, there were 80 club deals valued at  $1 billion or more\u2014accounting for about 16 percent of the total number of  all club deals but almost 90 percent of the total value of the club deals.  These large club deals peaked in 2007, with 28 deals valued at about $217  billion. Among the club deals we identified, the number of private equity  firms collaborating on a transaction ranged from two to seven.", "According to private equity executives, the principal reason they formed  clubs to buy companies was that their funds did not have sufficient capital  to make the purchase alone or were restricted from investing more than a  specified portion of their capital in a single deal. For example, an  executive of a large private equity firm told us that, under its agreements  with limited partners, the fund may invest no more than 25 percent of its  total capital in any one deal, which equated to a limit of $750 million for its  then-current fund. Another executive said his firm stops short of such  formal limits. For example, even though its per-investment limit in a recent  fund also was $750 million, the executive said, the firm limited its  investment in one acquisition to $500 million because that was thought to  be more prudent. Because of these constraints, the firms needed to  partner with other private equity firms to make recent acquisitions  requiring several billion dollars in equity. Other factors leading private  equity firms to pursue club deals, according to executives and academics,  include the benefits of pooling resources for the pre-buyout due diligence  research that private equity firms perform, which can be costly, and of  getting a \u201csecond opinion\u201d about the value of a potential acquisition.  Several private equity executives told us that club deals promote  competition because they enable bids to be made that would not  otherwise be possible.", "Although more prevalent in recent years, club deals may not always be the  preferred option for private equity firms. According to an academic we  interviewed, this is largely due to control issues. The academic said that  private equity firms joining a club may have to share authority over such  matters as operating decisions, which they otherwise would prefer not to  do. Executives of a large private equity firm agreed, saying that their firm  ordinarily has one of its partners serve as the Chairman of the board of  directors in an acquired company. They said that in a club deal, this could  be a contentious point. An executive of a midsize private equity firm told  us that his firm was offered, but declined, a minority stake in a technology  company buyout because his firm prefers to be in control. A consultant  told us that private equity firms are finding club deals less attractive and,  as a result, turning more frequently to other arrangements, such as  soliciting additional limited partners, including sovereign investors, to  coinvest in deals, rather than coinvesting with another private equity firm.", "Table 3 shows the 10 largest completed club deal LBOs of U.S. target  companies since 2000. As shown, these buyouts have involved companies  in a range of industries. Overall, reflecting their large value, club deal  transactions represent 6 of the 10 largest LBOs done since 2000.", "The extent to which private equity firms were involved in club deals for  large LBOs is shown in figure 3, which depicts the relationships among the  firms involved in the 50 largest U.S. LBOs from 2000 through 2007. These  LBOs had a total value of around $530 billion and involved 33 private  equity firms. Of the 50 LBOs, 31 were club deals. Most (31 of the 33) of the  private equity firms were involved in these club deals. For example, as  shown in the figure, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners (upper left corner)  entered into club deals that involved 14 other private equity firms,  including Apollo Advisors, Blackstone Group, and CCMP Capital.  Moreover, it entered into more than one club deal with some of the other  firms, such as Blackstone Group.", "Private equity executives with whom we spoke had differing opinions on  the future trend in club deals. One executive said that private equity funds  will continue to face constraints in acquiring large companies alone,  suggesting a continued role for club deals. Some noted that private equity  firms have been raising larger funds from limited partner investors and  thus should be able to acquire larger target companies alone. Credit  market conditions will also play an important role, some executives said,  because as long as credit is in relatively tight supply due to the problems  in the credit markets, it will be difficult to get the debt financing necessary  to support large club deals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "LBOs Commonly Involve a Competitive Process and Club Deals Could Support or Undermine This Process", "paragraphs": ["Private equity firms commonly acquire target companies through a  competitive process in which interested parties bid on the target  companies, according to academics, executives of private equity firms, and  commercial and investment bank officials. For example, two private  equity executives said that selling companies or their advisers use an  auction process to try to increase the companies\u2019 sale price. The nature  and formality of the process can vary from deal to deal, depending on the  level of interest in the target company and other factors. For example,  sellers might solicit bids from any interested buyer or ask only select  would-be buyers to bid. After an initial round of offers, bidders judged to  be more capable of working together or bringing a deal to completion  might be invited to submit revised offers. Additionally, even when the  parties have agreed on the principal terms of a buyout transaction,  executives said that the agreement may include a \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision that  allows the seller to seek a better offer from other potential buyers within a  certain period.In general, the auction process and go-shop provision seek  to produce higher sales prices for sellers and to allow sellers to fulfill legal  duties to obtain best prices for their shareholders. Those involved in the  process also note that sellers need not ultimately accept even the highest  bids for their companies, if they believe prices offered are inadequate.", "For LBOs involving an auction process, club deals can be formed by either  buyers or sellers. First, private equity firms can form clubs on their own  before making an offer to buy a target company. For example, executives  of one firm told us that they might approach other firms with whom they  have dealt effectively in a prior deal or who would bring advantageous  experience or skill to the particular deal. An executive of another firm  cited geographic or industry experience that a partner could bring.  Second, the target company or its advisers can play a role in organizing  private equity firms into clubs to bid on the company. For instance, in the  private equity-sponsored LBO of retailer Neiman Marcus, the company\u2019s  adviser organized bidders into four clubs after receipt of an initial round of  proposals. According to the company, it formed the bidders into clubs  because of the size of the transaction and to maximize competition among  the competing groups. (See app. V for additional details about this LBO.)", "Private equity executives said that sellers or their advisers can influence  the formation of bidding clubs by controlling the flow of information.  Before bidding on a target company, potential buyers typically want  detailed information about the company\u2019s operations and finances. Sellers  may provide this information under a nondisclosure agreement, which  bars the potential buyers from discussing such information with others.  Executives from private equity firms told us that by using this control of  information as a lever, sellers sometimes encourage potential buyers to  form clubs for several reasons. A seller may realize that the deal size is too  large for one private equity firm to undertake alone. Also, negotiating the  sale of a company can be time-consuming and distracting, so management  of the target company may wish to limit the number of offers it entertains.  Sellers also might encourage club deals among particular buyers for  strategic purposes; that is, to increase the price paid to acquire their  companies. For example, a seller might pair up a private equity firm  offering a lower bid with another firm offering a higher bid. The  expectation is that as bidding goes forward, prices offered will go up from  earlier bids. Thus, if the starting point for a new round of bids begins at a  higher price, the seller would expect to receive more.", "The recent growth of club deals, particularly the larger ones, has given rise  to questions and concerns about joint bidding\u2019s potential effect on buyout  competition. If each private equity firm that is part of a club deal could and  would bid independently on a target company, but instead chooses to bid  jointly, this could reduce price competition. In an auction process, a  greater number of bidders, all else being equal, should lead to a higher  purchase price. Thus, if club deals lead to fewer bidders participating in an  auction for target companies, then such deals could result in lower prices  paid for target companies than would otherwise be true. Even if joint  bidding does not reduce the number of potential bidders for a particular  target company, club deals could still lead to lower prices paid for target  companies. For example, bidders could collude, such as by agreeing on  which bidder will submit the highest offer and potentially win the auction  and allowing the losing bidder to join in later on the LBO."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Our Analysis Indicates That Public-to-Private Club Deals, in Aggregate, Generally Are Not Associated with Lower or Higher Prices Paid for Target Companies, and the Private Equity Marketplace Is Predisposed to Perform Competitively", "paragraphs": ["To examine the potential effect club deals may have on competition  among private equity firms, we developed an econometric model to  examine prices paid for target companies in a subset of all private equity  deals\u2014that is, those transactions where the target company is publicly  traded. We selected these transactions because pricing and other  information necessary for the analysis was publicly available. We  examined these transactions as a group, while incorporating individual  characteristics associated with each acquisition. The analysis generally  found no statistically meaningful negative or positive relationship between  the price paid for a target company and whether the buyout was the  product of a club deal.That is, public-to-private club deals, in the  aggregate, generally are not associated with lower or higher per share  price premiums, once important characteristics of target companies are  factored into the analysis. Thus, to the extent that potentially  anticompetitive effects of such club deals would be reflected in the  acquisition price, we do not find evidence of such an effect in the  aggregate. However, our results do not rule out the possibility that, in any  particular transaction, parties involved could seek to engage in illegal  behavior, such as bid-rigging or other collusion. We caution that we draw  conclusions about the association, not casual relationship, between clubs  deals and premiums. Accordingly, our results showing no association  between club deals and price paid should not be read as establishing that  club deals necessarily caused acquisition prices to be higher or lower. To  the extent that the nature of the firms and transactions we examined differ  from the overall population of club deals, our results may not generalize to  the population. (See app. X for details on our methodological and data  limitations.)", "For our econometric model, we initially identified 510 \u201cpublic-to-private\u201d  U.S. buyouts from 1998 through 2007, in which private equity firms  acquired publicly held companies. By number, this type of transaction  represents about 15 percent of all deals but accounts for about 58 percent  of total reported deal value. We examined price paid using the premium  paid over a target company\u2019s prebuyout stock price. Premiums are  common in buyouts, because it is the premium over current stock price  that helps persuade current owners to sell. By itself, the size of this  premium can vary significantly among buyouts overall, as well as for club  versus nonclub deals, depending on how it is measured. For example,  comparing a publicly held target company\u2019s stock price 1 day before  announcement of a buyout to the final price paid shows that the premium  in club deal acquisitions is slightly smaller\u2014by roughly 1 percent\u2014than  for other buyouts (fig. 4). On the other hand, using stock price 1 month  before announcement shows that the premium paid in club deals is  significantly larger\u2014about 11 percent higher. Neither of these differences  is statistically significant in our econometric models run on the full  sample.", "Academic research in this area is limited, but our finding that club deals  are not associated with lower per share price premiums in the aggregate is  consistent with two other studies done on U.S. data. However, our results  are inconsistent with another recent study that found large club deals  before 2006 led to lower premiums paid for target companies. This study  also found that target companies with high institutional ownership did not  experience the same effect, suggesting that such institutional investors are  able to counter the potentially negative price effect of club deals.  Moreover, we also found evidence, consistent with the literature, that  larger companies, companies with larger debt burdens, and companies  with large block and managerial holders of equity, received smaller  premiums upon takeover.52.", "Given concerns about the potential exercise of market power in private  equity transactions, we also employed two commonly used measures of  market concentration to assess the potential for anticompetitive behavior  in the private equity marketplace generally; that is, among buyouts of both  publicly and privately held target companies. One of these measures is  known as the Four-Firm Concentration Ratio. It is the sum of the market  shares by the four largest participants. A four-firm concentration ratio of  less than 40 percent generally indicates \u201ceffective competition,\u201d although it  does not guarantee competition prevails. Markets are considered tight  oligopolies if a four-firm concentration ratio exceeds 60 percent. For the  private equity marketplace, we estimate the concentration ratio at about  32 percent, below the 40 percent threshold.", "Our results also suggests\u2014as relating to which target companies are more likely to be  acquired through a club deal\u2014that large companies, companies with lower debt ratios and,  controlling for size, companies that do not trade on the New York Stock Exchange had a  greater probability of being taken private in a joint acquisition. and the potential for firms to exercise market power. The index is  calculated as the sum of the squares of each participant\u2019s market share.According to guidelines issued by DOJ, Herfindahl-Hirschman Index  values of below 1,000 indicate an unconcentrated marketplace, which is  more inclined to perform competitively. For the private equity  marketplace, we estimate the index value at 402.", "We note that the private equity marketplace is likely even less  concentrated, and more inclined to perform competitively, than our  analyses indicate. Both concentration measures are sensitive to the  definition of the \u201cmarket,\u201d and we have assumed that the marketplace is  comprised only of private equity firms as potential buyers. In actuality,  nonprivate equity buyers, often called \u201cstrategic\u201d purchasers, also can seek  to acquire companies.

For instance, the UK  Financial Services Authority (FSA) issued a private equity study in  November 2006, and a technical committee of International Organization  of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), which included SEC, issued a study  in November 2007. In its study, FSA raised concerns about, among other  things, the potential for market abuse (for example, insider trading) to  result from the leakage of price-sensitive information concerning private  equity transactions. It noted that a main cause of the increased potential  for information leaks in the private equity market is the number of  institutions and people involved in private equity deals, especially ones  involving publicly held companies. FSA further noted that the  development of related products traded in different markets, such as  credit derivatives on leveraged loans, increases the potential for this  abuse.The IOSCO technical committee also raised concerns about the  potential for market abuse in its study. It stated that market abuse, such as  insider trading, which is not limited to the private equity industry, remains  a key priority for IOSCO and individual regulators.

It stated that both sets of interests may become misaligned in a  number of situations, such as if management is allowed to coinvest with  the fund in a particular deal. The IOSCO technical committee also  commented that private equity transactions, along with other merger-and- acquisition activities, can present conflicts of interest for a number of  parties, including private equity firms, fund investors, and target  companies. For example, it noted that when management is participating  in a buyout, it may not have an incentive to act in the best interests of  existing shareholders by recommending a sale at the highest possible  price.

In light of this situation, regulators have  reviewed the risk-management practices of commercial and investment  banks and identified some weaknesses. As the regulators continue to  ensure that their respective institutions correct identified risk- management weaknesses, it will be important for them to evaluate  periodically whether their guidance responds to such identified  weaknesses and to update their guidance, as appropriate."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Major Commercial and Investment Banks Have Played a Key Role in Financing U.S. LBOs", "paragraphs": ["A small number of major commercial and investment banks have helped to  finance the majority of recent LBOs in the United States.

A revolver is a line of credit that allows the borrower  to draw down, repay, and reborrow a specified amount on demand. A term  loan is a loan that the borrower repays in a scheduled series of repayments  or a lump-sum payment at maturity. Although banks fund the term loans  when the LBO transactions are completed, the revolvers usually are not  funded at that time but rather are saved to meet future financing needs. As  discussed in the background, loans issued to finance LBOs are typically  syndicated\u2014provided by a group of lenders\u2014and categorized as  leveraged, rather than investment-grade, loans.", "Banks and other lenders provided, in total, nearly $2.7 trillion in  syndicated, leveraged loans in the U.S. market from 2005 through 2007,  according to Dealogic. Of this total, around $1.1 trillion, or 42 percent, was  used to finance transactions sponsored by private equity funds.

Since  the LBO boom in the 1980s, the Federal Reserve and OCC periodically  have issued regulatory guidance on financing LBOs and other leveraged  transactions. For example, in 1989, the regulators jointly defined the term  \u201chighly leveraged transaction\u201d to establish consistent procedures for  identifying and assessing LBOs and similar transactions. In guidance that  they jointly issued in 2001, the regulators stated that banks can engage in  leveraged finance in a safe and sound manner, if pursued within an  appropriate risk-management structure.According to the guidance, such  a risk-management structure should include a loan policy, underwriting  standards, loan limits, a policy on risk rating transactions, and internal  controls.", "OCC is responsible for supervising national banks, which include the four  U.S. commercial banks that played a key role in financing recent LBOs.  According to OCC staff, they have continued to supervise the financing of  LBOs by these banks through examinations and ongoing, on-site  monitoring. Moreover, each of these banks is a subsidiary of a bank or  financial holding company supervised by the Federal Reserve. Because of  the complexity of leveraged transactions and restrictions on commercial  bank finance activities, various parts of a leveraged financing package may  be arranged through the bank, its subsidiaries, or its holding company.  According to OCC examiners, OCC works with the Federal Reserve to  assess a banking organization\u2019s total participation in and exposure to  leveraged finance activities.", "OCC examiners told us that each year they have examined the leveraged  lending activities of the four banks as part of their ongoing supervision. In  large banks, most examination-related work is conducted throughout a 12- month supervisory cycle. The objectives of the examinations covering the  banks\u2019 leveraged lending activities included assessing the quantity of risk  and quality of risk management, reviewing underwriting standards, and  testing compliance with regulatory guidance. To meet these objectives,  examiners, among other things, sampled and reviewed loans and related  documentation, reviewed management reports, and interviewed bank  staff. OCC examiners told us that they also monitor the banks\u2019 risk  management of their leveraged lending activities on an ongoing basis  throughout the year. For example, they meet with bank managers from  various bank operations on a regular basis to discuss issues such as  portfolio trends, market conditions, underwriting practices, and emerging  risks. In addition, they periodically review management reports to identify  changes in portfolio performance, composition, and risk and audit reports  to assess the effectiveness of the programs and identify deficiencies  requiring attention.", "We reviewed 17 examinations that OCC examiners conducted between  2005 and 2007 that included some aspects of the leveraged finance  activities at two major banks. Each of the examinations generally covered  different portfolios that included leveraged loans, such as special credits,  North American leveraged loans, and syndicated credits. The examiners  found that underwriting standards for leveraged loans had been easing  every year since at least 2005, evidenced by increased leverage, liberal  repayment schedules on term loans, and erosion of loan covenants.However, the examiners generally found the quality of risk management at  the two banks to be satisfactory for the processes reviewed, at least until  mid-2007. For one of the banks, examiners noted that bank management  understood the key risks and implemented appropriate strategies and  controls to manage those risks. For instance, the bank retained a relatively  small percentage of its leveraged loans. Likewise, examiners at the other  bank noted that underwriting and distribution volume in leveraged loans  was significant and increasing, but the bank retained a small position in  leveraged loans. Nevertheless, in 2006 and 2007 internal documents that  outlined planned examinations and other supervisory activities, examiners  at one bank identified a key risk\u2014the potential for investor demand for  leveraged loans to slow and adversely affect the bank\u2019s ability to syndicate  loans and manage risk by retaining only small positions in leveraged loans.  The examiners noted that they would continue to monitor the bank\u2019s  leveraged lending activities through ongoing monitoring and examinations,  and they conducted such examinations in subsequent years.", "The Federal Reserve and OCC also supervised the financing of LBOs by  the major banks through other types of reviews and surveys. Each year,  they jointly review shared national credits, which include syndicated  leveraged loans.  In 2006, the review found that the volume of leveraged  loans rose rapidly, in part because of the rise in mergers and acquisitions.  It also found that strong market competition had led to an easing of  underwriting standards in leveraged loans, evidenced partly by minimum  amortization requirements and fewer maintenance covenants. The 2007  review continued to find weakened underwriting standards in leveraged  loans, and regulators stated in their joint press release that banks should  ensure that such standards are not compromised by competitive  pressures. Furthermore, the review noted that banks had a backlog of  leveraged loan commitments that could not be distributed without  incurring a loss and may need to be retained by the banks. Similarly, in  OCC\u2019s 2006 and 2007 survey of underwriting practices, the regulator also  found that banks were easing their credit standards for leveraged loans  and cautioned them about their weakening standards. Finally, in the  Federal Reserve\u2019s 2006 and 2007 \u201cSenior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on  Bank Lending Practices,\u201d responding banks generally reported that the  share of loans related to mergers and acquisitions, including LBOs, on  their books was fairly small.

SEC\u2019s supervision of CSEs extends beyond the  registered broker-dealers to their unregulated affiliates and holding  companies. SEC staff said that the CSEs usually originate their leveraged  loans in affiliates outside of their registered broker-dealers to avoid capital  charges that otherwise would be assessed under SEC\u2019s capital rules.  Between December 2004 and November 2005, selected broker-dealers  agreed to participate in the CSE program, and SEC has been responsible  for reviewing unregulated affiliates of the broker-dealers.", "According to SEC staff, they reviewed guidance issued by, and talked to,  federal bank regulators in developing their approach to supervising the  securities firms\u2019 leveraged lending. SEC staff said that they focus on credit,  market, and liquidity risks associated with the leveraged lending activities  of the CSEs to gain not only a broad view of the risks but also insights into  each of the different areas, because these risks are linked. For example,  under their approach, SEC staff can monitor how a firm\u2019s credit risk  exposure from its leveraged loan commitments can increase the firm\u2019s  liquidity risk if the firm cannot syndicate its leveraged loans as planned.  Because management of these three risks generally involves different  departments within a firm, the staff said that they routinely meet with the  various departments within each firm that are responsible for managing  their firm\u2019s credit, market, and liquidity risk exposures. They also said that  they review risk reports and other data generated by the firms.", "In fiscal year 2006, SEC reviewed the leveraged lending activities across  each of the CSEs. As part of the review, SEC analyzed the practices and  processes of leveraged lending, management of the risks associated with  leveraged lending, and the calculation of capital requirements for loan  commitments. SEC found that the CSEs, like the major commercial banks,  used loan approval processes and loan syndications to manage their risks.  According to an SEC official, the review generally found that the firms  were in regulatory compliance but identified areas where capital  computation and risk-management practices could be improved.  Moreover, the SEC official said four firms modified their capital  computations as a result of feedback from the leveraged loan review.

Under this model, a bank or group of banks arrange and underwrite a  leveraged loan and then syndicate all or some portion of the loan to other  institutions, rather than holding the loan on their balance sheets. Leading  up to June 2007, strong demand by nonbank institutions (such as  collateralized loan obligations, insurance companies, mutual funds, and  hedge funds) that invest in leveraged loans fostered the growth of the  leveraged loan market.  According to officials representing four major  banks, they typically were able to syndicate their leveraged loans when the  LBO deals closed. As a result, the banks generally were able to limit their  leveraged loan exposure to the amount that they planned to hold when  they initially committed to make the loans. The bank officials said that  their banks typically held portions of the pro rata loans, not the longer  term and, thus, potentially more risky institutional loans.In addition, the  bank officials said that, before mid-2007, high-yield bond offerings used to  help finance some LBOs normally were completed by the time the deals  were closed. This eliminated the need for the banks to provide bridge  loans for those LBOs, according to the bank officials.", "After June 2007, investor concerns about the credit quality of subprime  mortgages spread to other credit markets, leading to a sudden and  significant decline in demand for leveraged loans. Not expecting market  liquidity to change so suddenly, the major banks were left with a large  number of unfunded loan commitments for pending LBO deals. The four  major commercial banks had more than $294 billion in leveraged finance  commitments at the end of May 2007, and the four major investment banks  had more than $171 billion in commitments at the end of June 2007. When  market conditions changed, the banks were no longer able to syndicate  some of their leveraged loans at prices they had anticipated when the LBO  deals closed. The banks also had to fund some of the bridge loans for such  deals. As a result, the banks held on their balance sheets considerably  more loans than originally planned, including leveraged loans intended to  be syndicated to institutional investors. For the major commercial banks,  the amount of leveraged loans that exceeded the amount that they planned  to hold increased from around zero at the end of May 2007 to around $62  billion at the end of December 2007. Similarly, the total amount of  leveraged loans held by the major investment banks increased from almost  $9 billion to around $59 billion from June to December 2007. Because the  decrease in demand for syndicated loans caused prices to decline, the  banks had to mark down some of their leveraged loans and loan  commitments to reflect the lower market prices, resulting in substantial  reductions to earnings. For example, a credit rating agency estimated that  the major U.S. banks suffered around $8 billion in losses (before fees and  hedges) on their leveraged loans and loan commitments in the third  quarter of 2007.", "Since then, the major banks have made progress in reducing the number of  unfunded leveraged loan commitments but continue to face challenges  reducing their loan holdings. First, the major commercial banks have  reduced their leveraged finance commitments from about $294 billion to  about $34 billion from the end of May 2007 through the end of March 2008.  Likewise, the major investment banks have reduced their commitments  from about $171 billion to about $14 billion from the end of June 2007  through the end of March 2008. According to a credit rating agency, the  banks have been able to slowly reduce their commitment volume, as  liquidity gradually has returned to the leveraged finance market, and as  some LBO deals have been cancelled, restructured, or repriced. Second,  the banks are continuing to work to reduce their holdings of leveraged  loans. At year-end 2007, the commercial banks held about $62 billion more  in leveraged loans than they planned to hold but had reduced the amount  to around $53 billion at the end of March 2008. During the same period, the  total amount of leveraged loans held by the investment banks decreased  from around $59 billion to around $56 billion. Bank officials told us that  they are continuing to look for market opportunities to syndicate or  otherwise sell their leveraged loans. Additionally, the banks can, and some  do, manage their leveraged loan risk exposures through hedging, such as  with credit derivatives.", "During the third quarter of 2007, federal bank examiners and a credit  rating agency assessed the exposures of banks to their leveraged loans and  commitments under various market scenarios. Such analyses generally  indicated that the banks had sufficient capital to absorb potential losses.  In March 2008, OCC noted that the major commercial banks continued to  be well capitalized, despite adding a sizeable amount of leveraged loans  onto their balance sheets and taking significant write-downs on these and  other assets. Importantly, the default rate for leveraged loans has  remained at a historically low level to the benefit of banks holding  leveraged loans. However, in January 2008, a credit rating agency  forecasted that the default rate for U.S. leveraged loans will increase to  approximately 3 percent from its current 0.1 percent by the end of 2008, in  part driven by the weaker economy.", "Although the regulators consistently told us that individual banks were not  exposed to significant risk from their leveraged lending activities, some  broader concerns about systemic risk have arisen. In its June 2006 study  on private equity, FSA stated that market turbulence and substantial losses  among private equity investors and lenders potentially raised systemic  risk. It noted that such risk could be greater if leveraged debt positions  were concentrated and could not be exited during a turbulent market.  Although the originate-to-distribute model has served to disperse risk, it  also has made it more difficult to determine which financial institutions or  investors have concentrated leveraged debt exposures. Federal bank  regulators told us that they know the amount of leveraged loans held by  banks and nonbank investors through their review of shared national  credits. However, they said that although they know the concentrated  leveraged debt exposures of their supervised banks, they lack data to  determine whether, if any, of the nonbank investors have such exposures.  The regulators said that it would be difficult to collect and track such data  because leveraged loans could be traded or securitized, such as through  collateralized loan obligations. Moreover, they said that it is unclear  whether the benefits of collecting such information would exceed the  costs, which could be high\u2014in part because it is unclear what they could  do with the information with respect to nonbank investors. In its  November 2007 report on private equity, an IOSCO committee highlighted  the potential for a large and complex default, or a number of simultaneous  defaults in private equity transactions, to create systemic risk for the  public debt securities markets. To assess this risk, the committee plans to  do a survey of the complexity and leverage of capital structures employed  in LBOs across relevant IOSCO jurisdictions. Because the survey would  include issues of interest to banking regulators, the technical committee  recommended that the survey be done under the Joint Forum, which  postponed making a decision until a related study on leveraged finance of  LBOs was completed (which was issued in July 2008).", "Although the commercial and investment banks have taken steps to  decrease their leveraged lending exposures, the unexpected increase in  risk faced by these banks illustrates one of the ways in which problems in  one financial market can spill over to other financial markets and  adversely affect market participants. Accordingly, it highlights the  importance of understanding and monitoring the conditions in the broader  markets, particularly potential connections between markets. Should  regulators fail to fully understand and consider such interconnections and  their potential systemic risk implications, the effectiveness of regulatory  oversight and the regulators\u2019 ability to address such risk when market  disruptions that have potential spillover effects occur could be limited."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Pursuant to Recent Credit Market Problems, Regulators and Others Have Raised Concerns about the Risk Management of Leveraged Finance", "paragraphs": ["As a result of the recent credit market problems, financial regulators and  others have conducted a number of special studies on leveraged lending or  raised specific concerns. Based on a special review of the leveraged  finance activities of four banks, FRBNY examiners reported in September  2007 that the banks needed to improve their risk-management practices.  Confirming the findings of earlier examinations, FRBNY examiners found  that the banks generally had a robust credit risk approval process for  evaluating individual deals, but underwriting standards had weakened in  response to competitive market conditions. The examiners noted that the  banks used the same standards to underwrite loans held by banks and  loans that the banks traditionally would syndicate because of their more  risky characteristics. According to the examiners, the banks could have  worked through their pipeline of leveraged finance commitments if  liquidity had declined gradually, but the sudden shock highlighted the  negative impact of weakened underwriting standards and certain risk- management practices. Although the examiners found that the banks had  recently changed some of their risk-management controls and were  continuing to review their controls for any additional changes that might  be appropriate, they concluded that the banks needed to set or improve  limits on their pipeline commitments and test such exposures under  different market scenarios. Although the examiners noted that such risk- management controls are not addressed in detail in the 2001 regulatory  guidance on leveraged finance (discussed earlier), they recommended  waiting until the leveraged finance market adjusted to the current market  events to revisit the guidance.", "In an October 2007 speech, the Comptroller of the Currency said that he  asked examiners to encourage the major banks to underwrite their  leverage loans in a manner more consistent with the standards they would  use if they held the loans. He said that the originate-to-distribute model  has led banks to move too far away from the underwriting standards they  would have used if the banks held onto the loans. The Comptroller said  that the banks need to strengthen their standards, but the standards need  not be identical to what they would be if banks held the loans. He noted  that there are legitimate differences in risk tolerances that are useful in  matching willing lenders with risky borrowers. Nonetheless, he said that  the banks should have risk-management systems to measure, monitor, and  control underwriting differences between syndicated loans and loans to be  held in their loan portfolios. In its 2008 survey of underwriting practices,  OCC found that underwriting standards for leveraged loans changed  significantly. According to OCC, since the disruption in financial markets  that began last summer, most banks have responded to investor concerns  and the negative economic outlook by tightening underwriting terms,  particularly those relating to pricing, covenants, and maximum allowable  leverage.", "In a March 2008 policy statement, the President\u2019s Working Group on  Financial Markets (PWG), working with FRBNY and OCC, issued its  findings on the cause of the recent market turmoil and recommendations  to help avoid a repeat of such events. According to PWG, the financial  markets have been in turmoil since mid-2007, which was triggered by a  dramatic weakening of underwriting standards for U.S. subprime  mortgages. This and other developments, such as the erosion of market  discipline on the standards and terms of loans to households and  businesses, revealed serious weaknesses in the risk-management practices  at several large U.S. and European financial institutions. Such weaknesses  included weak controls over balance sheet growth and inadequate  communications within the institutions. These weaknesses were  particularly evident in the risk management of the syndication of  leveraged loans and other business lines. As a result, some institutions  suffered significant losses, and many experienced balance sheet pressures,  according to PWG. For example, some firms were left holding exposures  to leveraged loans that were in the process of being syndicated. PWG  made a broad array of recommendations to reform the mortgage  origination process and certain rating processes, as well as to strengthen  risk-management practices and enhance prudential regulatory policies.  With respect to leveraged finance, the PWG recommendations included  that (1) financial institutions promptly identify and address any  weaknesses in risk-management practices revealed by the turmoil, (2)  regulators closely monitor the efforts of financial institutions to address  risk-management weaknesses, and (3) regulators enhance guidance  related to pipeline risk management for firms that use an originate-to- distribute model.", "Finally, in May 2008, consistent with the PWG recommendation about risk- management practices, OCC examiners completed a special review of the  leveraged lending activities of four banks, prompted partly by the large  losses from their leveraged loan positions. The review\u2019s objectives  included comparing the risk-management practices across the banks,  assessing bank compliance with the 2001 regulatory guidance (discussed  above), and assessing the management systems used by banks to identify,  monitor, and control for underwriting differences between loans held by  the banks and loans sold to other institutions. Based on their preliminary  results, OCC examiners generally found that the banks needed to improve  aspects of their risk-management framework governing their leveraged  finance syndications. In particular, the examiners found that the banks did  not fully comply with the regulatory guidance for managing the risks  associated with their loan syndications. For example, the banks lacked  formal policies for managing syndication failures. According to the OCC  examiners, the banks are documenting lessons learned to reassess their  risk-management practices and making changes. In turn, OCC is  identifying best practices to communicate to the banks.", "In July 2008, Federal Reserve, OCC, and SEC staff told us that they are  continuing to monitor their respective financial institutions and work with  other regulators to address issues raised by the ongoing market turmoil.  The Federal Reserve staff said that they were still reviewing and analyzing  the risk-management weaknesses uncovered over the past year to ensure  that any revised guidance issued was sufficiently comprehensive and  appropriately targeted. OCC staff told us that they intend to provide  additional guidance on leveraged lending through a supplement to the  agency\u2019s existing guidance and will work with the Federal Reserve and  others to determine whether the 2001 interagency guidance on leveraged  lending needs to be revised.

Research also indicates that private equity LBOs are associated  with lower employment growth, but uncertainty remains about the  employment effect. In that regard, further research may shed light on the  causal relationship between private equity and employment growth, if any.  Our econometric analysis of a sample of public-to-private LBOs generally  found no indication that club deals, in aggregate, are associated with  higher or lower prices paid for the target companies, after controlling for  differences in targets.

However, in light of the recent growth in  LBOs, U.S. and foreign regulators have undertaken studies to assess risks  arising from such transactions and have identified some concerns about  potential market abuse and investor protection, which they are studying  further. As a result of the recent financial market turmoil, federal financial  regulators reassessed the risk-management practices for leveraged lending  at the major financial institutions and identified weaknesses. PWG,  working with OCC and FRBNY, has reviewed weaknesses in markets,  institutions, and regulatory and supervisory practices that have  contributed to the recent financial market turmoil. It has developed a  broad array of recommendations to address those weaknesses, some of  which apply to leveraged lending. As U.S. financial regulators continue to  seek to ensure that their respective institutions address risk-management  weaknesses associated with leveraged lending, it will be important for  them to continue to evaluate periodically whether their guidance  addresses such weaknesses and to update their guidance in a timely  manner consistent with the PWG and other relevant recommendations.", "Although the leveraged loan market comprises a relatively small segment  of the financial markets and has not raised the systemic risk concerns  raised by subprime mortgages and related structured financial products, it  shares similar characteristics and includes elements that could contribute  to systemic risk. First, the major players in the leveraged loan market  include some of the largest U.S. commercial and investment banks.  Second, the use of the originate-to-distribute model by such financial  institutions played a part in the erosion of market discipline and easing of  underwriting standards for leveraged loans. Third, the current financial  market turmoil\u2014triggered by weakening underwriting standards for  subprime mortgages\u2014revealed risk-management weaknesses in the  leveraged lending activities of the financial institutions and exposed them  to greater-than-expected risk when market events caused them to hold  more leveraged loans on their balance sheets. This situation increased the  vulnerability of these institutions because of the other challenges they  were facing due to the broader turmoil in the financial markets. Finally,  while the originate-to-distribute model provides a means by which to  transfer risk more widely among investors throughout the system, it can  reduce transparency about where such risk ultimately resides when held  outside regulated financial institutions and whether such risk is  concentrated. Such concentrations could directly or indirectly impact  regulated institutions.", "Recent events involving leveraged loans underscore the potential for  systemic risk to arise not only from the disruption at a major regulated  institution but also from the transmission of a disruption in a financial  market to other financial markets. Consequently, it is important for  regulators not to focus solely on the stability of their financial institutions  but also to understand how markets are interconnected and how potential  market changes could ultimately affect their regulated institutions. While  financial institutions have taken steps to decrease their leveraged lending  exposures, the unexpected increase in such exposures due to the spread  of problems with subprime mortgages to other credit markets illustrates  the importance of understanding and monitoring the conditions in the  broader markets, including potential connections between markets.

Most empirical work on buyouts in the 2000s is  based on European data, as more data on privately held firms are available  in Europe. Due to similar levels of financial development, we included  studies based on European data because they should be instructive for  understanding U.S. buyouts and the private equity market. However, there  are some structural differences between the U.S. and European  economies, such as differences in shareholder rights in the legal systems  of many countries in continental Europe, which may lead to differences in  LBOs. Based on our selection criteria, we determined that these studies  were sufficient for our purposes. However, the results should not  necessarily be considered as definitive, given the methodological or data  limitations contained in the studies individually and collectively. We also  interviewed four academics who have done research on LBOs by private  equity funds and had two academics review a summary of our literature  review.

Reflecting the debate,  there have been a number of congressional and other proposals to change  the tax treatment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Private Equity Firms Receive Two Types of Income, and They Are Taxed Differently", "paragraphs": ["Private equity firms generally receive two types of income for managing  the funds they establish to undertake buyouts of target companies. These  two types of income are taxed differently, so how income is classified is a  significant driver of tax liability. First, in serving as general partners, firms  receive an annual management fee based on the amount of fund assets  under management. According to an industry trade group, firms  historically have set their management fee at 2 percent of the assets under  management but recently have been lowering the fee, as the size of private  equity funds has grown and raising fund capital has become more  competitive. Private equity firms receive the fee for performing services  for the fund partnership (not in their capacity as partners), and the fee is  intended to finance their day-to-day operations. The management fee  received by a private equity firm generally is taxed as ordinary income and  subject to a federal marginal tax rate ranging up to 35 percent.", "Second, private equity firms, as the general partners of the funds, also  receive a share of the funds\u2019 profits, called carried interest. This carried  interest typically represents a right, as a partner, to share in 20 percent of  the future profits of the fund.The concept of carried interest is not new; it  has been employed since at least the 1930s in a number of industries.  Because private equity funds typically are organized as partnerships,  partnership tax rules determine the tax treatment of the distributive share  of the income from the carried interest. Under current tax law,  partnerships are \u201cpass-through entities,\u201d meaning that income passes  through the partnership to the partners without being taxed at the  partnership level. When income earned by a partnership is passed through  to the individual partners, it is taxed based on the nature of the income  from the underlying activity. While taxation of private equity profits may  be a new issue today, partnership taxation rules are well established. Upon  receipt of carried interest\u2014that is, the grant of the right to a share of  future profits\u2014a private equity firm becomes a partner in the fund and  pays tax in the same manner as other fund partners on its distributive  share of the fund\u2019s taxable income. Thus, if the fund earns ordinary  income, or a short- or long-term capital gain, each partner\u2019s distributive  share includes a portion of that income. In other words, carried interest is  not automatically subject to long-term capital gains treatment. But the  typical nature of private equity firms\u2019 activities\u2014selling investment assets  held for several years\u2014means carried interest received by private equity  firms commonly is taxed as a long-term capital gain. As such, it is subject  to a preferential federal tax rate of 15 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tax Treatment of Carried Interest as a Capital Gain Is Subject to Debate", "paragraphs": ["According to academics and others, categorizing carried interest as  entirely ordinary income or capital gains can be difficult, especially as it  reflects a combination of capital assets and labor in the form of expertise  applied to those assets. In short, private equity firm managers use investor  capital to acquire assets in the form of portfolio companies and then apply  their expertise to increase the value of the companies. Table 6 highlights  conceptual difficulties in making clear distinctions among types of  income, by comparing income earned by a traditional employee and a  fund\u2019s general partner, based on characteristics such as effort, capital  contributed, and compensation risk.", "Whether the private equity firm\u2019s distributive share from the carried  interest should be viewed as ordinary income for the performance of  services, and hence subject to a higher tax rate, has been the subject of  debate. Some academics and others, including labor union executives and  some in the private equity and venture capital industries, have criticized  allowing capital gains treatment to carried interest on a number of  grounds. These reasons include that such treatment  is inconsistent with the theory of capital gains because private equity firms  provide services similar to asset management when they select, acquire,  and oversee acquired companies; therefore, income from these activities  should be treated like that of an ordinary employee performing services; represents an unfair subsidy to wealthy individuals because it allows  private equity managers whose earnings can be millions of dollars per year  to pay a lower marginal rate than many lower-income workers earning  ordinary income; is inappropriate to the extent that private equity involves risking of time  and effort, but not money, since private equity firms contribute only a  small portion of total capital invested in a buyout fund; and is inconsistent with the nature of the private equity business because the  general partners are sophisticated enterprises that compete for the same  employee talent as investment banks and provide services analogous to  investment banking/financial services, where income is taxed as ordinary  income.", "By contrast, private equity executives and others, including some  academics and other business executives, say capital gains treatment is  appropriate and thus oppose treating carried interest as ordinary income  because    carried interest represents an ownership interest in assets held for long- term investment that involves risk-taking by private equity firms; because  risk-taking is a goal of the preferential treatment for capital gains, it is  appropriate for carried interest to be taxed at the lower rate;   private equity firms are creating new ventures and not being compensated    private equity firms\u2019 portfolio companies hold capital assets and pass their  gains to the private equity partnerships, which is not a performance of  services; the notion of capital gains taxation is not based on separating returns to  labor and returns to capital; instead, if there is a capital asset, and its value  grows through someone\u2019s effort, then that is a capital gain. For example,  the owner of a business may supply labor to the venture, causing the value  of the business to grow and upon sale of the business, any gains generally  would be entitled to capital gains treatment; and    capital gains treatment mitigates effects of \u201cdouble taxation\u201d of private  equity activities, because portfolio companies already pay corporate taxes  before passing any gains to the private equity partnerships owning them.  Supporters of the capital gains approach also say that changing the  treatment would have negative consequences. They said that investment  and innovation will be discouraged, the supply of capital would decline,  productivity would suffer, U.S. competitiveness in international capital  markets would be undermined, and tax avoidance activities will increase.  Tax avoidance occurs when the nature of activity is changed to lessen or  eliminate tax liability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Bills Have Been Introduced and Other Ideas Suggested to Change the Tax Treatment of Private Equity Firms\u2019 Income", "paragraphs": ["As the taxation of carried interest became a higher profile issue beginning  in 2007, a number of legislative proposals to change the tax treatment of  private equity firms\u2019 income were introduced in the 110th Congress.

He added that investment managers are  essentially able to pay a lower tax rate on their income because of the  structure of their investment firm.

That is, they would pay the corporate income tax on their  earnings, rather than pass those earnings through to be taxed only as the  partners\u2019 individual income.", "The sponsor and another senator said that, if a publicly traded partnership  earns profits by providing financial services, that kind of business should  be taxed as a corporation. Otherwise, creative new structures for  investment vehicles may blur the lines for tax treatment of income.

In  fiscal year 2005, before the buyout, net interest expense was $12.4 million.  Post-buyout, for fiscal year 2007, net interest expense increased more than  20-fold, to $259.8 million. At the end of 2007, outstanding debt was almost  $3 billion. Net income fell from $248.8 million in fiscal year 2005, before  the acquisition, to $56.7 million the following fiscal year and $111.9 million  for fiscal year 2007. Earnings from operations, however, are up, the  company said.", "The Neiman Marcus deal also featured a $700 million financing feature  known as a payment-in-kind, high-yield bond. This arrangement allows the  company to make a choice each quarter: pay interest to its bondholders in  cash or in the form of additional bonds. But if the company decides to  exercise the payment-in-kind option, it pays a higher interest rate\u2014three- quarters of a percentage point\u2014payable in additional bonds for that  interest period. This gives the company the ability to ease its debt  servicing burden in the short-term but at the cost of greater overall  indebtedness. To date, Neiman Marcus has not used this feature. To  protect itself against debt costs, Neiman Marcus has entered into interest  rate swaps, which have the effect of fixing the interest rate on a portion of  its variable rate debt.", "Exit: The private equity firms continue to own the company, and TPG  executives declined to discuss specifics of any exit strategy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Hertz Corp.

It  drew criticism in the media and from union members, after the company\u2019s  new owners paid themselves $1.3 billion in dividends not long after the  transaction closed and ultimately financed the payments by selling stock  to the public. The company has realized hundreds of millions of dollars in  improved financial results annually, but also has cut thousands of jobs as  it has sought to make operations more efficient. Figure 7 provides an  overview of the LBO transaction, including a time line of key events.", "Background: Hertz says it is the world\u2019s largest general use car rental  company, with approximately 8,100 locations in about 145 countries. Hertz  also operates an equipment rental company with about 380 locations  worldwide, although car rentals accounted for 80 percent of 2007  revenues. Ford Motor Co. had purchased an ownership stake in Hertz in  1987 and purchased the company outright in 1994.", "CD&R executives said that the firm emphasizes making operational  improvements in companies it acquires. The firm has long had an interest  in multilocation service businesses, they said, as evidenced by investments  including Kinko\u2019s and ServiceMaster. The Carlyle Group is one of the  biggest private equity firms and says it has demonstrated expertise in the  automotive and transportation sectors. Its investments include Dunkin\u2019  Brands, AMC Entertainment, Inc., and Grand Vehicle Works, which  provides products and services to truck fleets and recreational vehicle  users. Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity is the private equity arm of  Merrill Lynch & Co.", "The acquisition: In 2000, CD&R began exploring acquisition targets in the  car rental industry. It analyzed a number of firms before targeting Hertz  because of its industry-leading position. In addition to having strong brand  recognition, Hertz was the leader in airport rentals, and its equipment  rental division provided diversification. CD&R also had an interest in  \u201ccorporate orphans,\u201d that is, units of large corporations that are not part of  the company\u2019s core operations, and thus may not receive sufficient  management attention. CD&R viewed Hertz as such an orphan, with  significant room for improvement as a result.", "Beginning in 2002, CD&R regularly approached Ford about acquiring  Hertz, CD&R executives said. They explained that Ford was skeptical  about CD&R\u2019s ability to finance the acquisition and operation of Hertz,  which is capital-intensive due to its large holdings of cars and equipment.  By 2005, Ford was experiencing difficulty in its core auto manufacturing  business and decided to divest Hertz. Ford took a two-track approach to  doing that, simultaneously pursuing an initial public offering (IPO) of  Hertz, as well as a bidding process for the outright sale of the company.", "Given the size of the potential deal, CD&R needed partners, executives  said. Like many other private equity firms, CD&R has restrictions on how  much it can invest in a single entity and buying Hertz on its own would  have meant exceeding this \u201cconcentration\u201d limit. Thus, CD&R partnered  with two other firms\u2014the Carlyle Group and Merrill Lynch Global Private  Equity. Carlyle officials said they too had been interested in Hertz for  some time and were attracted by the strong brand and orphan status. The  two firms agreed to a partnership, with CD&R as the lead firm with  operational control. Both firms had worked previously with Merrill  Lynch\u2019s private equity fund, and they invited the company to join the two  firms.", "In September 2005, after several rounds of bidding, Ford agreed to sell  Hertz to the consortium. CD&R executives described the bidding process  as difficult and competitive, with two other groups of leading private  equity firms participating. Ford\u2019s investment bankers managed the process  and pitted the competing bidders not only against each other but also  against the prospect of an IPO. During bidding, CD&R stressed to Ford  that a direct sale would provide a higher price, more certainty, and more  cash than an IPO. Eventually, Ford went for the private sale, in a deal  valued at $14.9 billion, which included $5.8 billion of corporate debt and  $6.8 billion of debt secured by the company\u2019s vehicle fleet. At the time, it  was the second largest leveraged buyout ever done. The private equity  firms invested $2.3 billion, with each contributing an approximately equal  amount, to acquire ownership of all of Hertz\u2019s common stock.", "Strategy and implementation: Even before acquiring Hertz, CD&R had  identified three main areas for improving Hertz\u2019s operations: the off- airport market segment, high expenses in European rental car operations,  and widely varying performance among individual branch locations.  According to CD&R executives, Hertz had significantly increased its  number of off-airport locations, for example, but was losing money. So the  firm decided to close some poorly performing offices. In Europe, CD&R  identified overhead expenses, such as sales and administrative costs,  which were several times higher than in the United States and thus would  be a target for change.", "After the buyout, the consortium helped Hertz management develop  operational and strategic plans and implemented a new management  compensation method, according to Carlyle executives. The plans  included, for example, efforts to increase market share in the leisure  segment and to improve buying and managing of vehicles. Carlyle  executives said hiring a new chief executive in mid-2006 was critical to  implementing the plans. The new Chief Executive Officer came to Hertz  with a background in process improvement and industrial management  after working at General Electric Co. and serving as the Chief Executive of  auto parts supplier Tenneco.", "To target price-sensitive and leisure customers, Hertz began offering  discounts to customers making online reservations and using self-service  kiosks. Carlyle executives said that to reduce the cost of its fleet, Hertz  increased the share of cars that it buys, rather than leases, from  manufacturers. (Owning is cheaper, because with a lease, the  manufacturer must be compensated for the residual risk of disposing of a  rental car once its service lifetime is up.) As part of efforts to increase  efficiency, Hertz relied on employees to generate ideas. For example,  workers identified ways to improve cleaning and processing of rental cars  upon their return, Carlyle executives said. Changes in compensation were  designed to better align the interests of management and shareholders.  For example, Hertz provided more than 300 employees an opportunity to  own stock in the company, based on revenue growth, pretax income, and  return on capital.", "Results: Hertz\u2019s financial performance has improved in some areas since  the buyout. Revenues have continued to grow steadily, as they did under  Ford\u2019s ownership, with an increase of 16 percent from 2005 to 2007. Cash  flow, as measured by a common industry benchmark of earnings before  interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, grew by about 25 percent,  from $2.8 billion in 2005 to $3.5 billion in 2007. Hertz\u2019s operational  improvements can be seen in its direct operating expenses as a percentage  of revenues, which declined from 56 percent in 2005 to 53 percent in 2007.", "Net income, however, fell below preacquisition levels, although it is  growing. In 2005, net income was $350 million, but this declined to $116  million in 2006, before improving to $265 million in 2007. The lower  earnings reflect higher interest payments stemming from debt used to  finance the acquisition. In September 2005, before the acquisition was  completed, Hertz\u2019s total debt was $10.6 billion, and this balance increased  to $12.5 billion by the end of 2005, after the deal closed. Consequently, net  interest expense rose from $500 million in 2005 to $901 million in 2006 and  $875 million in 2007. These amounts represented 6.7 percent, 11.2 percent,  and 10.1 percent of revenue, respectively. At the same time, however,  Hertz\u2019s new owners have used the increased cash flow to pay down the  debt. As a result, total debt decreased by $555 million from 2005 to 2007.", "To help cut costs, Hertz has reduced its workforce by about 9 percent  since the end of 2005. After the private equity consortium acquired Hertz  in late 2005, the company had about 32,100 employees, with 22,700 in the  United States. By the end of 2007, total employment had decreased to  about 29,350, with 20,550 in the United States. Most of the reduction came  following job cuts announced in 2007 that the company said were aimed at  improving competitiveness. It said the reductions were aimed at  eliminating unnecessary layers of management and streamlining decision  making. According to CD&R, 40 percent of the lost jobs came in the  equipment rental business, which fluctuates with the construction cycle.  Further workforce cuts are planned, as Hertz has said the company has  completed agreements to outsource functions including procurement and  information technology by the end of the third quarter of 2008.", "In June 2006, 6 months after the acquisition, Hertz borrowed $1 billion to  pay its private equity firm owners a dividend. Five months later, Hertz  made an IPO of stock, raising $1.3 billion, and used the proceeds to repay  the $1 billion loan and to make another $260 million dividend payment to  the private equity firms. The dividends drew criticism, such as in the media  and from union members, for their size, and the IPO, coming less than a  year after the acquisition, drew criticism as a \u201cquick flip\u201d transaction. For  example, Business Week magazine, in an article describing what it called  private equity firms\u2019 \u201cslick new tricks to gorge on corporate assets,\u201d  singled out dividend payments as a \u201cglaring\u201d sign of excess and cited the  $1 billion Hertz dividend.", "Carlyle and CD&R executives said a desire to return funds to the private  equity firms\u2019 limited partners and uncertainty whether the IPO would  actually be completed as planned, spurred the June dividend. Banks were  willing to loan money at attractive rates to fund the dividend, they said. As  for the timing of the IPO, the executives explained that Hertz\u2019s  performance turned out to be better than expected, while at the same  time, market conditions were attractive. It can often take 3 years or more  to exit a buyout through an IPO and subsequent secondary equity  offerings, one executive said, because public investors are often unable or  unwilling to purchase more than a portion of the shares held by private  equity owners in a single offering. This long horizon, coupled with Hertz\u2019s  financial performance, convinced the private equity firms to proceed with  the IPO.", "Hertz\u2019s stock debuted at $15 per share, peaked near $27, and more recently  has been in the $13 range. The decline has generally been in line with the  performance of other large, publicly traded car rental companies.", "Exit: After the IPO, the three firms retained an ownership stake in the  company of 72 percent, which Carlyle and CD&R executives said  demonstrated that there was no \u201cquick flip.\u201d In June 2007, the firms  completed a secondary offering of their Hertz shares, selling $1.2 billion  worth of shares, and leaving them with a 55 percent ownership stake.

At the time the  deal closed, ShopKo had 356 stores under its ShopKo, Pamida, and  ShopKo Express Rx brand names in 22 states in the Midwest, Mountain,  and Pacific Northwest regions. Founded in 1961, ShopKo merged into  SuperValue, a wholesale grocer, in 1971. In 1991, SuperValue divested  ShopKo via an IPO of stock, and ShopKo became an independent public  company. In fiscal year 2000, ShopKo sales reached $3.5 billion, and the  company was on the Fortune 500 list. Four years later, however, sales had  fallen to $3.2 billion, and the company was experiencing its fourth straight  year of declining same-store sales.

Other Sun Capital acquisitions include  Bruegger\u2019s Bagels, Wickes Furniture, and Mervyn\u2019s department stores.", "The acquisition: Several factors contributed to ShopKo\u2019s declining sales  and set the stage for the Sun Capital buyout. In January 2001, ShopKo had  begun a reorganization that closed 23 stores and associated distribution  centers. ShopKo also faced heavy competition from national retailers. For  fiscal year 2004, ShopKo reported that Wal-Mart was a direct competitor in  97 percent of ShopKo\u2019s markets; for Target, the figure was 75 percent, and  for Kmart, 70 percent. In addition, ShopKo was testing alternative store  layouts in remodeled stores and attempting to identify its core customer\u2014 which it came to define as mothers with family income between $45,000  and $50,000 a year\u2014and to develop a merchandising strategy around that  customer.", "In late 2003, the private equity firm Goldner-Hawn approached ShopKo  about buying the company, and an agreement was reached in April 2005.  But some shareholders objected, saying ShopKo\u2019s board had not fully  investigated its options and that the proposed deal undervalued the  company. These other options considered by ShopKo\u2019s board, included  continuing current operations, seeking out strategic buyer(s), and  recapitalizing the company but keeping it publicly owned. Amidst the  controversy, two large shareholders\u2014a hedge fund and a real estate  investment firm\u2014individually approached Sun Capital about possible  interest in participating in a ShopKo buyout.", "ShopKo fit Sun Capital\u2019s focus on underperforming companies. Sun  Capital also believed ShopKo had shown resilience in the face of its  competition, primarily from Target and Wal-Mart. In addition, Sun Capital  thought that ShopKo had strength in its pharmacy and optical business  lines; that the chain had strong brand recognition and loyalty among its  customers, and that it was beginning to see success in shifting its  merchandise mix. However, Sun Capital executives said they were initially  hesitant to participate in bidding for ShopKo because the company had  already agreed to a buyout with Goldner-Hawn. In the end, Sun Capital  executives said they decided to join the bidding for ShopKo because it  appeared Sun Capital could pay more, for a deal it judged to be worth  more, and because the Goldner-Hawn deal appeared to have what Sun  Capital executives called an \u201cinsider flavor.\u201d This was because ShopKo\u2019s  nonexecutive Chairman had talked with Goldner-Hawn about potentially  becoming an investor in the private equity fund purchasing ShopKo and  about post-buyout employment at ShopKo as well. (This conflict caused  the Chairman, as well as another director, to recuse themselves from  lengthy deliberations on sale of the company.) After the shareholder  complaints raised in opposition to the Goldner-Hawn deal, Sun Capital  believed the ShopKo board would welcome its offer. Sun Capital\u2019s winning  bid of $29 per share was 21 percent better than Goldner-Hawn\u2019s initially  accepted offer of $24 per share, and it boosted the deal value by $160.8  million.", "Strategy and implementation: Following the buyout, Sun Capital began  a makeover of ShopKo operations. Sun Capital describes its approach to  managing its portfolio companies as more hands-on than most private  equity firms. It designates an operating partner who holds weekly calls and  monthly meetings with company management. According to Sun Capital  executives, these meetings help to monitor the acquired company\u2019s health,  coach its management, and identify areas for efficiencies and cost savings.", "ShopKo consolidated its vendors, making it a more important customer to  each vendor. In addition, Sun leveraged its portfolio\u2019s purchasing power to  acquire higher quality goods at a lower cost with better credit terms, Sun  Capital executives said. For example, ShopKo was able to realize what  executives said were large savings in the cost of prescription drugs. The  company overhauled its marketing, launching a broadcast television and  radio advertising campaign that included back-to-school ads for the first  time in many years. Before the buyout, ShopKo\u2019s promotions revolved  around local newspaper circulars. To capitalize on its in-store pharmacies,  which executives say is a key strength, ShopKo began buying small,  independent drugstores and transferring their business to ShopKo.", "Sun Capital executives say they plan to spend approximately $70 million  annually\u2014up from about $35 million planned for fiscal year 2005, before  the takeover\u2014to continue the remodeling of ShopKo and Pamida stores,  an initiative started before the buyout. In addition, ShopKo is opening its  first new store in 6 years. These moves bring capital expenditures back up  to 2004 levels.", "Operationally, ShopKo reorganized its five regional management offices  into 14 district groups. The aim was to provide better and faster  communication between store managers and field management. Sun  Capital recruited a new Chief Executive Officer but retained most ShopKo  management. In addition, Sun Capital decided to operate ShopKo and  Pamida as separate entities. This was because Sun Capital believed the  ShopKo and Pamida customer bases were sufficiently different \u2014chiefly,  with Pamida\u2019s being more rural. Shortly after the acquisition, Sun Capital  sold off ShopKo\u2019s real estate holdings, leasing the properties back from  the new owners, in an $815.3 million deal that at the time was the biggest  retail sale-leaseback in U.S. history. Previously, ShopKo owned both the  land and buildings at about half its stores. Sun Capital executives said the  real estate deal allowed Sun Capital to retire debt used to finance the  buyout and to operate ShopKo with reasonable debt ratios and ample  liquidity. Using the real estate proceeds to pay down initial debt was  planned at the time of the buyout, Sun Capital executives said.", "Results: Sun Capital executives declined to provide information on post- buyout revenue and income, but they said that revenue has been relatively  level, after being on the decline before the takeover. Sun Capital  executives say they believe they have put ShopKo in a better position to  compete against national competitors like Target and Wal-Mart, by  leveraging Sun Capital\u2019s retailing experience and sourcing capabilities, and  by allowing ShopKo to focus on improving the business away from the  demands of the public marketplace. ShopKo is expanding again, and  remodeling efforts are paying off, with sales at remodeled stores up 5  percent compared with a base level for stores that have not been  remodeled, which executives say is a significant difference.", "Given pre-buyout store closings, Sun Capital judged corporate and  administrative staffing to be excessive when it took control. As a result,  there were a small number of layoffs in these areas after the deal closed.  Overall, before the buyout, the company employed approximately 22,800\u2014 17,000 at ShopKo stores and 5,800 at Pamida stores. Today, ShopKo  employs approximately 16,000. Sun Capital executives declined to provide  a figure for Pamida. Overall, jobs have been lost due to store closures but  are being added as new stores open. Given the geographic spread of  ShopKo stores, company employment is dispersed as well, and generally,  no single store is a major employer within its market area.", "Exit: Sun Capital plans to hold ShopKo in its portfolio for the immediate  future. Eventually, according to executives, an IPO of stock is the most  probable exit strategy, as there does not appear to be a strategic buyer.  Sun Capital executives believe the Pamida division, which has been  established as a separate internal unit, will have more exit options than the  ShopKo division because of Pamida\u2019s particular customer base."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Nordco, Inc., Case Study", "paragraphs": ["Overview: The Nordco buyout illustrates several elements of the private  equity market: a smaller deal; a buyout in which the seller was another  private equity firm; and pursuit of an add-on strategy in which the acquired  firm serves as a platform for subsequent purchases that build the size of  the company.

Instead, it works with a variety of sources, including  smaller investment banks and brokers. Among Riverside\u2019s contacts was a  Minneapolis investment bank that alerted Riverside executives, among  others, that Nordco\u2019s then-current owners, another private equity firm,  were selling. Riverside executives met with Nordco management before  Riverside decided to submit a bid. Because of the investment bank\u2019s  promotional efforts, there was strong competition for the acquisition,  Riverside executives said. Although small, Riverside considers thousands  of buyout opportunities. In 2007, the company reviewed 3,500  opportunities, which executives said they quickly reduced to only about  1,200. Riverside personnel visited 400 would-be targets, with the company  ultimately buying 28 of them, or 0.8 percent of the original group.  Financing for the Nordco deal included a feature where one lender  receives some of the interest it was due as an increase in its outstanding  balance rather than cash. This allowed Riverside to offer a higher overall  return, which the lender demanded, but without diverting cash from  earnings to pay the interest due.", "Strategy and implementation: While considering Nordco an attractive  acquisition target, Riverside executives nonetheless had some concerns  about Nordco\u2019s ability to increase revenues internally. For instance,  Nordco management had been projecting revenue growth of about 5  percent to 6 percent annually, which a Riverside executive told us was  \u201ckind of underwhelming.\u201d Thus, from the beginning, Riverside\u2019s strategy in  acquiring Nordco was to boost revenue by using Nordco as a vehicle for  making add-on acquisitions that would increase the size of the company.", "In line with this strategy, Riverside acquired J.E.R. Overhaul Inc., another  maintenance-of-way company, in September 2006 as an add-on to Nordco  in a $12 million deal. J.E.R. makes replacement parts used to rebuild  equipment, which can then be rented out. Nordco was already in the  replacement-part business, and J.E.R. copied parts made by Nordco and  others. Besides expanding Nordco\u2019s business, the J.E.R. deal also allowed  Nordco to eliminate the copying of its parts by a competitor. J.E.R. also  had expertise in rebuilding equipment made by Nordco competitors,  meaning that Nordco could thus gain intelligence about other makers\u2019  machines. In March 2007, Riverside made a second add-on acquisition:  $14.1 million for Dapco Industries, Inc., and Dapco Technologies, LLC, two  related companies active in rail inspection, including ultrasonic testing of  rails. With the Dapco companies holding 10 patents, Riverside found their  technology to be attractive. In April 2008, Riverside announced its third  add-on buyout for Nordco: $45.5 million for Central Power Products, Inc.,  one of only three U.S. makers of railcar movers, and whose innovation is  the use of rubber tires for traction instead of steel wheels.", "While the initial acquisition of Nordco was highly competitive, Riverside  approached the smaller, add-on companies directly. Beyond building the  core business, the add-on acquisitions were part of another post-takeover  strategy for Nordco: build revenues by providing services, in an effort to  achieve a more diversified, and hence steadier, stream of sales as a way to  buffer the cyclicality of the capital equipment marketplace, executives  said.", "Riverside\u2019s strategy for Nordco has also included emphasizing new  product development, which had lagged, and making manufacturing more  efficient. According to Riverside executives, apart from seeking to  improve operational efficiency, a key element has been to give the  management team an opportunity to own a significant portion of the  company, on the theory of aligning managers\u2019 interests with the  company\u2019s. Riverside executives said they expect that by the time the  company sells Nordco, management will own about 30 percent of the  business.", "Results: Revenue and employment have grown steadily since the  acquisition, even after factoring out the growth attributable to the  acquisitions. Excluding the most recent add-on acquisition, combined  revenues grew from $39.1 million in 2002 to $100.2 million in 2007, with  net income up from $2.6 million to $4.2 million For the same period,  employment more than doubled, from 106 to 283. For only Nordco,  revenues grew from $39.1 million in 2002 to $77.8 million in 2007, with net  income level at about $2.6 million. Employment increased from 106 to 158.  Riverside\u2019s initial concern about Nordco\u2019s internal growth turned out to be  unfounded, because actual sales growth has been about 20 percent  annually in recent years, versus the 5 percent to 6 percent once forecast.", "Riverside executives say they are pleased by the developments, which they  say have relied upon standard practices, such as planning and executing  well, rather than novel or unique methods. A union representing many  employees complimented the new owners for the job they have done. A  union official told us that new management has invested significantly;  been hands-off on daily operations; hired new managers without purging  the old; and negotiated a contract with comparatively generous benefits.  The official added that in contract negotiations, the company initially  made aggressive antiunion proposals on such matters as organizing  activity and insurance benefits but quickly withdrew most of them.  Overall, union members, who are affiliated with the United Steelworkers,  traded off changes in work rules in return for an otherwise favorable  contract that won overwhelming approval. The official said that if the  union is concerned about anything, it is that the company still has room to  improve its efficiency, which is something workers want for the sake of  long-run job security.", "Exit: Riverside executives said they do not yet have a definite exit  strategy. But in this case, a \u201cstrategic\u201d buyer, that is, one interested in the  company specifically for what it does, versus another private equity firm,  seems more likely, they said.

As a result, large, debt-related and dividend payments were  burdening the company. In October 2002, a potential investment deal  proposed several months earlier fell apart. In February 2003, Samsonite  announced it was pursuing a new recapitalization investment from the  Ares Management-led group. Ares Management executives said that they  became interested in the travel industry after its downturn following the  9/11 attacks and also were aware of Samsonite because of a prior  investment in the company. Samsonite\u2019s brand was attractive to Ares  Management, executives said, but the firm was also aware of the  company\u2019s debt service burden and potential for bankruptcy.", "Ares Management formed a three-firm team and offered Samsonite a cash  investment in conjunction with a restructuring of Samsonite\u2019s debt and  preferred stock. Ares Management executives said they brought in  partners because the deal was too large to handle alone. Ares Management  first approached the largest investor in its private equity fund, the private  equity arm of the Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan, which agreed to join.  Because a large portion of Samsonite\u2019s sales came from Europe, Ares  Management sought to include an investor located in that region. To that  end, executives brought in a fund managed by the European private equity  group of the investment firm Bain Capital.", "After several months of negotiations, Samsonite announced in May 2003  that an agreement had been reached. The three private equity firms  invested $106 million (with each firm investing a little over $35 million), in  return for a new series of Samsonite preferred stock. Samsonite used the  proceeds, in part, to repay existing debt. Samsonite also exchanged its  existing preferred stock for a combination of the new preferred stock and  common stock. Building on a prior investment stake held by Ares  Management, the three-firm consortium used this transaction to gain  control of about 56 percent of the company\u2019s outstanding voting shares.", "Holdings of existing common shareholders, who approved the deal, were  diluted from 100 percent to about a 3 percent stake of outstanding voting  shares. Ares Management executives said that common shareholders had  faced losing everything in a bankruptcy, while the recapitalization left  them with a smaller share of a more valuable company.", "Strategy and implementation: The consortium\u2019s revitalization strategy  was to focus on reducing the debt load while seeking to improve  marketing and product quality. According to Ares Management executives,  troubled businesses struggling to service high debt loads often reduce  spending on marketing and product development in favor of simply  focusing on survival. Samsonite\u2019s restructuring of its finances lowered its  interest and dividend payments, providing more cash for marketing and  other activities, the executives said. Other efforts focused on improving  product sourcing and distribution.", "In early 2004, Samsonite\u2019s new owners hired the former President and  Chief Executive of luxury goods maker Louis Vuitton to reinvigorate the  company\u2019s image and products. He moved to reposition Samsonite as a  premium lifestyle brand, rather than simply as a commodity provider of  luggage. Especially in the United States, the Samsonite brand had suffered  in recent years, although it was still strong in Europe and Asia.", "The company created a new label\u2014the Samsonite Black Label\u2014for the  higher-priced, and higher-margin, segment of the market, while  establishing a sister brand, American Tourister, as the company\u2019s lower- priced product. The new Chief Executive also focused on a high-end  marketing campaign by using business and entertainment celebrities to  sell the products. The company hired a noted designer to produce a new  line of luggage. Another element of the strategy was an expansion of retail  activities by opening stores in fashionable locations such as Bond Street in  London and Madison Avenue in New York City. Spending on advertising  grew steadily from $37 million in the company\u2019s 2004 fiscal year to $67.5  million in the 2007 fiscal year.", "Results: Since the acquisition, Ares Management achieved its goals of  boosting revenues and margins, with both measures steadily improving  from fiscal year 2003, before the acquisition, through fiscal year 2007.  Annual revenue grew by about 42 percent, from $752 million to $1.07  billion, and gross profit margin widened from 43 percent to 51 percent.  Over the same period, the company was profitable in fiscal years 2004 and  2006. But it suffered losses in fiscal years 2005 and 2007, due in part to  higher expenses in redeeming preferred shares and retiring debt. Ares  Management executives said net income has been hurt by one-time  charges, such as for restructuring and a computer system, that did not  reflect Samsonite\u2019s operating performance.", "Although Ares Management executives said they wanted to cut  Samsonite\u2019s debt burden, it went up. Six months before the three private  equity firms acquired Samsonite, the company had $423 million in long- term debt. This amount declined to $298 million at January 2006 but then  increased to $490 million for 2007.", "While owned by the group of private equity firms, Samsonite\u2019s global  employment dropped by about 7 percent, as the company laid off workers  following factory closings and relocations. In January 2003, 6 months  before the firms acquired the company, Samsonite employed 5,400 people.  In each year since then, according to federal securities filings, the  employment level has been at about 5,000. In 2007, about 1,300 of those  employees were in North America. Ares Management executives said they  could not provide figures for U.S. employment. They also said Samsonite\u2019s  mix of workers has changed, as manufacturing employees were reduced in  number, largely in Europe, but employees were added in marketing,  distribution, product development, and retail.", "In recent years, Samsonite has continued a pre-buyout trend to outsource  its manufacturing from company-owned factories to third-party vendors in  lower-cost regions, mostly in Asia. In fiscal year 2007, Samsonite  purchased 90 percent of its soft-sided luggage and related products from  vendors in Asia, while most of its hard-sided luggage was manufactured in  company-owned facilities. Because of the shift, Samsonite has sold or  closed several of its remaining manufacturing facilities, in France,  Belgium, Slovakia, Spain, and Mexico. Samsonite has also revamped  domestic operations. In May 2006, the company announced it would close  its former headquarters in Denver, Colorado; relocate Denver distribution  functions to Jacksonville, Florida; and consolidate corporate functions in a  Mansfield, Massachusetts, headquarters office.", "Exit: Initially, the three firms in the consortium were looking to exit their  Samsonite investment through an IPO of stock, but eventually pursued  another option. In early 2006, Samsonite, whose stock had been delisted  from the Nasdaq exchange in 2002, began exploring a listing on the  London Stock Exchange. In 2007, Samsonite began marketing the planned  offering in Europe. But, in May 2007, several private equity firms  approached one of Samsonite\u2019s private equity owners, Bain Capital, about  acquiring the company. As a result, Samsonite\u2019s consortium of owners  decided to open up an auction for the company, while still continuing with  plans for the stock offering. The auction attracted a number of bidders,  with CVC Capital Partners, a Luxembourg-based private equity firm,  emerging as the winning bidder.", "The buyout was completed in October 2007. Terms of the deal were $1.1  billion in cash, plus assumption of debt that valued the transaction at $1.7  billion. Samsonite directors and the three private equity owners, whose  holdings had grown to about 85 percent of the company, approved the deal  unanimously. The private equity firms received about $950 million,  according to a securities filing. An Ares Management executive said the  company believed it had re-energized the Samsonite brand."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix X: Econometric Analysis of the Price Impact of Club Deals", "paragraphs": ["The presence of club deals (collaboration of two or more private equity  firms in a buyout) in the leveraged buyout market has raised concerns  about the potential for anticompetitive pricing. For example, the  Department of Justice\u2019s Antitrust Division has reportedly launched an  inquiry into this practice by some large private equity firms. While club  deals could enhance competition by enabling private equity firms to bid  together for companies they otherwise could not buy on their own, these  deals could also reduce competition by reducing the number of firms  bidding on target companies and fostering a collusive environment. If joint  bidding by private equity firms facilitates collusion, the share price  premium over market prices that private equity firms pay to shareholders  should be lower in club deals than in nonclub deals. To investigate the  relationship between club deals and the premium, we constructed a  sample of public-to-private U.S. buyouts by private equity firms using  Dealogic\u2019s Merger and Acquisitions (M&A) database. The sample initially  contained observations on 510 public-to-private transactions involving U.S.  target companies from 1998 through 2007. Of these transactions, 325 had  the requisite premium data for further analysis. We employed standard  econometric modeling techniques, including Heckman\u2019s two-stage  modeling approach to address potential selection bias issues. While the  results suggest that, in general, club deals are not associated with lower or  higher premiums, we caution that our results should not be taken as  causal: that is, they should not be read as establishing that club deals  necessarily caused acquisition prices to be higher or lower. To the extent  that the nature of the firms and transactions we examined differ from the  overall population of club deals, our results may not generalize to the  population.

We  augmented our set of variables with information from SEC\u2019s Edgar  database, Audit Analytics, and LexisNexis. We used the Edgar database to  collect data on managerial and beneficial holdings of equity for each of  the target companies in our sample since the existing literature has shown  that the presence of these shareholders is associated with the premium  paid by buyout firms. Similarly we used Audit Analytics\u2014an online  intelligence service maintained by Ives Group, Incorporated\u2014to extract  data on audit opinions dating back to 2000.

Published research  suggests that under this specification, the premium incorporates the  informational value of any announcement made during the going-private  process, such as amended bid prices, bidder competition, and the  identification of the acquiring party. We use the premium based on the  price 1 day before the announcement since this measure is lower for club  deals than for single private equity transactions.
