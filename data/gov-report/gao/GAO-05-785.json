The Commission must submit its recommendations to the President by September 8, 2005, for his acceptance or rejection in their entirety. Congress has final action to accept or reject these recommendations in their entirety later this year. The law requires that GAO issue a report on the Department of Defense's (DOD) recommendations and selection process by July 1, 2005. GAO's objectives were to (1) determine the extent to which DOD's proposals achieved its stated BRAC goals, (2) analyze whether the process for developing recommendations was logical and reasoned, and (3) identify issues with the recommendations that may warrant further attention. Time constraints limited GAO's ability to examine implementation details of most of the individual recommended actions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD had varying success in achieving its 2005 BRAC goals of (1) reducing excess infrastructure and producing savings, (2) furthering transformation, and (3) fostering jointness. While DOD proposed a record number of closures and realignments, exceeding all prior BRAC rounds combined, many proposals focused on reserve bases and relatively few on closing active bases. Projected savings are almost equally large, but most savings are derived from 10 percent of the recommendations. While GAO believes savings would be achieved, overall up-front investment costs of an estimated $24 billion are required, and there are clear limitations associated with DOD's projection of nearly $50 billion in savings over a 20-year period. Much of the projected net annual recurring savings (47 percent) is associated with eliminating jobs currently held by military personnel. However, rather than reducing end-strength levels, DOD indicates the positions are expected to be reassigned to other areas, which may enhance capabilities but also limit dollar savings available for other uses. Sizeable savings were projected from efficiency measures and other actions, but underlying assumptions have not been validated and could be difficult to track over time. Some proposals represent efforts to foster jointness and transformation, such as initial joint training for the Joint Strike Fighter, but progress in each area varied, with many decisions reflecting consolidations within, and not across, the military services. In addition, transformation was often cited as support for proposals, but it was not well defined, and there was a lack of agreement on various transformation options. DOD's process for conducting its analysis was generally logical, reasoned, and well documented. DOD's process placed strong emphasis on data, tempered by military judgment, as appropriate. The military services and seven joint cross-service groups, which focused on common business-oriented functions, adapted their analytical approaches to the unique aspects of their respective areas. Yet, they were consistent in adhering to the use of military value criteria, including new considerations introduced for this round, such as surge and homeland defense needs. Data accuracy was enhanced by the required use of certified data and by efforts of the DOD Inspector General and service audit agencies in checking the data. Time limitations and complexities introduced by DOD in weaving together an unprecedented 837 closure and realignment actions across the country into 222 individual recommendations caused GAO to focus more on evaluating major cross-cutting issues than on implementation issues of individual recommendations. GAO identified various issues that may warrant further attention by the Commission. Some apply to a broad range of recommendations, such as assumptions and inconsistencies in developing certain cost and savings estimates, lengthy payback periods, or potential impacts on affected communities. GAO also identified certain candidate recommendations, including some that were changed by senior DOD leadership late in the process that may warrant attention."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["It has been 10 years since the Department of Defense (DOD) last conducted  a base realignment and closure (BRAC) round. As a result of prior BRAC  rounds in 1988, 1991, 1993, and 1995, DOD reports that it has reduced its  domestic infrastructure by about 20 percent in terms of plant replacement  value, transferred hundreds of thousand of acres of unneeded property to  other federal and nonfederal entities, and saved billions of dollars on an  annual recurring basis for application to higher priority defense needs.  Despite these infrastructure reductions, DOD recognized the need for  additional closures and realignments following the 1995 closure round and  made repeated efforts to gain congressional authorization for an additional  closure round.", "We too have frequently reported in recent years on the long-term  challenges DOD faces in managing its portfolio of facilities, halting  degradation of facilities, and reducing unneeded infrastructure to free up  funds to better maintain enduring facilities and meet other needs. Because  of these long-standing issues, DOD\u2019s management of its support  infrastructure has been included in our list of high-risk areas since 1997.", "Congress authorized an additional BRAC round for 2005 with the passage  of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (the Act).  The 2002 Act essentially extended the authority of the Defense Base  Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, which had authorized the 1991, 1993,  and 1995 rounds, with some modifications for the 2005 base closure round.  The BRAC legislation provides for an independent Defense Base Closure  and Realignment Commission to review the Secretary of Defense\u2019s  realignment and closure recommendations, which were publicly  announced on May 13, 2005, and present its findings and conclusions on the  Secretary\u2019s recommendations, along with its own recommendations to the  President, by September 8, 2005. The President, in turn, must either  approve or disapprove the Commission\u2019s recommendations in their entirety  by September 23, 2005. If approved, the recommendations are forwarded to  Congress, which has 45 days or until the adjournment of Congress to  disapprove the recommendations on an all-or-none basis; otherwise, they  become binding. If the President disapproves the recommendations, the  Commission must consider the President\u2019s objections and send a revised  report back to the President no later than October 20, 2005. The President  then has until November 7, 2005, to forward his approval of the revised  Commission recommendations to Congress for its review.", "Considering changes in the national security environment and emerging  threats, along with ongoing changes in the United States defense strategy  to address these threats and protect our homeland, DOD has come to  realize the need to reshape its base structure to more effectively support its  military forces. In establishing goals for the 2005 BRAC round, the  Secretary of Defense, in a November 15, 2002, memorandum initiating the  round, expressed his interest in (1) reducing excess infrastructure, which  diverts scarce resources from overall defense capability, and producing  savings; (2) transforming DOD by aligning the infrastructure with the  defense strategy; and (3) fostering jointness by examining and  implementing opportunities for greater jointness across DOD.", "In the submission of his recommendations to the BRAC Commission on  May 13, 2005, the Secretary reported that his recommendations, if  approved, would accomplish these goals. DOD reported that its 222  recommendations, involving an unprecedented 837 closure and  realignment actions\u2014including 33 major base closures and 30 major  realignments, plus numerous other closures and realignments would  generate annual recurring savings of about $5.5 billion beginning in fiscal  year 2012.", "Legislation authorizing the 2005 round maintained the requirement,  applicable to three previous rounds, that we provide a detailed analysis of  the Secretary\u2019s recommendations and the selection process. Our objectives  were to (1) determine the extent to which DOD achieved its stated goals for  BRAC 2005, (2) analyze whether DOD\u2019s selection process in developing  recommended actions was logical and reasoned, and (3) identify issues  regarding the recommendations that may warrant attention by the BRAC  Commission.", "To analyze the selection process and the recommendations, we monitored  various aspects of the process as it evolved over time leading up to and  following the public release of the Secretary\u2019s recommendations. We  sought to assure ourselves that DOD followed a logical, reasoned, and well- documented decision-making process leading to the proposed  recommendations. Prior to the release of the recommendations, we abided  by an agreement with DOD not to disclose details of the process due to the  sensitivity of the information while the process evolved. With the approval  of the large number of recommendations occurring in the final weeks of the  process, the broad scope and complexity of the recommendations, and the  limited time available for us to report our results, we generally focused  greater attention following the announcement of the proposed closures and  realignments on those issues affecting more than one recommendation  than on issues pertaining to the implementation of individual  recommendations. However, as time permitted, we visited selected  installations to better gauge the operational and economic impact of the  proposed recommendations. We generally experienced good access to  relevant documentation and to key senior officials and staff involved in the  BRAC process.", "We performed our work primarily at the Office of the Secretary of Defense  (OSD), the military services\u2019 base closure offices, and the offices of the  seven joint cross-service groups that were established by the Secretary to  propose cross-service recommendations. While we did not attend  deliberative meetings, we had access to minutes of meetings and relevant  documentation, as well as opportunities to meet periodically with senior  leadership to provide observations or concerns we had as the process was  unfolding. We relied on DOD\u2019s Office of the Inspector General, Army Audit  Agency, Naval Audit Service, and Air Force Audit Agency to validate the  accuracy of the data used by the military services and joint cross-service  groups in their decision-making process. We met with staff members of  these audit agencies periodically to discuss the results of their work as well  as to observe their data validation efforts at selected locations. Based on  these discussions and observations and a review of their reports, we  believe the DOD data are sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. We conducted our work from October 2003, as DOD\u2019s process was  beginning, through June 2005, shortly after the Secretary of Defense  announced his proposed closures and realignments, in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Further details on the  scope and methodology are described in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["As described at the beginning of this report, DOD recognized the need for  additional base closures and realignments following the 1995 closure round  and made repeated efforts to gain congressional authorization for an  additional closure round.

The 2002 Act essentially extended the authority of the Defense Base  Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, which had authorized the 1991,  1993, and 1995 rounds, with some modifications for the 2005 base closure  round.", "In a memorandum dated November 15, 2002, the Secretary of Defense  issued initial guidance outlining goals and a leadership framework for the  2005 BRAC round. In doing so, he noted that \u201cAt a minimum, BRAC 2005  must eliminate excess physical capacity; the operation, sustainment and  recapitalization of which diverts scarce resources from defense capability.\u201d  However, specific reduction goals were not established. At the same time,  the Secretary\u2019s guidance for the 2005 round depicted the round as focusing  on more than the reduction of excess capacity. He said that \u201cBRAC 2005  can make an even more profound contribution to transforming the  Department by rationalizing our infrastructure with defense strategy.\u201d He  further noted that \u201cA primary objective of BRAC 2005, in addition to  realigning our base structure to meet our post-Cold War force structure, is  to examine and implement opportunities for greater joint activity.\u201d Toward  that end, the Secretary indicated that organizationally the 2005 BRAC  analysis would be two pronged. Joint cross-service teams would analyze  common business-oriented functions, and the military departments would  analyze service-unique functions.", "The Secretary of Defense established two senior groups to oversee and  guide the BRAC 2005 process from a departmental perspective. The first  was the Infrastructure Executive Council (IEC), which was designated the  policy-making and oversight body for the entire process, and the second, a  subordinate group, was the Infrastructure Steering Group (ISG), created to  oversee the joint cross-service analyses and integrate that process with the  military departments\u2019 own service-unique analyses. Each of the military  departments also established BRAC organizations, which had oversight  from senior leaders. Likewise, each of the joint cross-service teams, under  the purview of the ISG, was led by senior military or civilian officials, with  representation from each of the services and relevant defense agencies.  DOD\u2019s BRAC leadership structure is shown in figure 1.", "DOD developed a draft set of 77 transformational options that once  approved, were expected to constitute a minimum analytical framework  upon which the military departments and joint cross-service groups would  conduct their respective BRAC analyses. Because of a lack of agreement  among the services and OSD, the draft options were never formally  approved, but they remained available for consideration by analytical  teams and were referenced by some groups in support of various BRAC actions being considered. (See app. XV for a list of the draft  transformational options.) To some extent, the analyses and  recommendations of each of the services and joint cross-service groups  were also influenced by various guiding principles or policy imperatives  developed by the respective service or joint cross-service groups, such as  the need to preserve a particular capability in a particular location.", "The legislation authorizing the 2005 BRAC round, enacted as part of the  fiscal year 2002 Defense Authorization Act, required DOD to give priority to  selection criteria dealing with military value and added elements of  specificity to criteria previously used by DOD in prior BRAC rounds.  Subsequently, The Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 2005 codified the entire selection criteria and added the  word \u201csurge\u201d to one previously used criterion related to potential future  contingencies and mobilization efforts. In large measure, the final criteria  closely followed the criteria DOD employed in prior rounds, with greater  specificity added in some areas, as required by Congress. Figure 2 shows  DOD\u2019s selection criteria for 2005, with changes from BRAC 1995 denoted in  bold.", "To ensure that the selection criteria were consistently applied, OSD  established a common analytical framework to be used by each military  service and joint cross-service group. Each service and group adapted this  framework, in varying degrees, to its individual activities and functions in  evaluating facilities and functions and identifying closure and realignment  options. Despite the diversity of bases and cross-service functions  analyzed, each of the groups was expected to first analyze capacity and  military value of its respective facilities or functions, and then to identify  and evaluate various closure and realignment scenarios and provide  specific recommendations. Scenarios were derived from data analysis and  transformational options, as well as from goals and objectives each group  established for itself as it began its work. Figure 3 depicts the expected  progression of that process.", "An initial part of the process involved an overall capacity analysis of  specific locations or functions and subfunctions at specific locations. The  analysis relied on data calls to obtain certified data to assess such factors  as maximum potential capacity, current capacity, current usage, excess  capacity, and capacity needed to meet surge requirements.", "The military value analysis consisted of assessments of operational and  physical characteristics of each installation, or specific functions on an  installation related to a specific joint cross-service group\u2019s area of  responsibility. These would include an installation\u2019s or function\u2019s current  and future mission capabilities, physical condition, ability to accommodate  future needs, and cost of operations. This analysis also relied on data calls  to obtain certified data on the various attributes and metrics used to assess  each of the four military value criteria and permit meaningful comparisons  between like installations/facilities with reference to the collective military  value selection criteria. DOD officials used these data to develop  comparative military value scores for each installation/facility or for  categories of facilities serving like functions.", "The scenario development and analysis phase focused on identifying  various realignment and closure scenarios for further analysis. These  scenarios were to be derived from consideration of the department\u2019s 20- year force structure plan, capacity analysis, military value analysis, and  transformational options; applicable guiding principles, objectives, or  policy imperatives identified by individual military services or joint cross- service groups; and military judgment. Each component had available for  its use an optimization or linear programming model that could combine  the results of capacity and military value analyses and other information to  derive scenarios and sets of alternatives. The model could be used to  address varying policy imperatives or objectives, such as minimizing the  number of sites, minimizing the amount of excess capacity, or maximizing  the average military value. A BRAC review group could also direct  variations that would, for example, eliminate as much excess capacity as  possible while maintaining an average military value at least as high as the  original set of sites.", "OSD policy guidance has historically specified that priority consideration  be given to military value in making closure and realignment decisions, but  that priority was specifically mandated by the legislation authorizing the  2005 BRAC round. At the same time, historic practice and the 2005  authorizing legislation both required consideration of additional issues  included in selection criteria 5 through 8, detailed below:  Criterion 5\u2014costs and savings: This criterion consists of measures of  costs and savings and the payback periods associated with them. Each  component assessed costs using the Cost of Base Realignment Actions  (COBRA) model that was used in each of the BRAC rounds since 1988.  Appendix XIII summarizes improvements that have been made to the  model over time and more recently for the 2005 round.", "Criterion 6\u2014economic impact: This criterion measures the direct and  indirect impacts of a BRAC action on employment in the communities  affected by a closure or realignment. Appendix XIV provides a more  complete description of how economic impact was assessed and the  changes made to improve the assessment for this round.", "Criterion 7\u2014community infrastructure: Selection criterion 7  examines \u201cthe ability of the infrastructure of both the existing and  potential receiving communities to support forces, missions, and  personnel.\u201d The services and joint cross-service groups considered  information on demographics, childcare, cost of living, employment,  education, housing, medical care, safety and crime, transportation, and  public utilities of the communities impacted by a BRAC action.", "Criterion 8\u2014environmental impact: Selection criterion 8 assesses \u201cthe  environmental impact, including the impact of costs related to potential  environmental restoration, waste management, and environmental  compliance activities\u201d of closure and realignment recommendations. In  considering this criterion, the services and joint cross-service groups  focused mainly on potential environmental impacts while  acknowledging, when appropriate, known environmental restoration  costs associated with an installation recommended for closure or  realignment. Waste management and environmental compliance costs  were factored into criterion 5. However, under OSD policy guidance,  environmental restoration costs were not considered in the cost and  savings analyses for evaluating individual scenarios under criterion 5.  DOD is obligated to restore contaminated sites on military bases  regardless of whether they are closed, and such costs could be affected  by reuse plans that cannot be known at this time but would be budgeted  for at a later time when those plans and costs are better identified.", "Each of the military departments produced reports with closure and  realignment recommendations, as did each of the joint cross-service  groups, the results of which are summarized in appendixes III through XII.  Figures 4 and 5 show, respectively, the 33 major closures and 30 major  realignments that have been recommended by DOD where plant  replacement values exceed $100 million for major base closures and net  losses of 400 or more military and civilian personnel for major base  realignments.", "While the 2005 BRAC round, like earlier BRAC rounds, was chartered to  focus on United States domestic bases, DOD separately had under way a  review of overseas basing requirements that had implications for the  domestic BRAC process. In a September 2004 report to Congress, the  Under Secretary of Defense for Policy provided an update on DOD\u2019s \u201cglobal  defense posture review.\u201d It noted that once completed, the changes  stemming from the review would result in the most profound reordering of  United States military forces overseas as the current posture has been  largely unchanged since the Korean War. The report noted that over the  next 10 years, it is planned that up to 70,000 military personnel would  return to the United States, along with approximately 100,000 family  members and civilian employees. It further noted that a net reduction of  approximately 35 percent of overseas sites\u2014bases, installations, and  facilities\u2014is planned. DOD had indicated that the domestic BRAC process  would be used in making decisions on where to relocate forces returning to  the United States from overseas bases.", "Separately, Congress in 2003 mandated the creation of a special  commission to evaluate, among other things, the current and proposed  overseas basing structure of the United States military forces. The  Commission\u2019s observations are included in its May 2005 report. Among  other things, the Commission cited the need for appropriate planning to  ensure the availability of community infrastructure to support returning  troops and to mitigate the impact on communities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Recommendations Would Have Varying Degrees of Success in Achieving Goals for the 2005 BRAC Round", "paragraphs": ["The recommendations proposed by the Secretary of Defense would have  varying degrees of success in achieving DOD\u2019s BRAC 2005 goals of  reducing infrastructure and achieving savings, furthering transformation  objectives, and fostering joint activity among the military services.

Projected savings are almost equally as large, as all prior BRAC rounds  combined, but about 80 percent of the projected 20-year net present value  savings (savings minus up-front investment costs) are derived from only 10  percent of the recommendations. While we believe the recommendations  overall would achieve savings, up-front investment costs of about  $24 billion are required to implement all recommendations to achieve  DOD\u2019s overall expected savings of nearly $50 billion over 20 years. Much of  these saving are related to eliminations of jobs currently held by military  personnel but are not likely to result in end-strength reductions, limiting  savings available for other purposes.

The increase  in costs is due partly to significant military construction and moving costs  associated with Army recommendations to realign its force structure, and  to recommendations to move activities from leased space onto military  installations. For example, the Army projects that it will need about  $2.3 billion in military construction funds to build facilities for the troops  returning from overseas. Likewise, DOD projects that it will need an  additional $1.3 billion to build facilities for recommendations that include  activities being moved from leased space. Time will be required for these  costs to be offset by savings from BRAC actions and this in turn affects the  point at which net annual recurring savings can begin to accrue.", "Finally, the projected net annual recurring savings are $5.5 billion  compared to net annual recurring savings of $2.6 billion and $1.7 billion for  the 1993 and 1995 rounds respectively.

In contrast, because of the nature of the  Army\u2019s proposed actions and costs, such as providing infrastructure for  troops returning from overseas and the consolidation and recapitalization  of reserve facilities, the Army does not achieve net savings either during  the implementation period or within 20 years, based on recommendations  included in its BRAC report.", "Notwithstanding these projected savings, we identified limitations or  uncertainties about the magnitude of savings likely to be realized. As figure  6 shows, 47 percent of the net annual recurring savings can be attributed to  projected military personnel reductions. About 40 percent ($2.1 billion) of  the projected net annual recurring savings can be attributed to savings  from operation and maintenance activities, which include terminating or  reducing property sustainment and recapitalization, base operating  support, and civilian payroll. Furthermore, about $500 million of the  \u201cother\u201d savings is based on business process reengineering efforts, but  some of the assumptions supporting the expected efficiency gains have not  been validated."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Military Personnel Savings", "paragraphs": ["Much of the projected net annual recurring savings (47 percent) are  associated with eliminating positions currently held by military personnel;  but rather than reducing end-strength levels, DOD indicates the positions  are expected to be reassigned to other areas, limiting dollar savings  available for other uses.

Likewise, the Army  is projecting savings from eliminating about 5,800 military positions, but it  has no plans to reduce its end-strength. Finally, the Navy is projecting it will  eliminate about 4,000 active duty military positions, which a Navy official  noted will help it achieve the end-strength reductions already planned. As  we noted during our review of DOD\u2019s process during the 1995 BRAC round,  since these personnel will be assigned elsewhere rather than taken out of  the force structure, they do not represent dollar savings that can be readily  reallocated outside the personnel accounts. Without recognition that  these are not dollar savings that can be readily applied elsewhere, this  could create a false sense of savings available for use in other areas  traditionally cited as a beneficiary of BRAC savings, such as making more  funds available for modernization and better maintenance of remaining  facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sustainment, Recapitalization, and Base Operating Support Savings", "paragraphs": ["DOD is also projecting savings from the sustainment and recapitalization of  facilities that are scheduled to be demolished, as well as from facilities that  might remain in DOD\u2019s real property inventory when activities are  realigned from one base to another. For example, the Industrial Joint  Cross-Service Group is claiming about $20 million in annual recurring  savings from the recapitalization of facilities at installations responsible for  destroying chemical weapons at three locations recommended for  closure. However, the Army had already expected to demolish these  chemical destruction facilities upon completing the destruction of the  chemical weapons at each site and the Army has not identified future  missions for these installations. As a result, we do not believe it is  appropriate for the Industrial Joint Cross-Service Group to claim any  recapitalization savings related to these installations.", "Likewise, DOD is projecting savings from the recapitalization and  sustainment of facilities in cases where functions or activities would be  realigned from one base to another. However, it is not clear to what extent  the proposed realignments would result in an entire building or portion of a  building being vacated, or if entire buildings are vacated, whether they  would be declared excess and removed from the military services\u2019 real  property inventory. Our analysis shows that the supply and storage group\u2019s  recommendations project about $100 million in sustainment and  recapitalization savings from realigning defense distribution depots. The  group estimates its recommendations will vacate about 27 million square  feet of storage space. Supply and storage officials told us their goal is to  vacate as much space as possible by re-warehousing inventory and by  reducing personnel spaces, but they do not have a specific plan for what  will happen to the space once it is vacated. In addition, until these  recommendations are ultimately approved and implemented, DOD will not  be in a good position to know exactly how much space is available or how  this space will be disposed of or utilized. As a result, it is unclear as to how  much of the estimated $100 million in annual recurring savings will actually  occur.", "Collectively, the issues we identified suggest the potential for reduced  savings that are likely to be realized in the short term during the  implementation period, which could further reduce net annual recurring  savings realized in the long term. The short-term impact is that these  reduced savings could adversely affect DOD\u2019s plans for using these BRAC  savings to help offset the up-front investment costs required to implement  the recommendations and could further limit the amount of savings  available for transformation and modernization purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Savings Based on Business Process Reengineering", "paragraphs": ["DOD projected net annual recurring savings in the \u201cother\u201d category as  shown in figure 6 include about $500 million that is based on business  process reengineering efforts. Our analysis indicates that four  recommendations\u2014one from the Industrial Joint Cross-Service Group and  three from the Supply and Storage Joint Cross-Service Group\u2014involve  primarily business process reengineering efforts. However, the expected  efficiency gains from these recommendations are based on assumptions  that are subject to some uncertainty and have not been validated. For  example, our analysis indicates that $215 million, or 63 percent, of the  estimated annual recurring savings from the Industrial Joint Cross-Service  Group recommendation to create fleet readiness centers within the Navy is  based on business reengineering efforts that would result in overhead  efficiencies. Although the data suggest there is the potential for savings, we  believe the magnitude of the savings is somewhat uncertain because the  estimates are based on assumptions that have undergone only limited  testing. Realizing the full extent of the savings would depend on actual  implementation of the recommended actions and modifications to the  Navy\u2019s supply system. The industrial group and the Navy assumed that  combining depot and intermediate maintenance levels would reduce the  time needed for an item to be repaired at the intermediate level, which in  turn would reduce the number of items needing to be kept in inventory, as  well as the number of items being sent to a depot for repair. These  assumptions, which were the major determinant of the realignment  savings, were reportedly based on historical data and pilot projects and  have not been independently reviewed or verified by the Naval Audit  Service, the DOD Inspector General, or us.", "Furthermore, our analysis indicates that $291 million, or about 72 percent,  of the net annual recurring savings expected from the Supply and Storage  Joint Cross-Service Group\u2019s three recommendations are also based on  business process reengineering. In the COBRA model, the savings are  categorized as procurement savings and are based on the expanded use of  performance-based logistics and reductions to duplicate inventory.  Supply and storage group staff said that these savings accrue from reduced  contract prices because the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) will have  increased buying power since it is responsible for purchasing many more  items that before were purchased by each of the services. In addition,  savings accrue from increased use of performance-based agreements, a  key component of performance-based logistics. The group estimates DLA  can save 2.8 cents on each contract dollar placed on performance-based  agreements. In addition, savings result from reductions in the amount of  stock that must be held in inventory. Supply and storage staff said that  these savings are attributable to reductions in the cost of money, cost of  stock losses due to obsolescence, and cost of storage. Together the group  estimates these factors save about 17 percent of the estimated value of the  acquisition cost of the stock that is no longer required to be held in  inventory. These savings estimates, for the most part, are based on  historical documentation provided by DLA, which time did not allow us to  validate. The extent to which these same savings will be achieved in the  future is uncertain. As noted above, how these actions are implemented  could also affect savings. We are concerned that this is another area that  could lead to a false sense of savings and lead to premature reductions in  affected budgets in advance of actual savings being fully realized, as has  sometimes occurred in past efforts to achieve savings through business  process reengineering efforts. We are also concerned that it could  exacerbate a problem we have previously identified regarding past BRAC  rounds involving the lack of adequate systems in place to track and update  savings resulting from BRAC actions\u2014the focus of our recommendation  for the Secretary of Defense. These concerns are reinforced by limitations  in DOD\u2019s financial management systems that historically have made it  difficult to fully identify the costs of operations and provide a complete  baseline from which to assess savings."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Transformation Cited as Justification for Many Recommendations Despite Lack of Clear Agreement on Transformational Options", "paragraphs": ["While furthering transformation was one of the BRAC goals, there was no  agreement between DOD and its components on what should be  considered a transformational effort.

The OSD BRAC office narrowed this list to 77 options, but  agreement was not reached within the department on these options, so  none of them were formally approved. Nonetheless, each service and joint  cross-service group was permitted to use the transformational options as  appropriate to support its candidate recommendations. Appendix XV has a  list of these 77 draft options.", "Collectively, these draft options did not provide a clear definition of  transformation across the department. The options ranged from those that  seemed to be service specific to those that suggested new ways of doing  business. For example, some transformational options included reducing  the number of Army Reserve regional headquarters; optimizing Air Force  squadrons; and co-locating various functions such as recruiting, military  and civilian personnel training, and research, development and acquisition  and test and evaluation, across the military departments. In contrast, some  options suggested consideration of new ways of doing business, such as  privatizing some functions and establishing a DOD agency to oversee  depot-level reparables.", "While the transformational options were never formally approved, our  analysis indicates that many of DOD\u2019s recommendations reference one or  more of the 77 transformational options.

Likewise, 37 of the Army reserve component  recommendations reference the option to co-locate guard and reserve units  at active bases or consolidate guard and reserve units that are located in  proximity to one another at one location.", "Conversely, a number of the scenarios that were initially considered but  not adopted reference transformational options that could have changed  existing business practices. For example, the education and training group  developed a number of scenarios\u2014privatizing graduate education  programs and consolidating undergraduate fixed and rotary wing pilot  training\u2014based on the draft transformational options, but none were  ultimately approved by the department."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Progress Made in Fostering Joint Basing", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s recommendations make some progress toward the goal of fostering  joint activity among the military services, based on a broad definition of  joint activity.

For example, all of the groups used the DOD- approved COBRA model to calculate costs, savings, and return on  investment for BRAC scenarios and, ultimately for the final 222 BRAC  recommendations. As noted in appendix XIII, the COBRA model was  designed to provide consistency across the military services and the joint  cross-service groups in estimating BRAC costs and savings.

The Army created a separate yet parallel approach in  reviewing its reserve components for several reasons, although it generally  followed the BRAC process. With respect to its reserve components, the  Army did not perform a military value rank-ordering of these various  installations across the country, but instead assessed the relative military  value that could be obtained by consolidating various facilities into a joint  facility in specific geographical locales to support, among other things,  reserve component training, recruiting, and retention efforts. This  approach provided an opportunity for the Army reserve components to  actively participate in the BRAC process along with the voluntary  participation of the states. The Army reported that consulting with the  states was crucial to ensure the support of the state governors and staff  Adjutants General for issues related to recommendations that affected the  National Guard. The Army\u2019s recommendations affected almost 10 percent  of the Army\u2019s 4,000 reserve components\u2019 facilities.

Our analysis shows that all three military  departments factored in homeland defense needs, with the Air Force  recommendations having the most impact. According to Air Force  officials, the U.S. Northern Command identified specific homeland  defense missions assigned to the Air Force, which they incorporated  into its decision-making process. Navy officials likewise discussed the  impact of potential BRAC scenarios on its maritime homeland defense  mission with U.S. Northern Command, U.S. Strategic Command, and the  U.S. Coast Guard. In this regard, the Navy decided to retain Naval Air  Station Point Mugu, California, was influenced, in part, because the U.S.  Coast Guard wanted to consolidate its West Coast aviation assets at this  installation for homeland defense purposes. According to Army  officials, most of the their role in supporting homeland defense is  carried out by the Army National Guard. The U.S. Northern Command  reviewed the recommendations and found no unacceptable risk to the  homeland defense mission and support to civil authorities.", "Surge: DOD left it to each military service and joint cross-service group  to determine how surge would be considered in the their analysis.  Generally, all the groups considered surge by retaining a certain  percentage of infrastructure, making more frequent use of existing  infrastructure, or retaining difficult-to-reconstitute assets. For example,  the Technical Joint Cross-Service Group set aside 10 percent of its  facility infrastructure for surge, while the Industrial Joint Cross-Service  Group factored in additional work shifts in its analysis. The military  services retained difficult-to-reconstitute assets as the primary driver to  satisfying the statutory requirement to consider surge capability. Both  the Army and Navy gave strong consideration to infrastructure that  would be difficult to reconstitute, such as large tracts of land for  maneuver training purposes or berthing space for docking ships. For  example, the Navy has a finite number of ships and aircraft and would  likely have to increase operating tempo to meet surge needs. The Air  Force addressed surge by retaining sufficient capacity to absorb  temporary increases in operations, such as responding to emergencies  or natural catastrophic events like hurricane damage, and the capacity  to permanently relocate all of its aircraft stationed overseas in the  United States if needed.", "Congress also mandated four other criteria to be considered in the  analytical process: cost and savings of the BRAC recommendations,  economic impact on affected communities, impact on communities\u2019  infrastructure, and environmental impact. The extent these other mandated  considerations influenced recommendations varied. For example, high cost  was the primary reason the Army decided not to develop a  recommendation to restation troops returning from overseas to  installations with large tracts of undeveloped land that could potentially  accommodate these moves, such as Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, or  Dugway Proving Ground, Utah. Despite these installations having the  capacity to provide large training ranges, they do not have existing  infrastructure to immediately house 3,000 to 5,000 troops required for the  Army\u2019s new modular combat brigades. Initially, the Army assessed the  possibility of building new infrastructure at these locations, but Army  BRAC officials told us it would be too costly given that the Army\u2019s COBRA  analysis showed that at Yuma, for example, it would cost about $2 billion to  build the required infrastructure. As a result, the Army decided to place  units returning from overseas at installations currently used to base other  operational units, notwithstanding limitations in existing training  capacities.", "Although there was heavy reliance on data for completing analyses,  military judgment was also a factor throughout the entire process, starting  with an analytical framework to base analysis of the 20-year force structure  plan and ending with the finalized list of 222 recommendations submitted  to the BRAC Commission. Military judgment also played a role in decisions  on how military value selection criteria would be captured as attributes,  with associated values or weights. Military judgment was also applied in  deciding which proposed scenarios or actions should move forward for  additional analysis. Generally, military judgment was exercised at this stage  to delete or modify a potential recommendation for reasons such as  strategic importance, as shown in the following examples:  Naval Shipyard Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, which has a lower military value  than other shipyards, was eliminated from closure consideration  because the shipyard was considered to have more strategic  significance in the Pacific Ocean area compared to other alternatives.", "Tripler Army Medical Center, Hawaii, which has a lower military value  than some other bases, was eliminated from closure consideration  because it is the only defense medical center of significant size in the  Pacific Ocean area.", "Naval Station Everett, Washington, which has a lower military value  than some other bases, was eliminated from closure consideration  because of strategic reasons regarding the number and the locations of  the Navy\u2019s aircraft carriers on the West Coast and in the Pacific.", "Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota, which has a lower military  value than some other bases, was eliminated from closure consideration  because of the belief that a strategic presence was needed in the north  central United States.

According to the education and training group, its one recommendation  with no payback period is due to the high military construction costs  associated with the new mission to consolidate initial training for the Joint  Strike Fighter aircraft for the Navy, the Marine Corps and the Air Force.", "Similarly, the Army has nearly 50 percent of the total number of DOD  recommendations with payback periods of 10 years or longer.

While the impact of these  inconsistencies on savings is likely not as great as others noted in this  report, it nevertheless contributes to the overall imprecision of the cost  estimates of DOD\u2019s recommended actions.", "One area of inconsistent accounting involves the relative amounts of  estimated support costs\u2014such as the cost of connecting a new facility to  existing water, sewage, and electrical systems\u2014associated with military  construction projects across the services. In its estimates, the Army  considered these additional support costs as one-time costs whereas the  Navy and the Air Force included them in the cost of the military  construction projects for each project. By including these support costs in  the cost of each project, the Navy and Air Force generally generated higher  relative recurring costs than the Army for the recapitalization of facilities  over time. Specifically, the Army increased its military construction cost  estimates by 18.5 percent to account for the connection of the projected  new facilities\u2019 utilities. The Air Force, on the other hand, increased its  construction costs for support services from 8 to 40 percent, depending on  the type of facility, while the Navy included support costs at only two  locations. According to the Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Navy  for BRAC, the Navy assigned teams to review all proposed military  construction projects by location to determine any support costs necessary  for connection of utilities. Our analysis shows that had the Army used the  same methodology as the Navy and the Air Force, the Army would incur  about $66 million in additional recapitalization costs for all of its proposed  military construction projects.", "The services were also inconsistent in considering the costs associated  with meeting DOD\u2019s antiterrorism force protection standards in their  estimated costs for military construction projects. The Air Force  increased the expected costs of its military construction projects by 2.3  percent, or about $18 million, to meet DOD\u2019s standards. Air Force officials  noted that these funds would provide enhancements such as security  barriers and blast proof windows. The Army and the Navy, on the other  hand, did not include additional costs to meet the department\u2019s standards  in their proposed military construction projects. If the Army and the Navy  estimated costs similarly to the Air Force, the cost of their proposed  military construction projects would have increased by about $146 million  and $25 million, respectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Uncertainties in Accounting for All Expected Costs or Savings to the Federal Government", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s cost and savings estimates for implementing its recommendations  do not fully reflect all expected costs or savings that may accrue to the  federal government. The BRAC legislation requires that DOD take into  account the effect of proposed closure or realignment on the costs of any  other activity of the department or any other federal agency that may be  required to assume responsibility for activities at military installations.  While the services and joint cross-service groups were aware of the  potential for these costs, estimated costs were not included in the cost and  savings analysis because it was unclear what actions an agency might take  in response to the BRAC action. One such agency was the U.S. Coast  Guard, which currently maintains some of its ships or various units at  several installations that are slated to close. Navy BRAC officials briefed  the U.S. Coast Guard about its recommendations prior to the list being  published, but the Air Force did not meet with the Coast Guard. The U.S.  Coast Guard was still in the process of evaluating various responses to take  as a result of the proposed BRAC actions and did not complete its analysis  in time for it to be included in this report.", "Further, as noted earlier, estimated costs for the environmental restoration  of bases undergoing closure or realignment are not included in DOD\u2019s cost  and savings analyses. Such costs would be difficult to fully project at this  point without planned reuse of the unneeded property being known.  Consistent with the prior BRAC rounds, DOD excluded estimates for base  environment restoration actions from its costs and savings analysis and in  determining payback periods, on the premise that restoration is a liability  that the department must address regardless of whether a base is kept open  or closed and therefore should not be included in the COBRA analysis.  Nevertheless, DOD did give consideration to such costs in addressing  selection criterion 8, and included available information on estimated  restoration costs as part of the data supporting its BRAC  recommendations. DOD estimates that the restoration costs to implement  its major closures would be about $949 million, as shown in table 5. (See  fig. 4 in the Background section for a map of DOD\u2019s major base closures.)", "Based on the data provided, the Army would incur the largest share of  estimated restoration costs due to the closure of several ammunition plants  and chemical depots. The largest expected costs for any one location  across DOD, about $383 million, would be for restoration at Hawthorne  Army Depot, Nevada. While the DOD report does not specifically identify  the potential for some additional restoration costs at its installations,  available supporting documentation does identify some additional costs.  For example, the Army estimated the range restoration at Hawthorne Army  Depot could cost from about $27 million to $147 million, which is not  included in the estimates in table 5. Further, the Army recognizes that  additional restoration costs could be incurred at six additional locations  that have ranges and chemical munitions, but these costs have not yet been  determined.", "Our prior work has shown that environmental costs can be significant, as  evidenced by the nearly $12 billion in total cost DOD expected to incur  when all restoration actions associated with the prior BRAC rounds are  completed. Service officials told us that the projected cost estimates for  environmental restoration are lower, in general, because the environmental  condition of today\u2019s bases is much better than the condition of bases closed  during the prior BRAC rounds, primarily because of DOD\u2019s ongoing active  base environmental restoration program. Nonetheless, our prior work has  indicated that as closures are implemented, more intensive environmental  investigations occur and additional hazardous conditions may be  uncovered that could result in additional, unanticipated restoration and  higher costs. Finally, the services\u2019 preliminary estimates are based on  restoration standards that are applicable for the current use of the base  property. Because reuse plans developed by communities receiving former  base property sometimes reflect different uses for the property this could  lead to more stringent and thus more expensive restoration in many cases.", "Based on experiences from prior BRAC rounds, we believe other costs are  also likely to be incurred, although not required to be included in DOD\u2019s  cost and savings analysis but which could add to the total costs to the  government of implementing the BRAC round. These costs include  transition assistance, planning grants, and other assistance made available  to affected communities by DOD and other agencies. DOD officials told us  that such estimates were not included in the prior rounds\u2019 analyses and that  it was too difficult to project these costs, given the unknown factors  associated with the number of communities affected and the costs that  would be required to assist them. Additionally, as we reported in January  2005, in the prior four BRAC rounds, DOD\u2019s Office of Economic  Adjustment, the Department of Labor, the Economic Development  Administration within the Department of Commerce, and the Federal  Aviation Administration provided nearly $2 billion in assistance through  fiscal year 2004 to communities and individuals, and according to DOD  officials, these agencies are slated to perform similar roles for the 2005  round. However, while the magnitude of this assistance is unknown at this  time, it is important to note that assistance will likely be needed in this  round, as contrasted with prior rounds, for not only those communities that  surround bases losing missions and personnel but also for communities  that face considerable challenges dealing with large influxes of personnel  and military missions. For example, DOD stated in its 2005 BRAC report  that over 100 actions significantly affect local communities, triggering  federal assistance from DOD and other federal agencies. Also, as discussed  more fully later, the number of bases in the 2005 BRAC round that will gain  several thousand personnel from the recommended actions could increase  pressure for federal assistance to mitigate the impact on community  infrastructure, such as schools and roads, with the potential for more costs  than in the prior rounds.", "Finally, the BRAC costs and savings estimates do not include any  anticipated revenue from such actions as the sale of unneeded former base  property or the transfer of property to communities through economic development conveyances. The potential for significant revenue may exist  at certain locations. For example, the Navy sold some unneeded property  from prior round actions in California at the former El Toro Marine Corps  Air Station for about $650 million and the former Tustin Marine Corps Air  Station for $208.5 million. The extent to which sales will play a role in the  disposal of unneeded property arising from the 2005 BRAC round remains  to be seen."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impact of BRAC Recommended Actions on Communities", "paragraphs": ["The recommended actions for the 2005 BRAC round will have varying  degrees of impact on communities surrounding bases undergoing a closure  or realignment. While some will face economic recovery challenges as a  result of a closure and associated losses of base personnel, others, which  expect large influxes of personnel due to increased base activity, face a  different set of challenges involving community infrastructure necessary to  accommodate growth.", "In examining the economic impact of the 222 BRAC recommendations as  measured by the percentage of employment, DOD data indicate that most  economic areas across the country are expected to be affected very little  but a few could face substantial impact. Almost 83 percent of the 244  economic areas affected by BRAC recommendations fall between a  1 percent loss in employment and a 1 percent gain in employment. Slightly  more than 9 percent of the economic areas had a negative economic impact  of greater than 1 percent, but for some of these areas, the projected impact  is fairly significant, ranging up to a potential direct and indirect loss of up  to nearly 21 percent. Almost 8 percent of the economic areas had a positive  economic impact greater than 1 percent. Appendix XIV provides additional  detail on our economic analyses.", "Of those communities facing potential negative economic impact, six  communities face the potential for a fairly significant impact. They include  communities surrounding Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico;  Hawthorne Army Depot, Nevada; Naval Support Activity Crane, Indiana;  Submarine Base New London, Connecticut; Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska;  and Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota, where the negative impact on  employment as a percent of area employment ranges from 8.5 percent to  20.5 percent. Our prior work has shown that a variety of factors will affect  how quickly communities are able to rebound from the negative economic  consequences of closures and realignments. They include such factors as  the trends associated with the national, regional, and local economies;  natural and labor resources; effective planning for reuse of base property;  and federal, state, and local government assistance to facilitate transition  planning and execution. In a series of reports that have assessed the  progress in implementing closures and realignments in prior BRAC rounds,  we reported that most communities surrounding closed bases have been  faring well in relation to key national economic indicators\u2014unemployment  rate and the average annual real per capita income growth rates. In our  January 2005 report for example, we further reported that while some  communities surrounding closed bases were faring better than others,  most have recovered or are continuing to recover from the impact of  BRAC, with more mixed results recently, allowing for some negative  impact from the economic downturn nationwide in recent years.", "The 2005 round, however, also has the potential to significantly affect a  number of communities surrounding installations, which are expected to  experience considerable growth in the numbers of military, civilian, and  civilian support personnel. These personnel increases are likely to place  additional demands on community services, such as providing adequate  housing and schools, for which the communities may not have adequate  resources to address in the short term. The total gains can be much more  than just those personnel with the consideration of accompanying families.  Table 6 shows that 20 installations are expected to realize gains of over  2,000 military, civilian, and mission support contractor personnel for an  aggregate increase of more than 106,000 personnel.", "As shown in table 6, most of the gaining installations are Army installations  with the gains attributable to a number of actions, including the return of  large numbers of personnel from overseas locations under DOD\u2019s  integrated global presence and basing strategy and the consolidation of  various activities, such as combat-support related activities at Fort Lee,  Virgina. Fort Belvoir, Virginia, has the largest expected growth, due in large  measure to some consolidation of various activities from lease space in the  Washington, D.C. area.", "The challenges facing communities surrounding gaining bases can be many,  including increased housing demand, increased demands for roads and  utilities, and adequate schools. These challenges can be formidable as  communities may be faced with inadequate resources to address concerns  in these areas as follows:   Housing: If history is any indication, while some of the personnel  transferring into a base may live on-base, the majority may not, as the  military services are turning more to housing privatization. Installation  officials at Fort Riley, Kansas, told us about concerns about the nearby  availability of housing (within a 20-mile radius) to support the expected  influx of military and civilian personnel and their families transferring to  the base. For those installations where adequate housing is not available  in the surrounding communities existing housing privatization projects  would need to be revised and expedited to provide for additional units.  Fort Bliss, Texas, officials told us that they expect the need to accelerate  their existing housing privatization efforts, but would require additional  funds to do so. Currently, housing privatization has taken place or is in  the process of taking place at several of these installations and similar  efforts may be needed there as well.", "Schools: Effects on bases with the greatest gain in personnel resulting  from BRAC vary between whether dependents attend schools operated  on base by DOD (Fort Benning, Fort Bragg, and Marine Corps Base  Quantico as shown in table 6) or schools operated by local educational  agencies. We recently reported on challenges likely to be faced by both  DOD operated schools and those operated by local educational agencies  in the post BRAC environment at these and other locations. Recently,  in visiting selected bases affected by the BRAC recommendations,  installation officials told us that while local educational authorities  should be able to absorb additional students into their school systems,  they are more concerned about the potential shortage of teachers.  Another concern is that make-shift trailers or temporary modular  facilities might be used. For example, while Kings Bay, Georgia, officials  told us that the local school system should be able to accomodate the  increase of students, it may need to resort to the use of portable  classrooms. All installations that are expected to gain more than 2,000  personnel have local community-administrated school systems with the  exceptions of Fort Benning, Fort Bragg, and Marine Corps Base  Quantico which have DOD-administrated school systems. If additional  capacity is required at these three locations, additional military  constructions funds would likely be needed.", "Other infrastructure: Installation officials we spoke to also expressed  some concern for the increased demand for various community  services, such as health care, transportation, and utilities to  accommodate personnel increases. Fort Carson, Colorado, officials told  us that with its expected personnel increases, the local community will  need more TRICARE providers to meet the expected demand. In other  cases, such as at Fort Belvoir, Virgina, discussion has ensued regarding  the need for increased mass transit capability, which may involve  requests for millions of dollars in federal grant assistance.", "As previously noted, it is likely that these concerns may increase federal  governmental expenditures that are not included in the BRAC cost and  savings analyses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Candidate Recommendations That Were Deleted or Revised during the Final Weeks of the Selection Process", "paragraphs": ["We also identified several candidate recommendations that were presented  by the military services or joint cross-service groups to the IEC\u2014DOD\u2019s  senior BRAC leadership group\u2014that were substantially revised or deleted  from further consideration during the last few weeks of the BRAC section  process. In aggregate, based on projected savings, these actions reduced  the overall potential for estimated net annual recurring savings by nearly  $500 million and estimated 20-year net present value savings by over $4.8  billion, as shown in table 7.", "Each of the cases highlighted in the table is described in additional detail  below.", "The educational and training group proposed to privatize graduate  education, which enabled the Navy to recommend the closure of the  Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California. The proposed closure  supported DOD\u2019s draft transformational option to privatize graduate- level education. Navy officials, however, stated that they believed  professional military education was more important than ever given the  world climate. During the IEC deliberations, Navy officials expressed  concern about the loss of such a unique graduate military education  facility and the effect on international students who participate in the  school\u2019s programs.

We also reported previously that the university is a more  costly way to educate military physicians. The IEC, subsequently  disapproved the recommendation, citing that education is a core  competency for the department, and therefore it was considered too  risky to rely on the private sector to provide this function.

The IEC decided to downsize the  base and retain the depot, citing the Marine Corps\u2019 concerns.", "While the Navy recommended closure of the Naval Air Station  Brunswick, Maine, the IEC revised this to a realignment. Navy officials  stated that the senior Navy leadership had been reluctant to give up the  Navy\u2019s remaining air station in the Northeast region, but found the  potential savings significant enough to recommend closure. Navy  officials stated that the IEC relied on military judgment to retain access  to an airfield in the Northeast. Nonetheless, all aircraft and associated  personnel, equipment, and support as well as the aviation intermediate  maintenance capability will be relocated to another Navy base. The  Navy is maintaining its cold weather-oriented Survival, Evasion,  Resistance and Escape School, a Navy Reserve Center, and other small  units at the air station.", "While the Air Force had proposed to close Grand Forks Air Force Base,  North Dakota, the IEC revised this to a realignment a week before OSD  released its recommendations. The Air Force reported in its submission  to the BRAC Commission that over 80 percent of the base\u2019s personnel  are expected to be eliminated or realigned under the revised proposal.  The revision to keep the base open was made based on military  judgment to keep a strategic presence in the north central United States,  with a possible unmanned aerial vehicle mission for the base. Even  though Grand Forks Air Force Base was retained for strategic reasons,  Minot Air Force Base is also located in North Dakota and is not affected  by any BRAC rcommendation.", "The closure of Rome Laboratory, New York, was originally part of a  Technical Joint Cross-Service Group recommendation to consolidate  the Defense Research Laboratories. No concerns were originally raised  about the closure, and it was approved by the IEC. However, the IEC  subsequently decided to realign rather than close the laboratory to  address strategic presence and cost concerns.

DOD\u2019s recommendations would provide net reductions in space and plant  replacement value, which would reduce infrastructure costs once up-front  investment costs have been recovered but the extent some projected space  reductions will be realized is unclear. Other DOD savings estimates are  based on what might be broadly termed business process reengineering  efforts and other actions, where savings appear likely, but the magnitude of  savings has not been validated and much will depend on how the  recommended actions are implemented. Nevertheless, the savings could  prove difficult to track over time. As a result, DOD\u2019s projections may create  a false sense of the magnitude of the savings, with fewer resources  available for force modernization and other needs than might be  anticipated, and there may be the potential for premature budget  reductions. Given problems in tracking savings from previous BRAC  rounds, and the large volume of BRAC actions this round that are more  oriented to realignments and business process reengineering than closures,  we believe it is of paramount importance that DOD put in place a process  to track and periodically update its savings estimates.", "Despite a fundamentally sound overall process, we identified numerous  issues regarding DOD\u2019s list of recommendations that may warrant further  attention by the BRAC Commission, as noted in this report and appendixes  III through XII.

We sought to assure ourselves that DOD followed an  objective and consistently applied process in which we could observe  logical decision making leading to defensible and well-documented  proposed closure and realignment recommendations. During this period,  we abided by an agreement with DOD to not disclose details of the process  due to the sensitivity of the information. Following the release of the  recommendations, we continued our analyses of the process and  recommendations. With the unprecedented large number of  recommendations and the finalization of many of these occurring in the  final weeks of the process, along with the limited time available for us to  report our results following DOD\u2019s May 13, 2005, release of the  recommendations, we were not able to review all recommendations in  detail. We focused more of our attention on cross-cutting issues than on  implementation issues of individual recommendations, but did review  individual recommendations as time permitted. Further, because of time  constraints, we had only limited opportunities to gain further insight into  some of the recommendations from officials at bases affected by the  recommendations.", "We performed our work primarily at the Office of the Secretary of Defense  (OSD), the military services\u2019 base closure offices, and the offices of seven  joint cross-service groups that were established by OSD to develop cross- service recommendations. While we did not attend deliberative meetings,  we had access to minutes of meetings and relevant documentation and met  periodically with key staff and senior leadership to gain an understanding  of each phase of the process and to provide them with the opportunity to  address our concerns as the process was unfolding. We also visited  selected bases following the public disclosure of the Secretary\u2019s  recommendations to gain further insights into potential issues regarding  specific recommendations. Those bases included the Anniston Army  Depot, Alabama; Fort Bliss, Texas; Fort Carson, Colorado; Fort Sam  Houston, Texas; Fort Lewis, Washington; Fort Riley, Kansas; Lackland Air  Force Base, Texas; McChord Air Force Base, Washington; Marine Corps Air  Station Cherry Point, North Carolina; Naval Shipyard Portsmouth, Maine;  Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, Georgia; Naval Submarine Base New  London, Connecticut; and Red River Army Depot, Texas. We also met with  officials of the U.S. Coast Guard to discuss the impact of BRAC actions on  their operations since they are tenants on several bases recommended for  closure or realignment. We relied on DOD\u2019s Office of the Inspector General,  Army Audit Agency, Naval Audit Service, and Air Force Audit Agency to  validate the data used by the military services and joint cross-service  groups in their decision-making processes. We met with staff of these audit  agencies periodically to discuss the results of their work as well as to  observe their data validation efforts at selected locations across the  country. The DOD Inspector General and service audit agencies issued  reports that generally concluded that the extensive amount of data used as  the basis for BRAC decisions was sufficiently valid and accurate for the  purposes intended. In addition, with limited exceptions, these reports did  not identify any material issues that would impede a BRAC  recommendation. Where questions existed, we made further assessments  and were able to satisfy ourselves that issues raised would have limited, if  any, impact on the department\u2019s recommendations. Based on the audit  agencies\u2019 extensive validation efforts and our observation of their work, we  believe the data are sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "To determine the extent to which DOD achieved its BRAC goals, we  interviewed key officials and collected and analyzed relevant  documentation generated by OSD, the military departments, and the joint  cross-service groups. We reviewed the Secretary of Defense\u2019s November  2002 memorandum that initiated the 2005 BRAC process and highlighted  DOD\u2019s goals and obtained DOD officials\u2019 views on the degree to which the  goals were accomplished. With respect to DOD\u2019s goal of reducing excess  capacity, we initially reviewed the capacity analysis reports of the services  and joint cross-service groups to gain insight into the relative amounts of  excess capacity within the department. We subsequently reviewed major  recommendations to determine the extent to which these recommended  actions would reduce infrastructure and excess capacity. In this regard, we  also assessed the changes in the overall defense infrastructure\u2019s plant  replacement value\u2014a measure used by the department to determine the  cost to replace an existing facility with a facility of the same size at the  same location, using today\u2019s standards\u2014by reviewing supporting  documentation for the recommendations. We also analyzed the aggregated  estimated costs and savings associated with reducing DOD\u2019s unnecessary  infrastructure, as depicted in the Cost of Base Realignment Actions  (COBRA) analyses for the 222 recommendations proposed by the  department, and compared these estimates with similar data from the prior  BRAC rounds to determine similarities and differences in sources of costs  and savings and thereby identify potential areas for further review. With  respect to DOD\u2019s costs and savings estimates, we examined selected  supporting documentation to determine the basis for the estimates and  identified key elements, such as base operating support, personnel  compensation, or recapitalization of facilities, those estimates comprised.", "We also performed a qualitative analysis of DOD\u2019s performance in  addressing its other BRAC goals\u2014transforming the infrastructure and  fostering jointness\u2014by examining DOD\u2019s proposed recommendations and  seeking views from key officials on the relative success of achieving these  initiatives. We also compared the justification narratives supporting  individual recommendations for closures and realignments against draft  transformation options developed by the department, although not  formally adopted, that were nonetheless used by the individual military  services and joint cross-service groups. Our efforts in addressing this and  other objectives were facilitated by remote access to selected automated  databases and tracking systems, which gave us near real-time access to  relevant briefings and other documents, permitting us to broadly track the  evolution of the BRAC process and identify issues for further  consideration.", "To address whether DOD\u2019s selection process for developing  recommendations was logical and reasoned, we focused on key aspects of  the BRAC process, including capacity and military value analyses. In doing  so, we sought to determine whether DOD\u2019s selection process was objective  and in compliance with key considerations of BRAC legislation. Our  monitoring of the process from the start permitted us to assess the extent  to which the process followed was logical, sequential, reasoned, and well  documented. Our monitoring permitted us to determine to what extent a  logical and sequential flow existed among all phases of DOD\u2019s selection  process from the point at which data were collected and analyzed through  the compilation of the final recommendations. We reviewed the services\u2019  determinations of which installations to consider in the BRAC process and  analyzed the services\u2019 and joint cross-service groups\u2019 excess capacity  analyses and military value evaluation plans and analyses to determine if  they were developed in a reasoned fashion and supported by appropriate  documentation. In reviewing military value analyses, we reviewed specific  attributes established by the services and joint cross-service groups and  examined the linkage between the groups\u2019 methodologies and the military  value selection criteria (i.e., criteria 1 through 4) to determine if these  mandated selection criteria were addressed. Regarding the development of  recommendations, our focus was to determine whether the  recommendations were developed in a logical and reasoned manner. We  reviewed, among other things, the extent to which the services and joint  cross-service groups (1) considered various alternative proposals for  closure or realignment, (2) assessed proposed recommendations using  military value as the predominant decision-making factor, and  (3) considered the remaining four selection criteria as mandated by law.", "To address issues regarding DOD\u2019s recommendations, we focused more of  our attention on cross-cutting issues than on implementation issues of  individual recommendations, but did review individual recommendations  as time permitted. We reviewed recommendation justification packages  that included particulars on the benefits of implementing the  recommendations from an operational perspective, the estimated costs and  savings associated with implementing the recommendations, and their  degree of conformity to the mandated selection criteria. We discussed  perceived benefits with key officials and reviewed appropriate supporting  documentation. We also examined financial aspects of the recommended  actions, including expected up-front investment costs to implement the  actions, length of payback periods, net present value savings or costs over  a 20-year period, and annual recurring savings or costs. In examining the  expected costs and savings as generated by DOD\u2019s COBRA model, we  further examined assumptions and specific calculations regarding specific  recommendations to determine the relative reasonableness of the  estimates, given the data available to the services and the joint cross- service groups using the COBRA model. Further, we examined and  discussed with DOD officials the economic and community impact for  selected closure and realignment actions, including both adverse impacts  associated with closing bases as well as challenges facing bases and  surrounding communities that stand to receive large influxes of military  personnel, civilian personnel, or both. Additionally, we reviewed potential  recommendations that were approved by either the services or joint cross- service groups but ultimately rejected by senior leadership, the  Infrastructure Executive Council, during the last few weeks of the BRAC  process. We examined the merits of these proposals as presented by the  services or joint cross-service groups in terms of addressing DOD\u2019s BRAC  goals. We further reviewed the rationale offered by senior leadership in its  decisions to reject or substantially revise the offered proposals. Because of  time limitations and complexities introduced by DOD in weaving together  the unprecedented 837 closures and realignment actions across the country  into 222 recommendations, we focused more on evaluating major issues  affecting more than one recommendation than on implementation issues of  individual recommendations. However, as time permitted, we did visit  several selected installations, as noted above, to better gauge the  operational and economic impact of the proposed recommendations.  Installations visited were selected on a judgment basis because of our  desire to have additional information on issues of concern, such as those  related to costs and savings, potential operational implications, and  potential economic impact. They included a number of bases with  industrial-type activities because of concerns in prior rounds about how  well the BRAC process and the COBRA model deal with such issues and  other aspects of those facilities that permitted us to address other issues of  concern.", "We conducted our work from October 2003, as DOD\u2019s process was  beginning, through June 2005, shortly after the Secretary of Defense  announced his proposed base closures and realignments, in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Glossary of BRAC-Related Terms", "paragraphs": ["The following terms were used by DOD during the 2005 BRAC process.", "Annual recurring savings: Savings that are expected to occur  annually after the costs of implementing a BRAC action have been offset  by savings.", "Candidate recommendation: A scenario that a joint cross-service  group or military department has formally analyzed against all eight  selection criteria and which it recommends to the Infrastructure  Steering Group and Infrastructure Executive Council respectively for  approval by the Secretary of Defense.

The Army\u2019s surge analysis  also reinforced the importance of preserving assets such as maneuver land  that would be difficult to reconstitute if eliminated.

In this manner, the Army had the ability to  determine which installations could handle additional missions and units  and what infrastructure improvements and additional military construction  might be required to support those units.", "The Army did not perform a similar capacity assessment of the reserve  components\u2019 facilities because of the nature of their facilities and differing  objectives, but did collect and assess data related to, for example, the  condition and location of facilities, as well as expected costs such as  construction and force protection upgrades that may be necessary to  provide for viable reserve consolidation opportunities.

Attributes with less flexibility for change, such as the  availability of maneuver land or direct fire ranges, were among those most  highly valued in developing a scoring plan for evaluating the military value  for each of the Army\u2019s installations. According to Army officials, this  reflected their view of the criticality of possessing adequate acreage to  conduct unit training, particularly in view of the expectation for an  increase in the number of brigades and return of various forces from  overseas locations. The Army\u2019s military value attributes also reflected  consideration of its role in supporting the global war on terrorism,  homeland defense, and transformation. Through a process of weighting  each of the Army\u2019s attributes, the Army derived relative weights for the four  legislatively-mandated military value selection criteria. As shown in  table 9, three of the four criteria had relatively higher weights than the  remaining criterion dealing with cost and manpower implications.  Imbedded within these criteria was a key focus on the need for availability  of existing land and facilities for expansion purposes to address the needs  as cited in those specific criteria. In this regard, the Army placed high value  on these criteria as a hedge against uncertain future requirements and to  ensure that they did not dispose of assets such as large tracts of land,  which would be difficult to reacquire.", "In performing its military value assessment, the Army assessed each active  duty installation and ranked each of them across the four military value  selection criteria to more fully evaluate the potential for realignment and  closure actions. This contrasted with the approach the Army used in the  1995 BRAC round when it developed a military value ranking for individual  installations under one of 13 mission categories, which made it more  difficult to assess an installation for use in a different mission area. For this  round, the Army assessed the military value of each of its installations  based on a common framework that linked attributes, metrics, and data  call questions to military value as shown in figure 9.", "During its assessment, the Army stressed multi-function capabilities for  installations. To account for the unique capabilities that some Army single- function installations provided, the Army applied military judgment to  modify the initial ranking of its installations to better identify installations  that the Army believed were best suited to meet its current and future  capabilities. For example, the Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii,  which initially ranked low in military value, is DOD\u2019s only medical center of  significant size in the Pacific and therefore was retained for strategic  reasons. Ultimately, the Army moved nine installations higher in the list  based on their unique capabilities. Subsequently, those installations with a  lower military value ranking became more vulnerable to closure or  realignment actions.", "With respect to its reserve components, the Army did not perform a  military value rank-ordering of these various installations across the  country, but instead assessed the relative military value that could be  obtained by consolidating various facilities into a joint facility in specific  geographical locales to support, among other things, the reserve  components\u2019 training, recruiting, and retention efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army Audit Agency\u2019s Role in the Process", "paragraphs": ["Throughout the BRAC process, the Army Audit Agency advised the Army  on the development and implementation of its internal control procedures;  performed audits of the Army\u2019s conduct of the process, including the  validation of data and various models used to assist in decision making.

The Army used input from various DOD- generated models in assessing its scenarios against these criteria, which,  while important and mandated by the BRAC legislation, played less of a  role than that of military value. However, the Army considered these  criteria in order to ensure that there were no insurmountable challenges  that would derail the implementation of any particular scenario.

For  example, the Army determined its final stationing of modular brigades  based in part on its assessment of the environmental impact these brigades  would have on the receiving installations.", "The Army also integrated into the overall process those scenarios that had  been generated for the reserve components in the parallel process referred  to previously.

Most of the expected savings from these recommendations are due  to reductions in personnel costs and overhead (e.g., base operations  support).

The largest of these three latter recommendations involves the  rebasing of Army forces to the United States from overseas locations. The  Army projected that this realignment alone has a one-time cost of about $4  billion and annual recurring costs of almost $300 million and will never  produce savings. Army officials note that a contributory factor to these  high costs is the fact that the Army could not claim the estimated savings  that would accrue from the expected closure of the overseas installations  and the departure of Army forces from those locations. The Army estimates  that had these estimated savings been accounted for in BRAC, the  recommended actions would have produced substantial net savings rather  than the costs as indicated.

As we reported in  June 2005, several of the Army\u2019s training ranges already face challenges  resulting from inadequate maintenance and modernization and may also  require substantial investment for modernization to support the training  requirements of the new brigades.

However, Army  officials told us that should the Army decide to create an additional five  modular brigades or bring additional forces back from overseas, it may  become necessary to station these units at installations such as the Yuma  Proving Ground, which has large tracts of land, because existing Army  installations might not be able to support these additional units.

For example, in assessing the  impact of the return of forces from overseas, the Army\u2019s review of  community infrastructure for Fort Bliss and Fort Riley indicated the  importance of working with these communities to assess and implement  housing and schooling requirements.

Most of these recommendations, as  detailed in the Army\u2019s 2005 BRAC report, are contingent upon certain  actions that have either yet to take place or be decided. For example, the  Army expects to build 125 Armed Forces Reserve Centers, which are  currently expected to be able to accommodate National Guard units as well  as Army Reserve units and some reserve units from the other military  services. However, the decision to relocate these National Guard units lies  with state authorities.

While the the Army only produced six recommendations  for the realignment of its active component installations, most of these  recommendations have several components to them. For example, one  Army recommendation involves the realignment of the Armor Center and  School from Fort Knox, Kentucky, to Fort Benning, Georgia; the activation  of a new modular brigade at Fort Knox; the relocation of various combat  service support and other units from Europe and Korea to the United  States; and the relocation of a reserve training center from Fort McCoy,  Wisconsin, to Fort Knox. Similarly, the Army packaged all of its proposed  reserve components\u2019 realignments and closures within a state into a single  recommendation for that state. As a result, there may be components  within a recommendation that have relatively high costs or long pay-back  periods (or never produce savings) even though the recommendation taken  as a whole appears to have relatively higher savings or a shorter payback  period. The Commission may therefore wish to request and examine  information on the costs and savings associated with these individual  actions. The following examples highlight these potential issues:  The Army\u2019s maneuver training recommendation would realign Fort  Knox by incorporating several elements of scenarios the Army and the  Education and Training Joint Cross-Service Group developed over time.

The Army\u2019s approved recommendation combined most of the elements  of these two scenarios but generated 20-year savings of about  $950 million, or about $500 million less than one might have expected.  The difference may be largely attributed to the inclusion of the new  modular brigade in the Army\u2019s final recommendation.", "The Army\u2019s reserve components\u2019 transformation recommendation in  Arizona is expected to have a payback period of 5 years and generate a  net savings of almost $52 million over a 20-year period.

As previously noted, the Navy\u2019s BRAC  scenario analysis focused on East Coast submarine bases because attack  submarines are single-sited on the West Coast. The Navy considered three  alternatives: (1) moving all submarines at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia,  to New London, Connecticut; (2) moving all submarines at Submarine Base  New London and the Submarine School New London to Naval Station  Norfolk; and (3) moving submarines at Submarine Base New London to  both Naval Station Norfolk and Submarine Base Kings Bay, Georgia, and  moving the submarine school to Kings Bay or Naval Station Newport,  Rhode Island. The Navy analysis showed that only the option to relocate  submarines from New London to Norfolk and Kings Bay achieved a  reduction in capacity and savings resulting from a base closure.

However, a separate issue of concern relates to the  proposed move of the Navy\u2019s submarine school from New London to Kings  Bay. In our discussions with officials at New London, we found while the  Navy\u2019s BRAC cost and savings analysis includes one-time costs to move the  specialized equipment associated with the submarine school, the Navy  analysis does not appear to have included an assessment of the time it  would take to pack, move, and unpack the equipment, and the potential  impact on the training pipeline and the certification of crews for  submarines.

Initially, based on capacity data and the 20- year force structure plan submitted in March 2004, the Industrial Joint  Cross-Service Group determined that there was sufficient excess capacity  in the aggregate across the four shipyards to close either Pearl Harbor or  Portsmouth. However, the group determined that there was insufficient  excess capacity in certain commodities in the remaining three shipyards  to accept all the workload from the closing shipyard. As such, the group  initially determined that no shipyard should be closed.

A Naval Sea  Systems Command analysis of dry dock availability indicates that the three  remaining Navy shipyards could handle the projected ship repair and  overhauls in the future. However, the analysis indicates that within the next  three years there would not be much, if any, room for unanticipated ship  repairs. According to Navy officials, any unanticipated requirements would  be addressed by a combination of delaying and re-prioritizing scheduled  overhaul work, and authorizing additional overtime, which they noted is no  different than how they manage these requirements in the current  operating environment.", "In selecting Portsmouth over Pearl Harbor for closure, the Navy noted that  Pearl Harbor is in a fleet concentration area in the Pacific theater and is the  homeport for many ships, while Portsmouth is not in a fleet concentration  area or a homeport for any ships. In addition, closing Pearl Harbor would  require the ships that are homeported there to transit back to the east  coast, in some cases, for maintenance, which the Navy would essentially  view as a deployment and, for quality of life reasons, would want to avoid if  possible. Another strategic objective was to maintain dry docks for aircraft  carriers on both coasts and in the central Pacific.

First, they  objected to the industrial group and the Navy disallowing about  $281 million in costs ($205 million one-time and $76 million recurring) that  they believed would be incurred if the shipyard were to close. About  $52 million of the recurring costs are associated with sustainment of  facilities and power plant from fiscal year 2008, when the base is projected  to close, until 2011. While some of these costs are likely valid, overall they  appear high in relation to the Navy\u2019s projected savings of about $120 million  over the same period from reduced base operating support and  sustainment of facilities. The majority of the one-time costs are associated  with closure of the buildings, historical preservation of buildings, and  write-off of undepreciated assets of the working capital fund. While it is  questionable whether all of these costs should be included, our analysis  shows that if they are all included, the projected 20-year savings would  decrease by $192 million, or 15 percent.", "Portsmouth employees were also concerned that the cost and savings  analysis did not adequately capture the widely recognized efficiencies of  their shipyard, which, if adopted, could translate into additional costs that  the Navy would incur by shifting its workload to the remaining three Navy  shipyards. The employees estimated that they perform submarine overhaul  and depot maintenance work at about $54 million per year less than the  average of the other three shipyards, an efficiency which was not included  in the Navy\u2019s analysis. Department of Navy officials recognized that the  Portsmouth Naval shipyard is presently more efficient than the Puget  Sound and Pearl Harbor shipyards, but noted that it is very difficult to  quantify the impact of this efficiency. Navy officials noted that the scope of  work performed is not always the same, depending on the condition of  each submarine, and wages, especially in Pearl Harbor, are higher than in  Portsmouth. Navy officials told us they were reviewing the efficiency  analysis developed by the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard; however, their  analysis was not completed in time to be included in this report.

Also the  Air Force recognizes that in moving Air National Guard and Air Reserve  units, part-time military (commonly referred to as drill) personnel will also  be affected since they will not be moved. A significant portion of the  personnel associated with these units must be replaced at the gaining  installation and will require training. At Air National Guard installations  with flying units, over 30 percent have been recommended for realignment  or retirement; many of the personnel positions associated with the units do  not have missions.

The group  initially used generic savings factors to estimate the number of personnel  positions that could be eliminated when organizations were co-located or  consolidated.

The group found that personnel  reductions from 14 percent to 30 percent resulted from consolidation of  organizations and 7 percent to 15 percent when they were co-located.

According to a DOD  official, the department put together a task force after the June 1996  Khobar Tower bombing incident in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, of mostly  engineers to develop minimum force protection standards for all DOD- occupied locations. The official also stated that application of the  standards in BRAC was not the result of a threat or vulnerability  assessment of the affected facilities. The Pentagon Force Protection  Agency will shortly begin a 10-month antiterrorism and force protection  vulnerability assessment of about 60 DOD-occupied leased buildings in the  National Capital Region.

For example, the Army would be the executive agent for Fort  Lewis, Washington, and McChord Air Force Base, Washington, combined as  Joint Base Lewis-McChord. However, as evident from our recent visit to  both installations and discussions with base officials, concerns over  obstacles such as seeking efficiencies at the expense of the mission, could  jeopardize a smooth and successful implementation of the  recommendation. Further, Air Force officials stated that most military  personnel at McChord are mission critical and deployable, increasing the  difficulty to identify possible Air Force military personnel reductions.

Table 28  shows the various weights assigned to each of the four military value  criteria by the subgroups for their functions.", "The group\u2019s military value analysis also included the development of  attributes, metrics, and data call questions for each of the nine functional  areas represented in the categories in the chart above which were linked  back to the four military criteria. Figure 15 provides examples of these  attributes, metrics, and data questions and shows how each of these was  linked back to the criteria.", "Because of the disparate nature of the industrial areas analyzed by the  industrial group, the subgroups also differed in the way they assigned  military value scores to their respective activities. For instance, the  maintenance subgroup determined military value by commodity only and  did not develop an overall military value score for activities in the depot  and intermediate maintenance functions. Because military value scores  were only determined for activities by commodity, activities were only  ranked within their respective commodities. For example, Rock Island  Arsenal, Illinois, received a military value score for its combat vehicle  maintenance workload and was ranked accordingly against all the other  depot level activities that perform combat vehicle maintenance. In  addition, because most activities involve multiple commodities, such as  major maintenance functions like aircraft engines, electronics, etc., many  of the activities received multiple military value scores. In the case of Rock  Island Arsenal, it not only received a military value score for its combat  vehicle maintenance work but also for its tactical vehicle maintenance  work and its other equipment maintenance work. These military value  scores were then used in an optimization model to determine the best  locations to consolidate various like commodities among the three  services. In all cases, the subgroup examined redistributing the workload  to activities with a higher military value score for that commodity.  According to the maintenance subgroup, determining military value by  commodity allowed for more opportunities to create interservicing and  consolidations of workload among the services. The maintenance  subgroup\u2019s process was focused on military value and available capacity  without regard to service. The final recommendations were tempered by  financial and operational considerations. However, as we discuss later, our  analysis shows that while some interservicing may be achieved, most of the  group\u2019s recommendations remained relatively service-centric. The ship  overhaul and repair and munitions and armaments subgroups, on the other  hand, developed overall military value scores for activities within their  respective functions and ranked their activities within those functions  accordingly. For example, all shipyards were ranked together under the  depot maintenance function, and all industrial activities that perform  munitions production were ranked together under the munitions  production function."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Inspector General\u2019s and Service Audit Agencies\u2019 Role in the Process", "paragraphs": ["The DOD Inspector General and the service audit agencies played  important roles in ensuring that the data used in the industrial group\u2019s data  analyses were certified and properly supported.

The  DOD Inspector General validated the data.", "The maintenance and munitions and armaments subgroups used an  optimization model to help facilitate scenario development, while the ship  overhaul and repair subgroup, which had similar data problems, also relied  on incomplete data as well as military judgment to help formulate  scenarios for consideration. This subgroup did not rely on the optimization  model as extensively as the other subgroups due to the relatively small  number of activities analyzed. Collectively, the subgroups initially  developed 120 proposals and scenarios and with the maturation of the data,  completion of Cost of Base Realignment Actions (COBRA) analyses, and  elimination of alternative scenarios, the industrial group settled on 34  recommendations that were forwarded to the ISG with all but 3 being  ultimately approved by the IEC.", "Despite having incomplete data, the maintenance subgroup began its  scenario development by generating several ideas as potential scenarios. In  testing the feasibility of these ideas, the maintenance subgroup found it  useful to use an optimization model, because the subgroup was dealing  with a universe of 57 commodities across 28 depot level activities and 11  commodities across over 200 intermediate level activities which made it  extremely difficult to determine where workload could be consolidated or  redistributed. For realignment considerations, officials told us the  preferred method was to consolidate workload at the highest military value  sites that remained open in the optimization results, but military judgment  also played a role in finalizing the sites. In some instances, military  judgment was used to override the results of the optimization model. For  example, the subgroup chose not to realign the rotary aircraft workload  from the Naval Air Depot at Cherry Point, North Carolina, to the Corpus  Christi Army Depot, Texas, even though it was proposed for realignment  under the optimization model because of concerns about establishing a  single point of failure or vulnerability for DOD\u2019s rotary aircraft workload.", "One issue that the maintenance subgroup dealt with during its scenario  development was that the current DOD capacity baseline for its  maintenance work was based on a single shift 40 hours per week workload.  According to the subgroup, when using the optimization model, it found  that existing capacity as measured on this basis would constrain its ability  to identify options for achieving more economical operations. Further,  recognizing that such a baseline was inconsistent with industry practice,  the subgroup modified the capacity baseline to one and a half shifts with a  60 hours weekly workload, thus increasing available capacity at its  industrial activities and the potential for consolidating work at fewer  locations. As we reported after the 1995 BRAC round, a capacity baseline of  a single shift 40 hours per week workload is a conservative projection of  capacity because the private sector frequently uses a capacity baseline of  two or two and a half shifts. In addition, based on more current  information of private sector capacity utilization, we still believe that a  single shift is a conservative projection of capacity, since many firms today  work multiple shifts.", "Like the maintenance subgroup, the munitions and armaments subgroup  also used the optimization model to test the feasibility of its ideas and to  facilitate its scenario development and analysis. Its emphasis was on  increasing multi-functional activities, (i.e., those activities that have the  capability to do more than one munitions and armaments function). During  scenario development, the subgroup\u2019s preference was to eliminate excess  capacity through closure versus realignment.", "The ship overhaul and repair subgroup, on the other hand, used mostly  capacity and military value data in combination with military judgment in  developing and analyzing its scenarios. Due to the small number of  activities analyzed\u201422 depot and intermediate level ship overhaul and  repair activities\u2014the subgroup did not have to rely on the optimization  model to determine where workload could be potentially consolidated or  redistributed. While it did use the model primarily to check the feasibility  and rationalization of scenarios, military judgment was required because  most of the subgroup\u2019s scenarios were influenced by Navy force structure  changes and planned changes in the homeports of ships. According to  industrial group officials, expected out-year changes in Navy force  structure\u2014specifically expected reductions in the number of ships\u2014 allowed them to recommend the closure of a shipyard. Expected changes  in the homeports of ships also influenced the subgroup\u2019s intermediate level  scenarios because the Navy\u2019s intermediate level maintenance is generally  performed where ships are homeported."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations Approved by DOD", "paragraphs": ["The industrial group\u2019s 17 recommendations are estimated to produce an  estimated $7.6 billion in 20-year net present value savings.

The recommendation regarding the establishment of  Navy fleet readiness centers is by far the largest in terms of overall savings,  accounting for about $341 million, or about 56 percent, of the total  estimated net annual recurring savings. As discussed later, only one  recommendation\u2014the realignment of the Watervliet Arsenal, New York,  has a lengthy payback period exceeding 10 years.", "Of the industrial joint cross-service group\u2019s 17 recommendations, 8 are  closures and 9 are realignments. However, contained within these  recommendations are 40 smaller, individual realignment actions and  several recommendations involve installations with less than 300 personnel  that could be but were not required to be proposed under BRAC. The  following summarizes some of our overall observations about the group\u2019s  recommendations.", "Interservicing: Despite setting up its military value scoring for  maintenance by commodity to foster opportunities for interservicing,  the industrial group actually developed few recommendations that  proposed greater interservicing. Of the 9 realignment recommendations,  we consider only three to involve interservicing\u2014(1) realigning the Air  Force\u2019s depot maintenance workload at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas,  to Tobyhanna Army Depot, Pennsylvania, (2) realigning the Navy\u2019s depot  maintenance at Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach, California to several  other service depots, and (3) realigning Lima Army Tank Plant, Ohio, to  support, in part, the future manufacturing of the Marine Corps  expeditionary force vehicle. DOD has stated recently that there is some  interservicing of ground maintenance work already being performed at  the major depots. However, while there is significant interservicing of  electronics work at Tobyhanna Army Depot, Pennsylvania and of rotary  work at Corpus Christi Army Depot, Texas, our analysis shows that  interservicing at the major ground vehicle maintenance depots is very  limited. For example, in fiscal year 2003, only 3 percent of Anniston  Army Depot\u2019s total workload was for the Marine Corps and only 3  percent of Marine Corps Logistics Base Barstow\u2019s and Marine Corps  Logistics Base Albany\u2019s workloads was for the Army. Moreover, out of  17 major maintenance depots across the services, the group only  proposed the closure of three\u2014Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Maine, Red  River Army Depot, Texas and Marine Corps Logistics Base Barstow,  California\u2014with Barstow ultimately becoming a realignment. No  recommendations were developed regarding the Air Force\u2019s three  relatively large air logistics centers and only Navy-centric  recommendations were developed regarding the Navy\u2019s three naval air  depots, despite that the industrial group had registered scenarios  consolidating similar types of work from a naval air depot into air  logistics centers. According to group officials, they decided not to  propose these as recommendations because of the Navy\u2019s desire to  combine its aircraft depot and intermediate work into fleet readiness  centers and because this recommendation offered greater financial  benefits. As a result, this essentially removed the naval air depots from  the BRAC analysis in considering opportunities for more interservicing.  While not considered an industrial group recommendation or otherwise  addressed in this appendix, the industrial group\u2019s work also helped the  Navy develop a recommendation realigning some of the workload at  Marine Corps Logistics Base Barstow to Army depots. This  recommendation is discussed in appendix IV.", "Closures: Regarding eight closures, four involve underutilized Army  ammunition facilities, and three are chemical demilitarization facilities  where the primary mission is slated to disappear in the coming years.", "Savings: Essentially all of the projected savings from the group\u2019s  recommendations are based on reducing overhead and eliminating  civilian and military personnel as installations are closed and functions  are realigned between installations. For example, 63 percent of the  group\u2019s total projected net annual recurring savings is from reductions  in overhead and 37 percent is from personnel eliminations with civilians  making up 21 percent of total net annual recurring savings and military  personnel 16 percent.", "Taken individually, the recommendation that the industrial group expects  will generate the greatest amount of savings is the establishment of the  Navy\u2019s fleet readiness centers, which is estimated to produce net annual  recurring savings of $341 million or 56 percent of the group\u2019s total net  annual recurring savings and an estimated 20-year net present value  savings of $4.7 billion or 62 percent of the group\u2019s estimated total net  present value savings. This realignment recommendation differs from the  other realignments in that it proposes a significant business process  reengineering effort to integrate the Navy\u2019s non-deployable, intermediate  and depot level aircraft maintenance rather than a consolidation or  realignment of workload. While the changes proposed would appear to  have the potential for significant savings, as explained below, some  uncertainty exists about the full magnitude of the savings estimate for this  recommendation because most of the group\u2019s projected savings are based  on efficiency gains that have yet to be validated. For example, based on our  analysis, over 63 percent of the estimated net annual recurring savings for  this recommendation are miscellaneous recurring savings projected to  accrue from overhead efficiencies, such as reduced repair time and  charges, while 12 percent of the annual recurring savings is produced from  reductions in military personnel and 24 percent of the savings is derived  from reductions in civilian personnel. These efficiencies are expected to be  gained from integrating intermediate and depot levels of maintenance and  not having to ship as many items to faraway depots for repair.

The fleet readiness center construct focuses on the  philosophy that some depot level maintenance actions are best  accomplished at or near the operational fleet. Although the data suggests  the potential for savings, we believe there is some uncertainty regarding  the magnitude of the industrial group\u2019s expected savings for these  readiness centers because its estimates are based on assumptions that have  undergone limited testing, and full savings realization depends upon the  transformation of the Navy\u2019s supply system. In determining the amount of  savings resulting from the establishment of the fleet readiness centers, the  industrial group and the Navy made a series of assumptions that focused on  combining depot and intermediate maintenance in a way that would reduce  the time an item is being repaired at the intermediate level, which in turn,  would simultaneously reduce the number of items needed to be kept in  inventory and the number of items sent to a depot for repair. These  assumptions, which were the major determinant of realignment savings,  were based on historical data and pilot projects and have not been  independently reviewed or verified by the Naval Audit Service, DOD  Inspector General, or us. Moreover, how well these actions, if approved,  are implemented will be key to determining the amount of savings realized.", "According to the group, two types of savings account for the majority of the  projected savings from the fleet readiness center recommendation. First,  one-time savings are projected to accrue from reductions in inventory  maintained at several Navy shore locations because item repair cycle time  for components is reduced with more depot level maintenance being  performed at or near the fleet, generally at an intermediate facility.  According to group officials, this reduction is accomplished by stationing  several depot level repair personnel at an intermediate facility to assist in  repairing an item on site rather that spending time re-packing and shipping  the item to a depot for repair. By reducing the turnaround time for an  item\u2014that is, time spent in transit to and from a depot level repair facility,  group officials estimate that the average time an item is in the repair  pipeline will decrease from 28 hours to 9 hours, with nearly all that time  spent on the actual repair. The industrial group maintains this reduction in  turnaround time will allow for savings since fewer items will need to be  kept in the shore based aviation consolidated inventory because items will be getting repaired quicker and returned to the inventory faster.  The second type of savings is recurring overhead savings that are projected  to accrue from fewer items being sent to depots for repair. According to  group officials, establishing fleet readiness centers will result in fewer  items being sent to a depot to be repaired, thus reducing per item  maintenance costs. These savings are captured in the COBRA model under  overhead as miscellaneous recurring savings. As explained by group  officials, when an item is sent to a depot, two charges are applied to the  cost to repair the item\u2014a component unit price and a cost recovery rate.  So, if fewer items are sent to a depot, then fewer repair charges are  incurred and less overhead costs are incurred.", "However, according to an industrial group official, since the depots will  have fewer items to repair, they will have fewer opportunities to generate  revenue to support their working capital fund operations. This situation, in  turn, could create an incentive for the depot to increase its cost recovery  rate for items it does repair to make up for reduced revenues. If this were  to occur, then the projected savings would not materialize because most of  the fleet readiness center savings are based on a reduction in the number of  items sent to depots and are contingent on the supply system not  drastically raising the cost recovery rate. According to industrial group  officials, it will be important to overall transformation efforts that DOD  follow through on eliminating management structures and duplicate layers  of inventory in the supply system. Also, according to these officials, some  of this supply-side transformation is already underway at the retail level in  the form of a partnership between fleet industrial supply centers and the  naval air depots where material management for the depots was handed  over to the supply centers to standardize supply chain processes, improve  material availability, and reduce the material excesses that have been a  difficult problem for the naval air depots. In addition, group officials stated  that the supply and storage joint cross-service group\u2019s recommendation to  realign supply, storage, and distribution management should also further  this transformation by eliminating unnecessary redundancies and  duplication and by streamlining supply and storage processes, which will  reduce costs and help prevent a large increase in the cost recovery rate.", "In addition, we believe there is some potential risk in properly accounting  for depot level work to meet legislatively mandated reporting requirements  on the percentage of depot workload performed in government and  contractor facilities, absent efforts to ensure adequate differentiation of  work completed for intermediate and depot level maintenance. We  previously reported on similar difficulties in 2001 involving a consolidation  of intermediate and depot level work at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard,  Hawaii. We noted that, prior to consolidation, the Navy\u2019s determination of  depot and intermediate maintenance work was based on which facility  performed it\u2014the former Pearl Harbor shipyard performed depot work,  and the former intermediate maintenance facility performed intermediate  work. However, because Pacific Fleet and Pearl Harbor officials asserted  that all work was considered and classified the same at the consolidated  facility, the management and financial systems did not differentiate  between depot and intermediate categories of work. As a result, the lines  between what was considered intermediate and depot maintenance  became blurred, making it harder to report what was intermediate and  depot maintenance. The industrial group maintains that during the first few  years of implementing the fleet readiness center recommendation, the  Navy will continue to operate depot maintenance within the working  capital fund (setting up a separate holding account) and perform  intermediate maintenance with mission funding. During this period, depot  maintenance will be reported as depot maintenance and intermediate  maintenance will be reported as intermediate maintenance.

We previously reported that, while this initiative has offset  some of the Army\u2019s maintenance costs, maintaining ammunition plants in  an inactive status still represents a significant cost to the federal  government. Through this initiative, the Army contracts with an operating  contractor that conducts maintenance, repair, restoration, and remediation  in return for use of the inactive part of the facility. The operating  contractor, in turn, locates and negotiates with tenants regarding lease  rates, facility improvements, and contract terms. However, the effect on  these tenants of closing the four ammunition plants involved with the  initiative is currently unknown. Army officials responsible for the initiative  told us that past transfers of such property outside of the BRAC process  have been handled poorly in that the General Services Administration or  Army Corps of Engineers, the agencies responsible for transferring excess  property, evicted the tenants and then sold the property separately, as was  the case in past closures such as the Indiana Army Ammunition Plant.  Army officials said that property transfers conducted in this manner could  be costly because the government must incur some costs that were paid by  the tenants, such as for security and maintenance.

Our analysis of DOD data indicate that about 47 percent\u2014about  $2.6 billion\u2014of the expected net annual recurring savings of nearly  $5.5 billion for the 2005 round are attributable to these military  personnel actions, for which reductions in the military personnel end- strength levels are not planned.", "The COBRA model provides users with considerable flexibility in  estimating one-time and miscellaneous recurring costs or savings of  various recommendations by allowing them to consider what actions  might constitute a cost or savings and what the expected dollar amounts  should be.

COBRA is not intended to produce budget-quality  data and is not used to develop the budgets for implementing BRAC  actions, which are formulated following the BRAC decision-making  process. COBRA estimates may vary from the actual costs and savings of  BRAC actions for a variety of reasons, including the following:  COBRA estimates, particularly those based on standard cost factors, are  imprecise and are later refined during implementation planning for  budget purposes. The use of averages has an effect on precision. For  example, as noted previously, COBRA uses authorized, rather than  actual, base civilian personnel figures in its calculations. Our work has  shown that the actual number of personnel may be lower or higher than  that which is authorized. The authorized personnel levels are  documented estimates, which can be readily audited. COBRA also uses  a median national civilian personnel salary figure (adjusted by locality  pay), rather than average pay at a particular base, in its calculations.  Further, COBRA estimates are expressed in constant-year dollars,  whereas budgets are expressed in then-year dollars.", "36 percent, or $8.3 million, of the $23.3 million in costs incurred through  fiscal year 2003 for implementing BRAC actions for the previous four  BRAC rounds. Further, COBRA does not include estimates for some  other costs to the federal government, particularly those related to other  federal agencies or DOD providing assistance to BRAC-affected  communities. That is because assistance costs depend on specific  implementation plans that are unknown at the time COBRA estimates  are developed. In our January 2005 report on the previous BRAC rounds,  we noted that about $1.9 billion in such costs had been incurred through  fiscal year 2004.", "Some savings are not fully captured in COBRA as well. COBRA does not  include estimates, for example, for anticipated sales of BRAC surplus  property or other revenue that may be collected in the future through  property leasing arrangements with BRAC-affected entities. These  revenues can help offset some of the costs incurred in implementing  BRAC actions. While such estimates had been included in COBRA in the  previous rounds, the Joint Process Action Team decided not to include  any such estimates for the 2005 round because of the difficulty in  estimating the amount of these revenues.", "Nonetheless, while COBRA estimates do not necessarily reflect the actual  costs and savings ultimately attributable to BRAC, we have recognized in  the past and continue to believe that COBRA is a reasonably effective tool  for the purpose for which it was designed: to aid in BRAC decision making.

In a series of reports, that examine the progress in  implementing closures and realignments in prior BRAC rounds, we  examined how the communities surrounding closed bases were faring in  relation to key national indicators. In our last status report, we observed  that most communities surrounding closed bases were faring well  economically in relation to key national economic indicators.

To perform its assessment, DOD established the Economic  Impact Joint Process Action Team with members of the services and the  Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to develop an economic impact  model for the services and joint cross-service groups to use as they  considered potential recommendations. The team met many times to  develop the economic methodology. We attended and observed those  meetings as the methodology was developed. DOD also retained a private  firm, Booz Allen Hamilton, to provide technical assistance in developing  the methodology and computer database used by the military services and  joint cross-service groups in calculating economic impacts in communities  for which they were considering closure or realignment actions. which the base\u2019s primary county or counties lie.

The indirect job changes are the estimated net  addition or loss of jobs in each economic area that could potentially occur  as a result of the direct job changes. DOD considered two types of indirect  job changes: (1) indirect job changes that are associated with the  production of goods or the provision of services that are direct inputs to a  product, such as a subcontractor producing components for a weapon  system and (2) induced job changes that are affected as a result of local  spending by direct and indirect workers, such as retail sales. base was located. Indirect multipliers were estimated by mapping Military  Occupational Specialties (MOSes) to economically similar civilian sectors.  Each of these similar economic sectors multipliers were weighted by the  number of military personnel mapped to each sector divided by the total  number of employees in the sector. Examples of these economically similar  sectors are educational services, administration and support services,  scientific research and development services, aerospace product and parts  manufacturing, and electronic repair and maintenance. Judgment was used  to place all MOSes into one of the industrial sectors. A weighted average of  the indirect multipliers, based on the weights discussed above, for each  base was used to estimate the indirect job changes from military personnel.  This weighted average of indirect multipliers used to estimate the military  indirect multiplier for each base was used to estimate the indirect job  changes from civilian personnel job changes, as well as the indirect job  changes for mission-support contractors for each base.", "Estimating the induced job changes from military and civilian job changes  was more straightforward. For each economic area, MIG used one induced  multiplier for military personnel job changes and one for nonmilitary  government jobs changes. These multipliers were used to estimate the  induced job changes for each base in that economic area. Summing the  products of the weights for each of the civilian industries calculated for the  military indirect multipliers, and the induced multipliers for each of the  industries from MIG, produced the induced multiplier used for mission  support contractor job changes.", "Because of a concern about the lower spending of military trainees at  recruit training facilities, an adjustment was made to reduce the values of  the induced multipliers used for job changes of military trainees at recruit  training bases. The Economic Impact Joint Process Action Team was also  concerned about overestimating induced job changes for military trainees  at recruit training bases and thought that military trainees at such bases  have a smaller economic impact than civilian employees and regular  military personnel, including those military personnel who receive more  advanced training. The team thought this because such students receive a  relatively smaller income and are generally transient. Student multipliers  for bases with recruit training programs were estimated by multiplying the  military induced multiplier for an economic area by the ratio of basic  training wages to average military wages (slightly more than a third).  Student induced multipliers for bases without basic training programs were  set equal to the military induced multiplier for the base\u2019s economic area.  The team thought that these more advanced students were likely to have  incomes and spending habits similar to the average military in the  economic area.", "Some of the joint cross-service groups subsequently considered a small  number of bases (leased spaces or Reserve/Guard centers) that were not  included in the initial set of defined economic areas. For these economic  areas, a generic set of multipliers was developed by averaging each of the  multipliers of the five categories (military, civilian, contractor, student, and  recruit training student) over the existing economic areas. by economic area (net result of all actions for the economic area).", "The total potential job change and the total potential job changes as a  percentage of total in an economic area were to be considered in the  context of historical economic data. For historical context, the services  and the joint cross-service groups considered the following for each  economic area:  total employment: 1988 to 2002,  annual unemployment rates: 1990 to 2003, and  real per capita income: 1988 to 2002.", "In addition, the latest available numbers on population would be provided. These dates were chosen to reflect the latest available data from federal  sources.", "In the 1995 BRAC round, DOD developed a separate method of assessing  cumulative economic impact because some of the closures and  realignments from the prior rounds had not been fully implemented, so  special consideration was given to the economic impacts that were yet to  occur. However in 2005, given the passage of time since all four of the  previous BRAC rounds, which extended from 1988 to 1995, and other  factors contributing to changing economic conditions in the interim period,  DOD decided not to consider the cumulative economic impact of the prior  BRAC rounds in assessing the impact of the current round. We believe  DOD\u2019s decision not to assess a cumulative economic impact for the 2005  round has merit.", "DOD had extensive documentation controls to protect how documents for  economic impact were prepared, handled, and processed. Procedures were  used to ensure that the inputs, such as the values of the multipliers, used to  make calculations on job changes were correct. A review by qualified  analysts who did not participate in the initial calculations was also  conducted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Methodology Has Limitations but Is Reasonable for BRAC Purposes", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s approach to measuring economic impact did not measure all the  dimensions of the economic impact coming from a BRAC action. There will  be other economic impacts on the economic area, such as changes in the  value of real estate or the value of businesses in the area. The DOD  approach did not estimate these effects, but it is reasonable to assume that  the magnitude of job losses would be correlated with the changes in these  values.", "DOD\u2019s methodology does have some limitations. Specifically, it tended to  overstate the employment impact for economic areas. One of DOD\u2019s goals  for the methodology was to produce credible estimates but to err on the  side of overstating the actual impacts in order to prevent others from  arguing that DOD was underestimating economic impact. The Joint  Process Action Team was aware that the methodology had factors that  might offset the estimated job losses. For example, the methodology  assumed that that jobs are lost all at once and does not recognize that  employees may be released over the 6-year implementation period and be  reemployed in other local businesses or outside the economic area, which  would reduce the estimated job loss. The methodology does not recognize  the possible civilian reuse of the affected base and the resulting  reemployment of workers, which would reduce the estimated job losses.", "In examining the construction of the indirect multipliers, it is possible to  question how they were created. The indirect multiplier being used to  estimate job changes from military job changes for a base is constructed as  a weighted average multiplier where the weights are the fraction of total  base personnel being judged to be similar to a particular civilian industry.  Questions could be raised about judgments made to map particular Military  Occupation Specialties to activities in civilian industries. In some cases, the  mapping from military jobs to industries was easier, such as military jobs in  the medical area being mapped to the medical industry. However, in other  areas where the jobs are uniquely military, such as infantry, the mapping  would be more problematic. If a mistake was made in mapping a job that is  uniquely military to a civilian sector, the result would depend on the  relative size of the multiplier of the correct civilian sector versus the  civilian sector used. It could lead to overestimation or underestimation of  the indirect job change. Time did not permit us to examine this mapping.  Nonetheless, we believe the overall approach seemed to be a sound  attempt to produce a credible multiplier.", "Finally, in using the ratio of estimated job losses from 2006 through 2011 to  total employment as of 2002 (the latest figure for total employment) as a  measure of economic impact, the economic impact was likely overstated.  This occurs because total employment is likely to grow for many economic  areas over the 2006-2011 implementation period as local economies grow,  which would reduce the overall percentage of job losses.", "DOD\u2019s methodology for assessing economic impact was reviewed by an  independent panel of four economists and policy analysts from the private  and academic sectors in August 2004. DOD formed the panel of four  members to review the methodology and to determine if it conformed to  accepted economic practices. Three of the panel members were Ph.D.  economists and the other was a policy analyst. All four were experienced in  conducting local economic impact studies and were not otherwise  associated with the BRAC process. The panel found the methodology to be  reasonable. The experts agreed that the use of direct and indirect job  changes was a logical method to characterize the impact of proposed  closures and realignments. The reviewers also concluded that DOD\u2019s  methodology represents a \u201cworst-case\u201d estimate of economic impact.
