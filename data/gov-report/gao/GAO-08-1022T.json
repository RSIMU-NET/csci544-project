These reports recommended that the Postmaster General (1) strengthen planning and the overall integration of its realignment efforts, and enhance accountability by establishing measurable targets and evaluating results, (2) improve delivery service standards and performance measures, and (3) improve communication with stakeholders by revising its Area Mail Processing (AMP) Communication Plan to improve public notice, engagement, and transparency. The 2006 postal reform act required USPS to develop a network plan by June 2008 that described its vision and strategy for realigning its network; the anticipated costs, cost savings, and other benefits of its realignment initiatives; performance measures for its delivery service standards, and its communication procedures for consolidating AMP operations. This testimony discusses USPS's actions toward addressing GAO recommendations to (1) strengthen network realignment planning and accountability, (2) improve delivery performance information, and (3) improve communication with stakeholders. This testimony is based on prior GAO work, a review of USPS's 2008 Network Plan and revised AMP Communication Plan, and updated information from USPS officials. USPS did not have comments on this testimony."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["USPS has taken steps to respond to most of GAO's prior recommendations to strengthen planning and accountability for its network realignment efforts. In its June 2008 Network Plan, USPS clarified how it makes realignment decisions, and generally addressed how it integrates its realignment initiatives. However, USPS has not established measurable performance targets for its realignment initiatives. USPS believes that its budgeting process accounts for the cost reductions achieved through these initiatives. The Deputy Postmaster General explained that such performance targets are captured in USPS's overall annual goal of achieving $1 billion in savings. While these measures are not as explicit or transparent as GAO had recommended, USPS is required to report annually by the end of December to Congress on, among other matters, its realignment costs and savings. Also, USPS's annual compliance reports to the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) will provide opportunities for further transparency of performance targets and results. USPS's Network Plan notes that to respond to declining mail volumes, USPS must increase efficiency and decrease costs across all its operations. Given USPS's challenging financial situation, effective implementation of network realignment is needed; and USPS's annual reports could help inform Congress about the effectiveness of its realignment efforts. USPS has partially responded to GAO's recommendations to improve its delivery performance standards, measurement, and reporting, but full implementation of performance measures and reporting is not yet completed. USPS established delivery performance standards in December 2007. USPS's Network Plan stated that USPS would develop targets and measures to assess performance against these standards by fiscal year 2009. In addition, USPS has recently submitted a proposal for measuring and reporting on delivery service performance to the PRC. The PRC has requested public comment on USPS's proposal, which depends upon USPS and mailers implementing new technology. Delivery service performance is a critical area that may be affected by the implementation of the realignment initiatives. USPS has also taken steps to address GAO's recommendations to improve communication with its stakeholders as it consolidates its AMP operations by modifying its Communication Plan to improve public notification and engagement, increasing transparency by clarifying its processes for addressing public comments, and making additional information available on its Web site. Going forward, it will be crucial that USPS establishes and maintains an ongoing and open dialogue with stakeholders, including congressional oversight committees and Members of Congress who have questions or are concerned about proposed realignment changes"]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased today to participate in this oversight hearing on actions taken  by the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to address concerns about its network  realignment initiatives and communication with stakeholders. In July 2007,  we testified before this committee on issues we identified and  recommendations we made regarding USPS\u2019s strategy for realigning its  mail processing operations. We previously recommended that the  Postmaster General  1.  strengthen planning and accountability by ensuring that USPS\u2019s    a discussion of how the various network realignment initiatives will  be integrated with each other to achieve network realignment goals  and    measurable targets for the anticipated cost savings and benefits  associated with network rationalization; and  2. improve the way USPS communicates with stakeholders about its  realignment plans and proposals, particularly its proposals for  consolidating Area Mail Processing (AMP) operations, by ensuring  that its revised communication plan includes steps to  improve public engagement, and  increase transparency.", "Last year, we also reported on USPS\u2019s progress in improving delivery  performance information. We recommended to the Postmaster General  that USPS develop complete delivery performance information for all  major types of mail by:    committing to developing delivery performance measures,  implementing representative delivery performance measures, and  improving the transparency of delivery performance standards,  measures, and results.", "Congress has also addressed USPS\u2019s network realignment efforts, as  reflected in the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006  (PAEA), which required USPS to develop a comprehensive Facilities Plan.  This plan was to include USPS\u2019s long-term vision and strategy for  realigning its network; a description of the anticipated costs, costs savings,  and other benefits associated with the infrastructure realignment  alternatives discussed in the plan; and USPS\u2019s communication procedures  related to AMP consolidations. In response, USPS issued a plan in June  2008 titled \u201cPostal Accountability and Enhancement Act \u00a7302 Network  Plan,\u201d which we refer to as USPS\u2019s \u201cNetwork Plan\u201d in this testimony.  PAEA also required USPS to report to Congress 90 days after the end of  each fiscal year on how postal decisions or actions taken during the  preceding year have impacted or will impact rationalization plans,  including overall estimated costs and cost savings. Further, PAEA required  USPS to establish modern delivery service standards by December 20,  2007, and submit annual reports to the Postal Regulatory Commission  (PRC) on the quality of service provided, including the speed and  reliability of delivery for most types of mail (market-dominant products),  according to specific requirements to be established by the PRC.", "My comments today will focus on USPS\u2019s actions toward addressing our  prior recommendations related to network realignment and delivery  performance. Specifically, I will cover USPS\u2019s progress in (1)  strengthening planning and the overall integration of USPS\u2019s realignment  efforts, and enhancing accountability by establishing measurable targets  and evaluating results, (2) improving delivery service standards and  performance measures, and (3) improving communication with  stakeholders by revising its AMP Communication Plan to improve public  notice, engagement, and transparency. My statement is based on our prior  work, listed at the end of this document, and updated information on the  actions USPS has taken related to our recommendations. We reviewed the  Network Plan USPS issued in June 2008 and the revised AMP guidelines  and revised Communication Plan issued in March 2008. We also met with  the Deputy Postmaster General and Acting Senior Vice President for  Operations to discuss USPS\u2019s Network Plan and its decision-making  process related to its network realignment initiatives. We asked USPS to  comment on the results of our new work and USPS officials did not have  any comments.

We also reported that although USPS  had made progress on several of its realignment initiatives, it remained  unclear how the various initiatives were individually and collectively  contributing to the achievement of realignment goals because the  initiatives lacked measurable targets. Appendix I provides a brief  description and identifies the status of USPS\u2019s key realignment initiatives.  Appendix II provides updated status information for all AMP  consolidations through July 2008.", "PAEA calls for USPS to, among other matters, establish performance goals  and identify anticipated costs, cost savings, and other benefits associated  with the infrastructure realignment alternatives in its Network Plan. The  Network Plan describes an overall goal to create an efficient and flexible  network that results in lower costs for both the Postal Service and its  customers, improves the consistency of mail service, and reduces the  Postal Service\u2019s overall environmental footprint. In addition, the plan  states that USPS\u2019s goals are continuous improvement and savings of $1  billion per year through realignment and other efforts. According to the  plan, USPS will achieve these savings, in part, through three core  realignment initiatives, including Airport Mail Center (AMC) closures,  AMP consolidations, and Bulk Mail Center (BMC) transformations. The  specificity of the expected savings and other benefits related to the core  initiatives varies in the plan\u2019s discussion of measurable goals, targets, and  results achieved.", "Overall program targets: USPS estimated total savings of $117 million  for AMC closures\u2014including savings of $57 million in 2008 and $21  million in 2009\u2014but provided no such figure for the AMP  consolidations. Postal officials told us USPS is developing an overall  program target for transforming the BMCs.", "Evaluation of results: USPS has measured the results of its AMP  consolidations through a post-implementation review. In 2007, we  identified data consistency problems with this review. USPS has  addressed these problems in an updated handbook issued in 2008, by  revising its data calculation worksheets. No analogous process exists  for measuring the results of USPS\u2019s AMC closures, which included  outsourcing some operations conducted at these facilities, relocating  some operations to other postal facilities, and closing some facilities.  We are issuing a report today on USPS\u2019s outsourcing activities, which  discusses USPS\u2019s realignment decisions related to its AMCs. As part of  this review, we concluded that USPS does not track and could not  quantify the results of its outsourcing activities. We recommended that  USPS establish a process to measure the results and effectiveness of  those outsourcing activities that are subject to collective bargaining,  including the AMCs. USPS agreed to establish a process for future  outsourcing initiatives subject to collective bargaining, in which it  would compare the financial assumptions that supported its  outsourcing decision with actual contract award data 1 year after  project implementation.", "When we met with USPS officials in June 2008, we asked why they did not  have measurable performance goals and targets for the individual  realignment initiatives. The Deputy Postmaster General explained that the  realignment targets are captured in USPS\u2019s goal of saving $1 billion per  year. Specifically, he explained that USPS will present its overall goals and  targets in more detail as part of its internal budget, which will be  presented to the Board of Governors in July 2008. USPS will have  additional opportunities to provide information about its estimated costs  and cost savings related to its realignment efforts in its annual report to  Congress, which is required by the end of December.

We recommended  that USPS update its outdated delivery standards, which did not reflect  postal operations and thus were unsuitable for setting realistic  expectations and measuring performance. We also recommended that the  Service implement representative measures of delivery performance for all  major types of mail because only one-fifth of mail volume was being  measured and there were no representative measures for Standard Mail,  bulk First-Class Mail, Periodicals, and most Package Services.  Furthermore, we recommended that USPS improve the transparency of its  delivery standards, measurement, and reporting. In December 2006,  Congress enacted postal reform legislation that required USPS to  modernize its delivery standards and measure and report to the PRC on  the speed and reliability of delivery for each market-dominant product.  Collectively, market-dominant products represent 99 percent of mail  volume.", "In December 2007, USPS issued its new delivery standards and has  committed to measuring and reporting on delivery performance for  market-dominant products starting in fiscal year 2009.

Stakeholder  input can help USPS understand and address customer concerns, reach  informed decisions, and achieve buy-in. In our 2007 report, we concluded  that USPS was not effectively engaging stakeholders and the public in its  AMP consolidation process and effectively communicating decisions. For  example, USPS was not clearly communicating to stakeholders what it  was planning to study, why studies were necessary, and what study  outcomes might be. In addition, USPS did not provide stakeholders with  adequate notice of the public input meeting or materials to review in  preparation for the meeting. Furthermore, according to stakeholders,  USPS offered no explanation as to how it evaluates and weighs public  input in its decision-making process.", "To help resolve these and other issues concerning how USPS  communicates its realignment plans with stakeholders, we recommended  that USPS take the following actions:  Improve public notice. Clarify notification letters by explaining  whether USPS is considering closing the facility under study or  consolidating operations with another facility, explaining the next  decision point, and providing a date for the required public meeting.", "Improve public engagement.

The only information available  was a series of bullet points posted on USPS\u2019s Web site several days  before the meetings. This lack of timely and complete information further  inhibited the public\u2019s ability to meaningfully participate in the process.

When we asked USPS why it did not move the meeting to the  data-gathering phase of the study, USPS officials responded that it would  be difficult to hold the meeting during the data-gathering phase because at  that point, they do not know what operations could potentially be  consolidated. However, to ensure that the public meeting is held within a  reasonable amount of time after the study\u2019s completion, USPS included a  requirement in its 2008 AMP Communication Plan that the public meeting  take place within 45 days after the District Manager forwards the study to  the area office and headquarters. In addition, the initial notification letter  now includes contact information for the local Consumer Affairs Manager,  to whom the public can submit written comments up to 15 days after the  public meeting; previously, this contact information appeared in the  second notification letter. To help stakeholders better prepare for the  public meeting, USPS plans to post a meeting agenda, presentation slides,  and a summary brief of the AMP proposal on its Web site 1 week before  the meeting.

First, USPS considers written  comments from stakeholders before the public input meetings and  addresses these comments as part of the public input meetings. Second,  USPS has modified its public input review process so that officials at the  district, area, and headquarters levels consider, and are responsive to,  public concerns. Senior USPS officials told us that they weigh public input  primarily by considering the impact of any consolidations on customer  services and service standards. Additionally, USPS officials told us that as  AMP consolidations go forward, USPS will post standard information  about each consolidation on its Web site and update this information  regularly.

PAEA  required USPS to describe its communication procedures related to AMP  consolidations in its Network Plan. In response, the Network Plan  discusses how USPS will publicly notify communities potentially affected  by realignment changes and how it will obtain and consider public input.  In addition, PAEA directed USPS to identify any statutory or regulatory  obstacles that have prevented it from taking action to realign or  consolidate facilities. Accordingly, USPS\u2019s Network Plan identified delays  related to implementing AMP consolidations. For example, USPS was  directed not to implement certain consolidations until after GAO has  reported to Congress on whether USPS has implemented GAO  recommendations from its report issued in July 2007 to strengthen  planning and accountability in USPS\u2019s realignment efforts. These  directions were included in the joint explanatory statement accompanying  the Consolidated Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2008. We have  previously discussed the difficulties that stakeholder resistance poses for  USPS when it tries to close facilities and how delays may affect USPS\u2019s  ability to achieve its cost-reduction and efficiency goals. Part of the  problem stemmed from USPS\u2019s limited communication with the public. We  believe that USPS has made significant progress toward improving its AMP  communication processes since 2005.
