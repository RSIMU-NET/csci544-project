However, they have faced considerable challenges in these efforts, leading to repeated changes in the focus of their initiatives and target dates. In prior reviews of the departments' efforts, GAO noted management weaknesses, including the lack of a detailed project management plan to guide their efforts. Currently, the two departments are pursuing both long- and short-term initiatives to share health information. Under their long-term initiative, the modern health information systems being developed by each department are to share standardized computable data through an interface between data repositories associated with each system. The repositories have now been developed, and the departments have begun to populate them with limited types of health information. In addition, the interface between the repositories has been implemented at seven VA and DOD sites, allowing computable outpatient pharmacy and drug allergy data to be exchanged. Implementing this interface is a milestone toward the departments' long-term goal, but more remains to be done. Besides extending the current capability throughout VA and DOD, the departments must still agree to standards for the remaining categories of medical information, populate the data repositories with this information, complete the development of the two modernized health information systems, and transition from their existing systems. While pursuing their long-term effort to develop modernized systems, the two departments have also been working to share information in their existing systems. Among various short-term initiatives are a completed effort to allow the one-way transfer of health information from DOD to VA when service members leave the military, as well as ongoing demonstration projects to exchange limited data at selected sites. One of these projects, building on the one-way transfer capability, developed an interface between certain existing systems that allows a two-way view of current data on patients receiving care from both departments. VA and DOD are now working to link other systems via this interface and extend its capabilities. The departments have also established ad hoc processes to meet the immediate need to provide data on severely wounded service members to VA's polytrauma centers, which specialize in treating such patients. These processes include manual workarounds (such as scanning paper records) that are generally feasible only because the number of polytrauma patients is small. These multiple initiatives and ad hoc processes highlight the need for continued efforts to integrate information systems and automate information exchange. However, it is not clear how all the initiatives are to be incorporated into an overall strategy focused on achieving the departments' goal of comprehensive, seamless exchange of health information."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the sharing of electronic  medical records between the Department of Defense (DOD) and the  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

These include efforts focused on the long-term  vision of a single \u201ccomprehensive, lifelong medical record for each  service member\u201d that would allow a seamless transition between  the two departments, as well as more short-term efforts to meet  immediate needs to exchange health information, including  responding to current military crises.", "Each department is developing its own modern health information  system to replace its existing (\u201clegacy\u201d) systems, and they are  collaborating on a program to develop an interface to enable these  modernized systems to share data and ultimately to have  interoperable electronic medical records. Unlike the legacy  systems, the modernized systems are to be based on computable  data: that is, the data are to be in a format that a computer  application can act on, for example, to provide alerts to clinicians  (of such things as drug allergies) or to plot graphs of changes in vital  signs such as blood pressure. According to the departments, such  computable data contribute significantly to patient safety and the  usefulness of electronic medical records.", "While working on this long-term effort, the two departments have  also been pursuing various short-term initiatives to exchange  electronic medical information in their existing systems. These  include a completed effort to allow the one-way transfer of health  information from DOD to VA when service members leave the  military, ongoing demonstration projects to exchange particular  types of data at selected sites, and efforts to meet the immediate  needs of facilities treating veterans and service members with  multiple injuries.", "On May 8, 2007, we testified before the House Veterans Affairs  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations on the history of the  two departments\u2019 efforts to develop the capability to share health  information, and the current status of the long- and short-term  efforts that the departments are undertaking in this regard. At your  request, my statement today presents information discussed in that  testimony.", "The information in my testimony is based largely on our previous  work in this area. To describe the current status of VA and DOD  efforts to exchange patient health information, we reviewed our  previous work, analyzed documents on various health initiatives,  and interviewed VA and DOD officials about current status and  future plans. The costs that have been incurred for the various  projects were provided by cognizant VA and DOD officials.

However, the departments have faced  considerable challenges, leading to repeated changes in the focus of  their initiatives and target dates for accomplishment.", "As shown in figure 1, the departments\u2019 efforts have involved a  number of distinct initiatives, both long-term initiatives to develop  future modernized solutions, and short-term initiatives to respond to  more immediate needs to share information in existing systems. As  the figure shows, these initiatives often proceeded in parallel.", "The departments\u2019 first initiative, known as the Government  Computer-Based Patient Record (GCPR) project, aimed to develop  an electronic interface that would let physicians and other  authorized users at VA and DOD health facilities access data from  each other\u2019s health information systems. The interface was expected  to compile requested patient information in a virtual record (that is,  electronic as opposed to paper) that could be displayed on a user\u2019s  computer screen.", "In 2001 and 2002, we reviewed the GCPR project and noted  disappointing progress, exacerbated in large part by inadequate  accountability and poor planning and oversight, which raised doubts  about the departments\u2019 ability to achieve a virtual medical record.  We determined that the lack of a lead entity, clear mission, and  detailed planning to achieve that mission made it difficult to monitor  progress, identify project risks, and develop appropriate  contingency plans. We made recommendations in both years that  the departments enhance the project\u2019s overall management and  accountability. In particular, we recommended that the departments  designate a lead entity and a clear line of authority for the project;  create comprehensive and coordinated plans that include an agreed- upon mission and clear goals, objectives, and performance  measures; revise the project\u2019s original goals and objectives to align  with the current strategy; commit the executive support necessary  to adequately manage the project; and ensure that it followed sound  project management principles.", "In response, the two departments revised their strategy in July 2002,  refocusing the project and dividing it into two initiatives. A short- term initiative (the Federal Health Information Exchange or FHIE)  was to enable DOD, when service members left the military, to  electronically transfer their health information to VA. VA was  designated as the lead entity for implementing FHIE, which was  successfully completed in 2004. A longer term initiative was to  develop a common health information architecture that would allow  the two-way exchange of health information. The common  architecture is to include standardized, computable data,  communications, security, and high-performance health information  systems (these systems, DOD\u2019s CHCS II and VA\u2019s HealtheVet VistA,  were already in development, as shown in the figure). The  departments\u2019 modernized systems are to store information (in  standardized, computable form) in separate data repositories:  DOD\u2019s Clinical Data Repository (CDR) and VA\u2019s Health Data  Repository (HDR). The two repositories are to exchange  information through an interface named CHDR.", "In March 2004, the departments began to develop the CHDR  interface, and they planned to begin implementation by October  2005. However, implementation of the first release of the interface  (at one site) occurred in September 2006, almost a year later. In a  review in June 2004, we identified a number of management  weaknesses that could have contributed to this delay and made a  number of recommendations, including creation of a comprehensive  and coordinated project management plan. In response, the  departments agreed to our recommendations and improved the  management of the CHDR program by designating a lead entity with  final decision-making authority and establishing a project  management structure. As we noted in later testimony, however, the  program did not develop a project management plan that would give  a detailed description of the technical and managerial processes  necessary to satisfy project requirements (including a work  breakdown structure and schedule for all development, testing, and  implementation tasks), as we had recommended.", "In October 2004, the two departments established two more short- term initiatives in response to a congressional mandate. These  were two demonstration projects: the Laboratory Data Sharing  Interface, aimed at allowing VA and DOD facilities to share  laboratory resources, and the Bidirectional Health Information  Exchange (BHIE), aimed at allowing both departments\u2019 clinicians  access to records on shared patients (that is, those who receive care  from both departments). As demonstration projects, both  initiatives were limited in scope, with the intention of providing  interim solutions to the departments\u2019 need for more immediate  health information sharing. However, because BHIE provided  access to up-to-date information, the departments\u2019 clinicians  expressed strong interest in increasing its use. As a result, the  departments began planning to broaden BHIE\u2019s capabilities and  expand its implementation considerably. Until the departments\u2019  modernized systems are fully developed and implemented,  extending BHIE connectivity could provide each department with  access to most data in the other\u2019s legacy systems. According to a  VA/DOD annual report and program officials, the departments now  consider BHIE an interim step in their overall strategy to create a  two-way exchange of electronic medical records.", "Most recently, the departments have announced a further change to  their information-sharing strategy. In January 2007, they announced  their intention to jointly develop a new inpatient medical record  system. According to the departments, adopting this joint solution  will facilitate the seamless transition of active-duty service members  to veteran status, as well as making inpatient health-care data on  shared patients immediately accessible to both DOD and VA. In  addition, the departments consider that a joint development effort  could allow them to realize significant cost savings.

For example,  in fiscal year 2006, the Congress did not provide all the funding  requested for HealtheVet VistA because it did not consider that the  funding had been adequately justified. In addition, a recent  presidential task force identified the need for VA and DOD to  improve their long-term planning. This task force, reporting on  gaps in services provided to returning veterans, noted problems  with regard to sharing information on wounded service members,  including the inability of VA providers to access paper DOD  inpatient health records. According to the report, although  significant progress has been made on sharing electronic  information, more needs to be done.

The  first release has enabled the seven sites to share limited medical  information: specifically, computable outpatient pharmacy and drug  allergy information for shared patients.", "According to DOD officials, in the third quarter of 2007 the  department will send out instructions to its remaining sites so that  they can all begin using CHDR. According to VA officials, the  interface will be available across the department when necessary  software updates are released, which is expected this July.", "Besides being a milestone in the development of the departments\u2019  modernized systems, the interface implementation provides benefits  to the departments\u2019 current systems. Data transmitted by CHDR are  permanently stored in the modernized data repositories, CDR and  HDR. Once in the repositories, these computable data can be used  by DOD and VA at all sites through their existing systems. CHDR  also provides terminology mediation (translation of one agency\u2019s  terminology into the other\u2019s). VA and DOD plans call for developing  the capability to exchange computable laboratory results data  through CHDR during fiscal year 2008.", "Although implementing this interface is an important  accomplishment, the departments are still a long way from  completion of the modernized health information systems and  comprehensive longitudinal health records. While DOD and VA had  originally projected completion dates for their modernized systems  of 2011 and 2012, respectively, department officials told us that  there is currently no scheduled completion date for either system.  Further, both departments have still to identify the next types of  data to be stored in the repositories. The two departments will then  have to populate the repositories with the standardized data, which  involves different tasks for each department. Specifically, although  VA\u2019s medical records are already electronic, it still has to convert  these into the interoperable format appropriate for its repository.  DOD, in addition to converting current records from its multiple  systems, must also address medical records that are not automated.  As pointed out by a recent Army Inspector General\u2019s report, some  DOD facilities are having problems with hard-copy records. In the  same report, inaccurate and incomplete health data were identified  as a problem to be addressed. Before the departments can achieve  the long-term goal of seamless sharing of medical information, all  these tasks and challenges will have to be addressed.

According to department officials, over 184 million clinical  messages on more than 3.8 million veterans had been transferred to  the FHIE data repository as of March 2007. Data elements  transferred are laboratory results, radiology results, outpatient  pharmacy data, allergy information, consultation reports, elements  of the standard ambulatory data record, and demographic data.  Further, since July 2005, FHIE has been used to transfer pre- and  post-deployment health assessment and reassessment data; as of  March 2007, VA had access to data for more than 681,000 separated  service members and demobilized Reserve and National Guard  members who had been deployed. Transfers are done in batches  once a month, or weekly for veterans who have been referred to VA  treatment facilities.", "According to a joint DOD/VA report, FHIE has made a significant  contribution to the delivery and continuity of care of separated  service members as they transition to veteran status, as well as to  the adjudication of disability claims.", "One of the departments\u2019 demonstration projects, the Laboratory  Data Sharing Interface (LDSI), is now fully operational and is  deployed when local agencies have a business case for its use and  sign an agreement. It requires customization for each locality and is  currently deployed at nine locations. LDSI currently supports a  variety of chemistry and hematology tests, and work is under way to  include microbiology and anatomic pathology.", "Once LDSI is implemented at a facility, the only nonautomated  action needed for a laboratory test is transporting the specimens. If  a test is not performed at a VA or DOD doctor\u2019s home facility, the  doctor can order the test, the order is transmitted electronically to  the appropriate lab (the other department\u2019s facility or in some cases  a local commercial lab), and the results are returned electronically.", "Among the benefits of LDSI, according to VA and DOD, are  increased speed in receiving laboratory results and decreased errors  from manual entry of orders. The LDSI project manager in San  Antonio stated that another benefit of the project is the time saved  by eliminating the need to rekey orders at processing labs to input  the information into the laboratories\u2019 systems. Additionally, the San  Antonio VA facility no longer has to contract out some of its  laboratory work to private companies, but instead uses the DOD  laboratory.", "Developed under a second demonstration project, the BHIE  interface is now available throughout VA and partially deployed at  DOD. It is currently deployed at 25 DOD sites, providing access to  15 medical centers, 18 hospitals, and over 190 outpatient clinics  associated with these sites. DOD planned to make current BHIE  capabilities available departmentwide by June 2007.", "The interface permits a medical care provider to query patient data  from all VA sites and any DOD site where it is installed and to view  that data onscreen almost immediately. It not only allows DOD and  VA to view each other\u2019s information, it also allows DOD sites to see  previously inaccessible data at other DOD sites.", "As initially developed, the BHIE interface provides access to  information in VA\u2019s VistA and DOD\u2019s CHCS, but it is currently being  expanded to query data in other DOD databases (in addition to  CHCS). In particular, DOD has developed an interface to the Clinical  Information System (CIS), an inpatient system used by many DOD  facilities, which will provide bidirectional views of discharge  summaries. The BHIE-CIS interface is currently deployed at five  DOD sites and planned for eight others. Further, interfaces to two  additional systems are planned for June and July 2007: An interface  to DOD\u2019s modernized data repository, CDR, will give access to  outpatient data from combat theaters. An interface to another DOD  database, the Theater Medical Data Store, will give access to  inpatient information from combat theaters.", "The departments also plan to make more data elements available.  Currently, BHIE enables text-only viewing of patient identification,  outpatient pharmacy, microbiology, cytology, radiology, laboratory  orders, and allergy data from its interface with DOD\u2019s CHCS. Where  it interfaces with CIS, it also allows viewing of discharge summaries  from VA and the five DOD sites. DOD staff told us that in early fiscal  year 2008, they plan to add provider notes, procedures, and problem  lists. Later in fiscal year 2008, they plan to add vital signs, scanned  images and documents, family history, social history, and other  history questionnaires. In addition, at the VA/DOD site in El Paso, a  trial is under way of a process for exchanging radiological images  using the BHIE/FHIE infrastructure. Some images have  successfully been exchanged.", "Through their efforts on these long- and short-term initiatives, VA  and DOD are achieving exchanges of various types of health  information (see attachment 1 for a summary of all the types of data  currently being shared and those planned for the future, as well as  cost data on the initiatives).

Polytrauma centers  care for veterans and returning service members with injuries to  more than one physical region or organ system, one of which may  be life threatening, and which results in physical, cognitive,  psychological, or psychosocial impairments and functional  disability. Some examples of polytrauma include traumatic brain  injury (TBI), amputations, and loss of hearing or vision.", "When service members are seriously injured in a combat theater  overseas, they are first treated locally. They are then generally  evacuated to Landstuhl Medical Center in Germany, after which  they are transferred to a military treatment facility in the United  States, usually Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington,  D.C.; the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland; or  Brooke Army Medical Center, at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. From  these facilities, service members suffering from polytrauma may be  transferred to one of VA\u2019s four polytrauma centers for treatment.", "At each of these locations, the injured service members will  accumulate medical records, in addition to medical records already  in existence before they were injured. However, the DOD medical  information is currently collected in many different systems and is  not easily accessible to VA polytrauma centers. Specifically:   1.  In the combat theater, electronic medical information may be  collected for a variety of reasons, including routine outpatient  care, as well as serious injuries. These data are stored in the  Theater Medical Data Store, which can be accessed by unit  commanders and others. (As mentioned earlier, the departments  have plans to develop a BHIE interface to this system by July  2007. Until then, VA cannot access these data.) In addition, both  inpatient and outpatient medical data for patients who are  evacuated are entered into the Joint Patient Tracking  Application. (A few VA polytrauma center staff have been given  access to this application.)  2.  At Landstuhl, inpatient medical records are paper-based (except  for discharge summaries). The paper records are sent with a  patient as the individual is transferred for treatment in the  United States.   3.  At the DOD treatment facility (Walter Reed, Bethesda, or  Brooke), additional information will be recorded in CIS and  CHCS/CDR.", "When service members are transferred to a VA polytrauma center,  VA and DOD have several ad hoc processes in place to electronically  transfer the patients\u2019 medical information:  \u25cf  DOD has set up secure links to enable a limited number of clinicians  at the polytrauma centers to log directly into CIS at Walter Reed and  Bethesda Naval Hospital to access patient data.  \u25cf  Staff at Walter Reed collect paper records, print records from CIS,  scan all these, and transmit the scanned data to three of the four  polytrauma centers. DOD staff said that they are working on  establishing this capability at the Brooke and Bethesda medical  centers, as well as the fourth VA polytrauma center. According to  VA staff, although the initiative began several months ago, it has  only recently begun running smoothly as the contractor became  more skilled at assembling the records. DOD staff also pointed out  that this laborious process is feasible only because the number of  polytrauma patients is small (about 350 in all to date); it would not  be practical on a large scale.  \u25cf  Staff at Walter Reed and Bethesda are transmitting radiology images  electronically to three polytrauma centers. (A fourth has this  capability, but at this time no radiology images have been  transferred there.) Access to radiology images is a high priority for  polytrauma center doctors, but like scanning paper records,  transmitting these images requires manual intervention: when each  image is received at VA, it must be individually uploaded to VistA\u2019s  imagery viewing capability. This process would not be practical for  large volumes of images.   \u25cf  VA has access to outpatient data (via BHIE) from 25 DOD sites,  including Landstuhl.", "Although these various efforts to transfer medical information on  seriously wounded patients are working, and the departments are to  be commended on their efforts, the multiple processes and  laborious manual tasks illustrate the effects of the lack of integrated  health information systems and the difficulties of exchanging  information in their absence.", "In summary, through the long- and short-term initiatives described,  as well as efforts such as those at the polytrauma centers, VA and  DOD are achieving exchanges of health information. However, these  exchanges are as yet limited, and significant work remains to be  done to fully achieve the goal of exchanging interoperable,  computable data, including agreeing to standards for the remaining  categories of medical information, populating the data repositories  with all this information, completing the development of HealtheVet  VistA and AHLTA, and transitioning from the legacy systems. To  complete these tasks, a detailed project management plan continues  to be of vital importance to the ultimate success of the effort to  develop a lifelong virtual medical record. We have previously  recommended that the departments develop a clearly defined  project management plan that describes the technical and  managerial processes necessary to satisfy project requirements,  including a work breakdown structure and schedule for all  development, testing, and implementation tasks. Without a plan of  sufficient detail, VA and DOD increase the risk that the long-term  project will not deliver the planned capabilities in the time and at  the cost expected.
