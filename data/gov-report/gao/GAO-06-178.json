Their primary focus has been on actions to address the first part of the standard, which calls for establishing appropriate identity proofing and card issuance policies and procedures and which the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) required agencies to implement by October 27, 2005. Agencies had completed a variety of actions, such as instituting policies to require that at least a successful fingerprint check be completed prior to issuing a credential. Regarding other requirements, however, efforts were still under way. For example, Defense and NASA reported that they were still modifying their background check policies. Based on OMB guidance, agencies have until October 27, 2006, to implement the second part of the standard, which requires them to implement interoperable smart-card based ID systems. Agencies have begun to take actions to address this part of the standard. For example, Defense and Interior conducted assessments of technological gaps between their existing systems and the infrastructure required by FIPS 201 but had not yet developed specific designs for card systems that meet FIPS 201 interoperability requirements. The federal government faces significant challenges in implementing FIPS 201, including (1) testing and acquiring compliant commercial products--such as smart cards and card readers--within required time frames; (2) reconciling divergent implementation specifications; (3) assessing the risks associated with specific vendor implementations of the recently chosen biometric standard; (4) incomplete guidance regarding the applicability of FIPS 201 to facilities, people, and information systems; and (5) planning and budgeting with uncertain knowledge and the potential for substantial cost increases. Until these implementation challenges are addressed, the benefits of FIPS 201 may not be fully realized.

In an effort to increase the quality and security of ID and  credentialing practices across the federal government, the President issued  Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) in August 2004.  This directive ordered the establishment of a mandatory, governmentwide  standard for secure and reliable forms of identification for federal  government employees and contractors that access government-controlled  facilities and information systems.", "In February 2005, the National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST) issued the required standard, titled the Federal Information  Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 201, Personal Identity Verification  (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors. Known as FIPS 201, the  standard is divided into two parts. The first part, PIV-I, sets out uniform  requirements for identity proofing\u2014verifying the identity of individuals  applying for official agency credentials\u2014as well as issuing credentials,  maintaining related information, and protecting the privacy of the  applicants. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which is  responsible for ensuring compliance with the standard, issued guidance  requiring agencies to implement these requirements, with the exception of  the privacy requirements, by October 27, 2005. The second part, PIV-II,  specifies the technical requirements for credentialing systems for federal  employees and contractors based on interoperable smart cards. Agencies  are required by OMB to begin issuing credentials that meet these provisions  by October 27, 2006. Subsequent publications from NIST and the General  Services Administration (GSA) provided supplemental guidance on various  aspects of FIPS 201, including an outline of two alternate approaches that  agencies may take to comply with the standard, depending on their  previous experience with smart cards. Smart cards offer the potential to  enhance security by significantly improving the process of authenticating  the identity of people accessing federal buildings and computer systems,  especially when these cards are used in combination with other  technologies, such as biometrics.", "This report responds to your request that we conduct a review of agencies\u2019  progress in implementing systems that conform to the new federal identity  card standard, as directed by HSPD-12. Specifically, our objectives were to  determine (1) actions that selected federal agencies have taken to  implement systems, based on the new standard and (2) challenges that  federal agencies are facing in implementing such systems.", "To address these objectives, we selected six agencies with a range of  experience in implementing smart card-based identification systems\u2014the  Departments of Defense, Interior, Homeland Security (DHS), Housing and  Urban Development (HUD), Labor, and the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA). To obtain information on the actions these  agencies have taken and plan to take to implement the standard, we  analyzed documentation such as agencies\u2019 implementation plans and  interviewed their officials. To identify challenges and barriers associated  with implementing the new federal ID standard, we obtained and analyzed  documentation and interviewed officials from these agencies as well as  from GSA, NIST, OMB and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). We  performed our work at Defense, Interior, DHS, HUD, Labor, NASA, NIST,  OMB, OPM and GSA in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area from April  2005 to December 2005, in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Further details of our objectives, scope, and  methodology are provided in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Today, federal employees are issued a wide variety of ID cards that are used  to access federal buildings and facilities, sometimes solely on the basis of  visual inspection by security personnel. These cards generally cannot be  used to control access to an agency\u2019s computer systems. Furthermore,  many can be easily forged or stolen and altered to permit access by  unauthorized individuals. The ease with which traditional ID cards can be  forged has contributed to increases in identity theft and related security  and financial problems for both individuals and organizations. One means  to address such problems is offered by the use of smart cards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "What Are Smart Cards?", "paragraphs": ["Smart cards are plastic devices about the size of a credit card that contain  an embedded integrated circuit chip capable of storing and processing  data. The unique advantage that smart cards have over traditional cards  with simpler technologies like magnetic stripes or bar codes is that they  can exchange data with other systems and process information, rather than  simply serving as static data repositories. By securely exchanging  information, a smart card can help authenticate the identity of the  individual possessing the card in a far more rigorous way than is possible  with traditional ID cards. A smart card\u2019s processing power also allows it to  exchange and update many other kinds of information with a variety of  external systems, which can facilitate applications such as financial  transactions or other services that involve electronic record-keeping.  Figure 1 shows a typical example of a smart card.", "Smart cards can also be used to significantly enhance the security of an  organization\u2019s computer systems by tightening controls over user access. A  user wishing to log on to a computer system or network with controlled  access must \u201cprove\u201d his or her identity to the system\u2014a process called  authentication. Many systems authenticate users merely by requiring them  to enter secret passwords. This provides only modest security because  passwords can be easily compromised. Substantially better user  authentication can be achieved by supplementing passwords with smart  cards. To gain access under this scenario, a user is prompted to insert a  smart card into a reader attached to the computer as well as type in a  password. This authentication process is significantly harder to circumvent  because an intruder would not only need to guess a user\u2019s password but  also possess that same user\u2019s smart card.", "Even stronger authentication can be achieved by using smart cards in  conjunction with biometrics. Smart cards can be configured to store  biometric information (such as fingerprints or iris scans) in an electronic  record that can be retrieved and compared with an individual\u2019s live  biometric scan as a means of verifying that person\u2019s identity in a way that is  difficult to circumvent. An information system requiring users to present a  smart card, enter a password, and verify a biometric scan provides what  security experts call \u201cthree-factor\u201d authentication, the three factors being  \u201csomething you possess\u201d (the smart card), \u201csomething you know\u201d (the  password), and \u201csomething you are\u201d (the biometric). Systems employing  three-factor authentication are considered to provide a relatively high level  of security. The combination of smart cards and biometrics can provide  equally strong authentication for controlling access to physical facilities.", "Smart cards can also be used in conjunction with public key infrastructure  (PKI) technology to better secure electronic messages and transactions. A  properly implemented and maintained PKI can offer several important  security services, including assurance that (1) the parties to an electronic  transaction are really who they claim to be, (2) the information has not  been altered or shared with any unauthorized entity, and (3) neither party  will be able to wrongfully deny taking part in the transaction. PKI systems  are based on cryptography and require each user to have two different  digital \u201ckeys\u201d: a public and a private key. Both public and private keys may  be generated on a smart card or on a user\u2019s computer. Security experts  generally agree that PKI technology is most effective when used in tandem  with hardware tokens, such as smart cards. PKI systems use cryptographic  techniques to generate and manage electronic \u201ccertificates\u201d that link an  individual or entity to a given public key. These digital certificates are then  used to verify digital signatures and facilitate data encryption. The digital  certificates are created by a trusted third party called a certification  authority, which is also responsible for providing status information on  whether the certificate is still valid or has been revoked or suspended. The  PKI software in the user\u2019s computer can verify that a certificate is valid by  first verifying that the certificate has not expired and then by checking the  online status information to ensure that it has not been revoked or  suspended.", "In addition to enhancing security, smart cards have the flexibility to  support a wide variety of uses not related to security, such as tracking  itineraries for travelers, linking to immunization or other medical records,  or storing cash value for electronic purchases. Currently, a typical smart  card can store and process up to 32 kilobytes of data, however newer cards  have been introduced that can accommodate 64 kilobytes. The larger a  card\u2019s electronic memory, the more functions it can support.", "Smart cards are grouped into two major classes: \u201ccontact\u201d cards and  \u201ccontactless\u201d cards. Contact cards have gold-plated contacts that connect  directly with the read/write heads of a smart card reader when the card is  inserted into the device. Contactless cards contain an embedded antenna  and work when the card is waved within the magnetic field of a card reader  or terminal. Contactless cards are better suited to environments that  require quick interaction between the card and the reader, such as places  with a high volume of people seeking physical access. For example, the  Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority has deployed an  automated fare collection system using contactless smart cards as a way of  speeding patrons\u2019 access to the Washington, D.C., subway system. Smart  cards can be configured to include both contact and contactless  capabilities, but two separate interfaces are needed because standards for  the technologies are very different."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Governmentwide Smart Card Efforts Were Under Way Prior to HSPD-12", "paragraphs": ["Since the 1990s, the federal government has promoted the use of smart  card technology as one option for improving security over buildings and  computer systems. In 1996, OMB, which has statutory responsibility to  develop and oversee policies, principles, standards, and guidelines\u2014used  by agencies for ensuring the security of federal information and systems\u2014 tasked GSA with taking the lead in facilitating a coordinated interagency  management approach for the adoption of smart cards across government.", "Because the value of a smart card is greatly enhanced if it can be used with  multiple systems at different agencies, GSA worked with NIST and smart  card vendors to develop the Government Smart Card Interoperability  Specification, which defined a uniform set of commands and responses for  smart cards to use in communicating with card readers. This specification  defined a software interface for smart card systems that served to bridge  the significant incompatibilities among vendors\u2019 proprietary systems.  Vendors could meet the specification by writing software for their cards  that translated their unique command and response formats to the  government standard. NIST completed the first version of the  interoperability specification in August 2000. However, this and subsequent  versions did not fully define all implementation details, and therefore the  extent to which systems using the specification could interoperate was  limited.", "In 2003, OMB created the Federal Identity Credentialing Committee to  make policy recommendations and develop the Federal Identity  Credentialing component of the Federal Enterprise Architecture to  include processes such as identity proofing and credential management. In  February 2004, the Federal Identity Credentialing Committee issued the  Government Smart Card Handbook on the use of smart card\u2013based  systems in badge, identification, and credentialing systems with the  objective of helping agencies plan, budget, establish, and implement  identification and credentialing systems for government employees and  their agents.", "In September 2004, we reported that nine agencies were planning or  implementing agencywide smart card initiatives. Some of these initiatives  included the Defense\u2019s Common Access Card (CAC), which had 3.2 million  cards in use at the time of our review, and the Department of State\u2019s  Domestic Smart Card Access Control project, which had issued 25,000  cards as of September 2004."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HSPD-12 Requires Standardized Agency ID and Credentialing Systems", "paragraphs": ["In August 2004, the President issued HSPD-12, which required the  Department of Commerce to develop a new standard for secure and  reliable forms of ID for federal employees and contractors by February 27,  2005.

Experience with similar NIST  conformance testing regimes, such as FIPS 140-2 cryptography testing, has  shown that this process can actually take several months. According to a  FIPS 140-2 consulting organization, the variability in the time it takes to  test products depends on (1) the complexity of the product, (2) the  completeness and clarity of the vendor\u2019s documentation, (3) how fast the  vendor is able to answer questions and resolve issues raised during testing,  and (4) the current backlog of work encountered in the lab.

According to the guidance, the  transitional approach should be based on the existing GSC-IS specification  and should be a temporary measure prior to implementing the full FIPS 201  specification, known as the \u201cend point\u201d specification. Agencies without  existing large-scale smart card systems were to implement only systems  that fully conform to the end-point specification. NIST deferred to OMB to  set time frames for when agencies adopting the transitional approach  would be required to reach full compliance with the end-point  specification. However, OMB has not yet set these time frames and has  given no indication of how or when it plans to address this issue.", "The provision for transitional FIPS 201 implementations in NIST\u2019s guidance  acknowledges that agencies with fully implemented GSC-IS smart card  systems may already be meeting many of the security objectives of FIPS  201 and that it may be unreasonable to require them to replace all of their  cards and equipment within the short time frames established by HSPD-12.  However, according to NIST officials, the transitional specification is not  technically interoperable with the end-point specification. Thus, cards  issued by an agency implementing a transitional system will not be able to  interoperate with systems at agencies that have implemented the end-point  specification until those agencies implement the end-state specification,  too.", "Although allowing for the transitional approach to FIPS 201 compliance in  their guidance, NIST stated that agencies should implement the end-point  specification directly, wherever possible. According to NIST, agencies that  adopt the transitional specification will have to do more work than if they  immediately adopt the end-point specification. Specifically, major  technological differences between the two interfaces will require agencies  to conduct two development efforts\u2014one to adopt the transitional  specification and then another at a later date to adopt the end-point  specification.", "Agencies with substantial smart card systems already deployed\u2014such as  Defense and Interior\u2014have chosen the transitional option because they  believe it poses fewer technical risks than the end-point specification,  which is a new standard.

According  to OMB, these agencies will be allowed to meet OMB\u2019s October 2006  deadline by implementing the transitional specification. Defense officials  stated that, based on their past experience in implementing the CAC  system, they believe the transitional approach will entail fewer  development problems because it involves implementing hardware and  software that is similar to their current system. Further, Defense officials  indicated that implementing the end-point specification would be risky. For  example, Defense officials conducted a technical evaluation, which  determined that the specification was incomplete. The officials stated that  they would not plan to adopt the end-point specification until at least one  other agency has demonstrated a successful implementation. Similarly,  Interior officials said they also plan to use products based on the  transitional specification until approved end-point products are readily  available.", "While NIST and OMB guidance on FIPS 201 compliance allows agencies to  meet the requirements of HSPD-12 using two divergent specifications that  lead to incompatible systems, it does not specify when agencies choosing  the transitional approach need to move from that approach to the end-point  specification.

In January  2005, NIST issued initial draft guidance for storing electronic images of  fingerprints on PIV cards in accordance with a preexisting standard. NIST  based its draft guidance on the fact that the existing fingerprint image  standard is internationally recognized and thus can facilitate  interoperability among multiple vendors\u2019 products.", "When agency officials and industry experts reviewed and commented on  the initial draft guidance, they were strongly opposed to the use of  fingerprint images, arguing instead for a more streamlined approach that  would take less electronic storage space on the cards and could be  accessed more quickly. According to industry experts, because the large  amount of memory required for images can only be accessed very slowly, it  could take approximately 30 seconds for card readers to read fingerprint  information from an electronic image stored on a card\u2014a length of time  that would likely cause unacceptable delays in admitting individuals to  federal buildings and other facilities.", "Instead of relying on electronic images, agency officials and industry  experts advocated that the biometric guidance instead be changed to  require the use of \u201ctemplates\u201d extracted from fingerprint \u201cminutiae.\u201d A  minutiae template is created by mathematically extracting the key data  points related to breaks in the ridges of an individual\u2019s fingertip. As shown  in figure 6, the most basic minutiae are ridge endings (where a ridge ends)  and bifurcations (where a single ridge divides into two). Using minutiae  templates allows for capturing only the critical data needed to confirm a  fingerprint match, and storing just those key data points rather than a full  representation of an individual\u2019s fingerprint. Thus, this technique requires  much less storage space than a full electronic image of a fingerprint.", "An additional benefit of using minutiae templates is rapid processing  capability. Because minutiae data require a much smaller amount of  storage space than fingerprints in image format, the smaller data size  allows for decreased transmission time of fingerprint data between the  cards and the card readers\u2014approximately 7 to 10 seconds, according to  industry experts at Smart Card Alliance. Short transmission times are  especially important for high traffic areas such as entrances to federal  buildings.", "Despite these advantages, existing minutiae template technology suffers  from two significant drawbacks. One disadvantage is that vendors\u2019  techniques for converting fingerprint images to minutiae are generally  proprietary and incompatible; a minutiae template that one vendor uses  cannot be used by another. Another disadvantage of template technology is  its questionable reliability. Different algorithms for extracting minutiae  produce templates with varying reliability in producing accurate matches  with the original fingerprints.", "To resolve these issues, NIST began systematically testing minutiae  template algorithms submitted by 14 vendors to determine if it is possible  to adopt a standard minutiae template that can accurately match templates  to individuals. NIST officials anticipate that testing will be completed by  February 2006, when they expect to be able to determine the accuracy and  level of interoperability that can be achieved for the 14 vendors being  tested, using standard minutiae templates.", "In December 2005, NIST officials stated that they had conducted enough  tests to determine that the reliability, accuracy, and interoperability of  minutiae data among these 14 vendors were generally within the bounds of  what was likely to be required for many applications of the technology.  However they noted that the tests showed that the products of the 14  vendors varied significantly in their reliability and accuracy\u2014by as much  as a factor of 10. NIST officials expect that once they complete testing in  February 2006, they will have sufficient data to establish the reliability and  accuracy of each of the 14 vendors.", "Despite the fact that the testing of minutiae template technology was still  under way, NIST was requested by the Executive Office of the President to  issue revised draft guidance that replaced the previously proposed image  standard with a minutiae standard. While the minutiae standard resolves  the problems of storage and access speed associated with the image  standard, it opens new questions about how agencies should choose  vendor implementations of the minutiae standard, due to their varying  reliability and accuracy. Agencies will need to ensure that the vendors they  select to provide minutiae template matching will provide systems that  provide the level of reliability and accuracy needed for their applications.  Agencies will also have to determine the level of risk they are willing to  accept that fingerprints may be incorrectly matched or incorrectly fail to  match. According to NIST officials, agencies may find that in order to  preserve interoperability across agencies\u2019 systems, they may need to allow  for less reliability and accuracy in determining whether fingerprints match.  This reduction in reliability and accuracy\u2014and the associated higher  security risk\u2014could pose problems for secure facilities that require very  high levels of assurance. Further, according to NIST officials, any vendors  beyond the 14 currently being tested would need to undergo similar testing  in order to determine their levels of reliability and accuracy. If agencies do  not fully understand the implications of the variation in accuracy among  the biometric vendors, the security of government facilities could be  compromised and interoperability between agencies could be hindered."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incomplete Guidance Regarding the Applicability of FIPS 201 to Facilities, People, and Information Systems", "paragraphs": ["FIPS 201 and OMB\u2019s related guidance provide broad and general criteria  regarding the facilities, people, and information systems that are subject to  the provisions of FIPS 201. For instance, according to FIPS 201, compliant  identification credentials must be issued to all federal employees and  contractors who require physical access to federally controlled facilities\u2014 including both federally owned buildings and leased space\u2014and logical  access to federally controlled information systems. OMB guidance adds  that agencies should make risk-based decisions on how to apply FIPS 201  requirements to individuals and information systems that do not fit clearly  into the specified categories. For example, OMB guidance states that  applicability of FIPS 201 for access to federal systems from a nonfederally  controlled facility (such as a researcher uploading data through a secure  Web site or a contractor accessing a government system from its own  facility) should be based on a risk determination made by following NIST  guidance on security categorizations for federal information and  information systems (FIPS 199).", "Although this guidance provides general direction, it does not provide  sufficient specificity regarding when and how to apply the standard. For  example, OMB\u2019s guidance does not explain how NIST\u2019s security categories  can be used to assess types of individuals accessing government systems.  FIPS 199 provides guidance only on how to determine the security risk  category of government information and information systems, not how  such a category relates to providing access from nonfederally controlled  facilities. As a result, agencies are unlikely to make consistent  determinations about when and how to apply the standard. HUD is one  example of an agency that has not been able to finalize how it would  implement FIPS 201, with regard to allowing access to federal information  systems from remote locations; and according to a HUD official, they are  considering multiple options.", "Further, the guidance does not address all categories of people who may  need physical and logical access to federal facilities and information  systems. Specifically, for individuals such as foreign nationals, volunteers,  and unpaid researchers, meeting some of the FIPS 201 requirements\u2014such  as conducting a standard background investigation\u2014may be difficult. For  example, Defense and NASA employ a significant number of foreign  nationals\u2014individuals who are not U.S. citizens and work outside the U.S.  foreign nationals generally cannot have their identity verified through the  standard NACI process. In order to conduct a NACI, an individual must  have lived in the United States long enough to have a traceable history,  which may not be the case for foreign nationals. According to NASA  officials, approximately 85 percent of NASA\u2019s staff at its Jet Propulsion  Laboratory are foreign nationals. However, OMB\u2019s guidance for such  individuals states only that agencies should conduct an \u201cequivalent  investigation,\u201d without providing any specifics that would ensure the  consistent treatment of such individuals.", "Specifically regarding foreign nationals, the Smart Card Interagency  Advisory Board (IAB) and OMB have recognized that FIPS 201 may not  adequately address this issue. The IAB obtained data from agencies who  hire foreign nationals to more specifically identify the issues with identity  proofing of foreign nationals. According to IAB representatives, these data  were provided to OMB. In addition, OMB indicated that they planned to  establish an interagency working group to assess whether additional  guidance is necessary concerning background investigations for foreign  nationals. However, no time frames have been set for issuing revised or  supplemental guidance regarding foreign nationals.", "In addition to foreign nationals, other types of workers also have not been  addressed. For example, Interior has approximately 200,000 individuals  that serve as volunteers, some of whom require access to facilities and  information systems. OMB\u2019s guidance provides no specifics on what  criteria to use to make a risk-based decision pertaining to access to  facilities and systems by volunteers.", "Moreover, the guidance is not clear on the extent to which FIPS 201 should  be implemented at all federal facilities. While the standard provides for a  range of identity authentication assurance levels based on the degree of  confidence in the identity of cardholders, it does not provide guidance on  establishing risk levels for specific facilities or how to implement FIPS 201  based on an assessment of the risks associated with facilities. Therefore,  agencies such as HUD, which has 21 field offices with five or fewer  employees, and Interior, which has 2,400 field offices, many of which are  also quite small, do not have the guidance necessary to make decisions  consistently about how to implement FIPS 201 at each of their facilities.  Depending on how risks are assessed, to implement a FIPS 201 compliant  access control system at each facility could represent a significant  expense, including possibly acquiring and installing card readers, network  infrastructure, biometric hardware and software. As of November 2005,  OMB officials reported no specific plans to supplement or revise its FIPS  201 implementation guidance to address these issues.", "Without more specific and complete guidance on the scope of  implementing FIPS 201 regarding individuals, facilities, and information  systems, the objectives of HSPD-12 could be compromised. For instance,  agencies could adopt varying and inconsistent approaches for identity  proofing and issuing PIV cards to foreign nationals and volunteers needing  physical and logical access to their facilities and information systems, thus  undermining the objective of FIPS 201 to establish consistent processes  across the government. Variations from the standard could also pose  problems within each agency. Specifically, if agencies choose to make  exceptions to implementing FIPS 201 requirements for specific categories  of individuals, information systems, or facilities, such exceptions could  undermine the security objectives of the agency\u2019s overall FIPS 201  implementation.

However, as agencies  continue to move forward with implementing FIPS 201, we believe that in  order for OMB to successfully monitor agencies\u2019 progress, it will be  essential for OMB to develop a process specifically for agencies to report  on their progress toward implementing the standard.", "Regarding our recommendation to OMB to amend or supplement  government wide policy guidance regarding compliance with the HSPD-12  standard, OMB stated that it did not think that its guidance was incomplete.  Officials stated that their guidance provides the appropriate balance  between the need to aggressively implement the President\u2019s deadlines,  while ensuring agencies have the flexibility to implement HSPD-12, based  on the level of risk their facilities and information systems present. While  we agree that it is important for agencies to have flexibility in implementing  the standard based on their specific circumstances, we believe that OMB  has not provided agencies with adequate guidance in order for them to  make well-informed, risk-based decisions about when and how to apply the  standard for important categories of individuals and facilities that affect  multiple agencies. For example, while multiple agencies employ foreign  nationals to work at their facilities, OMB does not provide guidance on how  agencies should investigate these foreign nationals prior to allowing them  to access U.S. government facilities and information systems. Similarly,  several agencies maintain very small facilities, yet OMB does not provide  guidance on the extent to which FIPS 201 should be applied at these  facilities. In addition, guidance has not been provided on assessing risks  associated with the variation in the reliability and accuracy among  biometric products, so that agencies can select vendors that best meet their  needs while maintaining interoperability across the government.", "Additionally, OMB indicated that at this time, they do not have a full  understanding of whether interoperability among the transitional and end- point specifications is a concern and stated that it can not comment on our  recommendation to specify the time frame for when agencies  implementing transitional smart card systems are to implement the end- point specification. However, our review showed that these two  specifications are not interoperable and, until all agencies implement the  end-state specification the interoperability objective of HSPD-12 may not  be achieved.", "In commenting on our report, GSA stated that they agreed with our  findings, conclusions, and recommendations. In addition, it provided us  with technical comments that we incorporated as appropriate. It also  suggested that in order to fully demonstrate the scope and scale of  implementing HSPD-12 and FIPS 201 that we provide, as background, the  current state of identity management systems across the government and  industry and the impact of compliance with HSPD-12. We believe that we  have adequately explained the benefits of using smart card-based ID  systems and have outlined several of the significant requirements that  agencies must implement as part of their new PIV systems.", "In Commerce\u2019s written comments, it stated that our report was fair and  balanced.
