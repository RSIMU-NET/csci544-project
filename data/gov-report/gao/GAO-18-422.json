As of March 2018, DOD reports 18 recommendations as having been implemented and 17 as having actions under way to implement them. These actions are part of a broader effort to improve biosafety, biosecurity, and overall program management. For example, in March 2016, DOD established the Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT) Biorisk Program Office to assist in overseeing the BSAT Biosafety and Biosecurity Program and implementation of the recommendations.

Further, the EARO has established a  BSAT Biorisk and Scientific Review Panel to review and assess biosafety  and biosecurity concerns associated with new and existing procedures  conducted at DOD BSAT laboratories and to provide recommendations to  the EARO on their acceptability for use to enhance biosafety and  biosecurity across the DOD BSAT programs.", "To provide additional insights into DOD\u2019s actions to make safety  improvements and to better understand the effects of those actions on  laboratory staff and operations following the 2015 incident at Dugway  Proving Ground, we conducted facilitated discussions with a non- generalizable sample of supervisory and non-supervisory staff at the six  DOD laboratories that handled BSAT. We used these facilitated  discussions to obtain the views of those laboratory staff who have and will  be implementing key biosafety and biosecurity actions from multiple  sources. Appendix VI presents selected comments, organized by key  themes, from laboratory staff at DOD facilities that handle BSAT in  response to actions taken by DOD following the 2015 incident at Dugway  Proving Ground. We heard a broad range of views on the effects of the  Dugway incidents as well as the effects of subsequent actions to improve  the BSAT Biosafety and Biosecurity Program. For example, some  individuals were concerned about the effect of administrative  requirements on the efficiency of their work, while others believed that the  organizational changes made by the Army have improved communication  and coordination. We did not validate any of the views expressed to us,  but they may be of value to BBPO and officials throughout the BSAT  enterprise in considering both how their program efforts are perceived  and how best to carry them out."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BBPO Has Not Completed a Strategy and Implementation Plan to Assist the Program in the Long Term", "paragraphs": ["BBPO has begun to develop a draft concept plan to establish roles and  responsibilities for the BSAT Biosafety and Biosecurity Program.

BBPO\u2019s draft concept plan  identified manpower and funding requirements for the BSAT Biorisk  Program Office but did not go further in laying out a strategy and  implementation plan. According to BBPO officials, BBPO currently is  relying on DOD Instruction 5210.88 as overarching guidance for  managing BSAT biosecurity operations and bringing DOD into  compliance with Executive Order 13546, Optimizing the Security of  Biological Select Agents and Toxins in the United States, and select  agent regulations. BBPO also relies on DOD Manual 6055.18-M for  managing DOD BSAT biosafety operations. In addition, DOD is in the  process of drafting an overarching directive for the combined DOD BSAT  Biosafety and Biosecurity Program that will be based on DOD Instruction  5210.88 and DOD Manual 6055.18-M. According to BBPO officials,  BBPO plans to develop a multi-service policy to consolidate biosafety and  biosecurity initiatives for combined biorisk management and replace Army  Directive 2016-24 once the Army has fully implemented its directive.

For example,  strategic planning is a valuable tool for communicating a vision for the  future and should include goals and objectives that align with resources  and guide decision making to accomplish priorities and improve  outcomes. An overall strategy would also help to prioritize funding;  accomplish priorities to improve outcomes; and coordinate biosafety and  biosecurity protocols, practices, and procedures to achieve harmonization  across the military services and the DOD BSAT enterprise. To  accomplish these things, a strategy and implementation plan can include  such things as long-term goals, objectives, external factors that can affect  goals, use of metrics to gauge progress, and a time frame for completion.", "BBPO officials acknowledged that they need a strategy and  implementation plan for the BSAT Biosafety and Biosecurity Program.  They said that once they complete the concept plan, they will develop a  strategy that will include specific goals and tasks to support programmatic  efforts. They explained that they have not been able to develop a strategy  and implementation plan because BBPO still is organizing the office and  carrying out its other responsibilities while working toward obtaining  stakeholder support for the program.", "As DOD completes a concept plan for the program and turns its attention  to a strategy and implementation plan for the program over the long term,  BBPO has an opportunity to incorporate the following key elements  typically found in such strategies and implementation plans and specified  in OMB guidance: long-term goals, objectives, external factors that can  affect goals, use of metrics to gauge progress, evaluation of the plan to  monitor goals and objectives, and an overall time frame for completion of  the strategy and implementation plan. Without a strategy and  implementation plan, Dugway Proving Ground and DOD\u2019s currently  covered facilities may not be able to determine how to inform DOD\u2019s long- term planning efforts. In addition, components of the DOD BSAT  enterprise may remain unclear about the department\u2019s strategy to  harmonize BSAT operations to ensure safety, security, and  standardization of procedures throughout DOD\u2019s BSAT enterprise. A  strategy and implementation plan could also help ensure unity of  command among the military services to employ department-wide  policies and procedures for managing the biosafety and biosecurity of  BSAT.

This is important for preventing undue influence of test  and evaluation procedures on research and development procedures,  and vice versa. In April 2016, the Army issued General Order 2016-04 in  response to a recommendation from the Army\u2019s Biosafety Task Force,  which directed the transfer of the West Desert Test Center \u2013 Life  Sciences Division at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah, and its reassignment  to the U.S. Army Materiel Command-Research, Development and  Engineering Command \u2013 U.S. Army Edgewood Chemical Biological  Center at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. This transfer took place  in July 2016, and the former Life Sciences Division was subsequently  renamed the BioTesting Division.

The  memorandum also notes that the Research, Development and  Engineering Command will develop a mitigation strategy for  conflicts of interest when Edgewood Chemical Biological Center is  the developer and the BioTesting Division is the tester.", "In November 2017, Edgewood Chemical Biological Center  elevated the BioTesting Division from a branch to a division to  raise its visibility and alleviate concerns about independence  between the test and evaluation functions and the research and  development functions of Edgewood Chemical Biological Center.", "However, as of March 2018, the Army has not institutionalized measures,  such as policies, standard operating procedures, protocols, and roles and  responsibilities to ensure independence between the biological research  and development mission and the test and evaluation mission.  Specifically, the Army has not provided any measures beyond the  memorandum of agreement that acknowledged the potential for conflict of  interest, such as the conditions under which one or more officials\u2014even  without intent\u2014exercises undue influence of test and evaluation mission  procedures on research and development procedures. The Army also  recognizes the need for a mitigation strategy\u2014to ensure independence  between the biological research and development function and the test  and evaluation function that takes the transfer of command and control  into account. The memorandum of agreement does not contain, for  example, criteria that distinguish the mission requirements for operational  test and evaluation for the BioTesting Division from the mission  requirements for research and development, and risk management  guidelines to mitigate risks associated with potential conflicts of interest  between the Edgewood Chemical Biological Center research and development mission and the BioTesting Division\u2019s test and evaluation  mission.", "Army officials explained that a mitigation strategy has not been  developed\u2014and that there is no time frame for developing such a  strategy\u2014because there is no testing of BSAT materials under way at the  BioTesting Division, since its BSAT registration has been withdrawn.  According to Army officials, this condition could last for at least 1 to   2 years. While a mitigation strategy to prevent potential conflict of interest  is envisioned by the memorandum of agreement, Edgewood Chemical  Biological Center officials currently are focused on re-registering the  BioTesting Division with the Federal Select Agent Program and bringing it  back up to full operational capability. A senior official at Edgewood  Chemical Biological Center acknowledged that the risk to independence  between Edgewood Chemical Biological Center and the BioTesting  Division is an issue that remains unresolved and there are currently no  measures in place to prevent potential conflict of interest.", "According to Army Regulation 73-1, Test and Evaluation: Test and  Evaluation Policy, independence is important to ensure that the decision  maker is provided with, for example, unbiased, objective advice about the  status of the development of a system. In addition, as we have reported,  independence between research and development functions and test and  evaluation functions is key to the effectiveness of operational test and  evaluation. We have reported long-standing conflicts between the  research and development mission and the test and evaluation mission  when there is a lack of independence, including (1) how many and what  types of tests to conduct; (2) when testing should occur; (3) what data to  collect, how to collect it, and how best to analyze it; and (4) what  conclusions are supportable given the analysis and the limitations of the  test program.", "One example where the Army considered a potential conflict of interest  was between the Army Test and Evaluation Command\u2019s chemical test  and evaluation mission and Edgewood Chemical Biological Center\u2019s  chemical research and development mission. Specifically, Army Directive 2016-24 directed the Army Test and Evaluation Command to conduct a  separate evaluation to determine whether to transfer the \u201cremaining  elements,\u201d that is, the chemical mission, from West Desert Test Center to  Edgewood Chemical Biological Center. Officials from the Army Test and  Evaluation Command stated that after developing alternative courses of  action, they decided\u2014in contrast to their decision on the biological  mission\u2014to keep the chemical mission under the Army Test and  Evaluation Command rather than transferring it to the Edgewood  Chemical Biological Center. According to officials at the Army Test and  Evaluation Command, the transfer of operational command and control of  their chemical mission could create an independence issue by placing the  chemical test and evaluation function within the same command as the  research and development function. The chemical mission represents a  major operational command and control element of the Army Test and  Evaluation Command.", "Without measures in place to preserve independence\u2014such as criteria  that establish mission requirements for operational test and evaluation for  the BioTesting Division or risk management guidelines\u2014there is a  potential risk to the independence of the testing and evaluation mission  conducted by the BioTesting Division. For example, the BioTesting  Division might be compelled to prioritize the testing of Edgewood  Chemical Biological Center products over those of other DOD and non- DOD customers. Officials in the Army Test and Evaluation Command  stated that the transfer of the biological test and evaluation mission may  increase the complexity of the evaluation mission by requiring additional  coordination. Furthermore, the BioTesting Division\u2019s procedures on  particular efforts could be influenced, resulting in test and evaluation that  may not be objective or reliable.

CBDP  officials stated that they continually look for opportunities to partner with  industry on production. CBDP officials told us that they plan to determine  if there are opportunities to partner with industry after the CBDP  Enterprise-wide study effort is completed. In the meantime, officials  highlighted that the Army\u2019s Defense Biological Product Assurance Office  within the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological  Defense\u2014formerly known as the Critical Reagents Program\u2014has taken  action to study its office\u2019s BSAT-related commercial product line, which  has resulted in the office divesting itself of inactivated BSAT materials.", "Regarding the third required task, the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017  required DOD to study whether BSAT production operations should be  transferred to another government or commercial laboratory that might be  better suited to produce BSAT for non-DOD customers. DOD reported  that it has taken steps to support a future decision on this issue and,  according to DOD officials, once it has completed the CBDP Enterprise- wide study of infrastructure capabilities and capacity, it will determine  whether the BSAT community needs to transfer any part of its production  to another entity. With regard to the production of BSAT for non-DOD  customers, Army officials stated that when the BioTesting Division at  Dugway Proving Ground becomes fully operational and re-registers with  the Federal Select Agent Program in fiscal year 2019, it will no longer be  producing and shipping BSAT to non-DOD customers. The Army took  steps to address the issue prior to the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017.  Specifically, in August 2015, the Army established a Biosafety Task Force  working group that examined, among other things, DOD\u2019s covered  facilities and options for locations for producing BSAT. Subsequently, in  February 2016, the Army recommended that additional analysis be  conducted before any decision is made to change the current BSAT  laboratory infrastructure.

Assays are based on measurable parameters that allow  differentiation between sample and control.  biodefense: Prevention, protection against, and mitigations for biological  threats that could have catastrophic consequences to the nation.  biological agent: Microorganism (or derived toxin) that causes disease  in humans, animals, or plants.  biological weapon: A harmful biological agent used as a weapon to  cause death or disease usually on a large scale.  biorisk management: The effective management of risks posed by  working with infectious agents and toxins in laboratories; it includes a  range of practices and procedures to ensure the biosecurity, biosafety,  and biocontainment of those infectious agents and toxins.  biosafety: The combination of practices, procedures, and equipment that  protect laboratory workers, the public, and the environment from the  infectious agents and toxins used in the laboratory.  biosecurity: The measures taken to protect infectious agents and toxins  from loss, theft, or misuse.  biotechnology: The manipulation of living organisms or their  components to produce useful usually commercial products.  biological select agents and toxins certified personnel: Personnel  certified and cleared to work with biological select agents and toxins.  covered facility: Any facility of the Department of Defense that produces  biological select agents and toxins.  decontamination: The removal or count reduction of contaminating  pathogens present on an object.", "Federal Select Agent Program: A regulatory program established to  regulate the possession, use, and transfer of biological select agents and  toxins.  high-containment laboratory: Biosafety level (BSL)-3 or 4 facilities in  which studies are conducted on a variety of dangerous pathogens and  toxins.  inactivation: A procedure to render pathogens as non-toxic while  retaining characteristics of interest for future use.  irradiation: A process by which radiation (e.g., ultraviolet light, gamma  rays, and X-rays) is used.  nonviable: A pathogen that is no longer capable of growing, replicating,  infecting, or causing disease.  protocol: A detailed plan for a scientific procedure.  select agent: A biological agent or toxin that (1) potentially poses a  severe threat to public health and safety, animal or plant health, or animal  or plant products and (2) is regulated by select agent rules for  possession, use, and transfer (7 C.F.R. Part 331 (2018), 9 C.F.R. Part  121 (2018), and 42 C.F.R. Part 73 (2018)).  toxin: The toxic material or product of plants, animals, microorganisms  (including, but not limited to, bacteria, viruses, fungi, or protozoa), or  infectious substances, or a recombinant or synthesized molecule,  whatever their origin and method of production, and includes (1) any  poisonous substance or biological product that may be engineered as a  result of biotechnology produced by a living organism or (2) any  poisonous isomer or biological product, homolog, or derivative of such a  substance.  ultracentrifuge: A high-speed centrifuge able to separate colloidal and  other small particles and used especially in determining the sizes of such  particles or the molecular weights of large molecules.  validation: For the purpose of inactivation methods, the method must be  scientifically sound and produce consistent results each time it is used  such that the expected result can be ensured. Methods of validation may  include (1) use of the exact conditions of a commonly accepted method  that has been validated, (2) a published method with adherence to the  exact published conditions, or (3) for in-house methods, validation testing  should include the specific conditions used and appropriate controls (from  the Federal Select Agent Program).  validated inactivation procedure: A procedure to render a select agent  non-viable but which allows the select agent to retain characteristics of  interest for future use; or to render any nucleic acids that can produce  infectious forms of any select agent virus non-infectious for future use.  The efficacy of the procedure is confirmed by demonstrating the material  is free of all viable select agents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["DOD Personnel: Further Actions Needed to Strengthen Oversight and  Coordination of Defense Laboratories\u2019 Hiring Efforts.
