When awarding IRRF-funded contracts for $5 million or more noncompetitively, agencies are required by statute to provide notification and justification to Congress. In June 2004, GAO found that agencies generally complied with laws and regulations governing competition to award new contracts, but did not always comply with competition requirements when issuing task orders under existing contracts. As mandated by Congress, this report (1) describes the extent of competition in Iraq reconstruction contracts awarded by DOD, USAID, and State since October 1, 2003, based on available data, and (2) assesses whether these agencies followed applicable documentation and congressional notification requirements regarding competition for 51 judgmentally selected Iraq reconstruction contract actions.

Based on competition information we obtained on $10 billion of the total $11.6 billion in IRRF obligations by these agencies during the period of our review, we found that about $9.1 billion--or 91 percent--was for competitively awarded contracts. While our ability to obtain complete competition data for all DOD Iraq reconstruction contract actions was limited because not all DOD components consistently tracked or fully reported this information, we obtained information on approximately $7 billion, or 82 percent, of DOD's total Iraq reconstruction contract obligations, and of this, we found that competition occurred for nearly all of the obligations. Additionally, based on complete data for the period of our review we found that USAID competitively awarded contract actions for 99 percent of its obligations, while State awarded contract actions competitively for only 10 percent of its obligations. GAO reviewed the files for 51 contract actions totaling $1.55 billion--22 of which were awarded noncompetitively and 29 of which were awarded competitively--almost all of which contained proper documentation. One contract file--for a noncompetitively awarded task order issued by State--did not contain justifications or other required documentation. DOD was also unable to provide documentation for 4 of the competitively awarded contract actions. Of the 22 noncompeted contract actions in GAO's review, State should have notified Congress of 2 actions awarded using other than full and open competition in accordance with notification requirements but did not.

These funds\u2014referred to as IRRF I\u2014were to be used by USAID,  State, DOD, Treasury, and Health and Human Services for a broad range of  humanitarian and reconstruction efforts.

This appropriation\u2014referred to as IRRF II\u2014focused on security and  infrastructure, and the funding was allocated across multiple sectors.  Additionally, the November 2003 act required that full and open  competition be used to enter into contracts using IRRF funds unless the  use of an authorized statutory exception was properly documented and  approved, and the specified congressional committees notified. As of  August 29, 2006, about 94 percent, or approximately $20 billion, of all IRRF  funds had been obligated by all agencies.", "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 (CICA) generally requires that  federal contracts be awarded on the basis of full and open competition.  This process is intended to permit the government to rely on competitive  market forces to obtain needed goods and services at fair and reasonable  prices. However, the law and implementing regulations recognize that  there may be circumstances under which full and open competition would  be impracticable, such as when contracts need to be awarded quickly to  respond to urgent needs or when there is only one source for the required  product or service. In such cases, agencies are given authority by law to  award contracts without providing for full and open competition (e.g.,  using limited competition or on a sole-source basis), provided that the  proposed approach is appropriately justified, approved, and documented.  Additionally, regarding task orders issued under an existing contract, the  competition law does not require competition beyond that obtained for the  initial contract award, provided the task order does not increase the scope  of the work, period of performance, or maximum value of the contract  under which the order is issued."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Vast Majority of Reported Contract Obligations Were for Competitive Awards", "paragraphs": ["While no single, comprehensive system currently tracks governmentwide  Iraq reconstruction contract data, we obtained competition information on  $10 billion of the total $11.6 billion in obligations for Iraq reconstruction  contracts collectively awarded by DOD, USAID, and State from October 1,  2003, through March 31, 2006, and found that about $9.1 billion, or 91  percent, of the obligations was for competitive awards.

For example, the JCC-I/A  and its predecessor organizations did not fully input detailed, individual  contract action information into DOD-wide systems including DD 350,  which would provide information on competition.
