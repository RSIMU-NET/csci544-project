At that time, GAO also offered recommendations for improvements. OCS has responded that it intends to take actions to address each of those recommendations. In addition, GAO found that OCS did not routinely collect key information, such as results of state monitoring reports, or systematically use available information, such as state performance data, to assess the states' CSBG management risks and target monitoring efforts to states with the highest risk. All five states we visited conducted on-site monitoring of local agencies with varying frequency and performed additional oversight efforts. Two state offices visited each local agency at least once between 2003 and 2005, while the other three states visited local agencies less frequently. State officials we visited had different views on what they must do to meet the statutory requirement to visit local agencies at least once during each 3-year period, and OCS has not issued guidance interpreting this requirement. Officials in all five states also provided oversight in addition to monitoring through such activities as reviewing reports and coordinating with other federal and state programs. OCS targeted some training and technical assistance funds to local grantees with financial or management problems, but information on the results of this assistance is limited. In fiscal years 2002 through 2005, OCS designated between $666,000 and $1 million of its annual $10 million training and technical assistance funds to local agencies with problems, but had no process for strategically allocating these funds to areas of greatest need.

A key feature  of Community Action was the direct involvement of low-income people in  the design and administration of antipoverty activities through mandatory  representation on local agency governing boards. The federal government  had direct oversight of local agencies until 1981, when Congress created  CSBG and designated states as the primary recipients.

OCS divided its annual $10 million training and  technical assistance funds among program support, contracts, and grants.  The Deputy Director of OCS told us that program support funds paid  salaries and expenses for OCS officials that manage CSBG grants, and  contract funds paid for costs associated with logistics such as outreach  and meeting with grantees, costs related to a management information  system, and costs related to grant competitions. Training and technical  assistance grants may be used for a variety of purposes, and OCS allocated  these funds to support different types of activities each year. For example,  OCS frequently funded activities such as supporting the implementation of  ROMA, encouraging agencies to share innovative ideas, and providing  program and management training opportunities for community action  professionals. OCS designated between $666,000 and $1 million of annual  training and technical assistance grants to assist local agencies with  problems through two grant programs: Special State Technical Assistance  Grants and the Peer-to-Peer Technical Assistance and Crisis Aversion  Intervention Grants. These grants were commonly used to address to  management, financial, and board governance problems at local agencies.  Table 3 shows the allocation of CSBG funding for grants, contracts, and  program support.", "Despite a congressional recommendation, OCS officials told us there is no  process in place to strategically allocate its approximately $10 million in  training and technical assistance funds among program areas. OCS drafted  a strategic plan for allocating its training and technical assistance funds\u2014 an action directed by congressional conferees in the fiscal year 2005  Consolidated Appropriations Act conference report\u2014but did not  implement the plan. The federal CSBG director told us that OCS did not  implement the strategic plan because the President\u2019s recent budget  proposals did not include funding for CSBG, although Congress has  continued to provide funding for the program. The federal CSBG director  also told us that the draft plan focused resources on such areas as  financial integrity and management, leadership enhancement, and data  collection.", "The federal CSBG director also told us that OCS currently allocates  training and technical assistance funds based on input from some state  and local agencies, but this process was not guided by a systematic  assessment of state and local needs and did not involve guidance or  specifications on the actual amounts that should be awarded for activities.  Specifically, OCS sought input each year from the Monitoring and  Assessment Taskforce\u2014a group made up of some state and local CSBG  officials and national CSBG associations such as the National Association  of State Community Service Programs (NASCSP)\u2014to generate a list of  priority activities. OCS then presented this list at national community  action conferences, such as those sponsored by NASCSP or the  Community Action Partnership, for additional comments.

OCS\u2019s guidance to training and technical  assistance grantees recommends that the grantees report whether  activities are completed but does not include a requirement to report on  outcomes. Further, HHS\u2019s guidance on discretionary grant reporting,  which covers CSBG training and technical assistance grants, does not  specify what information program offices should collect on performance  and outcomes. We also spoke with officials in HHS\u2019s Office of Inspector  General who mentioned that on the basis of prior reviews the office had  some concerns about the administration of CSBG discretionary grants.  Specifically, these officials had concerns about the completeness and  accuracy of progress reports and whether grantees were meeting their  goals.", "Officials involved in efforts to use grants to assist agencies gave mixed  reviews on the effectiveness of activities funded by these grants. State and  local officials in Texas and Missouri spoke highly of their interaction with  MICA to assist agencies with problems. State officials in Texas said they  had used an SSTA grant to assist two local agencies and had hired MICA  as the contractor to provide the assistance. Texas officials were pleased  with the assistance that MICA provided and said that the state did not have  the resources to provide the kind of long-term, on-site assistance that  MICA offered. Missouri officials told us that all five local agencies that the  state had contracted with MICA to work with had benefited from MICA\u2019s  expertise, particularly with regard to financial matters. Like Texas, the  Missouri office also used SSTA grants to provide assistance to four of  these agencies. In contrast, we also spoke to national, regional, and state  community action association officials who said they had worked with  local agencies that received assistance from MICA and had concerns about  MICA\u2019s work. Specifically, they told us that MICA was not always effective  in resolving local agencies\u2019 problems, did not use money efficiently, and  had an apparent conflict of interest stemming from its practice of  conducting agency assessments and offering services to correct problems  those assessments identify. For example, an Ohio official who managed a  local agency\u2019s contract told us that even with 6 months of paid assistance  from MICA, the local agency had closed. In response to these criticisms, a  MICA official said that some problems at local agencies were too severe  for them to address and that MICA tries to be transparent about its costs  by issuing a detailed proposal before starting work with an agency.

Specifically, OCS does not fully use the data it  collects and does not collect other key information on state oversight  efforts and the outcomes of training and technical assistance grants that  could enhance its oversight capabilities. Additionally, OCS has not issued  guidance for how often states should visit local agencies. Thus, OCS  cannot determine where program risks exist or effectively target its  limited resources to where they would be most useful.

In addition, we  obtained and reviewed available information on OCS monitoring policies  and procedures; documentation of federal monitoring visits of states  conducted during fiscal years 2003 through 2005; other information OCS  collects from states, including state applications and performance data;  and guidance issued by OCS to communicate program-related information,  concerns, and priorities to grantees to assess OCS\u2019s compliance with laws  and standards. We also reviewed available Single Audit data for local  agencies and grouped them by state to assess the percentage of local  agencies with Single Audit findings at both the national and state levels  reported in fiscal years 2002 and 2003, the most recent years for which  information was available. The scope of this review included the District  of Columbia and Puerto Rico as well as the 50 states. We assessed the  reliability of Single Audit data by performing electronic and manual data  testing to assess whether the data were complete and accurate. We also  assessed the reliability of CSBG statistical data by interviewing officials  knowledgeable about data collection and maintenance. We determined  that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. In  addition, we interviewed federal officials with Head Start, the Low-Income  Home Energy Assistance Program, and the Community Development  Block Grant program, which also distribute funds to local agencies, to  learn whether officials from these programs shared information with  CSBG officials to support oversight efforts.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed federal laws and standards  to obtain information on states\u2019 CSBG oversight responsibilities and  conducted site visits.", "We visited five states, Illinois, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Texas, and  Washington, that were selected using several criteria including grant  amounts, number of local agencies, state administrative structure, and  analysis of Single Audit results among local agencies.
