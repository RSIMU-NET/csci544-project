Although any criminal justice system faces coordination challenges, the unique structure and funding of the District of Columbia (D.C.) criminal justice system, in which federal and D.C. jurisdictional boundaries and dollars are blended, creates additional challenges. Almost every stage of D.C.'s criminal justice process presents such challenges, and participating agencies are sometimes reluctant to coordinate because the costs to implement needed changes may fall on one or more federally funded agencies, while any savings accrue to one or more D.C. funded agencies, or vice versa. The Criminal Justice Coordinating Council (CJCC) was established and staffed as an independent entity to improve systemwide coordination and cooperation. During its two and a half-year existence, CJCC has served as a useful, independent, discussion forum at a modest cost. It has had notable success in several areas in which agencies perceived a common interest, such as developing technology that permits greater information sharing. It has been less successful in other areas, such as papering, in which forging consensus on the need for and the parameters of change has been difficult. CJCC has achieved some successes at a modest cost and served as a useful, independent forum for discussing issues that affect multiple agencies.

Because of the large number of agencies involved, coordination among agencies is necessary for the process to function as efficiently as possible within the requirements of due process. That is, all involved agencies need to work together to ensure proper and efficient system operations, identify any problems that emerge, and decide how best to balance competing interests in resolving these problems. The unique structure and funding of D.C.\u2019s criminal justice system, in which federal and D.C. jurisdictional boundaries and dollars are blended, creates additional coordination challenges. The D.C. criminal justice system consists of four D.C. agencies principally funded through local D.C. funds, six federal agencies, and three D.C. agencies principally funded through federal appropriations. Seven of the 10 stages of D.C.\u2019s criminal justice system require coordination among agencies funded by different sources.", "The fiscal year 2000 District of Columbia Appropriations Act mandated that we conduct a study of the D.C. criminal justice system.

Council, Court Services, Pretrial Services, Corrections Trustee, Defender Service, U.S. Marshals Service, and the D.C. Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. We then compiled a list of potential issues. After discussing these potential issues with the committees of jurisdiction, it was agreed that we would rely on other studies for some issues, such as scheduling of cases in Superior Court and forensics, that were the subject of ongoing or recent reviews. We also excluded juvenile justice, an area that involved noncriminal justice agencies such as the D.C. Department of Human Services. However, as requested, we did develop a description of the juvenile justice case flow process (see app. VI). As a case study of coordination issues, we examined D.C.\u2019s method of processing cases from arrest through initial court appearance before Superior Court\u2014an area of concern for many D.C. criminal justice system officials. We compared this process to the methods used in Philadelphia and Boston. These cities were judgmentally selected because they were both large East Coast cities that had recently revised their methods of processing cases from arrest through initial court appearance.", "To assess the mechanisms that exist to coordinate the D.C. criminal justice system, we interviewed agency officials and reviewed agency organizational charts, policies, and procedures. To identify initiatives planned or under way to improve D.C.\u2019s criminal justice process, we requested that each CJCC member agency with responsibilities for adult offenders provide us with a list of initiatives, as of November 2000, and include the goal of each initiative, other participating agencies, the status of the initiative, and any results to date plus any planned or completed evaluations of each initiative.

Revitalization Act), as amended, made to D.C.\u2019s criminal justice system. The D.C. Revitalization Act brought a number of D.C. functions, such as sentenced felon incarceration and community supervision, that are normally the responsibility of states rather than cities or counties, under federal funding. Areas affected by the D.C. Revitalization Act included (1) Pretrial Services, (2) Defender Service, (3) Superior Court, (4) sentencing, (5) incarceration, and (6) offender community supervision and parole. Specifically, within the time schedule specified in the D.C. Revitalization Act, these changes included federally funding Superior Court, Pretrial Services, and Defender Service; transferring sentenced felons from D.C.\u2019s Lorton Correctional Complex to BOP custody and supervision; transferring responsibility for parole decisions from the D.C. Parole Board to the U.S. Parole Commission; and creating a new federal community supervision agency, Court Services, for those convicted of crimes in D.C. courts.", "Appendix III includes details on certain changes made by the D.C. Revitalization Act, as amended.", "In many ways, the structure of the D.C. criminal justice system is unique. For example:  Because of its status as the nation\u2019s capital, over 30 law enforcement agencies other than MPDC have a significant presence in D.C. These include the U.S. Capitol Police, the Federal Protective Service, the U.S. Secret Service, and the U.S. Park Police. These and other agencies may make arrests for crimes committed within D.C., and MPDC assists these other law enforcement agencies by performing functions such as fingerprinting, photographing, and housing arrestees prior to their initial court appearance.", "D.C. has two prosecutors for local crimes. USAO prosecutes felonies, such as homicide or armed robbery, and \u201cserious\u201d misdemeanor violations committed by adults in D.C. Examples of the types of misdemeanors prosecuted by USAO include petty theft, assault, weapon offenses, and narcotics possession. Corporation Counsel, a D.C. agency, prosecutes \u201cminor\u201d misdemeanor violations, such as drinking in public or disorderly conduct, in addition to criminal traffic offenses and offenses committed by children.", "The Criminal Division of Superior Court is responsible for processing matters that are in violation of the D.C. Code and some related U.S. Code provisions, and municipal and traffic regulations. USAO may, at its discretion, prosecute certain eligible criminal offenses in either Superior Court or U.S. District Court for D.C. In practice, however, USAO brings a large majority of criminal prosecutions in Superior Court. According to a D.C. USAO official, D.C. is the only jurisdiction in the United States in which USAO may prosecute crimes in both local and federal courts.  Only in D.C. does BOP assume responsibility for all felony offenders sentenced to prison terms in local (i.e., state, county, and city) courts.", "The D.C. criminal justice system also has different case flow processes for handling arrestees, depending on which agency is prosecuting the case and the status of the arrestee.

Its different sources of funding, reporting structures, and organizational perspectives have complicated the task of coordinating systemwide activities, reaching agreement on the nature of systemwide problems, and taking a coordinated approach to addressing any problem areas that balances competing institutional interests. One reason for this is that the costs of coordinating activities and corrective actions may fall on one or more federally funded agencies, while any savings may accrue to one or more D.C. funded agencies, or vice versa. In the absence of a single hierarchy and funding structure, agencies have generally acted in their own interests rather than in the interest of the system as a whole.", "Typically, federal and nonfederal criminal justice systems include the following stages: (1) arrest and booking, (2) charging, (3) initial court appearance, (4) release decision, (5) preliminary hearing, (6) indictment, (7) arraignment, (8) trial, (9) sentencing, and (10) correctional supervision. Most stages require the participation of several agencies which need to coordinate their activities for the system to operate efficiently while also meeting the requirements of due process. That is, all involved agencies need to work together to ensure that their roles and operations mesh well with those of other agencies, and to identify any problems that emerge and decide how best to resolve them.", "Table 2 shows the stages in D.C.\u2019s criminal justice system and the agencies that participate in each stage. As shown in the table, 7 of the 10 stages typically involve multiple agencies with different sources of funding, which results in different reporting structures and different oversight entities. For example, as many as six agencies\u2014one D.C. (MPDC), three federal (USAO, U.S. Marshals Service, and Pretrial Services), and two federally funded D.C. agencies (Superior Court and Defender Service)\u2014 need to coordinate their activities before the arrestee\u2019s initial court appearance for a felony offense can occur.

At any stage, the participation of other agencies might also be required. In addition, the reporting and funding structure for these participating agencies often differs. For example, USAO, the U.S. Marshals Service, BOP, and the U.S. Parole Commission ultimately report to the U.S. Attorney General and are funded by the appropriations subcommittee that funds the Department of Justice; MPDC and Corporation Counsel ultimately report to the D.C.

One reason for this reluctance is that some actions that could help achieve greater systemwide efficiency might not benefit each agency equally, and in fact could benefit one agency at the expense of another. As a result, agreement on actions to benefit systemwide efficiency has been slow.", "Through discussions with D.C. criminal justice officials and our own analysis, we identified many examples where coordination lapses have hindered system operations. In some cases, the problem has been identified and a coordinated approach to resolving the problem is under way. In other cases, the problems persist. To better illustrate the coordination problem, in the following sections we highlight the issues surrounding four problem areas, as well as any corrective actions planned or under way.

As noted in table 2, MPDC, prosecutors, Defender Service, U.S. Marshals Service, Pretrial Services, Court Services, and Superior Court could be involved in the court-related processing of a case from the preliminary hearing to the trial and subsequent sentencing. Representatives from several of these different agencies are typically required to be present at court trials and hearings. Because specific court times are not established, individuals who are expected to appear in court are required to be present when the court first convenes in the morning. These individuals might be required to wait at the courthouse for some period of time for the case to be called, if (1) more trials or hearings are scheduled than can be conducted, (2) any one of the involved individuals is not present or prepared, or (3) the case is continued for any number of reasons. MPDC recorded that during calendar year 1999 its officers spent 118 full-time staff years in court- related activities such as preliminary hearings and trials. While MPDC officials stated that officers often spent many hours at court waiting for cases to be called, data were not available on the proportion of the 118 full-time staff years that were attributable to actual court time compared to the time spent waiting for cases to be called, including cases that were rescheduled.", "CJCC selected the Council for Court Excellence and the Justice Management Institute to conduct a detailed study of criminal justice resource management issues, with particular emphasis on court case processing and the utilization of police resources. In its March 2001 report, the Council for Court Excellence and the Justice Management Institute concluded that major changes were needed in the D.C. criminal justice caseflow system to improve the system\u2019s efficiency. Among other things, the report found inefficiencies and counterproductive policies at every stage in case processing. The report also concluded that little use was being made of modern technology in the arrest, booking, papering, and court process that could improve system operations. The Council for Court Excellence and the Justice Management Institute determined that an unnecessarily large number of police officers were notified to appear for prosecutorial and court-related proceedings. The Council for Court Excellence and Justice Management Institute found that during September 2000 an average of 670 MPDC officers a day appeared for these proceedings, costing MPDC approximately $823,000 in overtime costs.", "The Council for Court Excellence and the Justice Management Institute identified priority areas for system improvements, such as redesigning court procedures in misdemeanor cases, improving the methods used to process cases from arrest through initial court appearance by automating the involved processes, and improving the systems used to notify police officers about court dates. Congress provided $1 million for fiscal year 2001 to implement some of the recommended case management initiatives, such as a differentiated case management system for misdemeanors and traffic offenses, the papering pilot project between MPDC and Corporation Counsel, and a mental health pilot treatment project for appropriate, nonviolent pretrial release defendants in coordination with the D.C.

These systems are not linked in a manner that permits timely and useful information sharing among disparate agencies. For example, as the information systems are currently maintained, it is very difficult to obtain data to determine the annual amount of time MPDC officers spend meeting with prosecutors about cases in which prosecutors eventually decide not to file charges against the arrestee. We determined that such an analysis would require data about: (1) MPDC arrests, (2) MPDC officer time and attendance, (3) charges filed by USAO or Corporation Counsel, and (4) Superior Court case dispositions. All of this information is currently maintained in separate systems with no reliable tracking number that could be used to link the information in each system for a specific case and no systematic exchange of information. This lack of shared information diminishes the effectiveness of the entire criminal justice system. For example, according to a CJCC official, there is no immediate way for an arresting officer to determine whether an arrestee is on parole, or for an arrestee\u2019s community supervision officer to know that the parolee had been arrested. Such information could affect both the charging decision and the decision whether or not to release an arrestee from an MPDC holding cell.", "In 1999, CJCC attempted to address problems with D.C. criminal justice information systems by preparing, among other things, an Information Technology Interagency Agreement that was adopted by CJCC members. The agreement recognized the need for immediate improvement of information technology in the D.C. criminal justice system and established the Information Technology Advisory Committee (ITAC) to serve as the governing body for justice information system development. ITAC recognized that it was difficult for a single agency involved in the criminal justice system to access information systems maintained by other agencies, and pursued developing a system that would allow an agency to share information with all other criminal justice agencies, while maintaining control over its own system. ITAC devised a District of Columbia Justice Information System (JUSTIS).", "In July 2000, CJCC partnered with the D.C. Office of the Chief Technology Officer in contracting with a consulting firm to design JUSTIS based on modern dedicated intranet and Web browser technology. On August 31, 2000, the consulting firm delivered to CJCC and the D.C. Office of the Chief Technology Officer a draft version of a blueprint for a finalized JUSTIS. When completed, JUSTIS is to allow each agency to maintain its current information system, while allowing the agency to access selected data from other criminal justice agencies.", "Initially, Court Services, Pretrial Services, and MPDC will pilot JUSTIS by allowing a portion of each agency\u2019s data to be shared with other D.C. criminal justice system agencies. The initial operation is to be evaluated and changes can be made before the JUSTIS model is finalized. According to a CJCC official, after any necessary modifications are complete, ITAC plans to implement JUSTIS throughout the D.C. criminal justice system. While JUSTIS, if implemented, would allow D.C. criminal justice agencies to share data, it would not assure the quality of data that was being shared. For example, if an arrestee\u2019s name and/or social security number are entered incorrectly into the system, the corresponding data would be inaccurate.", "In addition to the JUSTIS project, CJCC\u2019s Data Group, composed of representatives of nine agencies involved in the D.C. criminal justice system, has outlined a program to implement a unique fingerprint- supported tracking number in the system. A unique identifier will be assigned upon the initiation of case processing to ensure that all entries related to a particular case\u2014from arrest through disposition of those charges, and corrections actions in response to those charges\u2014are linked. The unique identifier can ensure that each case is properly linked to an individual\u2019s criminal history record. The goal is to store the information linked through the tracking number in a central D.C. criminal justice repository.

Jail or one of several halfway houses in D.C.; (4) BOP, which supervises felons incarcerated in federal prisons; (5) the U.S. Parole Commission, which determines the prison release date and conditions of release for D.C. inmates eligible for parole;and (6) the U.S. Marshals Service, which transports prisoners.", "Gaps in coordination among agencies may lead to tragic consequences, such as those that occurred in the case of Leo Gonzales Wright, who committed two violent offenses while under the supervision of D.C.\u2019s criminal justice system. Wright, who was paroled in 1993 after serving nearly 17 years of a 15-to-60 year sentence for armed robbery and second degree murder, was arrested in May 1995 for automobile theft charges, which were later dismissed. In June 1995, Wright was arrested for possession with intent to distribute cocaine. However, he was released pending trial for the drug arrest, due in part to miscommunication among agencies. Wright subsequently committed two carjackings, murdering one of his victims. He was convicted in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and is currently serving a life without parole sentence in federal prison at Leavenworth, KS.", "The outcry over the Wright case resulted in two studies, including a comprehensive review of the processing of Wright\u2019s case prepared for the U.S. Attorney General by the Corrections Trustee in October 1999. The report included 24 recommendations to help ensure that instances similar to the Wright case do not reoccur. In July 2000, the Corrections Trustee issued a progress report on the implementation of recommendations from the October 1999 report. According to the Corrections Trustee, while not all recommendations in the October 1999 report have been fully implemented, progress has been made in addressing a number of them. For example, with funds provided by the Corrections Trustee, DOC has purchased a new jail-management information system for tracking inmates and implemented a new policy on escorted inmate trips. In addition, in January 2000, the Corrections Trustee began convening monthly meetings of an Interagency Detention Work Group, whose membership largely parallels that of CJCC. The group, and its six subcommittees, have focused on such issues as the convicted felon designation and transfer process, and parole and halfway house processing.", "In addition to the studies and the actions of the Corrections Trustee, CJCC and Court Services are addressing the monitoring and supervision of offenders.

D.C. does not have a comprehensive forensic laboratory to complete forensic analysis for use by police and prosecutors. Instead, MPDC currently uses other organizations such as the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and a private laboratory to conduct much of its forensic work. MPDC performs some forensic functions such as crime scene response, firearms testing, and latent print analysis. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, a D.C. agency, performs autopsies and certain toxicological tests, such as the testing for the presence of drugs in the body. Coordination among agencies is particularly important because several organizations may be involved in handling and analyzing a piece of evidence. For example, if MPDC finds a gun with a bloody latent fingerprint at a crime scene, the gun would typically need to be examined by both MPDC and the FBI. In order to complete the analysis, multiple forensic disciplines (e.g., DNA or firearm examiners) would need to examine the gun. If the various forensic tests were coordinated in a multidisciplinary approach, examiners would be able to obtain the maximum information from the evidence without the possibility of contaminating it. Such contamination could adversely affect the adjudication and successful resolution of a criminal investigation.", "In April 2000, the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) issued a report on the D.C. criminal justice system\u2019s forensic capabilities. The report concluded that D.C. had limited forensic capacity and that limitations in MPDC prevented the effective collection, storage, and processing of crime scene evidence, which ultimately compromised the potential for successful resolution of cases. NIJ-identified deficiencies included, among other things: lengthy delays in processing evidence; ineffective communications in the collection, processing, and tracking of evidence from the crime scene; and ineffective communications between forensic case examiners and prosecutors.", "The NIJ report supported development of a centralized forensic laboratory that would be shared by MPDC and the D.C. Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. The report did not examine the costs to build a comprehensive forensic laboratory. We did not independently evaluate the costs and benefits of a comprehensive forensic laboratory. However, such a facility could potentially improve coordination by housing all forensic functions in one location, eliminating the need to transport evidence among multiple, dispersed locations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "A Coordination Case Study: The Initial Stages of Case Processing", "paragraphs": ["D.C.\u2019s unique structure has also led to coordination problems in the initial stages of case processing that occur from the time of arrest through initial court appearance.

As is true of all stages of D.C.\u2019s criminal justice process, the actions of each participating agency affect the other participants in the process. Appendix IV includes a description of D.C.\u2019s criminal justice process\u2014from arrest through sentencing\u2014for cases USAO prosecutes. Appendix VII contains a more detailed description of the process from arrest through initial court appearance. Here we discuss issues of police-prosecutor coordination during the charging process.", "Both USAO and Corporation Counsel require a police officer knowledgeable about the facts of an arrest to physically report to the prosecutor\u2019s office for papering. In D.C., papering is the stage of case processing at which officers present their arrest reports to a prosecutor and explain the circumstances of the arrest. For each arrest, prosecutors determine whether the case should be prosecuted (\u201cpaper\u201d the case) or not (\u201cno-paper\u201d the case). We focused our study on USAO cases because they are more numerous, typically more complicated, and require significantly more officer time. In 1998, USAO cases (felony and misdemeanor) constituted 64 percent of the criminal cases brought to Superior Court for disposition. In addition, the cases prosecuted by USAO accounted for 87 percent of the 47,810 police hours recorded for papering during 1999.", "As part of their duties, police officers in all jurisdictions generally must make appearances to provide information about cases at a number of criminal justice proceedings, including grand jury testimony, preliminary hearings, pretrial witness conferences, and trials. In addition to these appearances, USAO and Corporation Counsel prosecutors require that MPDC officers personally meet with prosecutors in order to make a charging decision for all cases. This requirement, particularly for misdemeanors, appears to be unusual. A 1997 Booz-Allen and Hamilton survey found that in 30 of 38 responding jurisdictions (51 were surveyed), police officers were not required to meet with prosecutors until court (i.e., trial), and in 3 cities officers were not required to appear in person until the preliminary hearing. Four cities required officers to meet with prosecutors on a case-dependent basis, and one city was in the process of changing its charging procedures. Corporation Counsel and MPDC have agreed to initiate a pilot project in March 2001 in which officers are not required to appear in person for 17 minor offenses. There is currently no similar pilot planned for misdemeanors prosecuted by USAO.", "According to USAO officials, the current papering process is critical for USAO to make an initial charging decision correctly. Making an initial charging decision correctly benefits (1) USAO by allowing them to more effectively prosecute \u201cgood\u201d cases; (2) arrestees by ensuring that individuals are not inappropriately charged with a crime; and (3) the criminal justice system by allowing USAO to weed out \u201cpoor\u201d cases, which would otherwise languish in the system consuming many agencies\u2019 resources. To ensure that it has all the information required for making informed charging decisions, USAO requires that officers appear in person to provide information about the arrest that may be missing from the arrest reports, inaccurate in the reports, or corollary to information recorded in the reports.", "The purpose of the paperwork that police present to USAO attorneys is to provide evidence that there is probable cause to (1) believe that a crime has been committed and (2) that the person(s) arrested committed the crime. Police documentation could provide evidence that establishes probable cause, but prosecutors may decline to file charges because, for example, they do not believe the evidence would be sufficient to prove the arrestee\u2019s guilt \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d the standard required for conviction of a crime in court. The prosecutor\u2019s goal is to prevail in those cases selected for prosecution.", "Both USAO and MPDC officials said that the paperwork submitted to USAO for charging decisions has been of uneven quality. In the past, MPDC has responded to USAO concerns about the quality of arrest paperwork by conducting report writing training sessions for sergeants, requiring all officers to take annual in-service report writing training, and adopting the use of a new form to document officers involved in an arrest.", "Prosecutors\u2014federal and nonfederal\u2014generally have considerable discretion in selecting which cases they will prosecute. Within its prosecutorial discretion, USAO could decide not to file charges for a number of reasons unrelated to the completeness and accuracy of the police paperwork submitted to prosecutors. According to data USAO provided to MPDC, USAO declined to file charges for 3,270 cases during the period from November 1999 through June 2000. Of the 3,270 cases in which USAO declined to file charges, USAO listed police-related problems, including paperwork problems, in 8 percent of the cases; problems with witness or victim cooperation or credibility in 20 percent; problems with evidence or proof in 70 percent; and a variety of other reasons in 2 percent of the cases."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Problems With the Current Process", "paragraphs": ["Several problems exist with D.C.\u2019s current method of processing cases from arrest through initial court appearance.

For example, to document a drug arrest in which narcotics were seized and property was removed from the arrestee, an officer would have to complete 10 forms, write or type his/her name 8 times, the arrestee\u2019s name and charges 5 times, and the arrestee\u2019s full address and social security number 4 times. This increases the potential for entry error resulting in inconsistent entries for the same information on different forms. Reducing the number of forms required would itself require the cooperation and coordination of MPDC, USAO, Corporation Counsel, Pretrial Services, Defender Service, and Superior Court. However, linking the existing forms in an automated system would permit an officer to type such information once, after which relevant fields in each report would automatically display the required duplicative information. USAO has noted that problems in the accuracy and completeness of the forms submitted by officers for charging decisions are one reason that its prosecutors require a personal meeting with officers to make a charging decision. More accurate paperwork could increase prosecutors\u2019 willingness to use the paperwork as a source of charging decisions, at least for a number of misdemeanors.", "Paperwork delays may slow case processing. Paperwork problems, including physical movement of paperwork between various locations, may delay case processing. There is no electronic mechanism, such as a connected automated system, for transferring arrest paperwork from MPDC to the appropriate prosecuting office and then to the courts. Arrest paperwork may be misplaced as it is physically transported between agencies, and the initial court appearance may be delayed because some of the required paperwork is missing. Any resulting delays in the initial court appearance may increase the time that those detained spend in jail prior to their initial court appearance.", "Required meetings with prosecutors keep officers off the street.", "Before a papering decision is made, both USAO and Corporation Counsel prosecutors require that an officer knowledgeable about the facts of the arrest meet with an attorney for papering. In addition, the papering process requires officers to spend time at the prosecutor\u2019s office performing clerical duties, such as making copies and assembling documents in file jackets. On-duty officers who make arrests between 3:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. are required to meet with prosecutors the morning after an arrest to paper the case. All off-duty officers who appear for papering receive a minimum of 2 hours compensatory time. During 1999, MPDC officers spent the equivalent of 23 full-time staff years in meetings with prosecutors for papering decisions. In other words, the time required for these meetings was the equivalent of taking 23 full-time officers off the streets.", "Using an MPDC sworn officer\u2019s average salary, 23 full-time officers cost about $1,262,000. However, it would take more than 23 additional full- time officers to replace the duty hours devoted to the meetings with prosecutors. This is because (1) an officer is available for duty only a portion of the entire 2,080-hour work year, which includes vacation and training time, and (2) the data do not take into account that off-duty officers who appeared for less than 2 hours actually received 2 hours of compensatory time for their papering appearances. Although the principal participants in the charging decision are MPDC, USAO, and Corporation Counsel, reducing the hours that officers spend in meetings with prosecutors for charging decisions would require the cooperation and coordination of a number of D.C. criminal justice agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Philadelphia and Boston Have Each Made Coordinated Efforts to Improve Initial Charging Process", "paragraphs": ["During the past few years, criminal justice agencies in Philadelphia and Boston have each made coordinated efforts to improve their collective efficiency in processing arrestees. Both cities have turned to automation to improve the process from arrest to initial court appearance, and both involved the cooperation of multiple agencies in developing their automated systems. In Philadelphia participants continue to meet weekly to review arrestee processing statistics and discuss possible improvements to the system. Neither Philadelphia nor Boston requires face-to-face meetings with prosecutors for processing most cases. Prosecutors principally rely on the automated system for the information needed to make charging decisions.", "Philadelphia employs a software system and videoconferencing to process arrestees from the point of arrest through initial court appearance. The system, which was developed through collaboration among Philadelphia criminal justice system agencies, allows the Philadelphia Police Department, the District Attorney\u2019s Charging Unit, Philadelphia Municipal Court, and Pretrial Services to send and receive information electronically. In addition, the system is able to track a defendant\u2019s physical location and length of time in the system.", "The software was developed in conjunction with Philadelphia Municipal Court\u2019s implementation of videoconferencing for the initial court appearances. The courtroom, which operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, uses video cameras, monitors, and software that make it possible to conduct live hearings, eliminating the need to transport prisoners to a central location. Defendants are held at one of eight booking stations throughout the city.", "Rather than have police officers meet face-to-face with charging attorneys to reach a charging decision, Philadelphia charging attorneys review police paperwork submitted electronically. If charging attorneys need additional information, they will contact police for clarification or missing information.", "As in Philadelphia, Boston has also turned to automation to improve the efficiency of its processing of arrestees. In the spring of 2000, the Boston Police Department, Boston Municipal Court, and the Suffolk County District Attorney\u2019s Office implemented a pilot project designed to automate the charging process by electronically linking the three agencies. Boston\u2019s new system allows the Boston Police Department to electronically file applications for criminal complaints (i.e., charging documents) to Municipal Court for review and acceptance prior to the initial court appearance. The system contains all of the information that is typically available in paper form and allows users to track the status of complaints. In Boston, arresting officers are not required to attend face-to- face meetings to charge cases.", "The Philadelphia and Boston experiences illustrate the need for cooperation in crafting process changes and the benefits that could result from the greater use of automation.

However, the involved agencies never reached agreement on all components of the projects, and each of the projects was ultimately suspended. The Chief of MPDC has publicly advocated the establishment of some type of arrangement for making charging decisions during the evening and/or night police shifts.", "Night Papering and Night Court Night papering and night court refer to the extension of papering meetings and court hearings into the evening and night hours. Night papering could permit officers on evening and night shifts to generally present their paperwork to prosecutors during their shifts. Currently, both USAO and Corporation Counsel are only open to paper cases during typical workday hours, that is, generally from about 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Saturday. Night court refers to conducting certain court proceedings, such as initial court appearance, during a late evening or night shift. Night papering would require USAO and Corporation Counsel charging attorneys to work evening hours, and night court would involve a much broader commitment of Superior Court resources as well as the participation of other agencies (such as MPDC, USAO, Corporation Counsel, Pretrial Services, Defender Service, and U.S. Marshals Service).", "Officerless papering refers to a papering process where prosecutors base their charging decisions principally upon the paperwork submitted by officers. In such circumstances, officers would not generally be required to appear in person before the prosecutor, and provisions could be made for the prosecutor to contact the officer to clarify issues, as needed. MPDC and Corporation Counsel have agreed to begin an officerless papering pilot program in March 2001 for 17 minor offenses prosecuted by Corporation Counsel.

Police officers, for example, currently perform a number of clerical functions associated with processing the paperwork for charging decisions. On the other hand, the costs of instituting night papering would be borne primarily by USAO, Corporation Counsel, and/or Superior Court, depending upon the approach taken, not MPDC. Indeed, this approach would likely reduce MPDC\u2019s costs, principally the cost of compensation time for evening duty officers who must meet with prosecutors during off-duty hours.

Although CJCC was created to respond to criminal justice issues that extend beyond the scope of any one agency, the organization has no formal authority over member agencies and its future is uncertain. CJCC was created by the agreement of its members in 1998 to meet the need for better coordination among all of D.C.\u2019s criminal justice agencies, identify ideas of mutual interest, and mobilize resources to improve the D.C. criminal justice system. The D.C. Control Board funded CJCC through fiscal year 2000. Anticipating the Control Board\u2019s suspension of activities in fiscal year 2002, Congress reduced the Board\u2019s fiscal year 2001 funding.

CJCC has functioned as an independent entity whose members represent the major organizations within the D.C. criminal justice system. CJCC members have typically met every 4 to 6 weeks and have formed numerous teams to address criminal justice issues, such as drugs, juvenile justice, halfway houses, information technology, and identification of arrestees. CJCC staff have coordinated meetings, provided data and statistics, summarized workgroup findings, performed best practices reviews, and provided other information and support to D.C. criminal justice agencies. Hence, CJCC has served as a centralized mechanism for collecting and disseminating information and statistics about D.C.\u2019s criminal justice system.", "CJCC workgroups and teams have succeeded in developing proposals and project plans for several issues. For example, CJCC\u2019s Positive Identification Workgroup has been working on a project to determine how to implement fingerprinting protocols. One issue being reviewed by the workgroup is whether to expand positive identification fingerprinting to all arrestees. CJCC, through its technology committee, has been successful in establishing a draft blueprint for data sharing in part because the initiatives have been funded through grants and in part because each participating agency potentially stands to benefit from the changes being considered.", "However, CJCC\u2019s ability to effect cooperation among the various agencies has been limited because it has no formal authority or power over any member agency. In 1998 and 1999, for example, CJCC attempted to assist efforts by MPDC, USAO, and Corporation Counsel to reform the process for determining whether to charge arrestees. However, USAO would not agree to participate in the project unless certain conditions were met, and the project was ultimately suspended. In this case, the costs and potential benefits\u2014financial and organizational\u2014of the changes under consideration were perceived by one or more of the involved agencies to be unevenly distributed.", "Currently, CJCC faces an uncertain future.

In response to our survey, as of November 2000, CJCC and other agencies reported 93 initiatives planned or under way for improving the D.C. criminal justice system. These initiatives cover a wide range of aspects of the criminal justice process, from arrest through correctional supervision. Table 3 summarizes the initiatives by subject area.", "Participating agencies have reported some success with these initiatives. An example of a corrections subject area initiative is the one led by Pretrial Services and DOC to review and reform halfway houses operations. A goal of this initiative is to improve public safety by strengthening coordination, cooperation, and management among relevant criminal justice agencies. According to agency officials, the initiative has reduced the time to obtain a warrant for halfway house walkaways from 7 business days to 1 business day. As a second example, USAO has led an initiative to enhance crime prevention and law enforcement activity by allowing cooperation through agreements between federal agencies and MPDC. These agreements may span all areas of law enforcement, from equipment sharing to allowing federal law enforcement officers to patrol areas immediately surrounding the federal agencies\u2019 jurisdictions. Since most of the 93 initiatives were ongoing at the time of our review, we were unable to evaluate their collective impact on systemwide operations.", "Although the initiatives show that coordinated efforts among agencies can improve the D.C. criminal justice system, we found 62 instances in which agencies did not agree on the goals, status, date started, participating agencies, or results of the initiatives other agencies reported. A number of these differences resulted from agencies\u2019 suggested changes to a draft of appendix VIII. For example, while USAO noted that it is part of the Community Justice Partnerships initiative, Court Services did not identify USAO as a participating agency. For the Fingerprinting Arrestees initiative, Superior Court requested that we change a description of the goals provided by Pretrial Services. DOC noted that it had its own victims services initiative and that it intended to proceed alone on that initiative. A DOC official said DOC was unsure about the details of victims services initiatives by MPDC or the D.C. Mayor\u2019s office. When the agencies responsible for an initiative cannot agree on such fundamental questions as who is taking part in the initiative or even on the goals of the initiative, it becomes apparent that coordination is lacking.

Almost every stage of D.C.\u2019s criminal justice process presents such challenges, and participating agencies are sometimes reluctant to coordinate because the costs of implementing needed changes may fall on one or more federally funded agencies, while any savings accrue to one or more D.C. funded agencies, or vice versa. In the absence of a single hierarchy and funding structure, agencies have generally acted in their own interests rather than in the interest of the system as a whole.", "CJCC was established and staffed as an independent entity to improve systemwide coordination and cooperation. During its 2 \u00bd-year existence, CJCC has served as a useful, independent discussion forum at a modest cost. It has had notable success in several areas where agencies perceived a common interest, such as developing technology that permits greater information sharing. It has been less successful in other areas, such as papering, where forging consensus on the need for and the parameters of change has been difficult. Without a requirement to report successes and areas of continuing discussion and disagreement to each agency\u2019s funding source, CJCC\u2019s activities, achievements, and areas of disagreement have generally been known only to its participating agencies. This has created little incentive to coordinate for the common good, and all too often agencies have simply \u201cagreed to disagree\u201d without taking action. Further, without a meaningful role in the establishment of multiagency initiatives, CJCC has been unable to ensure that criminal justice initiatives are designed to identify the potential for joint improvements, and that they are carefully coordinated among all affected agencies.", "These factors notwithstanding, on balance, CJCC has achieved some successes at a modest cost and served as a useful, independent forum for discussing issues that affect multiple agencies. CJCC\u2019s future is uncertain because its funding source, the D.C. Control Board, is scheduled to disband and key CJCC officials have departed. This could leave D.C. without benefit of an independent entity for coordinating the activities of its unique criminal justice system.

The U.S. Attorney for D.C., for example, suggested that CJCC\u2019s review and coordination role regarding initiatives should be limited to those that have a significant impact on multiple agencies in the criminal justice system. Otherwise, the recommendation, if implemented, could hamper each agency\u2019s ability to implement policies and practices within its appropriate sphere of activity. Along these lines, the Director of Pretrial Services stated that it was important that every voice be heard before decisions are made, but it should not be required that all agencies have common goals for every initiative.", "We continue to believe that CJCC needs to have a role in resolving the types of coordination problems we found in our review. Our intent in making the recommendation was to better ensure that multiagency criminal justice initiatives are designed to maximize their potential for joint improvements, resolve apparent duplication and disagreement regarding roles and responsibilities, and promote the adoption of common goals and measures of success. Having agencies report multiagency initiatives to CJCC would also allow CJCC to maintain a comprehensive database of ongoing initiatives. To limit CJCC\u2019s role to initiatives that have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d invites debate on what is and is not significant. Moreover, the fact that agencies did not agree on something as fundamental as the agency with lead responsibility for a number of initiatives suggests a gap in communication and understanding of participating agency roles and responsibilities.

She noted that night papering had been tried in the late 1980s and that the effort was cancelled because too few cases were presented for papering. The night papering project she referred to was limited to the evening hours before 10 p.m., and given the time required to complete the paperwork needed to make a charging decision, the number of evening arrests that this project could consider for papering was limited. With respect to officerless papering, the U.S. Attorney noted that her office has offered to work with MPDC on a pilot project for officerless papering. However, she cited practical, nonbudgetary reasons that officerless papering had not yet been piloted, and said that USAO and MPDC have been unable to agree on the steps required to initiate it.

In addition to the costs of the process in terms of officer time, the Chief of MPDC said that papering may deter officers from making lower-level arrests.", "We did not specifically advocate the adoption of any of the papering processes used in other locations. Evidence exists to support or rebut the arguments made by various agencies regarding the merits and drawbacks of the current process. The debate concerning the papering issue has persisted for over a decade, and previous efforts to resolve it have been limited to discussions among D.C. criminal justice system agencies and have been unsuccessful. This is exactly the type of issue that could benefit from a broader perspective and increased visibility, and it underscores the need for CJCC to shed light on this and other complex issues in its annual reports to Congress, the Attorney General, and the D.C.

Revitalization Act), which altered some of the responsibilities and/or funding of D.C. criminal justice agencies. We also reviewed previous studies of D.C. criminal justice agencies and their operations, agency documents on policies and procedures, and relevant agency budgets for fiscal year 2000 and requests for fiscal year 2001. In addition, we interviewed officials in the following agencies: the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office (USAO) for the District of Columbia, the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPDC), Superior Court of the District of Columbia (Superior Court), Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia (Defender Service), District of Columbia Pretrial Services Agency (Pretrial Services), Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia (Court Services), Office of the Corporation Counsel for the District of Columbia (Corporation Counsel), Office of the District of Columbia Chief Medical Examiner (Medical Examiner), U.S. Marshals Service, Office of the Corrections Trustee for the District of Columbia, and the Criminal Justice Coordinating Council for the District of Columbia (CJCC).

Issues included the completeness and accuracy of police paperwork submitted to prosecutors and compensatory time off for police officers, who were required to meet with prosecutors in person to discuss their paperwork and the circumstances of the arrest.", "The process used to schedule or \u201ccalendar\u201d cases in Superior Court was perceived to be inefficient and resulted in long waiting times for police officers, witnesses, attorneys, and others scheduled to appear in court. MPDC officials said that the process resulted in significant police overtime costs.", "The juvenile justice system was perceived to have numerous, complex, interrelated problems.", "A principal issue in the process for collecting and evaluating forensic evidence, such as clothing fibers, tissue, and hair samples, was whether a central forensic facility would significantly enhance D.C.\u2019s forensic capacities. Currently, forensic tests are performed by federal and D.C. agencies.", "Officials told us that existing criminal justice databases did not necessarily have accurate, reliable data and that their structure impeded the sharing of data among criminal justice agencies.", "On the basis of our document reviews and interviews, each of these problems appeared to affect multiple D.C. criminal justice agencies, although not always the same ones.", "In our initial survey work, we also found that a number of initiatives had been proposed or were under way to address a variety of D.C. criminal justice issues. After discussing our initial findings with the committees of jurisdiction, we focused on the following objectives: assess how the structure of the D.C. criminal justice system has affected coordination; assess the mechanisms that exist to coordinate the activities of the system; and  describe current initiatives by federal and D.C. agencies for improving the operation of the D.C. criminal justice system.", "We did not focus on court case scheduling because CJCC had selected the Council for Court Excellence and Justice Management Institute to conduct a study of this issue. The problems officials noted in the juvenile justice system extended beyond criminal justice agencies (e.g., counseling and/or residential care) and we limited the scope of our review to D.C. criminal justice agencies. We also gathered available data on D.C.\u2019s current forensic capabilities and practices and the potential need for a central, comprehensive forensic laboratory in D.C. We reviewed a recent National Institute of Justice (NIJ) report on D.C.\u2019s forensic capabilities and interviewed an NIJ official and a local forensic official who served on the NIJ assessment team. However, we were unable to obtain data that could be used to document the effects of the District\u2019s current forensic practices that would be remedied by a central, comprehensive forensic facility. Because CJCC had a major initiative under way to address the automated data systems within the D.C. criminal justice system, we limited our work to describing this initiative and the problems it is designed to address.", "To assess how the structure of the D.C. criminal justice system affected coordination, we interviewed officials in each of the offices mentioned above and reviewed available written policies, procedures, and descriptions of the case flow process. We also reviewed the provisions of the D.C. Revitalization Act, which federalized some D.C. criminal justice agencies, such as Defender Service and Court Services. From these sources we drafted three separate case flow descriptions: (1) cases prosecuted by USAO, (2) cases prosecuted by Corporation Counsel, and (3) juvenile cases, and we discussed the responsibilities of each agency in each process. These drafts were reviewed by the participating agencies for accuracy and amended as appropriate.", "We reviewed the charging process with USAO, Corporation Counsel, MPDC, and Pretrial Services officials\u2014the principal participants in the process. We reviewed available policies and procedures at the participating agencies and observed the process at each agency, from the initial paperwork completed by police officers following an arrest through the decision by USAO or Corporation Counsel to file or not file formal charges. Because of the unique structure of the D.C. criminal justice system, there are no jurisdictions whose criminal justice structures and processes are comparable to those of D.C. However, we reviewed prior studies of the process and interviewed officials in Philadelphia and Boston, two large East Coast cities that have recently revised their methods of processing cases from arrest through initial court appearance. Both Philadelphia and Boston have a large annual number of misdemeanor and felony arrests, but their papering systems are more automated than D.C.\u2019s process.", "We also reviewed the available monthly reports (November 1999 through June 2000) that USAO provided to MPDC on its papering decisions. These reports identified, by case, the reasons assistant U.S. Attorneys declined to file charges against arrestees. We did not verify the data in these monthly reports. Using spreadsheets, we analyzed these reports by offense and police district to identify any variances or patterns by offense and police district.

Making an initial charging decision correctly benefits (1) USAO by allowing them to more effectively prosecute \u201cgood\u201d cases; (2) arrestees by ensuring that individuals are not inappropriately charged with a crime; and (3) the criminal justice system by allowing USAO to screen out \u201cpoor\u201d cases, which would languish in the system consuming resources from everyone if they were not weeded out. USAO cannot make an initial charging decision correctly if it does not have all of the information about the arrest. USAO requires that officers physically appear to paper the case in order to gather information about the arrest that may be missing from the arrest reports, inaccurate, or corollary to information recorded in the reports. In the past, MPDC has responded to USAO concerns about the quality of arrest paperwork by conducting report writing training sessions for sergeants, requiring all officers to take annual in-service report writing training, and adopting the use of a new form to document officers involved in an arrest.", "Prosecutors\u2014federal and nonfederal\u2014generally have considerable discretion in selecting which cases they will prosecute. According to data USAO provided to MPDC, USAO declined to file charges\u2014did not paper\u2014 3,270 cases during the period from November 1999 through June 2000. Of the 3,270 cases in which USAO declined to file charges, USAO listed police-related problems, including paperwork problems, in 8 percent of the cases; problems with witness or victim cooperation or credibility in 20 percent; problems with evidence or proof in 70 percent; and a variety of other reasons in 2 percent of the cases (see table 8). The two most frequently cited reasons for not filing charges\u2014\u201dinsubstantial injury or amount\u201d and \u201cinsufficient evidence to prove case\u201d\u2014together accounted for about 40 percent of the cases that USAO declined to prosecute. Within its prosecutorial discretion, USAO could decide not to file charges for reasons such as these, even though the police paperwork may have been complete and accurate.", "Both USAO and MPDC officials said that the paperwork submitted to USAO for charging decisions has been of uneven quality. However, there were no data to compare the quality of the paperwork for misdemeanors and felonies. The purpose of the paperwork that police present to USAO attorneys is to provide evidence that there is probable cause to (1) believe that a crime has been committed and (2) that the person(s) arrested committed the crime. Police documentation could provide evidence that establishes probable cause, but prosecutors may decline to file charges because, for example, they do not believe the evidence would be sufficient to prove the arrestee\u2019s guilt \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d the standard required for conviction of a crime in court.

This requirement, particularly for misdemeanors, appears to be unusual.", "In December 1997, Booz-Allen and Hamilton (Booz-Allen) surveyed 51 jurisdictions to determine how they typically processed misdemeanors.

In 30 of the 38 jurisdictions that responded to the survey, officers were not required to meet with prosecutors until court (i.e., trial), and in 3 cities, officers were not required to appear until the preliminary hearing.

During 1996, the Philadelphia Police Department, the Philadelphia County District Attorney\u2019s Charging Unit (Charging Unit), and the Philadelphia Municipal Court (including the Pretrial Services Agency) jointly began implementing two key automated programs\u2014a software system and videoconferencing\u2014in an effort to improve the processing of arrestees.", "Philadelphia\u2019s automated system for processing arrestees resulted from collaboration of, among others, the Philadelphia Police Department, the District Attorney\u2019s Office, Municipal Court, and Pretrial Services officials. The group was formed in response to lawsuits filed to expedite arrestee processing and was led by the President Judge of Municipal Court. The group\u2019s collaboration resulted in the creation of the Preliminary Arraignment System (PARS). Officials told us that the group continues to meet weekly to review arrestee processing statistics and discuss possible improvements to the system.", "PARS is a Windows-based computer software program that automates the paperwork and defendant processing required from the point of arrest to initial court appearance. PARS allows the Philadelphia Police Department, the Charging Unit, Municipal Court, and Pretrial Services to send and receive all paper-based information electronically and instantly. The system was also designed to track the defendant\u2019s physical location and length of time in the system. Six interfaces between PARS and other computer systems (e.g., other criminal record repositories) allow for continual data transmission and sharing.", "PARS was developed in conjunction with Municipal Court\u2019s implementation of videoconferencing for the initial court appearances. The courtroom, which operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, uses video cameras, monitors, and software that make it possible to conduct live hearings. Videoconferencing eliminates the need to transport prisoners to a central location\u2014the arraignments are held at one of eight booking stations throughout the city. The defendant speaks through a telephone and can see the judicial officer, the prosecutor, the public defender, and him/herself on a quad-screen monitor. A telephone handset located by the public defender allows counsel to interrupt the audio speaker system to either silence, or have a private consultation with, the defendant. Also, a police officer standing near the defendant can hear the process through an external speaker.", "Unlike D.C., Philadelphia does not require officers to meet face-to-face with charging attorneys to reach a charging decision. Charging attorneys review police paperwork submitted electronically via PARS. If charging attorneys need additional information, they will contact police for clarification or missing information. If the Charging Unit\u2019s decision not to charge the arrestee was based on incomplete or unclear information in the arrest report, police will be notified and have the opportunity to fix the police report and resubmit the case by way of an affidavit.", "Philadelphia criminal justice officials noted that PARS and video arraignments have improved the processing of arrestees. Despite a significant increase in the number of arrests processed during the past few years, the case processing time from arrest to release on bail or jail has not increased proportionally. PARS has also dramatically reduced duplication because once a case is charged, the system will not allow another person to accidentally recharge the same case. PARS has reduced data entry mistakes, which previously occurred when data were entered multiple times in multiple systems.

In the spring of 2000, the Boston Police Department, Boston Municipal Court (Court), and the Suffolk County District Attorney\u2019s Office (District Attorney) implemented a pilot project designed to automate the charging process by electronically linking the three agencies. The Electronic Application for Criminal Complaint (EACC) system allows the Boston Police Department to electronically file applications for criminal complaints (i.e., charging documents) to the Court for review and acceptance prior to the initial court appearance. The EACC system contains all of the information that is typically available in paper form, including information about the defendant, the offense, the witness, the complainant (i.e., the police officer in arrest-generated cases). EACC is also capable of providing information about whether the District Attorney, the clerk magistrate, and probation have reviewed a complaint.", "After arrest, the application for complaint and police reports are reviewed by a Boston Police Department duty supervisor and may be electronically submitted to Court. Next, the application for complaint is reviewed by one of several prosecuting police officers stationed at the Court. The prosecuting officers either approve the application for complaint and forward it to the District Attorney or return the application for complaint to the duty supervisor/arresting officer for any needed corrections. Police officers who make the arrests are not required to attend face-to-face meetings to charge the case.", "In Boston, the clerk magistrate determines whether to charge a case. The District Attorney performs a screening function and reviews the application for complaint and either (1) forwards the application to the clerk magistrate, (2) makes suggestions about changing the application and returns the application to the police supervisor of cases, or (3) rejects the application entirely. If a case is forwarded to the clerk magistrate, he reviews the case to ascertain whether probable cause exists and ultimately decides whether to generate a criminal complaint. If the clerk magistrate issues a criminal complaint, an initial court appearance is held at the Court, Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. On Saturdays and Sundays, when the Court is closed, a representative from the clerk magistrate\u2019s office is on-call to review cases in which an arrestee is not admitted to bail to make a probable cause and/or a bail determination.", "Although the pilot was ongoing at the time of our visit, Court officials noted that EACC was already providing benefits. All involved agencies were able to see exactly what stage an application for criminal complaint was. The system reduced the possibility of data entry errors because information was only entered once. Efficiency was improved because the complaint arrives at the Court prior to the arrestee, thereby reducing the amount of time the arrestee waits in lockup.", "The Boston and Philadelphia examples show the potential uses of automation and technology in improving efficiency and information sharing.
