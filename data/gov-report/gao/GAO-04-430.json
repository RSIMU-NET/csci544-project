GAO also examined why agencies may not have explored these opportunities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although some agencies have begun to take actions to achieve savings through their purchase card programs, most have not identified and taken advantage of opportunities to obtain more favorable prices on purchase card buys--opportunities that could yield hundreds of millions of dollars in savings. For example, most agencies have established some discount agreements with major purchase card vendors (those vendors with whom they did more than $1 million in purchase card business in fiscal year 2002), but these agreements cover only a few of the hundreds of major vendors and a limited number of products. Further, because agency purchase card training programs lack practical information to help cardholders take advantage of existing discount agreements or GSA's Federal Supply Schedule contracts, cardholders paid higher prices than necessary. The agencies that have taken steps to obtain better prices by negotiating discounts with their major vendors have achieved notable savings on purchase card buys. For example, in fiscal year 2003, the Agriculture Department negotiated a discount agreement for office supplies that yielded savings of $1.8 million--about 10 percent off Schedule contract prices--and the Interior Department recently negotiated agreements with information technology vendors for discounts up to 35 percent off Schedule prices. A conservative approach indicates that, if the agencies we reviewed obtained discounts of only 10 percent with their major vendors, annual savings of up to $300 million could be achieved. Most agencies have not more aggressively pursued savings through the purchase card because of a lack of management focus--simply put, this issue has not been the center of attention for managers. Further, the Office of Management and Budget has not leveraged its governmentwide oversight role by collecting and disseminating information on the successful initiatives some agencies have undertaken. Agency officials also expressed concerns that imposing additional requirements on cardholders would undermine the program's intent to streamline acquisitions and that pursuing discount agreements with large suppliers would limit their ability to provide opportunities for small businesses. They also cited poor data as a barrier to identifying savings opportunities. However, as individual agencies have demonstrated, these concerns are not insurmountable. For example, the Air Force's Air Mobility Command provides its cardholders a list of community vendors--many of which are small businesses--that offer discounts, making it easy for the cardholders to obtain discounts from local small businesses. Despite data limitations, information such as vendor sales reports could be used to identify major vendors with whom to pursue discount agreements and to provide insight into cardholder activity."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The introduction of government purchase cards fundamentally changed  the way agencies make small, routine purchases of goods and services.

In  addition, we reviewed selected fiscal year 2002 purchase card  transactions, at or below the micropurchase level, with major vendors at  the eight agencies and compared prices paid to prices available through  the General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule  (Schedule) and telecommunications contracts. Although these  transactions were selected at random from the population of micro- purchase transactions with vendors having the highest purchase card  sales at the eight agencies, we cannot project the results to the population  of transactions governmentwide. We also engaged the Dun and Bradstreet  Corporation to perform a spend analysis of the Interior Department\u2019s fiscal  year 2002 purchase card transactions to illustrate how a detailed analysis  could begin to identify opportunities for purchase card savings.

GSA, which manages  the purchase card program governmentwide, has awarded contracts to  banks to provide standard commercial charge cards for use by federal  employees. When GSA first pilot-tested the purchase card in the late 1980s,  its use was restricted to procurement personnel. In 1994, however, the  Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) defined micropurchases as  purchases in amounts not greater than $2,500. The act authorized  cardholders to make micropurchases without obtaining competitive  quotations if they considered the price reasonable and directed that  purchases be distributed equitably among qualified suppliers. The Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR) designated the purchase card as the  preferred method of making micropurchases. By shifting authority for  small purchases from procurement offices to individual cardholders,  agencies dramatically improved their ability to acquire quickly and easily  items that were needed for day-to-day operations and to reduce  administrative costs.", "Since the passage of FASA, the dollar value of goods and services acquired  through the purchase card has exploded, as figure 1 shows. This growth  was accompanied by an increase in the number of personnel using the  purchase card.", "Table 1 provides information on fiscal year 2002 purchase card activity for  the eight agencies we reviewed. Purchase card transactions at these  agencies account for over 85 percent of the government\u2019s purchase card  spending. While purchase cards may be used to make payments under  established contracts in addition to making micropurchases, an  overwhelming majority of transactions are micropurchases. At the eight  agencies reviewed, micropurchases represented 98 percent of transactions  and accounted for 63 percent of the dollars expended. Appendix VI  provides additional information on purchase card activity at the agencies  we reviewed.", "GSA, whose mission is to help federal agencies better serve the public by  offering acquisition services at the best value, has created several tools  that can help cardholders obtain more favorable pricing for goods and  services. The most common of these is the Schedule program, which  offers discounted prices on a wide range of commercial goods and  services from multiple vendors. The GSA Advantage on-line shopping  service allows agencies to compare prices under various Schedule  contracts, place orders, and make payments over the Internet. In addition,  GSA has awarded contracts that offer federal agencies discounted prices  on telecommunications services.", "Our prior work found that weak internal controls left purchase card use at  DOD and several civilian agencies vulnerable to fraud and abuse. The list  of Related Products at the end of this report identifies recent work in this  area. To address these concerns, Congress has enacted legislation that  directs DOD to improve program management by limiting the number of  purchase cards, providing appropriate training to purchase card officials  and cardholders, monitoring purchase card activity, disciplining  cardholders who misuse the purchase card, and assessing the credit  worthiness of cardholders. We recently reported that DOD has taken a  number of actions to improve the controls over the purchase card program  based on congressional action and our recommendations. To improve  management of the purchase card program governmentwide, the proposed  Purchase Card and Travel Card Accountability Act of 2003 would require  the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy to prescribe  a governmentwide policy regarding the appropriate and inappropriate uses  of the purchase and travel cards.

In more recent years, our work and the work of agency inspectors general  highlighted weaknesses in internal controls that left purchase card use  vulnerable to fraud and abuse. Agency managers have made a concerted  effort to address these internal control weaknesses, but have not paid  similar attention to capitalizing on opportunities for savings on purchase  card buys.

While the FAR requires agencies to obtain reasonable  prices, it limits the actions agencies need to take to verify price  reasonableness. Given the wide variety of missions that cardholders must  meet on a daily basis, they must retain the flexibility to make their  purchases in a way that meets their needs.

To receive Schedule discounts, cardholders generally must place orders  with a vendor through the GSA Advantage on-line shopping service or  other designated ordering procedures. Some of GSA\u2019s Schedule contracts,  however, provide vendors the option of offering cardholders discounts at  the point of sale in the vendors\u2019 retail stores. For example, one GSA  contracting officer modified a vendor\u2019s contract to provide for point-of-  sale discounts. The vendor then programmed cash registers in its retail  stores to recognize a federal government purchase card when a shopper  presents one and to apply the appropriate Schedule discount to the  shopper\u2019s order.

Veterans  Affairs also endorsed our recommendation that GSA pursue point-of-sale  discounts with large vendors and suggested that GSA consider  encouraging vendors to program point-of-sale devices to recognize that  federal purchases are exempt from sales taxes. Veterans Affairs\u2019  comments are reproduced in appendix V.", "In comments sent via e-mail, the Department of Agriculture concurred  with our recommendations and outlined a number of steps the department  will take to implement them.  Commenting on our finding that  Agriculture\u2019s discount agreement for office supplies did not take full  advantage of competitive forces to ensure the most favorable prices,  Agriculture stated that it reviews this agreement annually and will re- compete the agreement when these annual reviews indicate that re- competition is warranted. We believe that periodic\u2014but not annual\u2014re- competitions would provide the best information for assessing whether  the agreement continues to offer the most advantageous prices for office  supplies.", "In comments sent via e-mail, the Department of Transportation did not  specifically agree or disagree with our recommendations, but noted that  our report could benefit by explicitly recognizing that the greatest savings  could by achieved by pooling the buying power of the entire federal  government. We agree that leveraging governmentwide buying power  would result in the greatest savings. While this would be the best end- state, we see this as a long-term effort with many obstacles to be  overcome before it can be achieved.  Our work identified initiatives\u2014 relatively simple to implement\u2014that agencies can begin now to start  achieving savings. In addition, Transportation commented that our report  does not adequately depict the fundamental difficulties of complying with  JWOD purchase requirements while at the same time achieving best value.   We believe our report appropriately reflects the concerns agency officials  expressed to us about complying with socioeconomic requirements,  including JWOD, and we provide several examples of how some agencies  have taken steps appropriately structure discount agreements so that they  help ensure that cardholders purchase JWOD products when required. In  addition, Transportation commented that the report should discuss some  of the positive accomplishments of the purchase card program. Our report  acknowledges that the purchase card has fundamentally changed the way  agencies make small, routine, purchases and we believe the report  appropriately reflects the administrative cost savings and convenience  purchase cards have provided. Finally, Transportation suggested a  technical correction, which we have incorporated in the report.", "As arranged with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its  issue date. At that time, we will send copies of this report to the  Secretaries of Agriculture, DOD, Homeland Security, the Interior, Justice,  Transportation, and Veterans Affairs; the director of OMB; the  administrator of GSA; and other interested congressional committees. We  will provide copies to others on request.  This report will also be available  at no charge on GAO\u2019s Web site at http://www.gao.gov.", "If you or your staffs have any questions about this report or need  additional information please call David Cooper at (202) 512-4841  (cooperd@gao.gov) or Gregory Kutz at (202) 512-9505 (kutzg@gao.gov).  Key contributors to this report are acknowledged in appendix VII."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix I: Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["We reviewed laws and regulations relating to the purchase card program,  held discussions with GSA officials responsible for governmentwide  program management and OMB representatives responsible for program  policy and oversight, and reviewed governmentwide policy and guidance  for the program. We also performed our work at the Departments of  Agriculture, Defense (DOD), the Interior, Justice, Transportation, and  Veterans Affairs. These agencies accounted for over 85 percent of  governmentwide purchase card expenditures during fiscal year 2002.  Within DOD, we focused our work at the Departments of the Army, the  Navy, and the Air Force, which represented 92 percent of all DOD  purchase card expenditures during fiscal year 2002.  We contacted all  major component agencies\u2014referred to as major commands in the Army  and Air Force and as major claimants in the Navy. At the civilian  departments, we contacted the component agencies that were the largest  users of purchase cards.", "To determine whether agencies had taken advantage of opportunities to  obtain more favorable purchase card prices, we held discussions with  officials responsible for the purchase card program at each department to  obtain information on (1) efforts to identify opportunities to obtain more  favorable prices, (2) efforts to negotiate discount agreements that made  more favorable prices available to cardholders, and (3) guidance and  training provided to cardholders to inform them of opportunities to obtain  more favorable prices. We reviewed policy and guidance manuals, training  materials, and other agency documentation that provided information on  these topics. We also contacted the components responsible for the largest  volume of purchase card activity within each department. Finally, to  assess cardholder buying practices and gain insight into whether they  were obtaining favorable prices, we selected a limited number of fiscal  year 2002 micropurchase transactions at each department for review. We  obtained and reviewed documentation relating to the transactions, such as  invoices, and discussed the transactions with cardholders.", "To identify the reasons why agencies had not taken advantage of  opportunities to obtain more favorable purchase card prices, we discussed  these issues with officials responsible for departmental purchase card  programs and reviewed applicable agency documentation.", "To select transactions for review, we first obtained data files of fiscal year  2002 purchase card transactions from the banks that provided purchase  cards to each of the departments reviewed. (In the case of the military  services, we obtained data files from the Defense Manpower Data Center,  which had previously obtained the files from the applicable banks.) We  reviewed these files to determine that they did not contain any apparent  erroneous data and then summarized the total number and dollar value of  transactions for each department. We reconciled these totals with totals  reported by GSA for each department. Having determined that the data  files were generally reliable, we summarized the data to determine the  total number and dollar value of transactions by vendor and identified  major purchase card vendors at each department. We defined major  purchase card vendors as those vendors where the department had  purchase card expenditures of $1 million or more in fiscal year 2002.", "We then combined the data on major purchase card vendors for the eight  departments and summarized the number and dollar value of transactions  by vendor to identify those vendors where the eight departments had the  highest purchase card expenditures. From this combined listing, we  determined that vendors providing information technology products,  office supplies, and cellular telecommunications services were among the  top vendors at all eight departments. Accordingly, we selected two of the  top information technology vendors, two of the top office supply vendors,  and two of the top cellular telecommunications service providers as the  vendors for which we would select transactions for review.", "For each department, we identified the population of micropurchase  transactions with the selected vendors. If a department did not have $1  million or more in micropurchase transactions with the vendor, we  excluded that vendor\u2019s transactions from further analysis at that  department. We then identified, for each vendor, the subpopulation of  micropurchase transactions valued at $100.00 or more for information  technology and office supply vendors or $25.00 or more for cellular  telephone service providers at each department. We selected\u2014using a  random selection process\u20143 transactions with each vendor at each  department for a total of 135 transactions. Although these transactions  were selected at random, we cannot project the results of the selected  transactions to the population of transactions.", "To assess the prices cardholders had paid on a transaction, we ascertained  whether the vendor had a GSA contract or agency-negotiated discount  agreement applicable to the items or services purchased. We obtained  information on prices for the items or services under these contracts or  agreements and used these prices as benchmarks for assessing whether  the cardholder had obtained favorable pricing. In addition to making these  price comparisons, we contacted the cardholders to discuss the  transaction and gain insight into their buying practices and awareness of  vehicles that provide favorable pricing.", "To assess the potential magnitude of savings that agencies can achieve by  negotiating discount agreements with their major purchase card vendors,  we considered the discounts individual departments had obtained on the  agencywide discount agreements we reviewed during our work. Discounts  offered under these agreements varied\u2014for example, 8 percent under an  Interior agreement for desktop computers, 10 percent under an  Agriculture agreement for office supplies, and 35 percent under an Interior  agreement for laptop computers. We considered the 10 percent discount  that Agriculture obtained to represent a reasonable and conservative  benchmark for the potential discounts departments could obtain from  their major vendors.", "Our analysis showed that the agencies reviewed spent about $2.8 with  major purchase card vendors in fiscal year 2002. Although some of these  expenditures would have been covered by discount agreements the  departments had negotiated, we found that agency discount agreements  often did not cover all the items that cardholders purchased from those  vendors. Further, we found that cardholders did not always know of, or  take advantage of, the discounts agreements agencies had negotiated. A  number of the transactions we reviewed were made at retail prices. If the  agencies we reviewed obtained discounts of about 10 percent on the $2.8  billion spent with their major purchase card vendors, their savings would  amount to about $282 million. Actual discounts would vary with factors  such as sales volume, profit margin, and competitiveness of the industry. If  agencies obtained discounts equivalent to the high end of the range we  saw during our work, savings would amount to almost $1 billion, although  it is unrealistic to expect savings of this magnitude. Nonetheless, we  believe it is reasonable to anticipate that the federal government could  save hundreds of millions of dollars if agencies negotiated discounts with  major purchase card vendors.", "Finally, we engaged the Dun and Bradstreet Corporation to perform a  spend analyses of Interior\u2019s fiscal year 2002 purchase card transactions to  illustrate how a detailed analysis could begin to identify opportunities for  purchase card savings. In addition to performing analyses of Interior\u2019s  purchase card transactions, Dun and Bradstreet gathered information on  the costs and benefits to merchants and other stakeholders of providing  \u201clevel 3\u201d data\u2014which includes descriptions of the items and services  purchased\u2014and on barriers to vendors providing this information.", "We conducted our review between March 2003 and January 2004 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the General Services Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of the Interior", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Information on Purchase Card Expenditures", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individuals named above, Robert Ackley, Victoria  Klepacz, James Moses, Jerrod O\u2019Nelio, Monty Peters, Jose Ramos, Harold  Reich, Sanford Reigle, Kenneth Roberts, Sylvia Schatz, Quan Thai,  Najeema Washington, and Gary Wiggins made key contributions to this  report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Products concerning purchase card internal controls:  Purchase Cards: Steps Taken to Improve DOD Program Management,  but Actions Needed to Address Misuse, GAO-04-156 (Washington, D.C.:  Dec. 2, 2003).", "Audit Guide: Auditing and Investigating the Internal Control of  Government Purchase Card Programs, GAO-04-87G (Washington, D.C.:  Nov. 1, 2003).", "Forest Service Purchase Cards: Internal Control Weaknesses Resulted in  Instances of Improper, Wasteful, and Questionable Purchases,   GAO-03-786 (Washington, D.C.: Aug. 11, 2003).", "HUD Purchase Cards: Poor Internal Controls Resulted in Improper and  Questionable Purchases, GAO-03-489  (Washington, D.C.: Apr. 11, 2003).", "FAA Purchase Cards: Weak Controls Resulted in Instances of Improper  and Wasteful Purchases and Missing Assets, GAO-03-405  (Washington,  D.C.: Mar. 21, 2003).", "Purchase Cards: Control Weaknesses Leave the Air Force Vulnerable to  Fraud, Waste, and Abuse, GAO-03-292  (Washington, D.C.: Dec. 20, 2002).", "Purchase Cards: Navy Is Vulnerable to Fraud and Abuse but Is Taking  Action to Resolve Control Weaknesses, GAO-02-1041 (Washington, D.C.:  Sept. 27, 2002).", "Purchase Cards: Control Weaknesses Leave Army Vulnerable to Fraud,  Waste, and Abuse, GAO-02-732  (Washington, D.C.: June 27, 2002).", "FAA Alaska: Weak Controls Resulted in Improper and Wasteful  Purchases, GAO-02-606  (Washington, D.C.: May 30, 2002).", "Government Purchase Cards: Control Weaknesses Expose Agencies to  Fraud and Abuse, GAO-02-676T (Washington, D.C.:  May 1, 2002).", "Purchase Cards: Control Weaknesses Leave Two Navy Units Vulnerable  to Fraud and Abuse, GAO-02-32  (Washington, D.C.: Nov. 30, 2001).", "Products concerning strategic purchasing:  Contract Management: Restructuring GSA\u2019s Federal Supply Service and  Federal Technology Service, GAO-04-132T (Washington, D.C.:  Oct. 2,  2003).", "Best Practices: Improved Knowledge of DOD Service Contracts Could  Reveal Significant Savings, GAO-03-661 (Washington, D.C.: June 9, 2003).", "Contract Management: Taking a Strategic Approach to Improving  Service Acquisitions, GAO-02-499T (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 7, 2002)", "Best Practices: Taking a Strategic Approach Could Improve DOD\u2019s  Acquisition of Services, GAO-02-230  (Washington, D.C.: Jan. 18, 2002)"], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
