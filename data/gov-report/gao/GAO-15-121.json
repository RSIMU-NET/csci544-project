BIE's mission is to provide students with a quality education. However, BIE student performance has been consistently below that of public school students, including other Indian students. Given these challenges, GAO was asked to review BIE school funding and expenditures.", "This report examines how funding sources and expenditures of BIE schools compare to those of public schools; the extent to which BIE has the staff and expertise needed to oversee school expenditures; and the extent to which BIE's processes for oversight adequately ensure that school funds are spent appropriately.", "GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations and agency documents, and analyzed BIE and public school expenditure data for school year 2009-10, the most recent year for which data were available.

BIE directly operates about a third of its schools, and tribes operate two-thirds. According to BIE data, all of the BIE schools received a total of about $830 million in fiscal year 2014: about 75 percent from the Department of the Interior (Interior), 24 percent from the Department of Education (Education), and 1 percent from the Department of Agriculture and other agencies. Public schools nationwide receive about 9 percent of their funding from federal sources and rely mostly on state and local funding.", "GAO found that some BIE schools spend substantially more per pupil than public schools nationwide. Specifically, GAO estimates that the average per pupil expenditures for BIE-operated schools\u2014the only BIE schools for which detailed expenditure data are available\u2014were about 56 percent higher than for public schools nationally in school year 2009-10, the most recent year for which data were available at the time of GAO's review. Several factors may help explain the higher per pupil expenditures at BIE-operated schools, such as their student demographics, remote location, and small enrollment.", "BIE lacks sufficient staff with expertise to oversee school expenditures. Since 2011, the number of BIE full-time administrators located on or near Indian reservations to oversee school expenditures decreased from 22 to 13, due partly to budget cuts. As a result, the 13 administrators have many additional responsibilities and an increased workload, making it challenging for them to provide effective oversight of schools. Additionally, these administrators have received less training in recent years. Further, the three administrators GAO spoke with said they do not have the expertise to fully understand the school audits they are responsible for reviewing. BIE's staffing of these positions runs counter to federal internal controls standards and key principles for effective strategic workforce planning, such as having sufficient, adequately-trained staff. Without adequate staff and training, BIE will not be able to ensure that school funds are spent appropriately.", "BIE's processes for oversight do not adequately ensure that funds are spent appropriately. BIE lacks written procedures for how and when staff should monitor school spending and does not use a risk-based approach to prioritize how it should use its limited resources for oversight. Instead, BIE told GAO that it relies primarily on ad hoc suggestions by staff regarding which schools to oversee more closely. Meanwhile, some schools have serious financial problems. Notably, external auditors identified $13.8 million in unallowable spending at 24 schools as of July 2014. Further, in March 2014, an audit found that one school lost about $1.2 million in federal funds that were improperly transferred to an off-shore account. Without written procedures and a risk-based approach to overseeing school spending\u2014both integral to federal internal control standards\u2014there is little assurance that federal funds are being used for their intended purpose to provide BIE students with needed instructional and other educational services."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Among other things, GAO recommends that Indian Affairs develop a workforce plan to ensure that BIE has the staff to effectively oversee school spending and written procedures and a risk-based approach to guide BIE's oversight of school spending.

Of the 185 schools, 58 are directly  operated by BIE (BIE-operated), and 127 are operated by tribes (tribally- operated) mostly through federal grants. These schools serve about 7  percent of the Indian student population, mostly low-income students in  rural communities.", "Student performance at BIE schools has been consistently below that of  public school students, including other Indian students attending public  schools. In addition, high school graduation rates at BIE schools are  lower than the national average. Given these longstanding challenges  that BIE schools face, questions have been raised about the amount of  resources available to them as compared to public schools. GAO was  asked to review BIE school funding and expenditures. This report  examines: (1) how sources of funding for BIE schools compare to those  of public schools; (2) how BIE school expenditures compare to those of  public schools; (3) the extent to which BIE has the staff and expertise  needed to oversee school expenditures; and (4) the extent to which BIE\u2019s  processes are adequate for ensuring that school funds are spent  appropriately.", "To address these objectives, we used multiple data collection  methodologies.

Students in BIE schools\u2014both tribally- operated and BIE-operated\u2014tend to have different demographic  characteristics than students in public schools nationally. These  characteristics, including higher poverty rates and a higher percent of  students with special needs, are among the factors yielding higher  per-pupil expenditures on average, as we have noted in previous  reports. In BIE schools, students tend to be from lower income  households than public school students. For example, all BIE schools  were eligible for Title I funding on a school-wide basis because they  all had at least 40 percent of children from low income households in  school year 2009-10, according to an Education study. In contrast,  half of all public schools were eligible for Title I funds on a school-wide  basis. In addition, BIE-operated day schools have a higher  percentage of students receiving special education services than  public schools nationwide, according to BIE and Education data.  Students in special education generally need additional services, such  as physical, occupational or speech therapy, so expenditures tend to  be higher for these students.", "Smaller enrollment and remote location. The smaller enrollment and  isolated location of many BIE schools contribute to their higher  expenditures. In school year 2009-10, BIE schools, including BIE- operated schools, generally had smaller average enrollment than  public schools nationwide. For example, over 85 percent of BIE- operated day schools (28 of 32 schools) had fewer than 300 students  according to our analysis, as compared to about 30 percent of public  schools nationwide. Along with smaller size, the remote location of  many BIE schools hinders their ability to benefit from economies of  scale, as we have previously reported.

From fiscal years 2011 to 2014, funding for management of BIE  schools, including for line office staff, decreased by about 38 percent.", "As a result of having fewer line office administrators, the remaining  administrators have been assigned additional responsibilities and their  workload has increased, making it challenging for them to conduct  needed oversight. For example, administrators in two of the three line  offices we interviewed reported that over the last 2 years their  responsibilities have increased significantly, and they are now overseeing  and providing technical assistance to a greater number of schools. One  official told us that in addition to the 7 schools he usually monitors, he is  responsible for 11 additional schools that two other line offices had been  responsible for overseeing. According to an administrator in a third line  office, located in the Navajo Nation, responsibilities in that office have  also changed significantly, and currently one line office administrator is  responsible for overseeing 65 Navajo schools\u2019 financial matters, including  the tribally-operated schools\u2019 annual single audits.", "With increased responsibilities and travel budgets constraints, line office  administrators in all three BIE regions reported that conducting site visits  and maintaining regular interaction with school personnel is difficult. In  particular, line office administrators said, among other things, it is  challenging to obtain and review school documents, develop working  relationships with school officials, and provide technical assistance to  schools, all of which are activities that contribute to oversight. For  example, one line office administrator reported that she reviews hard- copy special education files during site visits to ensure that funding is  used to provide students with needed services. She explained that she is  only able to access these files when visiting schools.", "According to a high-ranking BIE official, increased line office  responsibilities can include working outside of one\u2019s assigned region in  geographically dispersed areas. For example, a line office administrator in  North Dakota also serves as the acting administrator for a line office in  Tennessee and is responsible for overseeing and providing technical  assistance to schools in five states\u2014Florida, Louisiana, Maine,  Mississippi, and North Carolina. Similarly, a line office administrator in  New Mexico and another in Arizona are responsible for overseeing school  expenditures to schools in Montana.", "The challenges line office administrators confront in overseeing school  expenditures are further exacerbated by a lack of financial expertise and  training. For example, although line office administrators make key  decisions about single audit report findings, such as whether funds are  being spent appropriately, they are not auditors or accountants.  Additionally, the administrators responsible for the three line offices we  visited said that they did not have the financial expertise to understand  the content of single audits. Although Indian Affairs has offered  occasional webinars pertaining to single audits in the last two years,  some line office administrators have not received this training. In fact, the  majority of BIE\u2019s acting line office administrators (4 out of 7), have not  attended these webinars, though they may especially need training on  their new job responsibilities. Additionally, no BIE staff have attended any  in-person single audit training since at least 2011.", "Although BIE officials reported in September 2013 that eliminating line  office positions would create problems if appropriate plans are not  developed and implemented, the agency has not developed a plan for  meeting its workforce needs. According to BIE officials, they have not  hired new line office administrators for 4 years due to budget cuts. As a  result of these cuts, Interior had a hiring freeze for about 1.5 years and  currently has a cap on hiring. Although BIE can request waivers to hire  additional staff, it has not done so for line office positions in this fiscal  environment.", "BIE has a responsibility to employ the staff needed to adequately oversee  school expenditures. To the extent that line office administrators are  currently stretched thin without an effective plan for realigning staff  responsibilities, BIE\u2019s efforts to fulfill its mission of educating Indian  students are impaired. BIE\u2019s approach to staffing line offices runs counter  to federal internal control standards and key principles for effective  strategic workforce planning. Federal internal control standards state that  staff need to possess and maintain a level of competence that allows  them to accomplish their assigned duties. Additionally, key principles for  workforce planning include: (1) aligning an organization\u2019s human capital  program with its current and emerging mission and programmatic goals  and (2) developing long-term strategies for acquiring, developing, and  retaining staff to achieve programmatic goals. The appropriate number  and geographic distribution of employees can further support  organizational goals and strategies and enable an organization to have  sufficient, adequately trained staff. Absent a comprehensive workforce  plan that responds to staff shortages, BIE is jeopardizing its ability to  oversee both BIE-operated and tribally-operated schools to ensure their  funds are being used for their intended purpose to provide students a  quality education.", "Strategic workforce planning for oversight of school expenditures is  especially important for BIE as it implements a recently announced  restructuring. On June 13, 2014, the Secretary of the Interior issued an  Order to restructure BIE using existing resources for the 2014-15 school  year. The Order emphasizes the importance of improving academic  achievement at BIE schools and creates new offices in BIE as well as  transferring responsibilities for certain school support services from other  Indian Affairs offices to BIE. However, the Secretarial Order does not  address any issues regarding the oversight of school expenditures. For  example, although line offices are discussed within the context of  restructuring and will still be responsible for providing technical assistance  to schools, it is unclear whether they will continue to have a role in  monitoring school expenditures. Further, the Order is silent on the status  and roles of Performance and Accountability and the Administration  office, the two other BIE entities currently involved in monitoring school  expenditures. In addition, the Order does not address concerns about the  shortage of staff responsible for overseeing school expenditures or gaps  in their expertise and training. In late June 2014, a senior BIE official  said that the status of Performance and Accountability is still unclear and  that the Administration office will become BIE\u2019s School Operations  Division, responsible for acquisition and grants, among many other  duties.", "Although the Secretarial Order requires the Assistant Secretary-Indian  Affairs to complete an analysis of new work functions and develop  workforce plans, it is unclear if the workforce plans will address whether  BIE has an adequate number of staff with the required knowledge and  skills to oversee BIE school spending. Moreover, the timeframe for  completing these activities is limited. Specifically, the Order directs BIE  and the Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs to complete these activities in  less than 3 months\u2014from mid June through August 2014. As of mid- August, high-ranking officials reported that BIE was unlikely to meet these  timeframes. This compressed timeframe makes it extremely challenging  to conduct effective workforce planning. According to our prior work, as  part of workforce planning an agency should first identify current and  future needs, including the appropriate number of employees, the key  competencies and skills for mission accomplishment, and the appropriate  deployment of staff across the agency. After completing these activities,  the agency should then create strategies for identifying and filling gaps.", "While BIE is restructuring to improve operational support to schools and  enhance school performance, it must also ensure that federal funding to  the schools is used for its intended purposes. Therefore, it is critical to  ensure that there are sufficient staff assigned to oversee school  expenditures and that they have the appropriate expertise and training to  do so. If BIE does not develop a detailed workforce plan for staff  overseeing school expenditures, its ability to effectively provide technical  assistance to tribes and build tribal capacity to operate schools will be  impaired."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BIE\u2019s Processes Are Not Adequate to Ensure that School Funds Are Spent Appropriately", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "BIE Lacks Consistent Processes for Documenting and Sharing Findings and Overseeing Major Programs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Single Audits", "paragraphs": ["BIE oversees tribally-operated school spending primarily through  information provided in the schools\u2019 annual single audits; however, it does  not have a process in place for consistently documenting actions it takes  to respond to audit findings.

BIE officials told us they could not produce documents for  the remaining five schools because the line office staff assigned to  oversee the schools\u2019 spending had either retired or were unavailable. As  a result of not having a process to document what steps BIE took to  address the issues identified at the schools, BIE staff newly assigned to  oversee these schools\u2019 expenditures have no way to determine how their  schools\u2019 audit findings were resolved. Consequently, they must start  anew when following up on future single audit findings and other  oversight activities. Without a mechanism to ensure sustained oversight  of school expenditures, BIE is not well-positioned to improve financial  management at these schools and ensure they are spending Interior and  Education funds to provide Indian students a quality education.

Performance and Accountability officials told us  they have requested access to single audits from Administration officials  in the past, but they told us their requests were not honored because of  technological challenges related to BIE\u2019s computer network.

This would help them determine whether schools are  complying with Education program requirements, such as whether IDEA  funds are being used to provide special education services for students  with disabilities. Additionally, the officials said the audits would help them  identify tribally-operated schools that have large unexpended IDEA  balances from year to year and may not be using funds to provide needed  services to students. To the extent that Performance and Accountability  staff do not have access to needed documents, it hinders BIE\u2019s ability to  hold others accountable for use of government resources.

Absent written oversight procedures, BIE  is at risk of obtaining and relying on varied and incomplete information to  determine whether its schools are using funds as intended. Written  procedures are particularly important for BIE\u2019s oversight of tribally- operated schools since BIE plans to increase their number in coming  years and the Tribally Controlled Schools Act limits the amount of  information that tribes must submit to BIE. If funds are not used for their  intended purpose, students in BIE schools may not receive the services  they need, such as tutoring and other forms of instruction.", "In contrast to the lack of written procedures for overseeing ISEP  expenditures, Performance and Accountability staff have developed draft  procedures for overseeing schools\u2019 IDEA spending and are in the process  of developing them for ESEA-funded programs (see table 2). The draft  procedures for overseeing IDEA funds include detailed written  instructions for conducting both fiscal desk audits of schools and on-site  oversight reviews. For example, the desk audit instructions include a list  of all the financial documents that staff will review, outline a detailed  process for determining the risk level of each school for meeting IDEA  fiscal requirements, and describe follow-up actions to be taken depending  on the schools\u2019 level of risk.", "In addition to not having comprehensive written procedures for oversight,  Administration officials reported they do not consistently document the  results of monitoring, including on-site visits, which is particularly  important given recent staff departures. In addition, BIE officials reported  that a line office administrator had solely conducted monitoring activities  in fiscal years 2010 through 2012 at a school with a history of poor  management of ISEP funds.

BIE officials said they typically wait for  suggestions from line office staff to determine which schools to monitor  on-site, and they typically visit schools in close proximity to their offices.  This approach is consistent with BIE\u2019s tendency to rely on its practice  history, rather than standard oversight processes. While this approach  may, in isolation, allow BIE to identify some schools that need additional  oversight or assistance, federal internal control standards call for a more  comprehensive analysis, and they state that management needs to  comprehensively identify risks.", "A line office administrator we interviewed reported that given his  increased workload in recent years and travel budget constraints he has  been unable to visit schools for which he is responsible and whose single  audits have identified serious financial weaknesses. For example, he has  been unable to visit one school\u2014which is at a significant distance from  his office\u2014whose audit found $1 million or more in questioned costs over  multiple years.", "According to written responses to questions we posed, BIE indicated that  monitoring visits to all schools have been infrequent over the past few  years due to budget constraints and travel restrictions. Given these  budget constraints as well as staff shortages, it is critical for BIE to use its  existing resources to target schools for monitoring that have been  identified in their single audits as at high risk of misusing federal funds.  Internal control standards state that the scope and frequency of  monitoring should depend primarily on the assessment of risks and the  effectiveness of ongoing monitoring procedures.", "Absent a risk-based approach, federal funds may continue to be provided  to schools with a history of financial weaknesses. For example, as of July  2014, single audits of tribally-operated schools identified $13.8 million in  costs that were not allowable at 24 schools, but we found minimal follow- up by BIE with the schools that had misused funds or did not adhere to  program or legal requirements. Further, it appeared that BIE took little  action to incentivize schools to adhere to financial and program  requirements. According to Circular A-133, issued pursuant to the Single  Audit Act, if an auditee, such as a tribally-operated school, has not  completed corrective action, the agency awarding the auditee\u2019s grant  should give it a timetable for follow-up. Further, according to Indian  Affairs\u2019 policy manual, if a tribally-operated school fails to take the action  necessary to resolve findings in its single audit, BIE should offer technical  assistance to the school if the audit findings remain unresolved. In serious  situations, BIE may also designate the school as \u201chigh risk,\u201d which  subjects the school to additional monitoring and restricted payments. If  BIE determines that there has been gross negligence or mismanagement  in the handling or use of funds, it may initiate procedures to assume  control of the school.", "In our review of single audits of six tribally-operated schools whose audits  in fiscal years 2010 through 2012 identified poor financial management of  major program funds, we found some occasions where BIE took little  follow up action to address serious financial problems that auditors  identified at the schools. For example:  In 2010, auditors found that one school used $1.2 million of its ISEP  funds to provide a no-interest loan to a local public school district,  which the auditors found is not permitted by law. In 2011 BIE asked  the school to repay the more than $1 million and is still negotiating  with the school to recoup the funds. Nevertheless, BIE could not  provide us with records that line office staff visited the school or  provided additional oversight of school expenditures or technical  assistance during the past 3 years. In the meantime, a subsequent  audit found that the school has not taken any steps to ensure that its  funds are not misused again and that it is still at risk of comingling  federal funds with the local school district funds. However, BIE has  continued to provide the school its full ISEP funding without additional  monitoring or restrictions on those payments.", "At another school that received an adverse audit opinion 3 years in a  row (fiscal years 2010 to 2012), auditors found that the school\u2019s  financial statements had to be materially adjusted by as much as  nearly $1.9 million. As a result, they found that the financial reports  that the school submitted to BIE for those 3 years were unreliable.  Despite these problems, BIE was unable to provide any evidence that  it took action to increase oversight of the school\u2019s expenditures to  ensure that it could accurately account for the federal funds it spends.", "More recent examples of financial issues at BIE schools include:  In February 2014, during our review of the Federal Audit  Clearinghouse database, we found that one school had not submitted  its required single audits since fiscal year 2010. Officials with BIE and  the Office of Internal Evaluation and Assessment were not aware of  this, and acknowledged that it was an oversight on their part when we  brought it to their attention. According to Indian Affairs, the Office of  Internal Evaluation and Assessment subsequently updated this  information in its system. However, despite a legal requirement for  tribally-operated schools to submit annual single audits, BIE has not  imposed sanctions on this school.", "A March 2014 single audit found that a tribally-operated school lost  $1.7 million in federal funds that were illegally transferred to an off- shore bank account. According to the school\u2019s audit, about $500,000  of these funds were subsequently returned to the school\u2019s account,  making the net loss around $1.2 million. Interior reported in October  2014 that this incident was \u201c\u2026a result of cybercrimes committed by  computer hackers and/or other causes\u201d and that the school is working  with tribal authorities to investigate the incident. Nevertheless, the  school\u2019s single audit stated that its inadequate cash management and  risk assessment procedures contributed to the incident and stated that  the school must strengthen these procedures. Additionally, a school  administrator reported that the school held at least another $6 million  in federal funds in a U.S. bank account. As of June 2014, BIE had not  yet determined how the tribe accrued that much in unspent federal  funds.", "Several BIE officials told us that some tribes operating schools have a  history of placing Interior and Education funds in savings accounts  rather than using them to provide educational services as intended.  One official cited an instance of a school accumulating over $900,000  in unspent IDEA funds that were intended to be used to provide  special education services to students with disabilities.", "According to a June 2014 study commissioned by the Secretaries of the  Interior and Education, the Tribally Controlled Schools Act provides an  incentive for schools not to spend funds they receive from Interior and  Education because schools are permitted to retain certain unspent federal  funds, and they can also place any current or unspent funds in interest- bearing accounts before they are spent. Based on certain audit  information that was available, the study found that approximately 80  tribally-operated schools have retained a total of about $125 million in  unspent funds that have accumulated over time. According to the study,  BIE has contributed to this problem by not implementing policies that  encourage schools to fully utilize their funding and discourage them from  planning to have unspent funds. The study stated that BIE and Education  should provide tribes with technical assistance and practical guidance  about the activities for which federal funds are allowed to be spent under  current laws. Education is currently developing this type of guidance and,  according to Indian Affairs, it is working with Education to develop this  type of guidance.", "Without using a risk-based approach to monitoring and having written  procedures in place to oversee school expenditures, the amount of  misused and unspent funds at BIE schools is likely to grow."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["BIE\u2019s mission is to provide the students attending its schools a quality  education.

To ensure  that students have access to these services, it is imperative that BIE  accurately track and oversee school expenditures to make sure that  federal funds are used for their intended purposes. However, BIE staff  responsible for oversight currently face multiple challenges, and their  monitoring of expenditures is weak. High staff turnover and reductions in  the number of education line office administrators as well as their lack of  expertise and training have left them struggling to adequately monitor  school expenses. In addition, the limited information that BIE officials  have about tribally-operated school expenditures is not shared with the  BIE staff responsible for overseeing schools\u2019 use of Education funds.  Further, BIE does not utilize tools, such as written procedures and a risk- based approach to monitor school expenditures that would help improve  the effectiveness of its oversight. Within this environment, BIE is not well  positioned to oversee schools that may be at high risk for misusing  federal funds. Strong oversight of school expenditures is especially critical  since the number of tribally-operated schools is likely to increase over the  next several years and limited expenditure information is available from  these schools.

We  assessed the reliability of data for this school year from these systems in  several ways, including (1) electronic data tests, (2) reviews of related  documentation about the data and the system, and (3) interviews with  knowledgeable agency officials. Based on our assessment, we  determined that the relevant data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.", "BIE and DOD are the only two federal entities that directly oversee the  management and operation of elementary and secondary schools. For  this review, we were unable to compare expenditures at schools operated  by the Department of Defense (DOD) schools with those of BIE or public  schools because DOD\u2019s financial system containing school year 2009-10  data was not sufficiently reliable for our purposes of comparing amounts  across departments. Specifically, DOD\u2019s Standard Accounting and  Reporting System-Field Level data system contains expenditure data for  DOD schools that we determined were not sufficiently reliable for our  purposes, based on reviews of related documentation about the data and  the system, as well as interviews with knowledgeable agency officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nationwide Comparison", "paragraphs": ["To compare expenditures at BIE and public schools, we developed  estimates of per-pupil expenditures at the national level. Although  Interior\u2019s Federal Financial System does not use categories that directly  align with Education\u2019s Common Core of Data, we were able to compare  broad categories, based on reviews of documentation, professional  judgment and interviews with agency officials. We focused our analysis  on operating expenditures of elementary and secondary schools in a  typical year. We classified BIE expenditure data and Education  expenditure data into four broad categories: (1) instruction, (2)  transportation, (3) facilities operation and maintenance, and (4)  administration. Then, we derived per-pupil expenditures by dividing  expenditure amounts by student enrollment. Due to our focus on  operating expenditures, we generally excluded certain amounts such as  expenditures for food service, capital (i.e., construction), and debt service.", "Student enrollment is measured differently by BIE and Education. BIE  measures enrollment as an average daily membership, or an average  over the course of the year. We derived student enrollment by adding  average daily membership for students in school year 2009-10 who are  eligible Indian students under the Indian School Equalization Program  (ISEP) and those who are not eligible Indian students but still attend BIE  schools, such as children of BIE staff. Because we used student  enrollment in one particular year and we included students who are not  eligible under ISEP but still attend BIE schools, our enrollment data may  differ somewhat from published data from Interior. Meanwhile,  Education\u2019s Common Core of Data measures student enrollment by  taking a head count at one point in time in the fall.", "Consistent with the methodology of our 2003 report, we generally  analyzed expenditures of BIE-operated day schools. Thus, we analyzed  day schools and excluded boarding schools, which have a boarding as  well as an academic component. We also limited our analysis to all 32  day schools that were BIE-operated in school year 2009-10. Of 185 BIE  schools and dormitories, BIE-operated day schools represent about 17  percent of the schools and dormitories. As with our 2003 report and  Education\u2019s publication on its School District Finance Survey for school  year 2009-10, we did not adjust expenditures for geographic variation.", "We excluded schools that were tribally-operated because BIE has limited  expenditure data for tribally-operated schools. In our 2003 report, we  recommended, among other things, that the Secretary of the Interior  should consider entering into negotiations with tribal entities to acquire  detailed expenditure data for the schools they manage for comparison  with public schools. However, Indian Affairs, in consultation with the  school boards of tribally-operated schools, concluded that this  recommendation would not be feasible with the school boards\u2019 existing  systems. BIE headquarters officials noted that current law limits the type  or format of information that the agency can require from tribes, including  data on expenditures. For example, one statutory provision requires a  tribal grantee to submit an annual financial statement reporting revenue  and expenditures and an annual financial audit, but the grantee has  discretion on the specifications of the cost accounting of the statement.", "Additionally, we reviewed seven reports of Education data on the  characteristics of public and BIE schools. These characteristics helped to  explain differences in per-pupil expenditures between public and BIE  schools. We generally reviewed the most recent version available of  these studies. Estimates obtained from reports that used sample data  collected using random probability samples are subject to sampling error.  We present estimates along with 95 percent confidence intervals to show  the precision of those estimates.

We conducted site  visits to BIE schools that serve the Oglala Sioux Tribe in Pine Ridge,  South Dakota; the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians; the Navajo  Nation in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah; and various Pueblo Indians in  New Mexico, where we interviewed school administrators and observed  school conditions. We also requested expenditure data from tribally- operated schools because BIE has limited expenditure data from schools  operated by tribes. Further, we interviewed administrators at public school  districts in close proximity to the BIE schools we visited. We selected  locations to visit to reflect an array of BIE schools that varied in  administration type, school and tribal size, and location.

We determined that the data for these four BIE schools  and two public school districts were sufficiently reliable. We excluded data  from the remaining 12 BIE schools and 2 public school districts we visited  because we did not receive any expenditure data or were not able to  obtain reliable expenditure data for both the BIE schools and the nearby  public school districts.

For more analysis of single audit  findings, we selected for further review the single audits of six recipients  of Indian School Equalization Program (ISEP) funding, the largest funding  source of BIE schools. We selected these recipients based on audit  opinions of their compliance with program requirements. Specifically, we  examined all the single audits in which the auditor found that the school\u2019s  records for ISEP compliance either contained significant departures from  generally accepted auditing standards or were in a condition that made it  impossible for them to be assessed in accordance with generally  accepted auditing standards. We also examined the single audits of  select tribally-operated schools based on information from BIE officials.  Although our non-generalizable sample focused on schools with poor  financial management, these schools may have needed the greatest  oversight and technical assistance from BIE to correct the audit findings  and improve their financial management. We assessed the reliability of  the Federal Audit Clearinghouse data on single audits by (1) reviewing  existing information about the data and systems that produced them, and  (2) obtaining information from U.S. Census Bureau officials  knowledgeable about the database.
