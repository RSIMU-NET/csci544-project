It issued its 2005 and 2006 reports over 5 months late because the commissioners' appointment dates and the commission work cycle activities are not aligned with the annual reporting deadline. For example, over half the commissioners' terms will expire in December, 5 months before they are to approve and issue the 2008 report. However, the commission has taken steps to comply with applicable provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The commission's organizational structure and management policies and procedures have weaknesses and are not in accordance with GAO's internal control standards for the federal government. The commission has not formally defined and assigned key management duties and responsibilities that are typically divided or segregated among different people. Also, policies and procedures were insufficient, incomplete, or not adequately documented. For example, GAO found that the commission had no written policies or procedures to ensure that the procurement of certain goods and services was transparent, competitive, and at the best value. Internal control over financial management and reporting was not adequate to provide reasonable assurance that activities were properly processed and recorded and complied with federal laws and regulations. GAO noted weak or missing internal controls in three broad areas. In examining non-payroll-related financial transactions, GAO found inadequate documentation, lack of proper authorization and approval, and improper classification, including $13,000 in questionable purchases. The purchase and travel card programs lacked written guidance, proper segregation of duties, and adequate training. Also, time and attendance records were not always approved according to the commission's policies and procedures. As a result of inadequate control in these areas, the commission's financial resources are at an increased risk of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In October 2000, Congress established the U.S.-China Economic and  In October 2000, Congress established the U.S.-China Economic and  Security Review Commission (USCESRC).

They should appoint  commissioners no later than 30 days after the date on which each new  Congress convenes. Congress regularly convenes on January 3, unless  Congress by law designates a different day to convene. Thus, they  normally should appoint commissioners no later than February 2. In  practice, they have appointed 26 of 45 commissioners after this date. For  example, in 2003, the commission did not produce an annual report  because the required number of commissioners to form a quorum was not  appointed or reappointed until May 6, 2003, giving the commission only 26  days to issue its annual report by the June 1 deadline. Figure 2 shows the  actual ranges of commissioner appointment dates.", "The current misalignment makes it difficult for the commission to develop  and produce the annual reports on schedule. The chairman, vice chairman,  and executive director estimate that the commission needs about 11  months to conduct the work and research necessary to produce a robust  annual report that addresses the required economic and security issue  areas and that reflects bipartisan consensus. Thus, moving the annual  report submission date or the timing of commissioner appointments would  provide a work cycle with enough time to develop and produce a report on  schedule, according to the commission. If the annual work schedule were  aligned with the June 1 deadline, without changing the commissioners\u2019  terms, newly appointed commissioners would be required to participate in  determining key findings and recommendations to Congress based on  activities that occurred before they were appointed, according to the three  most recent chairmen. Furthermore, the composition of the commission  could change significantly in the middle of the reporting cycle. For  example, in 2007, the 2-year terms of seven commissioners, including the  current chairman and vice chairman, will expire on December 31,  5 months before the 2008 report is due.

According to the executive director, the  commission informally evaluated staff in 2005 and 2006 and will formally  evaluate its staff in 2007. The commission\u2019s new employee performance  management policy and procedures aim to motivate staff to perform at  their highest levels and give supervisors instruments to evaluate  employees\u2019 performance.

According to the commission staff, the errors occurred  when the commission notified GSA that the funds should be obligated  based on the purchase order but mistakenly placed the obligated balances  on the pending accruals worksheet submitted to GSA at year end. In  following up, we found that the related goods and services were received  and paid for in fiscal year 2007.", "During our review, we also noted that the commission did not develop or  document criteria for official representation expenses or a means to  properly track appropriated funds for this purpose.

They included transactions at Macy\u2019s, Sam  Goody, and Corner Bakery.", "The associate director told us that all of the questionable purchases we  identified were for official commission business. According to the  commission, all of the purchases from the Senate gift shop were small  items such as pens or business card cases that were presented as gifts  during commission fact-finding trips to China and Taiwan. Over three- fourths of the purchases in table 5 were for food, which included catering  for commission hearings or quarterly business meetings. According to the  associate director, the food was primarily for commissioners, commission  staff, and witnesses working exclusively on a particular hearing where it  may have been inconvenient or counterproductive to break for lunch. We  did observe instances where nongovernmental personnel participated in  various panel sessions at certain hearings, and it may have been beneficial  for scheduling purposes to provide lunch or other refreshments.

We reviewed all applicable T&A records for  four commissioners in fiscal years 2005 and 2006 and found that 37  percent were not reviewed and approved by the executive director in  accordance with the described policies and procedures. We also reviewed  selected T&A records for three commission staff for fiscal years 2005 and  2006 and found that over one-half were not approved by the executive  director, and 10 of the 25 staff T&A records we reviewed were not  approved by a certifying officer in accordance with commission policy.  According to the commission staff responsible for payroll, the certifying  officer is responsible for (1) reviewing T&A records to ensure that each  one is properly approved by the executive director and (2) affirming that  the hours are accurately entered into the online payroll data entry system  that the commission uses to communicate with GSA. Failure to adhere to  this policy increases the risk that inaccurate or inappropriate time charges  will be entered into the system, resulting in potential errors in wages paid  and recorded by the commission.

We identified a great range in the  number of hours charged by the commissioners in fiscal years 2005 and  2006, from some commissioners who did not charge any time to  commission activities, to one commissioner who charged almost 1,900  hours in one fiscal year. We also noted several instances where the  number of hours charged to commission activities and paid to a  commissioner exceeded the standard 80 hours for the pay period. While  exceeding 80 hours in a given pay period is permissible, this practice and  other changes to the time and attendance information resulted in  numerous manual adjustments to the Commission\u2019s recorded payroll to  reflect the excess hours or retroactive time. Manual adjustments can lead  to inaccuracies and inconsistencies and provide opportunities for error.

We encourage the commission to adopt these  standards, which give management of federal agencies, regardless of  size, the responsibility and discretion to develop and implement the  mechanisms for internal control necessary for providing reasonable  assurance that the objectives of the agency are being achieved with  regard to effective and efficient operations, reliable financial reporting,  and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  2.  We characterize the commission\u2019s views on pages 5 and 46.  3.  With regard to the section on internal control over financial reporting,  and the projection of the results of the statistical sample over  nonpayroll transactions, the commission requested specific wording  changes related to the potential impropriety or illegality of all or any  specific transactions. We did not make those changes because the  objective of the sampling performed was to determine whether the  controls over non-payroll-related transactions were in place and  operating effectively. As stated in the objectives, scope, and  methodology in appendix I, we selected a statistical sample of 59 debit  transactions totaling approximately $1.1 million from a population of  1,991 debit transactions totaling approximately $4.5 million for fiscal  years 2005 and 2006 to test specific internal control activities over non- payroll-related transactions, such as adequacy of supporting  documentation, evidence of proper authorization or approval, and  proper classification. The non-payroll-related population included  transactions related to purchasing, travel, leases, payment to  contracted employees and other miscellaneous transactions. Results  from the statistical sample were projected to the population of non- payroll-related transactions for fiscal years 2005 and 2006, where we  estimated that the dollar value on non-payroll-related debit  transactions with ineffective controls during the 2-year period we  examined is not more than $1.2 million. Because this $1.2 million  estimate exceeds the tolerable error of $224,715, we concluded that  the controls were ineffective as stated in the report.  4.

We did not review the specific transaction  details related to this practice, and we are unable to say to what  portion of the $9,386 this practice applies.
