Prior to the establishment of the Department of Energy's (DOE) Supply Project in fiscal year 2011 to produce new plutonium-238 (Pu-238), NASA officials said that Pu-238 supply was a limiting factor in selecting RPS-powered missions. After the initiation of the Supply Project, however, NASA officials GAO interviewed said that missions are selected independently of decisions on how to power them. Once a mission is selected, NASA considers power sources early in its mission review process. Multiple factors could affect NASA's demand for RPS and Pu-238. For example, high costs associated with RPS and missions can affect the demand for RPS because, according to officials, NASA's budget can only support one RPS mission about every 4 years. Expected technological advances in RPS efficiency could reduce NASA's demand for RPS and Pu-238.", "DOE has made progress in reestablishing Pu-238 production to meet NASA's future demand to fuel RPS and has identified challenges to meeting its production goals. Specifically, since the start of the Supply Project, DOE has produced 100 grams of Pu-238 and expects to finalize production processes and produce interim quantities by 2019. However, DOE has also identified several challenges to meeting the Supply Project goal of producing 1.5 kilograms (kg) of new Pu-238 per year by 2026. DOE officials GAO interviewed said that DOE has not perfected the chemical processing required to extract new Pu-238 from irradiated targets to meet production goals. These officials also said that achieving the Pu-238 production goal is contingent on the use of two reactors, but only one reactor is currently qualified for Pu-238 production while the second reactor awaits scheduled maintenance. Moreover, while DOE has adopted a new approach for managing the Supply Project and RPS production\u2014based on a constant production approach\u2014the agency has not developed an implementation plan that identifies milestones and interim steps that can be used to demonstrate progress in meeting production goals and addressing previously identified challenges. GAO's prior work shows that plans that include milestones and interim steps help an agency to set priorities, use resources efficiently, and monitor progress in achieving agency goals. By developing a plan with milestones and interim steps for DOE's approach to managing Pu-238 and RPS production, DOE can show progress in implementing its approach and make adjustments when necessary. Lastly, DOE's new approach to managing the Supply Project does not improve its ability to assess the potential long-term effects of challenges DOE identified, such as chemical processing and reactor availability, or to communicate these effects to NASA. For example, DOE officials did not explain how the new approach would help assess the long-term effects of challenges, such as those related to chemical processing. Under Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government , agencies should use quality information to achieve objectives and to communicate externally, so that external parties can help achieve agency objectives. Without the ability to assess the long-term effects of known challenges and communicate those effects to NASA, DOE may be jeopardizing NASA's ability to use RPS as a power source for future missions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our recent work on radioisotope  power systems. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA) has long used radioisotope power systems (RPS) to generate  reliable electrical power and heat energy for long-duration space  missions. RPS can operate where solar panels or batteries would be  ineffective or impossible to use, such as in deep space or in shadowed  craters, by converting heat from the natural radioactive decay of  plutonium-238 (Pu-238) into electricity. The Department of Energy (DOE)  and its predecessor agencies have been providing Pu-238 and fabricating  RPS for NASA and other federal agencies for more than 5 decades.", "In 2011, with funding provided by NASA, DOE initiated the Pu-238 Supply  Project (Supply Project) to reestablish the capability to domestically  produce Pu-238. According to DOE documents and agency officials,  DOE currently maintains about 35 kilograms (kg) of Pu-238 isotope  designated for NASA missions, about half of which currently meets the  power specifications for spaceflight. However, given NASA\u2019s current  plans for solar system exploration, this supply could be exhausted within  the next decade. Specifically, NASA plans to use about 3.5 kg of Pu-238  isotope for one RPS to power the Mars 2020 mission. NASA may also  use an additional 10.5 kg of Pu-238 isotope for its New Frontiers #4  mission if three RPS are used. If DOE\u2019s existing Pu-238 supply is used  for these two missions, NASA would be forced to eliminate or delay future  missions requiring RPS until DOE produces or acquires more Pu-238.", "My remarks today are based on our recent report on NASA\u2019s use of  radioisotope power systems that are powered by plutonium 238, which  we are releasing today. Our report examined (1) how NASA selects RPS  for missions and what factors affect NASA\u2019s demand for RPS and Pu- 238; and (2) DOE\u2019s progress in meeting NASA\u2019s RPS and Pu-238  demand, and what, if any, challenges DOE faces in meeting the demand.  Today, I will discuss the key findings and recommendations from that  report.", "For our report, we reviewed documentation on how NASA considered  mission requirements during the agency\u2019s planning for recent missions  that considered or used RPS as a power source. We also interviewed  officials from the Planetary Science Division (PSD) of NASA\u2019s Science  Mission Directorate and from the Human Exploration and Operations  Mission Directorate. In addition, we reviewed documentation related to  DOE\u2019s efforts to develop the Supply Project and DOE\u2019s RPS production  process. We also interviewed officials from DOE\u2019s Office of Nuclear  Energy as well as officials involved in RPS work at three DOE national  laboratories\u2014Idaho National Laboratory (INL), Los Alamos National  Laboratory (LANL), and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)\u2014and  conducted site visits to ORNL and INL. More detailed information on the  objectives, scope, and methodology of our work can be found in the  September report. The work upon which this statement is based was  conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.", "In summary, we found that NASA selects RPS for missions based  primarily on scientific objectives and that several factors may affect  NASA\u2019s demand for RPS and Pu-238. For example, RPS have been  typically used on NASA\u2019s most expensive and highest priority missions.  Based on expected funding levels, NASA can only support two or three of  these missions per decade. We also found that DOE has made progress  meeting NASA\u2019s demand for RPS and Pu-238, but the agency faces  some challenges in reaching full production goals. For example, DOE  does not maintain a comprehensive system for tracking RPS production  risks. In addition, DOE\u2019s management approach does not allow for the  agency to adequately communicate long-term production challenges to  NASA. We made several recommendations to DOE to address these  issues. DOE agreed with our recommendations and outlined actions it  planned to take to address them."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["RPS are long-lived sources of spacecraft electrical power and heating  that are rugged, compact, highly reliable, and relatively insensitive to  radiation and other effects of the space environment, according to NASA  documentation.

Scientific and mission objectives influence the types of  equipment needed for the mission, including the mission\u2019s power source.  According to NASA officials we interviewed, missions in NASA\u2019s PSD  portfolio are generally classified in three ways:", "Flagship. Flagship missions are the largest and most expensive class  of NASA\u2019s missions, costing $2 billion or more, and are given the  highest priority for resources, including funding, infrastructure, and  launch support. Past Flagship missions that have used RPS include  the Galileo, Cassini, and Curiosity missions. NASA\u2019s Mars 2020  mission is a planned Flagship mission using RPS.", "New Frontiers. New Frontiers missions focus on enhancing our  understanding of the solar system and have a development cost cap  of $850 million. To date, there has been one New Frontiers mission  using RPS (New Horizons).", "Discovery. Missions in the Discovery program have a development  cost cap of $450 million to $500 million and have shorter development  time frames, according to NASA officials and documentation. No  Discovery mission has been powered by RPS.", "DOE oversees the design, development, fabrication, testing, and delivery  of RPS to meet NASA\u2019s overall systems requirements, specifications, and  schedules. DOE\u2019s goal under its Supply Project is to reach a full Pu-238  production rate of 1.5 kg per year by 2023, at the earliest, with a late  completion date of 2026. DOE also established an interim production rate  of 300 to 500 grams per year by 2019, to ensure an adequate supply of  Pu-238 for NASA\u2019s near-term missions, before the full production rate  goal is achieved. The Supply Project involves a number of steps across  several DOE national laboratories, including the use of two DOE research  reactors\u2014the High Flux Isotope Reactor at ORNL, and the Advanced  Test Reactor at INL.", "NASA began fully funding DOE\u2019s Supply Project in 2011, and since 2014,  has been responsible for funding all aspects of RPS production  operations, according to NASA documents. NASA funds DOE\u2019s efforts to  build, test, and fuel RPS, as well as to update equipment and sustain  staffing levels associated with RPS production between missions. Since  2014 NASA has provided, on average, approximately $50 million per year  to support DOE\u2019s ongoing operations and maintenance of RPS  production equipment. Since its inception until early 2017, DOE has used  a short-term and incremental segmented management approach to  manage the Supply Project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NASA Selects RPS for Missions Based Primarily on Scientific Objectives, and Several Factors May Affect NASA\u2019s Demand for RPS and Pu-238", "paragraphs": ["NASA selects RPS to power its missions primarily based on scientific  objectives and mission destinations. According to NASA officials we  interviewed, the need for RPS is usually apparent based on the mission\u2019s  scientific objectives and destination. For instance, an RPS is more likely  to be needed for a mission to a distant planet, where minimal sunlight  reduces the effectiveness of solar power. NASA officials we interviewed  stated that, consistent with the National Space Policy, the agency uses  RPS when they enable or significantly enhance a mission, or when  alternative power sources, such as solar power, might significantly  compromise mission objectives. NASA prioritizes mission selection  based on missions identified in the National Academy of Sciences\u2019  decadal survey report, which represents the highest priorities of the  scientific community and includes many missions that require the use of  RPS.", "Prior to the establishment of DOE\u2019s Supply Project in fiscal year 2011,  NASA officials we interviewed stated that mission selections were  influenced by the limited amount of available Pu-238. These same  officials told us that missions are now selected independently from  decisions about how they will be powered. However, projected availability  of Pu-238 is factored into whether an RPS is available for a specific  mission opportunity.", "In addition to the scientific objectives of planned and potential space  exploration missions, several other factors may affect NASA\u2019s demand for  RPS and Pu-238:", "Costs associated with missions that typically require RPS.", "According to NASA officials, RPS have typically been used on  Flagship missions that cost $2 billion or more. NASA can support no  more than one mission using RPS about every 4 years\u2014or two to  three missions per decade\u2014based on expected agency funding  levels.", "Cost of RPS relative to mission costs. According to NASA officials,  New Frontiers missions may be good candidates to use RPS;  however, given the cost cap for this mission class, one RPS would  account for about 9 percent of the mission\u2019s budget, while three RPS  would account for almost 14 percent. For Discovery missions, for  which the cost of using RPS would represent a large portion of a  Discovery mission budget, a single RPS would represent more than  17 percent of a mission\u2019s development cap.", "DOE\u2019s production capability. According to DOE officials we  interviewed, it can take up to 6 years to acquire, fuel, test, and deliver  a new RPS for a NASA mission. According to DOE and NASA officials  we interviewed, given the current floor space dedicated to RPS  development at INL and limits on staff exposure to radiation at LANL,  DOE only has the capacity to produce three to four RPS at one time.  To accommodate DOE\u2019s current RPS production capability, NASA  officials we interviewed said they will not select two consecutive  missions requiring RPS.", "Technological advances may reduce the demand for Pu-238 and thus  RPS. For example, according to NASA officials, advances in solar power  technology have realistically expanded the ability to use solar power for  missions for which it would not have been considered before, and these  advances could help address low levels of light intensity for deep space  missions. NASA also is developing new RPS technologies that may  reduce its demand for Pu-238 and thus RPS. For example, NASA officials  told us that they plan to invest in dynamic RPS technology that could  increase RPS efficiency and require less RPS to achieve mission power.  NASA research indicates that dynamic RPS designs could be more than  four times as efficient as the current MMRTG design.", "The Supply Project goal of producing 1.5 kg of Pu-238 per year was  established to support two to three PSD missions using RPS each  decade, and NASA does not anticipate other potential users to affect  demand for RPS or Pu-238, according to NASA and DOE officials and  documentation we reviewed. DOE planning documents and NASA  officials we interviewed stated that current RPS and Pu-238 production  levels expected from the Supply Project are intended to only meet PSD\u2019s  demand. NASA officials said that they did not account for potential  demand from other potential users within NASA, the national security  community, or commercial sectors when establishing current Pu-238  production goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Has Made Progress Meeting NASA\u2019s RPS and Pu- 238 Demand, but Faces Challenges Reaching Full Production Goals", "paragraphs": ["DOE has made progress meeting NASA\u2019s future demand for Pu-238 to  fuel RPS.

However, given  DOE\u2019s Supply Project and RPS production schedule, and NASA\u2019s current  space exploration plans to use up to four RPS for its Mars 2020 and New  Frontiers #4 missions, DOE\u2019s existing Pu-238 supply will be exhausted by  2025.", "Moreover, DOE officials we interviewed from INL, LANL, and ORNL  identified several challenges, including perfecting and scaling up chemical  processing and the availability of reactors, that need to be overcome for  DOE to meet its projected Supply Project goal of producing 1.5 kg per  year of Pu-238 by 2026, at the latest. If these challenges are not  overcome, DOE could experience delays in producing Pu-238 to fuel RPS  for future NASA missions.", "DOE\u2019s ability to meet its production goal and support future NASA  missions is at risk if certain steps for chemical processing necessary for  the production of Pu-238 are not improved and scaled up. According to  DOE officials we interviewed, DOE is still in the experimental stage and  has not perfected certain chemical processing measures required to  extract new Pu-238 isotope from irradiated targets, creating a bottleneck  in the Supply Project and putting production goals at risk.", "In addition, reactor availability will be necessary for DOE to achieve its  Pu-238 production goals. Officials we interviewed at INL and ORNL said  that achieving 1.5 kg of Pu-238 per year is contingent on the availability of  positions within both the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) and the  Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) to irradiate neptunium targets for  conversion to Pu-238 isotope. DOE officials said HFIR can produce  approximately 600 grams of Pu-238 isotope and they plan to use  positions within ATR to achieve full production goals; however, ATR has  not been qualified for Supply Project work. In addition, DOE officials said  that ATR\u2019s availability for the Supply Project may be limited due to  competition from other users. DOE officials said that they will be unable to  meet full Pu-238 production goals if positions in ATR, which are already  over-utilized, are not available for Pu-238 isotope production and that  they do not have a plan to address this challenge.", "These and other challenges identified in our September 2017 report may  place DOE\u2019s RPS and Pu-238 production goals at risk, in part, because of  the short-term and incremental segmented management approach DOE  had used to manage the Supply Project since its inception in 2011  through early 2017. In March 2017, DOE officials we interviewed said that  the agency anticipated moving to a constant GPHS production rate  approach to help provide funding flexibility and stabilize RPS production  staffing levels between NASA missions. In June 2017, DOE officials we  interviewed said that implementing a constant GPHS production rate  approach would also address other previously identified challenges  associated with RPS production and the Supply Project and therefore  decided to discontinue its short-term and incremental segmented  management approach.", "However, DOE officials we interviewed did not describe how the new  constant GPHS production rate approach would help them address some  of the longer-term challenges previously identified by the agency, such as  scaling up and perfecting chemical processing. We found that DOE has  yet to develop an implementation plan for the new approach, with defined  tasks and milestones, that can be used to show progress toward  assessing challenges, demonstrate how risks are being addressed, or  assist in making adjustments to its efforts when necessary. Our previous  work has shown that without defined tasks and milestones, it is difficult for  agencies to set priorities, use resources efficiently, and monitor progress  toward achieving program objectives.", "In our September 2017 report, we recommended that DOE develop a  plan that outlined interim steps and milestones that would allow the  agency to monitor and assess the implementation of its new approach for  managing Pu-238 and RPS production. DOE agreed with our  recommendation and noted it was in the process of implementing an  approach for the RPS supply chain that was more responsive to NASA\u2019s  needs, among other things. DOE also noted that it was developing an  integrated program plan to implement and document the agency\u2019s new  approach and expected this to be completed in September 2018. We  believe that the development of an integrated program plan is an  important step and that any such plan should include defined tasks and  milestones, so that DOE can demonstrate progress toward achieving its  RPS supply chain goals.", "In addition, in our September 2017 report we identified another factor that  could undermine DOE\u2019s ability to inform NASA about previously identified  challenges to reach its full Pu-238 production goal. We found that DOE  does not maintain a comprehensive system for tracking RPS production  risks and, instead, relies on individual laboratories to track and manage  risks specific to their laboratories. Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government call for agency management to identify, analyze,  and respond to risks related to achieving defined objectives. We  recommended that DOE develop a more comprehensive system to track  systemic risks, beyond the specific technical risks identified by individual  laboratories. Doing so would better position DOE to assess the long-term  effects of the challenges associated with its Pu-238 and RPS production  objectives. DOE agreed with our recommendation and stated that the  agency would include steps to ensure that its risk assessment system  would include comprehensive programmatic risks.", "Finally, in our September 2017 report we found that DOE\u2019s new approach  to managing RPS and Pu-238 production does not allow for DOE to  adequately communicate long-term challenges to NASA. It is also unclear  how DOE will use its new management approach to communicate to  NASA challenges related to Pu-238 production. As a result, NASA may  not have adequate information to plan for future missions using RPS.  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government call for agency  management to use quality information to achieve agency objectives and  communicate quality information externally through reporting lines so that  external parties can help achieve agency objectives and address related  risks. In our September 2017 report, we recommended that DOE assess  the long-term effects that known challenges may have on Pu-238  production quantities, time frames, and required funding, and  communicate these potential effects to NASA. DOE stated that it agreed  with our recommendation and would work with NASA to identify, assess,  and develop plans to address known challenges. DOE also stated that  the agency expected to complete this effort in September 2019.", "Chairman Babin, Ranking Member Bera, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
