The new system could also improve project management by allowing office managers to determine how long an applicant has been involved in the consultation or HCP process and whether the recommended time frames for completing consultations and the targeted frames for processing HCPs have been exceeded. The Carlsbad office will still have difficulty completing its consultations and HCP projects within recommended or targeted time frames if it is unable to address its staffing problems. An inability to hire new staff and retain existing, experienced staff has made it difficult for the Carlsbad office to meet the demands of its workload. Because the Carlsbad office does not maintain its project files in accordance with federal internal control standards and FWS' guidelines, there has often been confusion between the office and its customers on what was agreed to and why.

The Secretary of the Interior, through the Fish and Wildlife Service, generally is responsible for implementing the act for freshwater and land species. Section 9 of the act, its primary species protection provision, and the act\u2019s implementing regulations generally prohibit the taking\u2014killing, harming, or harassing\u2014 of threatened or endangered fish and wildlife species that are federally listed. In conjunction with this provision, the act also established two important processes that provide for the protection of listed species\u2014the consultation process, under section 7, and the habitat conservation planning process, under section 10. The Service\u2019s field offices, like Carlsbad, are responsible for, among other things, implementing sections 7 and 10 of the act.", "Section 7 requires federal agencies to consult with the Service to determine whether a proposed action that is federally authorized, carried out, or funded is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or adversely modify or destroy its critical habitat. To determine this, the Service conducts informal and formal consultations. Informal consultations, which precede formal consultations, may include discussions of whether a listed species inhabits the proposed action area and what affect the action may have on the species. Formal consultations are conducted when a federal agency determines that its actions may affect a listed species or its critical habitat and submits a written request to initiate formal consultation. From these consultations, the field office writes a biological opinion of whether the proposed action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or adversely affect its critical habitat. If this is likely to occur, the biological opinion will propose reasonable and prudent alternatives to the proposed action, if they are available. If the federal agency or landowner agrees to a suggested alternative, the consultation is concluded and the proposed action may proceed. If jeopardy is unlikely but an incidental take could still occur, the biological opinion will provide reasonable and prudent measures to minimize the impact of the take.", "Likewise, section 10 of the act requires that landowners engaged in activities likely to cause the incidental taking of listed species, but not requiring federal authorization or funding, develop an HCP and obtain a permit allowing for the incidental take. An HCP specifies, among other things, what measures will be taken to minimize and mitigate the adverse effects on listed species. The Service\u2019s field offices are responsible for assisting the applicant in preparing the HCP, ensuring that the HCP and the associated documents are complete, and coordinating with the appropriate regional office throughout development, approval, and implementation. Once a field office accepts a proposed plan as complete, the field office and the regional office jointly review the feasibility of the draft HCP. The regional office cannot approve a plan and issue an incidental take permit if doing so would appreciably reduce the species\u2019 chances of survival and recovery, among other things.

According to Service officials, most of the time spent on HCPs is needed by the applicant to develop the initial plan and then modify it to comply with the Service\u2019s guidelines before a field office can accept it as a completed application. However, once a regional office receives a complete application for its review and approval, the Service has established targeted time frames for the regional office to process the application. These time frames depend on the HCP\u2019s size, complexity, and potential impact. Specifically, as part of the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, an environmental impact statement (EIS) usually accompanies a large, complex, high-impact plan. A medium-size, medium-complex, medium-impact plan is often accompanied by an environmental assessment (EA), and a small, less complex, low-impact plan generally does not need either an EIS or an EA. The Service\u2019s targeted time frame for processing low-impact plans is less than 3 months from the receipt of a complete application; for plans of medium impact, it is from 3 to 5 months; and for high-impact plans, it is within 10 months. The Service allows these targeted processing time frames to be exceeded for reasons such as controversy regarding the project and staff or workload problems. Once a complete application is received, the Service notifies the public that it has a minimum of 30 days to review and comment on the HCP and any environmental impact analysis. If the regional office approves the plan, it issues an incidental take permit.

Furthermore, the Carlsbad office could not provide the data needed to determine whether targeted time frames had been met for one plan. We used the data that we obtained for the remaining 26 plans and determined that the Portland regional office and the California/Neveda operations office did not meet the targeted time frames for 11 plans (42 percent) that it reviewed. The amount of time by which these dates were missed ranged from about 20 days to about 880 days. The time frames were missed by less than 2 months for five plans, between 4 and 10 months for three plans, and by more than 19 months for three plans. We did not conduct audit work at the Portland regional office or the California/Nevada operations office to determine why the processing time frames were not met.

A consultation involving an applicant cannot be extended for more than 60 days without the applicant\u2019s consent.", "In the Carlsbad office, the reasons for extending consultation time frames include (1) the office\u2019s need for more time to analyze the data it received from a federal agency or to prepare the final biological opinion or (2) the other federal agency\u2019s need for more time to provide data or review the draft biological opinion. In two of the formal consultations we reviewed, the Carlsbad office obtained extensions to review information that the applicant submitted and to prepare the biological opinion. The Service extended the consultations by about 4 months for one project and 2-1/2 months for the other.", "The Service also has established targeted time frames for processing HCPs, which can also be extended for such issues as controversy regarding the project or staff or workload problems. We focused our review on the operations of the Carlsbad field office.

The standards are to ensure that the federal government provides the highest quality service possible to the American people. According to the executive order, all executive departments and agencies that directly provide the public with significant services shall, among other things, post customer service standards and measure results against them; make information, services, and complaint systems easily accessible; and provide a means to address customer complaints. To comply with the President\u2019s initiative, as part of the National Performance Review (NPR) efforts, teams of staff from various federal government agencies embarked on a series of benchmarking studies, one of which was to determine which businesses\u2014public and private\u2014are doing the best job of customer complaint resolution. The best complaint systems identified had, among other things, processes to make it easy for customers to complain through customer help telephone lines, 1-800 numbers, or complaint/comment cards. The best systems also had fully automated and integrated information systems in which to enter complaint data that can be analyzed and used to identify and fix root causes of the dissatisfaction and determine the future direction for product and service improvements.", "To implement the requirements of Executive Order No. 12862, the Service issued Customer Service Policy 96-02 (effective, Aug. 6, 1996). According to the policy, all of the Service\u2019s employees are expected to fully comply with the spirit and intent of the standards that were established to guide their actions as public servants. The policy establishes six standards\u2014 among them is that (1) customers be treated with courtesy and responded to in a timely and professional manner and (2) employees maintain a professional appearance and positive attitude. However, the Service\u2019s policy does not address how to handle customer complaints or how to make information services and complaint systems easily accessible to customers, as directed by the executive order.", "Despite this lack of guidance, Carlsbad officials said that they take complaints seriously, and they have established an informal system for handling them. Specifically, the office accepts customer feedback in various forms, including letters, E-mail, in-person meetings, and telephone calls. According to the Carlsbad officials, complaints are routed to the supervisor of the affected employee or to the branch or division chief that has responsibility for the specific project. Depending on the nature of the complaint, the line supervisor may elevate the action to senior management or handle the complaint directly. Supervisors maintain their own files for the complaints they handle. The types of complaints that the office receives vary. For example, some complaints stem from misunderstandings. When a complaint is more serious, such as an employee\u2019s treating a customer harshly or in an unprofessional manner, the immediate supervisor has the responsibility to counsel the affected employee and identify corrective actions. Carlsbad officials stated that supervisors may or may not document these types of complaints. However, if a supervisor receives recurring complaints about an employee\u2019s performance and conduct, the supervisor is to addresses the issue through the employee\u2019s annual performance plan, which has indicators relating to quality of work, teamwork, and customer service. An employee who does not perform the critical elements related to these indicators can be placed on a performance improvement plan, which is a prerequisite for a reduction in grade or removal.", "The Carlsbad office\u2019s informal customer complaint system does not record and classify data on complaints so they can be analyzed and used to identify trends and solutions to common problems. Instead, Carlsbad management relies on being apprised of complaints in weekly supervisor and staff meetings. Management also relies on the supervisors, who handle the complaints, to identify any patterns or frequency of complaints against specific employees. However, Carlsbad officials said that each supervisor might track complaints differently. The Carlsbad office also does not have standard documentation requirements or a centralized filing system for the complaints it receives.", "The Service stated that it has been working to improve its customer service program. Specifically, the Service has designated the development of a customer feedback process as a critical component of its Strategic and Annual Performance Plans prepared under the Government Performance and Results Act. The Service has also placed a site on its Webpage, where customers can voice concerns or provide comments. An additional Website is offered by the Service\u2019s Midwest region.", "Furthermore, although not required, the Service has been working with the Department to create a centralized customer complaint system.", "The Service noted that the Department established a task force to recommend ways to improve its customer service. The task force recommended that the Department establish an automated database system that would capture, track, and report on customers\u2019 complaints Department-wide. According to the Service, this proposed on-line information system would be designed to support the performance of the front-line staff who interact with customers and assist them in answering customers\u2019 inquiries quickly and accurately. The system would compile complaint information electronically in order to better align services to meet customers\u2019 expectations. A complaint data report would be generated for managers to indicate the root cause of complaints, when a complaint is resolved, and related statistics.

This system, if properly implemented, should improve the office\u2019s record keeping and its ability to track the status of projects and help determine why they are in that status. Accurate information on the office\u2019s workload should also help the office justify its staffing and budget requests. The new system could also improve project management by allowing office managers to determine how long an applicant has been involved in the consultation or HCP process and whether the recommended time frames for completing consultations and the targeted time frames for processing HCPs have been exceeded. Also, although the Fish and Wildlife Service has no requirements for how its field offices track their workload, if the new tracking system is successful, other field offices might want to use it to obtain the same benefits.", "Although the new tracking system will potentially contain much needed information on the status of a project, project files need to be maintained to document and confirm that the data in the system are correct. The Carlsbad office does not maintain its project files in accordance with federal internal control standards and the Service\u2019s guidelines. Currently, project files are located in three different buildings instead of being centrally located and readily available for examination. Furthermore, project files often do not contain a complete history of the project, including written documentation of the proposals and the agreements reached between the office and its applicants or other federal agencies. Without this information, there has often been confusion between the office and its customers on what was agreed to and why. In addition, without adequate documentation, managers and others have a difficult time determining whether the status of a project is justified. For example, if the Service and an applicant agree upon an extension of time to complete a consultation and that information is not in the files, managers may not know that the reason why a project exceeded recommended time frames was justified and supported. The Service has also embarked upon an effort to have its offices periodically verify and correct the information in its nationwide HCP database.", "Although installing a new tracking system and verifying the HCP database are steps in the right direction, these initiatives do not address the Carlsbad office\u2019s ability to complete its consultations and HCP projects within the recommended or targeted time frames. The Carlsbad office will still have difficulty accomplishing this if it is not able to do something about its staffing problems. An inability to hire new staff and retain existing, experienced staff has made it difficult for the Carlsbad office to meet the demands of its workload.", "Finally, the Service\u2019s customer service policy does not address how to handle complaints or how to make complaint systems easily accessible to its customers, as discussed in Executive Order No. 12862. Although the Carlsbad office has developed an informal process for handling customer complaints, this process does not ensure managers that all complaints received are directed to the proper office personnel and are properly resolved. It also does not ensure that complaint data are centrally collected and analyzed to help ensure that root causes of the dissatisfaction are identified and fixed. Furthermore, Carlsbad\u2019s informal process does not include procedures for recording and documenting complaints and their resolution. The Service stated that neither it nor the Department has a centralized customer complaint system but one has been recommended for Department-wide implementation when funds become available.

In addition, the Carlsbad office is developing quality control standards for the tracking system to ensure prompt and accurate data entry, periodic reviews of the database and files, and training on the use of the database. The Department stated that the Carlsbad project tracking system would need to be evaluated and compared with other field office systems to determine whether it, or something similar, can be used to provide more consistency in tracking workload throughout the Service. In addition, the Carlsbad office has identified several mechanisms to improve the documentation of agreements between applicants and their office and is working to streamline recruitment and identify incentives to retain experienced staff biologists. Finally, the Department stated that the Service plans to review its customer service policy for appropriate revisions in accordance with applicable departmental requirements.", "In its comments, the Department also raised a concern about our analysis of the number of formal consultations that exceeded the recommended 135-day time frame. The Department stated that although the report appropriately recognizes that some of the consultations could have agreed-upon extensions and therefore could have been completed within allowable time frames, the report did not attempt to assess the degree to which consultations were late. The Department stated that on the basis of the Carlsbad office\u2019s analysis of 20 biological opinions issued from 40 to 60 days after the 135-day formal consultation time frame, 8 (40 percent) should not be considered late. Specifically, one consultation had an approved time extension; another was initiated without the required information; two received information needed to complete the consultation after it was initiated, and the Service would have been justified in requesting an extension; for one consultation, the applicant was provided with a draft biological opinion within 35 days of its initiation; and for three consultations, we did not have correct initiation and completion dates. Our report states that we did not attempt to determine how many consultations had agreed-upon time extensions. The purpose of our analysis was only to demonstrate how many consultations exceeded the 135-day time frame\u2014not the number of days and not whether the additional time was justified. The fact remains that the Carlsbad office had the wrong information recorded in its logs for all eight projects.", "The Department also said that we should more clearly indicate that the time frames for processing HCPs are only targets and that given the complexity of the projects in the Carlsbad office, it would not be unusual for some projects to exceed these time frames.

Specifically, we selected the entries for 30 informal and 30 formal consultations that had been logged with both beginning and completion dates and reviewed the Carlsbad office\u2019s files to verify that documentation existed to support those dates. In addition, we provided Carlsbad officials with a list of formal consultations that did not have beginning and/or completion dates on the logs. Our purpose was to get as many dates as possible so we would have better confidence in estimating how long it takes to complete formal consultations. Lastly, we sampled the entries for 30 informal consultations that did not have the beginning and/or completion dates recorded on the logs to determine whether documentation existed in the files to support a date. The sampling error associated with our estimates is discussed in appendix II.", "To determine how the office tracks its HCP workload, we started by obtaining a computer printout for each plan in the Service\u2019s nationwide HCP database that had been processed through the Carlsbad office.

We separately calculated the time expended for the remainder of the consultations recorded on the logs, including those consultations for which Carlsbad officials subsequently provided dates. We compared the results of our calculations for the 30 samples with the other calculations and determined that there were no statistically significant differences between them. Because the differences were not statistically significant, we used the logs to calculate the length of time taken to complete formal consultations for the entire universe of those for which we had beginning and completion dates.", "We also determined whether the Service\u2019s targeted time frames for processing HCPs submitted by the Carlsbad office were being met by the Portland regional office.

To obtain municipal, county, state, and federal approval for the project, the developer was required to address multiple environmental issues. Several of these issues focused on the project\u2019s impacts on federally listed endangered species, including the desert tortoise, the southwestern willow flycatcher, and the desert slender salamander as well as the Peninsular bighorn sheep. When the developer initially proposed the project, the Peninsular big horn sheep was listed by the state of California as threatened and was proposed to be federally listed. Although the developer had to consider impacts on several species, the concerns he shared with us focused on Peninsular bighorn sheep.", "Before construction on the project could begin, the developer needed to obtain a Clean Water Act section 404 permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) because of the project\u2019s anticipated impacts on waters of the United States. The Corps, in turn, determined that the project could affect federally listed and proposed species. Therefore, in accordance with the Endangered Species Act, the Corps was required to initiate a section 7 consultation with the Service to determine whether the project\u2019s impacts would jeopardize the continued existence of the listed species.", "The developer had four primary concerns regarding how the Service handled the Corps\u2019 consultation. First, the developer was frustrated over the time it had taken to move the project forward and did not agree with the Service\u2019s jeopardy determination regarding Peninsular bighorn sheep that was conveyed in a conference opinion to the Corps. Second, the developer believed that the reasonable and prudent alternative that the Service offered to avoid the jeopardy determination was not technologically or economically feasible. Third, the developer was frustrated that Carlsbad officials had required him to complete several redesigns of the project to comply with concerns about the project\u2019s impacts on Peninsular bighorn sheep but then rejected each revision. Fourth, the developer believed that the sheep would not use his property regardless of the project\u2019s configuration because heavy traffic on the road adjacent to his project already deterred sheep from crossing the road to habitat on the other side of the project site. Figure 3 is a map of the general project area that illustrates many of the following issues."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Jeopardy Determination", "paragraphs": ["The developer maintained that the project plan that he submitted to the Service adequately addressed any adverse impacts on Peninsular bighorn sheep even though he did not believe that the species resided on his property.

He believed that his project plan addressed all the requirements outlined in a court supervised settlement agreement that resulted from a lawsuit filed by the California Department of Fish and Game regarding the project\u2019s impacts on the sheep. Consequently, he did not believe that any more project modifications were necessary. Finally, he claimed that he had been in negotiations with the Service for 8 years without resolution of these issues.", "According to Carlsbad officials, the jeopardy determination was reviewed and supported by the Portland regional office, which signed the conference opinion. In 1997, eight herds of female Peninsular bighorn sheep existed in the United States, and each was considered critical by the Service for maintaining the viability of the entire population (then about 280 sheep). The jeopardy determination was based on the Service\u2019s conclusion that the project would likely result in an overall reduction of about 14 percent (40 of 280) of the U.S. Peninsular bighorn sheep population. Carlsbad officials explained that the project, as submitted, would lead to the demise of the only remaining herd of big horn sheep in the San Jacinto Mountains (about 19 sheep). Carlsbad officials concluded that the loss of this herd would also likely lead to the loss of a biologically viable herd located just south of the San Jacinto Mountains herd in the neighboring northern Santa Rosa Mountains (about 21 sheep). Carlsbad concluded that the loss of two of the eight herds of Peninsular bighorn sheep in the United States\u2014a 25-percent reduction on the total number of herds\u2014would reduce the chances for the population\u2019s recovery and eventual delisting. According to Carlsbad officials, this would occur because of decreases in the genetic diversity of the population, the number of sheep available for movement between herds, and the ability for the herds to expand their range.", "The Service concluded that the development would fragment valuable sheep habitat into at least two relatively isolated habitat areas, interfere with sheep dispersal, and sever the connection to important unoccupied habitat that the Service believes is needed to sustain the herd over time. Specifically, Service officials maintained that for large mammals, such as the Peninsular bighorn sheep, to avoid extinction at a regional scale, the movement of individuals must be sufficient enough to allow the species to repopulate areas where local extinction has occurred. The Service maintained that the project would reduce the ability of the sheep to access important mountain slopes, canyon bottoms, water sources, and forage areas, thereby reducing the likelihood for sheep range expansion and population recovery.", "Finally, because the project would establish a hotel, among other structures, the Service anticipated that increased fire suppression practices would occur over the life of the project and would result in the sheep\u2019s eventual abandonment of the habitat. Carlsbad officials provided biological evidence suggesting that increased fire suppression practices associated with human development are one of several factors leading to the abandonment of habitat by bighorn sheep and has been associated with the loss of sheep herds in other areas, such as Arizona. Bighorn sheep show a strong preference for habitats providing good visibility because they provide the sheep with the greatest security from predators. Fire suppression causes brush to accumulate over time and reduces visibility for the sheep.", "The developer stated that biological experts supported his position that the project would not adversely affect the sheep. However, Carlsbad officials presented us with a letter from one of the biological experts that the developer had used to support his claim. The expert wrote that because some of his comments had been misrepresented and projected out of context by the developer, he was unwilling to become more involved in the project. Furthermore, the letter stated that the project was clearly situated within the sheep\u2019s habitat.", "We spoke with two of the three experts who consulted with the developer about the project. Both stated that although their involvement with the project was limited, the project was situated within the sheep\u2019s habitat. However, because the area had already been heavily affected by previous development, they would not recommend sheep conservation in the area. Additionally, both experts agreed that the heavily used road adjacent to the project boundary was a major factor contributing to the poor quality of the habitat. Finally, neither expert knew how the development project would affect the overall population of Peninsular bighorn sheep, but they agreed that the herd located close to the proposed development project was already dwindling because of previous development.", "The developer believed that he had fulfilled his requirements to protect the sheep in the court-supervised settlement agreement with the California Department of Fish and Game. Carlsbad officials stated that the Service had no jurisdiction over the project at that time. In reviewing the settlement agreement, we found that the Service was not a party to the agreement. The agreement was between the developer and the California Department of Fish and Game. When the Carlsbad office became involved in the project through the section 7 process, it did not agree with some of the conditions of the settlement agreement. These disagreements included concerns about the configuration of the project site and its effects on the sheep\u2019s movement. Finally, Carlsbad officials explained that the developer had been involved in a larger process that included many other stakeholders, such as the City of Palm Springs and the California Department of Fish and Game, for about 8 years. They also provided documentation showing that the Carlsbad office\u2019s involvement under the section 7 consultation process had been ongoing for about 2 of those years.

The developer maintained that it was not possible to develop the golf course within the area recommended by the alternative because part of the golf course would have been in a \u201cno-development\u201d zone as mandated by the settlement agreement with the California Department of Fish and Game. Furthermore, the developer stated that the alternative\u2019s requirement to construct a fence around the project was in direct violation of the settlement agreement.

Furthermore, he did not understand the basis for requiring a $500,000 preservation and research endowment fund for the sheep. We reviewed the settlement agreement and did not find any requirements that specifically precluded fencing the project area and Carlsbad officials maintain that a fence around the project site was necessary to prevent sheep from accessing the developed property. Regarding the endowment fund, Carlsbad officials stated that no separate estimate was made to establish its amount. However, they stated that the amount was commensurate with other development projects of similar size and scope. Currently, the Service uses a computer software program to determine amounts of endowment funds.

The developer has a county- approved development plan and a state-certified environmental impact report. However, before any construction can begin, the developer needs to obtain a Clean Water Act section 404 permit from the Corps because of the project\u2019s anticipated impacts on waters of the United States. During the 404 permitting process, the Corps determined that the project could affect some federally listed species. To comply with the Endangered Species Act, the Corps initiated consultation with the Service in 1999 to determine the extent of the project\u2019s impact on those species at the site.

First, the developer disagreed with the Carlsbad office\u2019s position that he offset for impacts on six pairs of gnatcatchers because his biologist had identified only five pair during biological surveys of the project\u2019s site. Second, the developer believed that the Carlsbad office\u2019s suggestion that he conserve land on-site to complete a flight corridor for the gnatcatchers was inappropriate because these birds were not sighted in the vicinity of the proposed corridor during the biological surveys. Third, the developer believed that the Carlsbad office was over extending its authority by requesting that a habitat corridor be preserved on the project site for use by species that were not federally listed. He said that all these actions would require a redesign of the project, which would reduce the number of houses that could be built and cause significant revenue losses. Figure 4 is a map of the project area that illustrates many of these issues."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Offsetting Measures for Six Pairs of Gnatcatchers", "paragraphs": ["The developer explained that when his biologists initially conducted biological surveys on the project site, only five pairs of gnatcatchers were identified. These surveys were in compliance with the Service\u2019s protocols and had been initially accepted by the Carlsbad office. However, during an on-site field visit attended by Carlsbad officials, a Service biologist and the developers biological consultant sighted a pair of gnatcatchers on the developer\u2019s land in an area where the birds had not been previously sighted. This area was directly adjacent to other land that was anticipated to have gnatcatchers on it. The developer maintained that Carlsbad officials increased the number of birds from five to six pairs on the basis of this visual sighting rather than by a survey or other documentation, thereby requiring the developer to offset project impacts on more birds. He questioned the office\u2019s conclusion because gnatcatchers are known to expand their ranges during the nonbreeding season, which is when the sighting occurred. The developer maintained that the new pair had either already been counted in the biological survey or were birds that did not reside on his property. In either case, he believed that little evidence supported the increase in the number of gnatcatcher pairs.", "Carlsbad officials explained that Service guidelines required them to be conservative in their conclusions and to err on the side of the species. Carlsbad officials also stated that in their professional judgment, the sixth pair of gnatcatchers was additional to the birds identified in the biological survey. They based this conclusion on the location of the sighting. Carlsbad officials pointed out that biological surveys often do not capture all members of a species that use a site. The Service uses these surveys as a benchmark for determining a project\u2019s effects and the appropriate offsetting measures. If new members of a species are identified during the consultation process, the Service considers this information as the best and most current available and determines offsetting measures accordingly. Carlsbad officials agreed that gnatcatchers expand their ranges during the nonbreeding season, but they did not believe that any of the original five pairs would expand their range to the area where the additional pair was found. They said that it was more likely that the additional birds used on-site and off-site habitat contiguous with the location where the birds were sighted and less likely that the birds represented one of the five pairs to the north, as these birds were isolated by unsuitable habitat. Because the birds were observed foraging on-site, and on the basis of the gnatcatcher\u2019s known behavior, Carlsbad officials determined that at least a portion of the use area for these birds occurred within the project boundary. Therefore, based on the best available scientific information, the office included the birds in the number of pairs the developer needed to consider in developing offsetting measures to reduce the project\u2019s impacts on the species."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Flight Corridor for Gnatcatchers", "paragraphs": ["The developer believed that the Carlsbad office\u2019s request that he conserve land on-site to complete a flight corridor for the gnatcatchers was inappropriate because this species was not sighted in the vicinity of the proposed corridor during the biological surveys. Carlsbad officials stated that the size and shape of areas used by gnatcatchers are significantly larger than any area that is defined on the basis of a presence/absence survey and that gnatcatchers likely used habitat contiguous with and including the proposed flight corridor. Carlsbad officials explained that they suggested this area for a corridor when the developer expressed interest in conserving gnatcatchers on-site rather than providing off-site property as an offsetting measure for the taking of the species. They told the developer that if he wanted to conserve gnatcatchers on-site, he would need to ensure that the property would support the birds in perpetuity. Carlsbad officials stated that the flight corridor would allow the gnatcatchers the opportunity to immigrate to and emigrate from the property and provided us with documents supporting their position that gnatcatchers use highway right-of-ways for dispersal purposes. Carlsbad officials suggested that the developer locate the flight corridor in an area of his property that already has gnatcatcher habitat and in an area that is directly across the highway from additional gnatcatcher habitat.

Carlsbad officials said that the corridor was needed because the applicant wanted to conserve some of the gnatcatchers on the property and to accomplish this, the developer needed to provide viable habitat for the birds. Carlsbad officials stated that the corridor would provide a means for large predators, such as coyotes, to access the property. Large predators are known to prey on midsize and small predators (such as raccoons, skunks, and domestic cats) that prey on gnatcatchers. Carlsbad officials provided scientific evidence to support their position that a lack of large predators can lead to high levels of smaller predators, which prey on birds.", "Carlsbad officials stated the issue of a nonlisted species habitat corridor was first discussed in 1995 with officials from Riverside County who had asked the office to comment on a proposed project layout submitted to the county by the developer. At that time, they stated that the developer was working on obtaining approval of his development plan from local jurisdictions and that Carlsbad officials expressed the importance of maintaining wildlife corridors in the area to county officials. As part of their assistance, Carlsbad officials and officials from the California Department of Fish and Game conducted surveys on potential corridors that remained in the area to connect the already established Lake Mathew\u2019s Multispecies Habitat Conservation Plan with the Cleveland National Forest. Because the corridor was one of the last connections between these two large conservation areas, officials from both agencies maintained that it was imperative that the corridor be conserved.

The utility company included nonlisted species in its HCP as a proactive measure to avoid the need for piecemeal additions of species to the HCP if a species were to become listed.", "In 1995, the HCP was completed, and the Service issued an incidental take permit that covered 110 species. The permit allowed the utility company to perform maintenance and construction activities. In 1997, the Quino Checkerspot butterfly was federally listed as endangered, however, under the existing permit, incidental takes of the butterfly was not authorized because the HCP did not include provisions to ensure the butterfly\u2019s continued existence.

At the time that the HCPs were being analyzed, only one population of Quino Checkerspot butterfly was known to exist in San Diego County. Additionally, in some years, more individual butterflies may be detected while in other years only a small number of individuals may be detected. The ability for biologists to detect butterflies in the field is affected by local environmental conditions, especially the amount and timing of rainfall. If rains are insufficient or if rains fall at the wrong time of year, the butterfly\u2019s host plant may not persist long enough for the butterfly to go through its life cycle from caterpillar to adult butterfly.
