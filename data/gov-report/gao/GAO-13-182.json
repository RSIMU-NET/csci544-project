GAO also found that DOD components have conducted reviews of the health care needs of servicewomen during deployments and are collecting data on the medical services provided to deployed servicewomen.", "At the 15 selected locations GAO visited in Afghanistan and aboard Navy vessels, health care providers and most servicewomen indicated that the available health care services generally met deployed servicewomen's needs. In Afghanistan and aboard Navy vessels, health care providers said they were capable of providing a wide range of the female-specific health care services that deployed servicewomen might seek, and servicewomen GAO spoke with indicated that deployed women's needs were generally being met. Specifically, based on information provided by the 92 servicewomen GAO interviewed, 60 indicated that they felt the medical and mental health needs of women were generally being met during deployments; 8 indicated they did not feel those needs were generally being met during deployments; an additional 8 indicated a mixed opinion; and 16 said they did not have an opinion. For example, some servicewomen told GAO that they were satisfied with their military health care, given the operating environment. Among those who expressed dissatisfaction with their military heath care, GAO heard a concern about difficulty in obtaining medications. Among those who expressed mixed views, a comment was raised that junior health care providers were limited in the types of procedures they could perform and lacked practical experience.", "DOD has taken steps to provide medical and mental health care to victims of sexual assault, but several factors affect the availability of care. For example, this care can vary by service and can be impacted by operational factors, such as transportation and communication challenges, that are inherent to the deployed environment. Further, military health care providers do not have a consistent understanding of their responsibilities in caring for sexual assault victims because the department has not established guidance for the treatment of injuries stemming from sexual assault--which requires that specific steps are taken while providing care to help ensure a victim's right to confidentiality. Additionally, while the services provide required annual refresher training to first responders, GAO found that some of these responders were not always aware of the health care services available to sexual assault victims because not all of them are completing the required training. Without having a clearer understanding of their responsibilities, health care providers and first responders will be impeded in their ability to provide effective support for servicewomen who are victims of sexual assault."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To enhance the medical and mental health care for servicewomen who are victims of sexual assault, GAO recommends that DOD (1) develop department-level guidance on the provision of care to victims of sexual assault; and (2) take steps to improve first responders' compliance with the department's requirements for annual refresher training.

Navy medical providers  we spoke with told us that the Navy does not require that its vessels  deploy with a provider trained to conduct a forensic examination, and will  instead transfer a victim to the nearest trained provider, whether at sea or  ashore. Navy medical providers also told us that if a transfer is not  possible they would do their best to conduct the forensic examination  using the instructions provided with examination kits.", "Department of Defense, Fiscal Year 2011 Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the  Military (April 2012). treatment.

Specifically, in October 2005 DOD published a  directive that contains its comprehensive policy for the prevention of and  response to sexual assault. While generally applicable to all  servicemembers and locations, DOD\u2019s directive calls for the sexual  assault prevention and response program to be gender-responsive,  culturally competent, and recovery-oriented; and for an immediate,  trained sexual assault response capability to be available in deployed  locations.

According to DOD  Directive 5136.01, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs is  required to, among other things, exercise authority, direction, and control  over DOD medical policy, and to establish policies, procedures, and  standards that govern the management of DOD health and medical  programs. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health  Affairs has performed these responsibilities for some medical issues in  DOD, but it has not established guidance for the treatment of injuries  stemming from sexual assault\u2014a crime that requires a specialized level  of care to help ensure that forensic evidence is properly collected,  medical care is provided in a way that minimizes the risk of  revictimization, and a victim retains the right to disclose the assault with  confidentiality.", "Absent department-level guidance from DOD\u2019s Office of the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, the services have, to varying  degrees, revised their respective medical guidance to address care for  victims of sexual assault. For example, at one location we visited we  reviewed a command\u2019s medical policy and found that while the policy  addressed some responsibilities of health care providers in responding to  sexual assault incidents, it had not been updated to identify how care  should be modified for restricted reports of sexual assault. For example,  the policy addressed topics such as when and where forensic  examinations should be conducted, and health care provider  responsibilities for transferring evidence to law enforcement. However, it  did not mention DOD\u2019s policy on restricted reporting or provide guidance,  for example, on the use of non-identifying information to label and store  evidence collected from restricted reports of sexual assault. At another  location, we found that a command\u2019s medical policy contained  requirements for health care personnel that conflicted with their  responsibilities under restricted reporting. The policy required the  command\u2019s medical department representatives to document all injuries  and referrals of personnel for care, and to keep the commanding officer  and chain of command informed of medical conditions that affect the  health, safety, and readiness of all command personnel. However, the  policy was silent on the issue of sexual assault and did not identify  exceptions to these requirements or offer health care providers alternative  procedures for documenting and reporting medical issues associated with  restricted reports of sexual assault. Accordingly, we found that military  health care providers do not have a consistent understanding of their  responsibilities in caring for sexual assault victims. We met with senior  medical personnel from the command who confirmed that provisions in  their medical policy conflicted with other command policy and had created  confusion for health care providers regarding the extent of their  responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of victims who choose to  make a restricted report of sexual assault. These inconsistencies can put  DOD\u2019s restricted reporting option at risk, undermine DOD\u2019s efforts to  address sexual assault issues, and erode servicemembers\u2019 confidence.  As a consequence, sexual assault victims who want to keep their case  confidential may be reluctant to seek medical care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "First Responders Are Not Always Aware of the Health Care Services Available to Sexual Assault Victims", "paragraphs": ["DOD requires that personnel designated as first responders to sexual  assault incidents, whether in the United States or in deployed  environments, receive initial and annual refresher training on topics that  include available medical and mental health treatment options. Although  DOD provides this required training, we found that first responders we  met with were still unsure of the health care services available to sexual  assault victims at their respective locations. This was particularly the case  among first responders we met with during visits to selected locations in  the United States, in part because of the increased medical and mental  health care options that were available to them. For example, we  regularly found that Sexual Assault Response Coordinators, Victim  Advocates, and health care personnel differed in their understanding as  to where to take a sexual assault victim for a forensic examination\u2014a  potentially problematic issue, given that the quality of forensic evidence  diminishes the later it is collected following a sexual assault. The  Department of Justice\u2019s National Protocol for Sexual Assault Medical  Forensic Examinations identifies 72 hours after an assault occurs as the  standard cutoff time in many jurisdictions for collecting evidence (except  for blood alcohol determinations, which should be done within 24 hours of  ingestion of alcohol), but notes that evidence collection beyond that point  is conceivable. Additionally, we found that not all first responders fulfill the  requirement to annually complete refresher training on tasks DOD deems  essential to their role in responding to incidents of sexual assault.  According to DOD\u2019s instruction, first responders are required to complete  periodic refresher training on a variety of topics that include management  of restricted and unrestricted reports of sexual assault and local protocols  and procedures. DOD reported in its fiscal year 2011 Annual Report on  Sexual Assault in the Military that while each of the military services  continued to implement sexual assault prevention and response training  for first responders, not all first responders had completed the required  training. For example, DOD reported that for fiscal year 2011, the Army  trained only about 6,000 of the more than 17,000 personnel who served  as Sexual Assault Response Coordinators or Victim Advocates. Further,  DOD\u2019s report noted that only 69 percent of Department of Navy Victim  Advocates\u2014which include Navy and Marine Corps personnel\u2014 completed the required training, and the report also noted that some of  the training for Air Force first responders was overdue."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As women continue to assume an expanding and evolving role in the  military it is important that DOD be well positioned to meet the health care  needs of deployed servicewomen and ensure their readiness.

However,  DOD\u2019s limited health care guidance on the restricted sexual assault  reporting option and first responders\u2019 inconsistent knowledge about  available resources are factors that affect the quality and availability of  that care. Left unaddressed, such factors can undermine DOD\u2019s efforts to  address the problem of sexual assault in the military by eroding  servicemembers\u2019 confidence in the department\u2019s programs and  decreasing the likelihood that victims of sexual assault will turn to the  programs or seek care and treatment when needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that sexual assault victims have consistent access to  health care services and the reporting options specified in DOD\u2019s sexual  assault prevention and response policies, we recommend that the  Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel  and Readiness to direct the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health  Affairs to develop and implement department-level guidance on the  provision of medical and mental health care to victims of sexual assault  that specifies health care providers\u2019 responsibilities to respond to and  care for sexual assault victims, whether in the United States or in  deployed environments.", "To help ensure that Sexual Assault Response Coordinators, Victim  Advocates, and health care personnel have a consistent understanding of  the medical and mental health resources available at their respective  locations for sexual assault victims, we recommend that the Secretary of  Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness, in collaboration with the military departments, to take steps to  improve compliance regarding the completion of annual refresher training  on sexual assault prevention and response."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD stated in its cover letter  that, overall, the department did not concur with the report\u2019s findings and  conclusions.

DOD\u2019s justification of its assessment,  however, did not make clear why the department did not concur. Instead,  DOD provided examples of steps it has been taking that may help to  address the findings in this report. Specifically, DOD stated that, while the  second version of DOD Instruction 6495.02, entitled \u201cSexual Assault  Prevention and Response (SAPR) Program Procedures\u201d has been in  coordination for nearly 2 years and is not yet published, the revised  instruction will be comprehensive and will contain two medical  enclosures.

We cannot verify, therefore, whether the enclosures referenced in  DOD\u2019s comments will address our recommendation. However, we plan to  review the instruction when DOD finalizes it to determine whether it meets  the intent of our recommendation. Finally, DOD stated that the  department meets its oversight responsibilities with regard to sexual  assault response through training in graduate medical education and  through monitoring and oversight of the process that governs  credentialing and privileging of providers.
