For the MA program, CMS contracts with MA organizations (MAO) to  provide covered services to beneficiaries who enroll in one of their plans.  As of April 2014, CMS had 571 contracts with MAOs that served nearly  15.5 million enrollees, accounting for approximately 30 percent of all  Medicare beneficiaries. The Congressional Budget Office has projected  that enrollment in MA plans will increase to about 21 million enrollees by  2023 and that Medicare payments to MAOs will grow from about   $154 billion in 2014 to about $250 billion in 2023. As the MA program  expands, setting appropriate payments to MAOs and making Medicare a  more prudent purchaser of health care services will remain critical.", "Whereas Medicare pays FFS providers who submit claims for  reimbursement after services have been provided, Medicare pays MAOs  a fixed monthly amount per enrollee to cover all the services enrollees  use. CMS adjusts payments to MAOs to reflect enrollees\u2019 expected health  care costs, with higher payments for enrollees who are predicted to be  sicker and lower payments for those predicted to be healthier\u2014a process  known as risk adjustment. MAOs can incur losses if aggregate costs  exceed payments but can retain savings if aggregate costs are less than  payments.", "Since the 1980s, the methodology for setting MAO payments has  changed several times to better reflect the expected health care costs of  plan enrollees and to mitigate the effects of potential favorable selection.  The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 authorized payment  for full-risk Medicare plans on the basis of a fixed per beneficiary rate set  at 95 percent of the estimated average cost of beneficiaries in Medicare  FFS. We and other researchers criticized the accuracy of the  adjustment, which resulted in excess payments to plans that enrolled  healthier beneficiaries with below-average health care costs. In an effort  to refine the payment methodology, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997  required CMS to use health status measures to adjust plan payments and  required the agency to collect inpatient hospital data for this purpose. In  implementing these requirements in 2000, CMS selected a risk  adjustment method that relied on enrollee demographics augmented with  hospital inpatient data to measure health status. This risk adjustment  method more accurately matched MA payments to enrollees\u2019 expected  total Medicare costs compared with the previous method.", "In 2002, CMS transitioned to collecting a larger set of medical data\u2014via  the Risk Adjustment Processing System (RAPS)\u2014to risk adjust  payments. As required by law, the agency began using information on  enrollee demographics and diagnoses collected from MAOs for services  provided in physician office, hospital inpatient, and hospital outpatient  settings to risk adjust payments in 2004. Using these data in conjunction  with FFS beneficiaries\u2019 cost and diagnosis information, CMS developed  the hierarchical condition categories risk adjustment model that uses one  year\u2019s diagnoses to predict the following year\u2019s health care costs for each  MA enrollee. Although this model is better than the previous model\u2014 which estimated an MA enrollee\u2019s health status from certain inpatient  diagnosis and demographic factors\u2014at predicting an enrollee\u2019s costs, it  has led to overpayments to MAOs because of different diagnostic coding  patterns between the FFS and MA programs.", "In a 2008 final rule, CMS reasserted its authority to collect more detailed  data, referred to as encounter data. Such data include diagnosis and  treatment information for all medical services and items provided to an  enrollee, with a level of detail similar to FFS claims. In January 2012, after  a multiyear rollout, the agency began collecting such data from MAOs via  the Encounter Data System.

This  approach assumes that diagnostic coding practices are the same in MA  and FFS. Risk scores for beneficiaries with the same diagnoses and  characteristics should be identical, regardless of whether the beneficiaries  are in MA or Medicare FFS. However, MAOs have a greater incentive  than FFS providers to make sure that all diagnoses are coded, as this can  increase enrollees\u2019 risk scores and ultimately the payments plans receive.  In part because of this incentive, risk scores for MA enrollees may tend to  be higher relative to the risk scores of FFS beneficiaries who are in  similar health and have identical characteristics.", "To help ensure that MAOs are not overpaid as a result of these  differences in diagnostic coding, CMS makes a separate adjustment to  payments to MAOs.

According to CMS, the number of errors returned to MAOs  and the number of duplicate data files submitted per MAO can illustrate,  at least in part, the completeness and accuracy of the encounter data  submitted. For example, CMS performs automated checks to flag missing  data elements\u2014such as a contract ID number or a date of service\u2014in  encounter data files and returns files with missing elements to MAOs.  CMS also determines whether encounter data elements have the correct  alphanumeric values (e.g., that zip codes contain only numeric  characters) and verifies whether the values are consistent across data  elements (e.g., the date of service is before the date of data submission).  In addition, CMS ensures that the same data file is not accepted into the  Encounter Data System more than once, which would result in duplicate  data files.", "After performing these automated checks, CMS sends MAOs up to five  types of automated reports with details about the encounter data  submission, including information on the data received. These reports  provide information on whether errors occurred and whether encounter  data processing can continue so that MAOs can identify problems with  their data. CMS may provide additional reports if MAOs need to resubmit  the data to meet CMS\u2019s requirements. (See app. II for a summary of  CMS\u2019s automated reports for MAOs.) Although representatives from  MAOs noted that CMS has not always produced the automated reports  on a timely basis, CMS officials told us that they now produce the reports  within 1 week of encounter data submission. According to the MAO  representatives, the reports are generally useful, straightforward, and  easy to understand.", "CMS plans to develop four other automated reports related to data  submission and processing but has not established a time frame for doing  so. These reports are expected to determine the number of encounter data files accepted and rejected  identify encounter data submission errors and summarize the type of  errors found, provide additional details on rejected encounter data submissions, ascertain diagnoses that CMS accepted and will use to calculate risk  scores.", "Although CMS has had plans since at least October 2010 to develop a  report that identifies those diagnoses that it will use to calculate risk  scores, it still has not produced the report. MAOs we interviewed  expressed concern that CMS has not developed this report, which could  help them understand how encounter data will be incorporated into  CMS\u2019s risk score calculation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Has Not Yet Conducted Statistical Analyses Using MA Encounter Data", "paragraphs": ["Although CMS is aware of the need to perform statistical analyses of MA  encounter data, the agency has not yet conducted these analyses.  According to CMS\u2019s protocol for validating Medicaid encounter data,  analyzing values in specific data elements, generating basic statistics on  the volume and consistency of data elements, and periodically compiling  and reviewing statistics on utilization rates can help detect data validity  issues. In March 2014, CMS officials told us that they were able to only  summarize the volume of encounter data files by MA plan. The officials  stated that they would like to be able to determine the frequency of  diagnoses per encounter data file, examine the dates of service on  encounter data files, and compare MA encounter data with FFS claims  data by the summer of 2014. However, the officials noted that they have  not developed a specific time frame for performing statistical analyses  and that determining which analyses to perform will be an iterative  process over the next year or two. It appears that CMS will use encounter  data to calculate 2015 risk scores and pay MAOs before it performs  statistical analyses of the data.", "As CMS begins to analyze the quality of MA encounter data, several  types of statistical analyses outlined in its Medicaid validation protocol  may help detect potentially inaccurate or unreliable data. Such analyses  include the following:", "Determining whether the frequency of values within an  encounter data element is reasonable.

To examine the  completeness of Medicaid encounter data, a CMS contractor  assessed the average number of encounter data files per enrollee and  the percentage of enrollees with data files. As another example,  MAOs reporting an unexpectedly large number of a particular service  may suggest overreporting.", "Analyzing encounter data elements by demographic group,  provider type, and service type. For example, analyzing encounter  data by enrollees\u2019 gender would enable CMS to verify that data files  for gender-specific diagnoses and procedures are logical. Analyzing  encounter data by provider type helps identify missing or erroneous  data for specific provider types or discover fluctuations in enrollee  visits. For example, dramatic changes in utilization from one time  period to another may indicate erroneous data. Finally, analyzing  encounter data by service type also helps to examine the relationship  between (1) ancillary services (e.g., laboratory tests and x-rays)   and enrollee visits, (2) primary care and specialty care visits, or   (3) outpatient services and inpatient admissions.", "Comparing encounter data with other Medicare data sources,  MAOs\u2019 financial reports, or other benchmarks.

It also  evaluated the accuracy of the diagnosis and procedure codes in encounter data by  comparing them with documentation in enrollees\u2019 medical records. The findings showed  that enrollees\u2019 medical records generally supported encounter data files in Georgia.  Specifically, 93.9 percent of the dates of service, 86.7 percent of the diagnosis codes,  and 78.5 percent of the procedure codes from the encounter data had supporting  evidence in the medical records. However, not all services documented in the medical  records were found in encounter data files.

However, as of May 2014,  the agency has not developed specific plans or time frames to include  these data in this auditing process. CMS currently uses this auditing  process to validate the accuracy of RAPS data.

On the basis of the  clinical information contained in enrollees\u2019 medical records that  substantiates the information in their RAPS data, CMS calculates  corrected risk scores and calculates payment errors\u2014which can  represent a net overpayment or underpayment.

However, CMS has yet to develop specifics on how or when it will use  encounter data for a variety of program management purposes.", "Although CMS has decided to use MA encounter data to supplement  RAPS data in calculating risk scores in 2015, this use may inappropriately  increase payments to MAOs. Using diagnoses from both sources can  only increase the number of diagnoses reported for MA enrollees. This  has the potential to widen the existing discrepancy between FFS and MA  in the coding of diagnoses. As we previously recommended, CMS should  take steps to improve the accuracy of the adjustment made for  differences in diagnostic coding practices between FFS and MA to help  ensure appropriate payments to MAOs. As of March 2014, CMS has not  acted on our recommendation. To the extent that CMS continues to pay  MAOs under its current risk adjustment system and not adequately  account for diagnostic coding differences, excess payments to MAOs  could grow.", "Furthermore, CMS\u2019s decision to use MA encounter data in 2015 may be  premature because the agency has not yet fully validated the data.

However,  the agency has not yet completed other steps in assessing whether the  data are suitable for use, such as performing statistical analyses,  reviewing medical records, and providing MAOs with summary reports of  its findings. Without fully validating the completeness and accuracy of MA  encounter data, CMS and MAOs would be unable to confidently use  these data for risk adjustment or any other program management or  policy purposes.
