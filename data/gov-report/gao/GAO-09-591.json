The ethics practices information GAO obtained was from before the FAR rules were finalized and thus was not designed to test contractor compliance with the rules that came later. In response to the new FAR rules, DOD has made two key oversight improvements by revising its contract audit guidance to cover the new ethics requirements and establishing the Contractor Disclosure Program to implement the mandatory disclosure requirement. However, opportunities exist to improve DOD's oversight in two other key areas. For example, in verifying implementation of contractor ethics programs during contract administration, the impact of the FAR rules on oversight at this point is negligible. GAO found that DOD had no plans to change contract administration offices' oversight because authority for oversight is not explicit nor is organizational responsibility clear. Also, with regard to contractors' hotline poster displays, the new FAR rules could reduce DOD's awareness of potential violations. The rules exempt contractors with ethics programs that include their own hotlines from the requirement to display DOD hotline posters. If contractor employees report violations to company hotlines instead of DOD hotlines, the employees do not receive the same protections from whistleblower laws. Whistleblower protections for employees unaware of the DOD hotline could be jeopardized."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2008, the Department of Defense (DOD) spent more than  $387 billion for goods and services from more than 85,000 contractors.  Given the magnitude of taxpayer money at stake, it is essential that  defense contractors conduct their business operations with integrity. In  the last several years there have been a number of cases of fraud, waste,  and abuse in wartime contracting and even some high-profile criminal and  civil convictions of large defense contractors because of procurement  integrity and foreign corrupt practices violations. These procurement  fraud cases heightened concerns in Congress and the executive branch  about the adequacy of defense contractors\u2019 ethics programs in preventing  or addressing misconduct that could put billions of dollars of contracted  goods and services at risk.", "In the past, DOD\u2019s policy under the Defense Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement (DFARS) encouraged contractors to have written  ethics policies and recommended practices, such as ethics training for all  employees and hotlines or other internal mechanisms for them to report  suspected misconduct. Essentially, defense contractor ethics programs  were voluntary and self-policed. Moreover, our prior work raised concerns  that DOD lacked adequate oversight of its contractors\u2019 ethics programs,  recommending that enhanced knowledge of contractor ethics programs  would enable DOD to assess whether the public trust is protected.", "Given the significant sums of federal dollars spent by agencies to acquire  goods and services, and the need to establish a clear and consistent policy  regarding contractor code of ethics and business conduct, the Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR) was amended twice to address contractor  ethics programs. In December 2007 and again in December 2008, the FAR  was amended first to mandate and then to amplify governmentwide ethics  program requirements for certain contractors. Contractors\u2019 internal  programs must now include an ethics and compliance system with several  practices aimed at preventing and detecting misconduct and at promoting  an organizational culture that encourages ethical conduct and a  commitment to compliance with the law. Before FAR changes were  finalized in late 2008, Congress included a provision in the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 requiring us to report on  the internal ethics programs of major defense contractors\u2014defined as any  company that received more than $500 million in DOD contract awards in  fiscal year 2006\u2014and the extent to which DOD monitors or approves  them. In January 2009, we briefed your committees on the preliminary  results regarding the reporting requirements specified in the act. Taking  into consideration the new FAR contractor ethics program rules, which  are very similar to some of the reporting requirements specified in the act,  this report (1) describes the extent to which contractors had ethics  programs before the finalization of the FAR rules that included practices  consistent with standards now required by the FAR and (2) assesses the  impact the new FAR rules have on DOD oversight of contractor ethics  programs.", "To select contractors for review, we used DOD\u2019s contract award data and  identified 57 major defense contractors receiving more than $500 million  in fiscal year 2006 for review. To obtain information on contractor ethics  programs and practices, in September 2008 we surveyed all 57 contractors.  We also obtained corroborating documentation for various practices\u2014 including those consistent with the FAR\u2019s standards, such as management  oversight and ethics and compliance training\u2014and information about the  benefits to contractors and the challenges they face in implementing the  new FAR ethics rules. We analyzed responses from all 57 contractors and  reviewed the FAR Council\u2019s disposition of public comments considered as  part of the rulemaking process for additional perspectives on benefits to  contractors and challenges they face implementing new ethics program  rules. While we reviewed the contractors\u2019 self-reported practices for  consistency with the FAR rules that came later, we did not test them for  effectiveness or compliance. We selected a nongeneralizable sample of  four contractors for site visits in order to review in detail implementation  practices for some of the ethics program policies or procedures described  in their survey responses. We chose these four contractors because   (1) they ranked among the top 15 contractors in terms of dollar value of  fiscal year 2006 DOD contract awards and (2) their survey responses  indicated that they had such policies or procedures in use.", "To assess the impact the new FAR contractor ethics rules have on DOD,  we focused on defense and military organizations responsible for  oversight and investigation of contractor operations and improper  business practices. These organizations included the (1) Defense Contract  Management Agency (DCMA); (2) Defense Contract Audit Agency  (DCAA); (3) DOD Office of the Inspector General (DOD IG); (4) Air Force,  Army, and Navy offices responsible for suspension and debarment; and   (5) Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology  and Logistics (AT&L). We interviewed senior procurement officials;  general counsel; and contract administration, audit, and investigative  service officials concerning these agencies\u2019 roles and responsibilities for  monitoring or approving contractor ethics programs. Through interviews  and information obtained from these officials, we obtained views and  reviewed supporting documentation concerning the impact the new FAR  rules have had or could have on DOD contractor oversight activities  related to monitoring contractors\u2019 compliance with ethics program  practices required by the new rules.

While  defense regulations provided that contractors should have such elements,  they were not mandatory. As a result, under DFARS and until the FAR  rules established mandatory ethics program requirements, DOD relied on  contractor self-governance\u2014through which a company decided if and how  to implement and enforce ethical conduct.", "Oversight and management of DOD contracting activities is shared among  various organizations. Collectively, these organizations help detect  instances of fraud, waste, and abuse; try to prevent them from happening;  or are involved in correcting policies and procedures when they occur.

By 2007,  in view of the trend, the FAR Council commented that the DFARS  provision that contractors should have specific elements of an ethics  program was no longer considered strong enough to increase contractor  compliance with ethical rules of conduct.", "To address this problem, the FAR Council changed the regulations. After  conducting an extensive proposed rulemaking and public comment  process from February 2007 through November 2008, the FAR Council  twice amended the FAR to impose new ethics requirements on  government contractors. The initial rule\u2014effective in December 2007\u2014 created a new FAR subpart that requires government contractors to have  written codes of business ethics and ethics compliance training programs  for contractor employees and to post \u201cfraud hotline\u201d posters at contractor  work sites to encourage contractor employees to report fraudulent activity  in connection with performance and award of government contracts.", "However, in December 2008 certain shortcomings in the initial contractor  ethics rules were addressed in further amendments to the FAR. For  example, public concerns over the first rule\u2019s exemption connected to  overseas contracting prompted elimination of this exemption in the  second rule, and as of December 2008, overseas and commercial  contractors are now required to maintain written codes of business ethics  and conduct. In addition, the amended FAR contractor ethics rules now  require contractors to disclose violations of criminal law involving fraud,  conflict of interest, bribery, or gratuity violations or violations of the civil  False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729-3733) in connection with award or  performance of government contracts and subcontracts. It should be  noted that these requirements are implemented by contract clause and are  mandatory. The amended rules also specifically subject contractors to  suspension and debarment from government contracting for knowingly  failing to disclose such violations and failing to disclose receipt of  overpayments on government contracts in a timely manner.", "The FAR changes effective in December 2008 also enhance provisions for  sound ethics business practices by specifically requiring the establishment  of internal control systems for  facilitating discovery of improper conduct,    ensuring that corrective measures are promptly carried out, and    otherwise promoting an organizational culture that encourages ethical  conduct and a commitment to compliance with the law.", "In publishing the December 2008 rule\u2019s amplified requirements, the FAR  Council stated that the U.S. Sentencing Commission\u2019s federal sentencing  guidelines are the source of the FAR text, which provides guidance for  contractors consistent with the guidelines on effective compliance and  ethics programs for organizations. Among other things, the sentencing  guidelines state that an ethics and compliance program should be  reasonably designed, implemented, and enforced so that it is generally  effective in preventing and detecting criminal conduct. Notably, the  sentencing guidelines also state that the failure to prevent or detect a  particular offense does not necessarily mean that the program is generally  ineffective in preventing and detecting criminal conduct.", "According to the FAR Council, the final rule reflects standards across four  broad components and establishes a framework for institutional ethics  management and disclosure, but does not prescribe specific ethical  requirements.

For example, the FAR Council commented that review of  contractors\u2019 compliance would be incorporated into normal contract  administration on a discretionary basis, but provided no description on  how responsibility for that discretionary duty would be assigned or  exercised. If such a review were to be required by DOD guidance, it  could use the FAR\u2019s framework for contractor ethics program standards to  begin to provide a basis for DCMA or other contracting officials to verify  that a contractor has established the type of internal ethics and  compliance program to be expected. This, in turn, would provide some  assurance that contractors are following ethics programs as expected by  the FAR Council to help prevent, detect, and timely disclose contract- related fraud, waste, and abuse.", "Beyond the issue of authority, there is no consensus among DOD  contractor oversight officials on where organizationally such  responsibility for verifying the implementation of the new FAR ethics  program requirements during contract administration would be assigned.  Some of DCMA\u2019s CAO staff that we spoke with at several of DOD\u2019s largest  contractor facilities said that oversight of contractor ethics program  compliance would fit into their contract administration area of  responsibility. Other contractor oversight officials at DOD IG, DCAA, and  the Office for the Under Secretary of Defense for AT&L told us that  verifying or monitoring DOD contractor ethics programs would logically  fit with DCMA\u2019s contract administration services.", "DCMA headquarters officials, however, stated that it is not their agency\u2019s  functional responsibility to verify compliance with the new contractor  ethics requirements. One senior DCMA headquarters official indicated that  it would be better to assign responsibility for this function to DCAA\u2019s  contract audit services that assess the adequacy of contractor internal  controls for integrity and ethical values. In addition, assigning this  function to DCMA alone would leave some defense contractors  unaddressed because DCMA is not delegated management responsibility  for all defense contracts, according to its headquarters officials. Rather,  CAO staff at DCMA\u2019s field locations oversee just those contracts and  perform contract administration as assigned to them by procuring  contracting officers at DOD\u2019s buying offices. Thus, for many of DOD\u2019s  contractors, the contract administration function is retained by the  procuring contracting officer. As a result, other contracting officials across  DOD procuring offices would need to examine any contractors not  covered by DCMA CAO staff."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Not Requiring Display of DOD Hotline Posters Could Delay or Lessen DOD\u2019s Awareness of Problems and Use of Whistleblower Protections", "paragraphs": ["Under the FAR rule effective in December 2007, defense contractors are  not required to display DOD IG\u2019s fraud hotline posters if the contractors\u2019  ethics and compliance programs include reporting mechanisms such as  their own hotline posters. According to a FAR Council response to public  comments in finalizing the agency hotline display rule in 2007, the  exemption was to mirror earlier DFARS guidance, which permitted  contractors to post their own hotline posters, in lieu of DOD hotline  posters, to provide an outlet for employees to raise issues of concern.  This exemption has two potential adverse consequences for DOD  oversight of defense contractors: lessening DOD\u2019s awareness of problems  and diminishing contractor employee awareness of whistleblower  protections.", "The display of the standard hotline posters available to contractors from  DOD IG, shown in figure 1, at contractor work sites is part of DOD\u2019s  efforts to fight procurement and other types of fraud, waste, and abuse.", "In fiscal year 2008 alone, DOD\u2019s hotline received nearly 14,000 contacts  resulting in 2,000 cases referred for investigation. However, because the  FAR rule exempts contractors whose ethics programs include their own  hotlines, and if more contractors opt not to display DOD\u2019s hotline posters,  there is a risk that defense contractor employees will be unaware and not  avail themselves of DOD\u2019s hotline. According to our ethics program  survey, 55 of the 57 contractors report having one or more reporting  mechanisms, such as a hotline for employees to report known or  suspected conduct that violates ethics standards or contract requirements.", "The DOD hotline poster\u2019s absence from contractor work sites could also  jeopardize use of whistleblower protections for contractor employees put  in place by DOD in response to legislation separate from the development  of the FAR\u2019s contractor ethics program requirements. Under this  legislation, federal protections were strengthened for contractor  employees against employer reprisals for blowing the whistle to  government entities (such as DOD IG through its fraud hotline) on  suspected gross mismanagement of or illegal activities on a DOD contract.  The contractor internal reporting mechanisms, such as hotline posters  required separately under the new FAR rules, do not provide contractor  employees with the type of whistleblower protections that disclosure to  DOD IG or to other DOD entities offers.", "Although DFARS, since January 2009, requires contractors to inform their  employees in writing of these federal whistleblower rights and  protections, without display of DOD\u2019s hotline poster in a contractor work  site, contractor employees could unwittingly disclose information to the  company\u2019s internal hotline, where they would not have federal protections  in the event of employer reprisals. To facilitate contractor employee  whistleblower protections, senior DOD IG headquarters officials  responsible for investigations and policy agreed that it might be necessary  to modify DOD hotline posters for display at contractor work sites to  inform contractor employees that their federal whistleblower protections  are limited to disclosures to government entities only.", "According to FAR Council responses to public comments received while  finalizing the hotline display rule, it is the responsibility of the agency  inspector general to determine the need for, and the contents of, the fraud  hotline poster. Given the magnitude of DOD\u2019s contract dollars spent each  year, with tens of thousands of contractors and ongoing efforts by DOD  through its Panel on Contracting Integrity to reduce vulnerabilities to  procurement fraud, we asked DOD IG, DCAA, suspension and debarment,  and AT&L contractor oversight officials for their views. Specifically, we  asked about the risk of defense contractors not displaying DOD hotline  posters and whether the hotline poster\u2019s absence in workplaces where  DOD contracts are performed might impinge on DOD\u2019s ability to timely  address contractor violations. Several of the DOD oversight officials were  not aware of the FAR\u2019s exemption regarding display of the DOD hotline  posters until we told them.", "Once informed, some of these DOD officials expressed concern that the  hotline poster\u2019s absence was not in the best interest of reducing DOD\u2019s  vulnerability to procurement fraud. DOD IG officials agreed that changing  DFARS to require all defense contractors to display the DOD hotline  poster should occur. Nearly all of the 57 contractors we surveyed appear  positioned to detect problems because they report having mechanisms  such as hotlines for employees to report problems. However, the DOD IG  team leader for military reprisal investigations expressed concern that  contractor employees may be uncomfortable reporting to their companies\u2019  internal hotlines, an indication that relying only on contractor reporting  mechanisms could also result in DOD not finding out about the problems  at all. Moreover, relying on contractor mechanisms could also delay DOD\u2019s  awareness of such problems and its efforts to verify and act on suspected  violations. For example, under the new FAR rules, the length of time it  takes a contractor to determine if there is credible evidence of a violation  subject to mandatory disclosure requirements could affect DOD\u2019s  awareness of a problem. With the DOD hotline, DOD has immediate  awareness of potential violations from contractor employee calls. While  there might be practical reasons for continuing to exempt some defense  contractors with their own hotlines from displaying DOD\u2019s hotline poster,  such as avoiding the confusion or duplication that could occur with too  many hotline posters on display in one place, senior contract policy  officials in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for AT&L believe  that further study is warranted of possible changes in DFARS to more fully  protect defense contracting integrity."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The FAR requirements provide new direction for defense contractor ethics  programs and present DOD opportunities to improve its oversight of these  programs. The new rules seek to promote organizational cultures that  encourage ethical behavior as well as promote compliance with the law.  Our survey completed in 2009 shows that nearly all of the 57 major  defense contractors reviewed included many of the ethics program  practices before the FAR rules were finalized consistent with the  standards later required for compliance. DOD, in turn, is making positive  changes to address some of the new FAR requirements.", "However, additional opportunities exist to improve DOD\u2019s oversight in  two key areas. The first is in the area of verifying the existence of  contractor ethics programs after contract award as part of contracting  officers\u2019 contract administration responsibility. The need for new  oversight attention and guidance across DOD in the area of contract  administration has not been clearly identified or determined. Such  additional oversight of contractor ethics programs during contract  administration could help ensure that contractor ethics programs are in  place as intended.", "The second is in the area of DOD\u2019s hotline program, for improved  oversight for potential contract-related fraud, waste, and abuse. The new  FAR contractor ethics rules have the potential to make the hotline  program less effective by ultimately reducing contractor exposure to DOD  hotline posters and diminishing the means by which fraud, waste, and  abuse can be reported under the protection of federal whistleblower laws.  Nearly all of the major contractors surveyed have in-house ethics and  compliance programs that exempt them from displaying the DOD posters.  It is conceivable that virtually no major contractor would be required to  display the DOD hotline posters. Contractor employees might be reluctant  to report violations to an in-house hotline that did not provide federal  protection against company retaliation. However, employees do have such  protection when reporting directly to the DOD hotline."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are recommending four actions aimed at improving DOD\u2019s oversight of  defense contractors\u2019 ethics programs.
