To address these issues, GAO was asked to determine (1) the potential risks to federal systems from these emerging cybersecurity threats, (2) the federal agencies' perceptions of risk and their actions to mitigate them, (3) federal and private-sector actions to address the threats on a national level, and (4) governmentwide challenges to protecting federal systems from these threats."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Spam, phishing, and spyware pose security risks to federal information systems. Spam consumes significant resources and is used as a delivery mechanism for other types of cyberattacks; phishing can lead to identity theft, loss of sensitive information, and reduced trust and use of electronic government services; and spyware can capture and release sensitive data, make unauthorized changes, and decrease system performance. The blending of these threats creates additional risks that cannot be easily mitigated with currently available tools. Agencies' perceptions of the risks of spam, phishing, and spyware vary. In addition, most agencies were not applying the information security program requirements of the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) to these emerging threats, including performing risk assessments, implementing effective mitigating controls, providing security awareness training, and ensuring that their incident-response plans and procedures addressed these threats. Several entities within the federal government and the private sector have begun initiatives to address these emerging threats. These efforts range from educating consumers to targeting cybercrime. Similar efforts are not, however, being made to assist and educate federal agencies. Although federal agencies are required to report incidents to a central federal entity, they are not consistently reporting incidents of emerging cybersecurity threats. Pursuant to FISMA, the Office Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) share responsibility for the federal government's capability to detect, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity incidents. However, governmentwide guidance has not been issued to clarify to agencies which incidents they should be reporting, as well as how and to whom they should report. Without effective coordination, the federal government is limited in its ability to identify and respond to emerging cybersecurity threats, including sophisticated and coordinated attacks that target multiple federal entities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report describes the threats of emerging cybersecurity issues such as  spam (unsolicited commercial e-mail), phishing (fraudulent messages to  obtain personal or sensitive data), and spyware (software that monitors  user activity without user knowledge or consent).

Security experts are observing the rapid evolution of  attack technologies and methods. Unsolicited commercial e-mail (spam)  has been an annoyance to Internet users for several years. However, over  the past few years, this mass-marketing tool has evolved from a mere  nuisance to a delivery mechanism for malicious software programs  (commonly referred to as malware) that hijack computers, and e-mail that  deceives recipients into divulging sensitive information, such as credit card  numbers, login IDs, and passwords (phishing). One emerging form of  malware, known as spyware, is installed without the user\u2019s knowledge to  surreptitiously track and/or transmit data to an unauthorized third party.", "Security researchers\u2019 and vendors\u2019 2004 annual security reports reportedly  identified phishing and spyware as among the top emerging threats of last  year, and they were predicted to increase in 2005. These threats have  targeted our government; for instance, in 2004, federal entities such as  FDIC, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and IRS were used in  phishing scams in which their agency names were exploited. Although  spam, phishing, and spyware were once viewed as discrete consumer  challenges, they are now being blended to create substantial threats to  large enterprises, including federal systems. For example, the number of  phishing scams that are often spread through spam has significantly  increased.", "Government officials are increasingly concerned about attacks from  individuals and groups with malicious intent, such as crime, terrorism,  foreign intelligence gathering, and acts of war. According to the FBI,  terrorists, transnational criminals, and intelligence services are quickly  becoming aware of and using information exploitation tools such as  computer viruses, Trojan horses, worms, logic bombs, and eavesdropping  sniffers that can destroy, intercept, and degrade the integrity of or deny  access to data. As larger amounts of money are transferred through  computer systems, as more sensitive economic and commercial  information is exchanged electronically, and as the nation\u2019s defense and  intelligence communities increasingly rely on commercially available  information technology, the likelihood increases that information attacks  will threaten vital national interests. Table 1 summarizes the sources of  emerging cybersecurity threats.", "The sophistication and effectiveness of cyberattacks have steadily  advanced. These attacks often take advantage of flaws in software code,  circumvent signature-based tools that commonly identify and prevent  known threats, and use stealthy social engineering techniques designed to  trick the unsuspecting user into divulging sensitive information. These attacks are becoming increasingly automated with the use of botnets\u2014 compromised computers that can be controlled remotely by attackers to  automatically launch attacks.

Enacted into law on December 17, 2002, as title III of the E- Government Act of 2002, FISMA requires federal agencies to protect and  maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their information  and information systems. It also assigns specific information security  responsibilities to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the  Department of Commerce\u2019s National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST), agency heads, chief information officers (CIO), and inspectors  general (IG). For OMB, these responsibilities include developing and  overseeing the implementation of policies, principles, standards, and  guidelines on information security, as well as reviewing, at least annually,  and approving or disapproving, agency information security programs.  FISMA required each agency including agencies with national security  systems, to develop, document, and implement agencywide information  security programs to provide information security for the information and  information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency,  including those provided or managed by another agency, contractor, or  other source. Specifically, this program is to include  periodic assessments of the risk and magnitude of harm that could  result from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption,  modification, or destruction of information or information systems;  risk-based policies and procedures that cost-effectively reduce  information security risks to an acceptable level and ensure that  information security is addressed throughout the life cycle of each  information system;  subordinate plans for providing adequate information security for  networks, facilities, and systems or groups of information systems;  security awareness training for agency personnel, including contractors  and other users of information systems that support the operations and  assets of the agency;  periodic testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of information  security policies, procedures, and practices, performed with frequency  depending on risk, but no less than annually, and that includes testing of  management, operational, and technical controls for every system  identified in the agency\u2019s required inventory of major information  systems;  a process for planning, implementing, evaluating, and documenting  remedial action to address any deficiencies in the information security  policies, procedures, and practices of the agency;  procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security  incidents; and  plans and procedures to ensure continuity of operations for information  systems that support the operations and assets of the agency.", "FISMA requires each agency to report annually to OMB, selected  congressional committees, and the Comptroller General on the adequacy of  information security policies, procedures, and practices, and on  compliance with FISMA\u2019s requirements.", "FISMA also charges the Director of OMB with ensuring the operation of a  central federal information security incident center with responsibility for  issuing guidance to agencies on detecting and responding to incidents.  Other responsibilities include compiling and analyzing information about  incidents and informing agencies about current and potential information  security threats. Prior to FISMA, the CIO Council (then chaired by OMB\u2019s  Deputy Director for Management) issued a memorandum to all agency  CIOs instructing agencies to follow specific practices for appropriate  coordination and interaction with the Federal Computer Incident Response  Capability (FedCIRC).

US-CERT was established to aggregate and  disseminate cybersecurity information to improve warning about and  response to incidents, increase coordination of response information,  reduce vulnerabilities, and enhance prevention and protection. US-CERT  analyzes incidents reported by federal civilian agencies and coordinates  with national security incident response centers in responding to incidents  on both classified and unclassified systems.

We took steps in the development of the survey instrument, the data  collection, and the data analysis to minimize these nonsampling errors. For  example, a survey specialist designed the survey instrument in  collaboration with subject-matter experts. Then, it was pretested to ensure  that the questions were relevant, clearly stated, and easy to comprehend.  Because this was a Web-based survey, 23 of the 24 respondents entered  their answers directly into the electronic questionnaire, thereby eliminating  the need to have much of the data keyed into a database and thus  minimizing an additional potential source of error.

In social engineering, an attacker uses human  interaction\u2014or social skills\u2014to obtain or compromise information about  an organization or its computer systems. In addition to using their social  skills, phishers use technical methods to create e-mail and Web sites that  appear legitimate, often copying images and the layout of the actual Web  site that is being imitated. Further, phishers exploit software and system  vulnerabilities to reinforce users\u2019 perceptions that they are on a legitimate  Web site. For example, phishers use various methods to cause the  browser\u2019s Web address display to show a legitimate site\u2019s address instead of  the actual Web address of the fraudulent site. Phishers also use browser  scripting languages to position specially created graphics containing fake  information over key areas of a fraudulent Web site, such as covering up  the real address bar with a fake address. In addition, phishers can fake the  closed lock icon on browsers that is used to signify that a Web site is  protecting sensitive data through encryption.\u201cPharming\u201d is another method used by phishers to deceive users into  believing that they are communicating with a legitimate Web site. Pharming  uses a variety of technical methods to redirect a user to a spoofed Web site  when the user types in a legitimate Web address. For example, one  pharming technique is to \u201cpoison\u201d the local domain name server (DNS),  which is an Internet service that translates domain names like  www.congress.gov into unique numeric addresses. Poisoning a DNS  involves changing the specific record for a domain, which results in  sending users to a Web site very different from the one they intended to  access\u2014without their knowledge.

According to several agency responses, some of the most effective  antispyware tools are freeware applications, but they do not have the  capability to centrally manage a large deployment of systems. In addition,  officials at one agency noted that it is difficult to track data being  transmitted by spyware. Although current tools such as firewalls may assist  in tracking incidents, spyware incidents are difficult to measure because  spyware transmits using the same communications path as legitimate Web  traffic. Indeed, our spyware test proved the difficulty in analyzing such  spyware transmissions; the Internet traffic logs from a single hour of Web  browsing resulted in more than 30,000 pages of text that could not be  effectively reviewed without automated analysis tools.", "Software vendors have recognized the need for enterprise antispyware  applications. Antivirus and intrusion-detection vendors have recently  added antispyware features to their base products, and corporate  applications have recently been placed on the market to detect and block  known spyware while providing larger enterprises with centralized  administration. These enterprise antispyware tools enable network  administrators to combat spyware from a central location. With an  enterprise solution, an antispyware program is installed on each computer  system (client) and communicates with a centralized system. The central  system updates individual clients, schedules scans, monitors the types of  spyware that have been found, and determines if the spyware was  successfully removed. As with many antivirus efforts, a major limitation for  some antispyware tools is that in order to detect the spyware, the tool has  to have prior knowledge of its existence. Thus, as with many antivirus  tools, certain antispyware tools must be updated regularly to ensure  comprehensive protection. Evolving enterprisewide tools may provide the  ability to establish rules that can address various categories of potential  spyware behavior.

These e-mail messages will typically bypass the filter even if  they exhibit characteristics that may define them as spam. Similarly,  blacklists, also referred to as blocklists, prevent e-mail from specific  domains, IP addresses, or individuals from being accepted.

Reverse domain name server lookup allows the receiving mail  server to look up the IP address of the sending server to determine if it  matches the header information in the e-mail. This allows the tool to  determine if the sender is attempting to spoof the mail organization  information. This form of validity checking is not commonly used because  many systems are not correctly configured to accurately respond to this  type of lookup.", "An increasingly common feature is heuristical analysis, which employs  statistical probabilities to determine if the characteristics of an e-mail  categorize the message as spam. Each spam characteristic is assigned a  score, or spam probability, and if the cumulative score exceeds a  designated threshold, the message is labeled as spam. Most heuristic  analysis includes adaptive filtering techniques, which can generate rules to  identify future spam. A more advanced heuristics-based approach is  bayesian filtering, which makes an assessment of both spam-like versus  legitimate e-mail characteristics, thereby allowing it to distinguish between  spam versus legitimate e-mail. Its self-learning filter is adaptive in learning  the e-mail habits of the user, which can allow the tool to be more  responsive and tailored to a specific individual.", "Because a salient characteristic of spam is the bulk quantity in which it is  distributed, spam filtering solutions also check for the volume of e-mail  sent from a particular IP address over a specific period of time. Other spam  protection capabilities include challenge/response systems, in which  senders must verify their legitimacy before the e-mail is delivered. This  verification process typically requires the sender to respond to a request  that requires a human (rather than a computer) to respond. Tools can also  employ traffic pattern analysis, which looks for aberrant e-mail patterns  that may represent a potential threat or attack.", "Antispam tools can handle spam in various ways, including accepting,  rejecting, labeling, and quarantining messages.

Finally, because spammers are constantly evolving their techniques,  vendors may lag behind in providing the most current capabilities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Antispyware Tools", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "What the Technology Does", "paragraphs": ["Antispyware tools provide protection against various potentially unwanted  programs such as adware, peer-to-peer threats, and keyloggers, by  detecting, blocking, and removing the unwanted programs and also by  preventing the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.

These antispyware solutions use a  signature database, which is a collection of what known spyware looks  like. Therefore, it is critical that the signature information for applications  be current.", "When a signature-based antispyware program is active, it searches files and  active programs and compares them to the signatures in the database. If  there is a match, the program will signal that spyware has been found and  provide information such as the threat level (how dangerous it is).", "Some tools are able to block spyware from installing onto a system by  using real-time detection. Real-time detection is done by continuously  scanning active processes in the memory of a computer system and alerting  a user when potentially hostile applications attempt to install and run. A  user can then elect to stop the spyware from installing onto the system.", "Once spyware is found, a user can chose to either ignore it or attempt to  remove it. In order to remove a spyware application, a tool has to undo the  modifications that were made by the spyware. This involves deleting or  modifying files and removing entries in the registry. Some tools can block  the transmission of sensitive information across the Internet. For example,  one tool allows users to input specific information that the user wants to  ensure is not transmitted (e.g., credit card number) by an unauthorized  source. The tool then monitors Internet traffic and will warn a user if a  program attempts to send the information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effectiveness of the Technology", "paragraphs": ["Antispyware solutions cannot always defend against the threat of spyware  unless they have prior knowledge of its existence and also the required  frequent updating for signature files.
