ASD is a highly individualized condition with characteristics that vary in degree and type from person to person. Autism characteristics may hinder or help youth achieve their goals\u2014such as postsecondary education and community integration. For each goal, the panel described services and supports that youth (ages 14-24) with ASD transitioning to adulthood may need to address autism characteristics and other health conditions that affect their ability to attain the goal. GAO grouped these services into 14 broad categories.", "To support a successful transition into adulthood, the panel said youth need to be able to access services that are individualized, timely, equitable, and community- and evidence-based, among other things. The panel discussed the need for timely, individualized services that address the variation in autism characteristics and any changes over a person's lifetime. For example, a person's verbal abilities may change over time, and their needs for communication services would also change. The panel said transitioning youth with ASD need equitable access to services regardless of their race, gender, family income, or location. For instance, the panel said that female and minority youth may be diagnosed at a later age and thus receive fewer services during school and may need additional transition planning services. The panel also emphasized the need for services within youths' local communities in order to foster access and community involvement. In addition, the panel said that while services should be evidence-based, more research into program efficacy is needed.", "To improve the ability of autistic youth to fully integrate into society, the panel cited the need for a new approach to providing supports and better public understanding of autism. Such an approach would place a shared responsibility for inclusion on both society and youth with ASD. For example, according to the panel, youth with ASD should learn workplace social expectations and meet them to the extent they can, but employers should also recognize that some social rules, such as expecting individuals to smile, can be difficult for some individuals with autism. The panel also said that widespread knowledge of autism could lead to better understanding of autistic youths' potential and enhance their chances of attaining it."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["About a half million youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) will enter  adulthood over the next decade, according to a 2015 report.

Commonly known as autism, ASD is  a group of complex developmental disorders characterized by difficulties  with social interactions and communication, highly focused interests, and  repetitive or ritualized behaviors. While in elementary and secondary  school, children with autism may receive many services\u2014such as  speech, behavioral, or occupational therapy, job training, and  transportation\u2014through their public schools, as required by the  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).

See appendix I for our scope and methodology,  including more details about how we selected our panelists, and appendix  II for a copy of the agenda for the event.

The panel told us  that some characteristics of autism can be strengths that may help  individuals with ASD achieve their goals\u2014for example, intense focus on a  specific interest can be very productive in the workplace. The panel  discussed the importance of valuing the characteristics that may facilitate  goals and warned against assuming that autism characteristics need to  be \u201cfixed.\u201d The panel discussion, however, focused primarily on services  and supports needed to address autism characteristics that can hinder  progress toward goal attainment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Goal: Postsecondary Education", "paragraphs": ["The panel told us that, like their peers without autism, many youth with  ASD pursue postsecondary education or training, although not all of them  finish their academic programs.

Of those youth, 32 percent had attended a 4-year  college, 70 percent had attended a 2-year college, and 33 percent had  attended a vocational, business, or technical school. According to the  panel, in addition to more traditional classroom settings, some youth with  ASD also attend online programs and an increasing number of  specialized colleges designed to meet the specific needs of students with  disabilities.", "According to the panel, youth with autism may need some of the same  supports as other postsecondary students to help them succeed in the  higher education environment, but may require increased intensity or  providers with training in autism. For example, many students need help  with organizational skills, such as managing time or prioritizing tasks, to  keep up with the pace of academic demands. The panel cited mental  health conditions, especially anxiety, as some of the biggest impediments  to success in postsecondary education and said these conditions can  have a greater effect than youths\u2019 autism characteristics. Youth may also  need supports to help them navigate social demands of college life, such  as relationships with roommates, dating, and issues with alcohol and drug  use. The panel noted that self-care is especially important because poor  personal hygiene can lead to isolation. The panel also discussed the  need to have stronger supports at the beginning of college that taper  down as students experience success and learn to navigate the  environment. Table 1 shows some of the services and supports that may  be needed in a postsecondary education environment.", "Young adults with ASD have lower rates of employment than some other  people with disabilities. For example, in 2009, 58 percent of youth with  autism in their early 20s had ever worked for pay outside the home,  compared to 91 percent of youth with emotional disturbances and 74  percent of youth with intellectual disabilities. The diverse nature of  autism means no single workplace setting or set of supports is  appropriate for all autistic individuals. Examples of various workplace  settings include the following:", "Full-time or part-time employment with market wages and  responsibilities, with or without long-term supports\u2014such as a job  coach to help with communication and social navigation;", "Self-employment, which may offer the flexibility to tailor the job to the  individual\u2019s strengths and the work environment to their needs; and", "A workplace that primarily or exclusively employs individuals with  disabilities\u2014with wages that can fall below the federal minimum  wage. Some workplaces provide services, supervision, or training in  life skills or vocational skills.", "Customized employment may provide an opportunity for some individuals  with autism who might otherwise not be able to find employment.  Employers create a job specifically designed for an individual\u2019s strengths,  abilities and support needs.", "The panel told us that the type and level of supports that youth may need  to succeed in the workplace may vary over time. For example, youth may  need training in job-seeking, interviewing, or organizational skills at the  beginning of their employment, while they may need job coaching  throughout their employment. The panel noted that while some programs  may teach youth with autism how to interview and some of the logistics of  work, youth also need to learn about navigating the social aspect of  employment and may require ongoing support in this area. The panel  noted that social difficulties in the workplace could lead to isolation,  marginalization, or job termination. Additionally, according to the panel,  some vocational supports could help youth find jobs that build on some of  their autism strengths, such as the ability to focus intensely on a problem  or activity or skills in following routines and performing tasks consistently.  Some of the services and supports the panel discussed in conjunction  with successful employment are highlighted in table 2.", "One of the goals of IDEA is to prepare students for independent living.  The level of independence that autistic youth may achieve varies widely\u2014 some are able to live in their own home (with or without supports), while  others require 24-hour care. According to an analysis of NLTS2, young  adults with autism are less likely to live independently than youth with  other disabilities, including intellectual disabilities and emotional  disturbances. Specifically, in 2009, 19 percent of autistic adults in their  early 20s had lived independently at some point, either with or without  supports. Fourteen percent had lived in a supervised setting, such as a  group home or medical facility, which may have provided services such  as life skills education or vocational supports.", "The panel discussed two key aspects of independence\u2014performing daily  living activities and making and carrying out decisions. Daily living  activities may include tasks such as cleaning, shopping, paying bills,  maintaining personal hygiene, and preparing meals. Again, while some  youth with ASD do not need help with these activities, some may need to  learn these skills step by step and then practice them in real life to gain  proficiency. For example, some youth may need a list of each step of  washing hair\u2014shampoo in hand, lather into hair, rinse, etc. The panel  said that some youth may be able to perform tasks in isolation, but may  have trouble combining them with employment or social demands.  Youths\u2019 abilities to make their own decisions may also vary, depending on  their skills in communication and self-advocacy\u2014identifying and  expressing their needs to others. Regardless of their level of disability, the  panel said that it is critically important that all youth be given the  opportunities to state their own preferences to the extent of their  capabilities. Table 3 shows some of the services and supports that the  panel said may help youth reach their maximum independence.", "Health and safety are essential to maintaining a quality life for all people,  including youth with ASD. According to the panel, health and safety are  the primary goals for some youth with high support needs. The panel said  that in order for youth with ASD to achieve health and safety, there need  to be enough medical and mental health caregivers who are trained in the  unique needs of patients with ASD and prepared to accommodate them.  The panel noted that physical or mental comorbid conditions are  sometimes more of a concern than autism. For example, unaddressed  mental health issues like depression or anxiety can lead to lower social  and life skills and increased self-injurious behavior, family stress, and  suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The panel also discussed sleep issues\u2014 such as difficulty going to sleep or remaining asleep\u2014and noted that  youth with ASD can have sleep disruptions lasting several days.  Extended sleep deprivation could have severe effects on a person\u2019s  ability to function and manage their autism characteristics. Finally, the  panel said that reproductive and sexual health care were often  overlooked due to mistaken assumptions that autistic youth would not  engage in sexual relationships.", "In addition, the panel discussed several reasons that youth with ASD may  need supports to help them maintain their safety. For example, the panel  told us that youth with ASD are more likely to be bullied or abused than  other youth; some youth with ASD experience aggressive or self-injurious  behavior, especially when they are frustrated or in pain; and some autistic  youth wander away from their caregivers and are hit by cars or drown.  The panel also discussed how some of the social and communication  difficulties of ASD can make it hard for youth to tell when a situation or  person is dangerous, and gave examples of youth who were coerced by  gang members into committing crimes, unintentionally provoked police  officers, or didn\u2019t know when they were being sexually abused or bullied.  Some of the services and supports the panel discussed in conjunction  with health and safety are highlighted in table 4.", "Community integration includes both individual social interactions and  broader community participation. In 2009, according to NLTS2 data,  about one-third of young adults with autism did not participate in any  community activities, and one-quarter had not had any contact with  friends for at least a year. The panel noted that community integration is  closely tied to higher education and employment because these are  where adults tend to establish their social circles. The panel said that  having housing, jobs, services, and social opportunities that are located in  the community can facilitate interaction with neighbors who do not have  ASD and help increase societal acceptance of autism. The panel also  described transportation as one of the most important factors in achieving  this goal, as it enables physical access to the community, and said that  many youth with ASD can use public transportation independently if they  receive adequate training.

Given the individualized and complex nature of ASD, no  single combination of supports and services will prepare all youth with  ASD for success as adults, according to the panel. For example, for a  successful transition to a higher education environment, one student may  need organizational coaching in order to develop study skills, while  another may need mental health support for anxiety and peer mentoring  in order to attend class every day. According to the panel, having the right  combination of supports to meet each person\u2019s individual needs may  contribute to success in higher education, employment, community  integration, and overall quality of life. The panel also told us that the  creation of an individualized support system begins with a comprehensive  assessment of a person\u2019s skills and abilities.", "On Individualized Supports   \u201cEducation, employment, health care, access to communication and self-determination,  and support for overall community integration are all critical components for our  community. A comprehensive approach which provides individualized, consumer- directed supports in all of these areas can enable all autistic people to participate in their  communities, self-advocate, and live meaningful and productive lives with a high quality  of life, regardless of level of disability.\u201d", "The panel said that individuals with ASD need flexible services and  supports that can adapt to changes in their needs. Autism is a lifelong  disability with characteristics that can shift over time, especially as  personal circumstances and comorbid health conditions change. For  example, the panel described people whose verbal skills fluctuated from  nonverbal to highly fluent during their lifetimes. During their nonverbal  periods, they would need communication aids that were not needed  during their fluent periods. Additionally, the panel said that the ability to  fall and remain asleep could fluctuate over time, and youth may need  behavioral therapy or medication during sleepless periods. The panel also  cautioned against removing supports that may be needed over the long  term. For example, a job coach may be used at the beginning of an  autistic person\u2019s employment to help them acclimate to their employer  and vice versa. However, the individual may also benefit from continued  support\u2014either ongoing or occasional\u2014from a job coach to help address  new issues that arise over the course of their employment. Flexible job  coaching that was available when needed could help the individual retain  the job."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Timely Access to Supports", "paragraphs": ["The panel said that youth with autism need timely access to services and  supports, beginning with having enough service providers to meet the  demand. For example, according to the panel, youth receiving care from  service providers who primarily work with children, such as  developmental pediatricians and speech and language therapists, may  need access to adult providers after their transition, because their needs  for the service do not necessarily end when they reach a certain age. The  panel also said that waiting lists for services have gotten longer due to a  \u201ctsunami\u201d of increased demand. Furthermore, due to the unpredictable  nature of ASD, there may be times when autistic youth need immediate  access to services. For example, if autistic youth become aggressive or  self-injurious, they and their families may need such services as  emergency rooms, hospitals with specialized units, residential behavioral  treatment programs, or direct support providers. Our panel described  situations where families lacked immediate access to these services, and  hence tried to care for aggressive youth at home, which can risk the  safety and well-being of both the person with ASD and others present in  the home.", "The panel told us that in order for autistic youth to have adequate access  to supports, providers of adult services\u2014including basic services  important to all adults\u2014would ideally have the expertise necessary to  serve clients with autism. For example, dentists may need to be prepared  for behaviors often associated with autism, such as the inability to sit in  the dental chair, agitation, or self-injury (e.g., head banging). Additionally,  according to the panel, youth with autism may have difficulty developing  new relationships with service providers and are negatively affected by  high turnover rates. The panel noted that support providers who work  directly with autistic individuals have a physically and emotionally  demanding job and that turnover among these providers is likely related  to prevailing wages for this work.", "On Provider Expertise   \u201cOne of the things we need to do is teach the adult physicians how to deal with adults  who have developmental disabilities. Beyond checking their blood sugar and their  cholesterol levels and blood pressure, you need to be checking their life. How are they  doing psychologically?  How is their self-esteem?  How are they doing occupationally?   And how is their living environment with their families or away from their families?\u201d", "The panel cited research noting that any gaps or loss of services during  the transition from a school-based support system to adulthood could  have long-lasting detrimental effects on youths\u2019 health, employment,  educational attainment, and family stability. To avoid gaps, according to  the panel, the various programs for adults should have compatible  eligibility requirements so that youth do not have to re-establish eligibility.  Specifically, the panel said there should be a single point of entry into  adult services, much as the school provides a single point of entry for  many services for children. The panel also suggested that transition  planning start earlier\u2014as early as middle school\u2014and end when youth  turn 25.

The panel also stated that access to services should not vary  depending on the states and communities where youth live. For example,  in rural areas, support services like transportation or telemedicine\u2014 wherein providers serve patients remotely, such as via video  conference\u2014may help improve access to services that are more common  in large cities. The panel also discussed the need to maintain a  continuum of care as youth move across state lines, noting that even  though eligibility rules and service provision may differ from state to state,  youths\u2019 needs for services and funding do not necessarily change when  they move. The panel suggested a portable and flexible funding  mechanism that would allow youth to pay for services in any location.", "Finally, in order to have equitable opportunities to pursue their adult  goals, the panel said that some demographic groups, such as females or  minorities, may have specific needs. For example, according to the panel,  workplaces may have higher social expectations for women than men,  and mentoring from other women on the spectrum could help them learn  how to react to these expectations. The panel also noted that girls and  minority students are diagnosed with ASD at a later age than other youth,  on average\u2014sometimes after they have left high school. As a result, the  panel said, they may have received fewer services and may need more  help as they transition to adulthood. Additionally, the panel said that  minority students\u2014especially those living in low-income, urban areas\u2014 may face issues compounded by having less preparation for the transition  during their school years, including less parental education on available  resources as well as less access to medical care.

For example, according to the  panel, an individual needing care from both a mental health practitioner  and a developmental disability doctor may not be adequately supported  by either provider, because each may assume the other has primary  responsibility and thus neither may take a holistic view of the individual\u2019s  care. Additionally, the panel said that some medical personnel find that  other service providers are among the best sources of information about  their patients. The panel advocated for a comprehensive approach in  which service providers work together to simultaneously address issues  of employment, housing, health care, and behavioral health.

Additionally, the panel told  us that some youth with ASD may have difficulty making decisions that  depend on changing input. For example, when deciding whether to cross  the street, it is not enough to know whether a car is coming.

In a June 2015 report, we found  that research into the needs of adults consistently received less federal  funding than other areas of autism research, such as the biology of  autism. Also consistent with our work, the panel said that services  should be grounded in evidence-based research and programs should be  held accountable for delivering results, but they underscored that more  research was needed for this to be feasible. The panel recommended  studying the developmental disability system as a whole to determine  what large-scale changes may be needed. Some of the specific areas of  research they recommended included:  the needs of transitioning youth and adults with ASD, effective adult services,  comorbid conditions and health needs,  improving collaboration among service providers, and efficient uses of funding.", "On Need for Research   \u201cI would rather see investments in performance measurement, quality improvement, and  accountability that promise to help all people by incentivizing learning systems that aim  to continuously experiment and improve\u2026for everyone.

In this new paradigm, society and autistic youth alike would  share the responsibility for inclusion, and the public and service providers  would have better understanding of autistic youths\u2019 potential. The panel  likened this new paradigm to the magnitude of the changes made to  physical infrastructure, such as curb cuts, ramps, and elevators, to  improve mobility for people with physical disabilities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "New Approach to Supporting Youth with ASD", "paragraphs": ["The panel told us that one element of the new paradigm would be the  understanding that the responsibility for the inclusion of autistic youth  rests on both the individual with autism and society. The panel said  society expects individuals with autism to continually adapt to situations  that are difficult for them\u2014even though adaptation itself is difficult for  many people with ASD. The panel acknowledged that people with autism  are responsible for learning about social expectations for school, work,  and social settings, but said that institutions and communities should also  learn how best to support individuals with ASD, given the characteristics  of autism. For example, the panel said that explaining the \u201cunwritten  rules\u201d of workplace social behavior to youth with autism may facilitate  their inclusion. On the other hand, the panel emphasized that society  should acknowledge that some unwritten rules may lead to the exclusion  of autistic youth. For example, the panel noted that it may not be  reasonable to expect people with autism to smile or make small talk even  though smiling and chatting are often expected in certain situations, such  as in the workplace.", "On a New Approach to Supporting Youth with Autism:  And if you think about social navigation and autism, and you think about physically  navigating a space if you have a mobility difference, what are universal design  standards? I don't mean just the structure of a building but what kinds of things could be  universally implemented to make those places more accessible for us with our specific  disability\u2026so that the onus isn't always on the individual to have to mimic social  behaviors that are expected in order to have a standard of living of some kind.", "The panel said that some of the changes they envision might already be  supported by federal laws that govern services to people with disabilities,  including youth with autism. For example, the panel told us that although  existing law requires the provision of experiential learning opportunities  for youth with disabilities, including autism, some teachers provide  instruction only in a classroom setting despite the benefits of experiential  learning."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Greater Public Understanding of Autism", "paragraphs": ["The panel described how greater public understanding of the  characteristics, potential, and challenges of autism would be key to the  new paradigm. According to the panel, lack of knowledge about autism  can result in misinterpretations of the meanings behind some behaviors.  For example, an autistic student with anxiety and depression may miss  classes due to those comorbid conditions and may not seek help due to  communication difficulties caused by autism. Without an understanding of  autism and the behavioral effects of its interaction with comorbid  conditions, professors or university personnel may attribute the student\u2019s  absences to a lack of interest or motivation, underestimate the severity of  the situation, and miss an opportunity to help that student. The panel also  said a public awareness campaign could deepen the public\u2019s  understanding of autism and help people think about how they can better  support people with ASD. The panel suggested educational sessions that  describe the diversity among people with autism, promote tolerance, and  help create a safe environment to support youth on the spectrum.", "In addition to the wider public, the panel said that professionals who  interact with people with autism need education and training about  autism. The panel cited a wide range of fields\u2014such as health care,  justice, education, transportation, mental health, public safety, and public  services\u2014whose members need to understand autism characteristics  and be prepared to support them. Specifically, the panel noted that, while  youth with autism have clear needs for supports, people should not make  assumptions about an individual\u2019s competence based on a single  characteristic of autism. The panel told us that some people may base  their assumptions about the capabilities of an autistic youth on the youth\u2019s  ability to communicate verbally. For example, people may erroneously  equate a lack of verbal communication skills with an inability to make  decisions or express preferences, while assuming that those autistic  youth who can speak have no communication issues and no need for  supports. Consistent with this, the panel noted that those people closest  to youth with autism should foster high expectations when preparing them  for adulthood. For example, one panelist said that parents and teachers  should expect youth to learn to be more independent, noting that people  often adopt a risk-averse approach to teaching autistic youth, coming to  the rescue when someone does not succeed at a task. This can create a  \u201clearned helplessness\u201d and missed opportunities to teach the valuable life  skill of perseverance. Rather, the panel said that youth should begin  building self-advocacy skills\u2014identifying and asking for what they need\u2014 in middle and high school. For example, one panelist said that youth  should learn to identify their sensory, social, and communication  differences and strengths.", "The new paradigm would include fostering a better understanding of the  potential of youth with ASD, according to the panel. Specifically, the panel  told us that recognizing the strengths of individuals with ASD can greatly  improve their opportunities, while focusing on the difficulties associated  with autism may limit them.", "On Contributing to Society   These aren't just people who are service users and need things all the time. These are  people who can contribute to society, their campus communities. And how do we create  opportunities for them to be leaders, to be mentors, as part of the service delivery  process?", "The panel said some characteristics of autism, such as a tendency  toward repetitive actions and a preference for routine, could be an  advantage in the workplace. For example, the panel told us about a youth  who enjoyed stacking boxes\u2014an interest that translated into a job skill  needed in the community\u2019s home improvement store\u2014and another young  man whose intense focus and interest resulted in encyclopedic  knowledge of heating, ventilation and air conditioning. The second youth  became the most reliable worker in his internship and reported to work  early every day. The panel discussed a national financial services  company that initiated an agricultural program for employing youth with  disabilities, including autism, because the company saw their comfort with  routine and reliability as strengths. The panel also discussed a national  retailer that hired workers with disabilities, including autism, and found  that those workers had lower job turnover rates and were just as  productive as workers without disabilities.", "The panel noted that better inclusion of people with ASD could help  reduce the stigma associated with autism and reduce bullying, which the  panel suggested occurred frequently among youth with ASD. The panel  told us that some youth miss out on supports, including helpful medical  devices, that may be available to them because they fear being  stigmatized if they disclose their autism. A greater understanding of  autism in general could decrease the sense of stigma, similar to the way  that physical disabilities are becoming less stigmatized over time. In  addition, people may be less likely to make flawed judgments or act on  stereotypes if they have an increased understanding and acceptance of  the different interaction styles characteristic of individuals with autism.  The panel noted that one way to reduce bullying was to implement  school-based anti-bullying training, that focused on respect and  acceptance from pre-kindergarten to 12th grade. Greater public  awareness of autism could also improve the safety of autistic youth when  they are in the community. For example, the panel discussed the  prevalence of abuse, including sexual abuse, among youth with autism  and noted that increased awareness of the risks to autistic youth in the  community would increase their safety.", "On Benefits of Community Awareness and Integration  If someone abused our son, we wouldn't know. He cannot tell us. \u2026The best safety and  security system is more eyes and ears. And so the more people that are coming and  going, the more eyes and ears, the more than we are part of community and integrated  into community, the better off we are and the safer we will be.", "Additionally, the panel described the benefits of police officers knowing  how to appropriately aid an autistic person who is acting erratically, as  well as teaching youth with autism how to interact with the police. The  panel said that because some youth with autism may not appropriately  respond to verbal commands, increased awareness of autism among  police officers was critical given the potential consequences of  miscommunication\u2014such as incarceration or violence."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to Education and HHS for comment.
