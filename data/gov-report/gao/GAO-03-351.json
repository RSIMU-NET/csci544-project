These programs enable direct communication between users, allowing users to access each other's files and share digital music, images, and video. GAO was requested to determine the ease of access to child pornography on peer-to-peer networks; the risk of inadvertent exposure of juvenile users of peer-to-peer networks to pornography, including child pornography; and the extent of federal law enforcement resources available for combating child pornography on peer-to-peer networks. Because child pornography cannot be accessed legally other than by law enforcement agencies, GAO worked with the Customs Cyber-Smuggling Center in performing searches: Customs downloaded and analyzed image files, and GAO performed analyses based on keywords and file names only. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Department of Justice agreed with the report's findings and provided additional information."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Child pornography is easily found and downloaded from peer-to-peer networks. In one search using 12 keywords known to be associated with child pornography on the Internet, GAO identified 1,286 titles and file names, determining that 543 (about 42 percent) were associated with child pornography images. Of the remaining, 34 percent were classified as adult pornography and 24 percent as nonpornographic. In another search using three keywords, a Customs analyst downloaded 341 images, of which 149 (about 44 percent) contained child pornography. These results are in accord with increased reports of child pornography on peer-to-peer networks; since it began tracking these in 2001, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has seen a fourfold increase--from 156 in 2001 to 757 in 2002. Although the numbers are as yet small by comparison to those for other sources (26,759 reports of child pornography on Web sites in 2002), the increase is significant. Juvenile users of peer-to-peer networks are at significant risk of inadvertent exposure to pornography, including child pornography. Searches on innocuous keywords likely to be used by juveniles (such as names of cartoon characters or celebrities) produced a high proportion of pornographic images: in our searches, the retrieved images included adult pornography (34 percent), cartoon pornography (14 percent), child erotica (7 percent), and child pornography (1 percent). While federal law enforcement agencies--including the FBI, Justice's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, and Customs--are devoting resources to combating child exploitation and child pornography in general, these agencies do not track the resources dedicated to specific technologies used to access and download child pornography on the Internet. Therefore, GAO was unable to quantify the resources devoted to investigating cases on peer-to-peer networks. According to law enforcement officials, however, as tips concerning child pornography on peer-to-peer networks escalate, law enforcement resources are increasingly being focused on this area."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The availability of child pornography has dramatically increased in recent  years as it has migrated from magazines, photographs, and videos to the  World Wide Web.

By contrast, for material to be defined as obscene depends on  whether an average person, applying contemporary community standards,  would interpret the work\u2014including images\u2014to appeal to the prurient  interest and to be patently offensive, and whether a reasonable person  would find the material lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or  scientific value.", "In addition to making it a crime to transport, receive, sell, distribute,  advertise, or possess child pornography in interstate or foreign commerce,  federal child pornography statutes prohibit, among other things, the use of  a minor in producing pornography, and they provide for criminal and civil  forfeiture of real and personal property used in making child pornography  and of the profits of child pornography. Child pornography, which is  intrinsically related to the sexual abuse of children, is unprotected by the  First Amendment. Nor does the First Amendment protect the production,  distribution, or transfer of obscene material.", "In enacting the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996, Congress  sought to expand the federal prohibition against child pornography from  images that involve actual children to sexually explicit images that only  appear to depict minors but were produced without using any real  children. The act defines child pornography as \u201cany visual depiction,  including any photograph, film, video, picture, or computer or computer- generated image or picture\u201d that \u201cis, or appears to be, of a minor engaging  in sexually explicit conduct\u201d or is \u201cadvertised, promoted, presented,  described, or distributed in such a manner that conveys the impression  that the material is or contains a visual depiction of a minor engaging in  sexually explicit conduct.\u201d Last year, the Supreme Court struck down this  legislative attempt to ban \u201cvirtual\u201d child pornography in Ashcroft v. The  Free Speech Coalition, ruling that the expansion of the act to material that  did not involve and thus harm actual children in its creation is an  unconstitutional violation of free speech rights. According to government  officials, this ruling may increase the difficulty faced by law enforcement  agencies in prosecuting those who produce and possess child  pornography. Since the government must establish that the digital images  of children engaged in sexual acts are those of real children, it may be  difficult to prosecute cases in which the defendants claim that the images  in question are of \u201cvirtual\u201d children."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Internet Has Emerged as the Principal Tool for Exchanging Child Pornography", "paragraphs": ["Historically, pornography, including child pornography, tended to be  found mainly in photographs, magazines, and videos.

According to recent estimates, there are about 400,000  commercial pornography Web sites worldwide, with some of the sites  selling pornographic images of children. The profitability and the  worldwide reach of the child pornography trade was recently  demonstrated by an international child pornography ring that included a  Texas-based firm providing credit card billing and password access  services for one Russian and two Indonesian child pornography Web sites.", "According to the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the ring grossed as much  as $1.4 million in just 1 month selling child pornography to paying  customers.", "Usenet. Usenet newsgroups are also providing access to pornography,  with several of the image-oriented newsgroups being focused on child  erotica and child pornography. These newsgroups are frequently used by  commercial pornographers who post \u201cfree\u201d images to advertise adult and  child pornography available for a fee from their Web sites. The increase in  the availability of child pornography in Usenet newsgroups represents a  change from the mid-1990\u2019s, when a 1995\u201396 study of 9,800 randomly  selected images taken from 32 Usenet newsgroups found that only a small  fraction of posted images contained child pornography themes.", "Peer-to-peer networks.

A client is defined as a requester of services,  and a server is defined as the provider of services. Unlike the traditional  model, the peer-to-peer model enables consenting users\u2014or peers\u2014to  directly interact and share information with each other without the  intervention of a server. A common characteristic of peer-to-peer  programs is that they build virtual networks with their own mechanisms  for routing message traffic.", "The ability of peer-to-peer networks to provide services and connect users  directly has resulted in a large number of powerful applications built  around this model. These range from the SETI@home network (where  users share the computing power of their computers to search for  extraterrestrial life) to the popular KaZaA file-sharing program (used to  share music and other files).", "As shown in figure 4, there are two main models of peer-to-peer networks:  (1) the centralized model, based on a central server or broker that directs  traffic between individual registered users, and (2) the decentralized  model, based on the Gnutella network, in which individuals find and  interact directly with each other.", "As shown in figure 4, the centralized model relies on a central  server/broker to maintain directories of shared files stored on the  respective computers of the registered users of the peer-to-peer network.  When Bob submits a request for a particular file, the server/broker creates  a list of files matching the search request by checking the request with its  database of files belonging to registered users currently connected to the  network. The broker then displays that list to Bob, who can then select the  desired file from the list and open a direct link with Alice\u2019s computer,  which currently has the file. The download of the actual file takes place  directly from Alice to Bob.", "The broker model was used by Napster, the original peer-to-peer network,  facilitating mass sharing of copyrighted material by combining the file  names held by thousands of users into a searchable directory that enabled  users to connect with each other and download MP3 encoded music files.  The broker model made Napster vulnerable to legal challenges and  eventually led to its demise in September 2002.", "Although Napster was litigated out of existence and its users fragmented  among many alternative peer-to-peer services, most current-generation  peer-to-peer networks are not dependent on the server/broker that was the  central feature of the Napster service, so, according to Gartner, these  networks are less vulnerable to litigation from copyright owners.", "In the decentralized model, no brokers keep track of users and their files.  To share files using the decentralized model, Ted starts with a networked  computer equipped with a Gnutella file-sharing program, such as KaZaA or  BearShare. Ted connects to Carol, Carol to Bob, Bob to Alice, and so on.  Once Ted\u2019s computer has announced that it is \u201calive\u201d to the various  members of the peer network, it can search the contents of the shared  directories of the peer network members. The search request is sent to all  members of the network, starting with Carol, who will each in turn send  the request to the computers to which they are connected, and so forth. If  one of the computers in the peer network (say, for example, Alice\u2019s) has a  file that matches the request, it transmits the file information (name, size,  type, etc.) back through all the computers in the pathway towards Ted,  where a list of files matching the search request appears on Ted\u2019s  computer through the file-sharing program. Ted will then be able to open a  connection with Alice and download the file directly from Alice\u2019s  computer.", "One of the key features of Napster and the current generation of  decentralized peer-to-peer technologies is their use of a virtual name space  (VNS). A VNS dynamically associates user-created names with the Internet  address of whatever Internet-connected computer users happen to be  using when they log on. The VNS facilitates point-to-point interaction  between individuals, because it removes the need for users and their  computers to know the addresses and locations of other users; the VNS  can, to certain extent, preserve users\u2019 anonymity and provide information  on whether a user is or is not connected to the Internet at a given  moment.", "The file-sharing networks that result from the use of peer-to-peer  technology are both extensive and complex. Figure 5 shows a map or  topology of a Gnutella network whose connections were mapped by a  network visualization tool.
