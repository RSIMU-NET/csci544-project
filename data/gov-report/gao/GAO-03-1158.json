As part of that study, GAO surveyed a random sample of 250 public companies from the Fortune 1000 list; preliminary findings were included in the July report. This supplemental report details more comprehensively the 159 responses we received through August 11, 2003, focusing on (1) the relationship of their company with their auditor of record in terms of satisfaction, tenure relationship, and services provided; (2) the effects of consolidation on audit fees, quality, and independence; and (3) the potential implications of consolidation for competition and auditor choice."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Most of the 159 respondents said that they were satisfied with the current auditor, and half had used their current auditor for 10 years or more. Generally, the longer a respondent had been with an auditor, the higher the overall level of satisfaction. Consistent with high levels of satisfaction, GAO found that, aside from former clients of Arthur Andersen, few respondents had switched auditors in the past decade. When they did, they switched because of reputation, concerns about audit fees, and corporate mergers or management changes. In looking for a new auditor, the most commonly cited factors the respondents gave were quality of service, industry specialization, and \"chemistry\" with the audit team. Finally, almost all respondents used their auditor of record for a variety of nonaudit services, including tax-related services and assistance with company debt and equity offerings. Respondents had differing views about whether past consolidation had some influence on audit fees, but most believed that consolidation had little or no influence on audit quality or independence. Respondents commented that other factors--such as new regulations deriving from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and changing auditing standards--have had a greater impact on audit price, quality, and independence. While half of the respondents said that past consolidation had little or no influence on competition and just over half said they had a sufficient number of auditor choices, 84 percent also indicated a preference for more firms from which to choose as most would not consider using a non-Big 4 firm. Reasons most frequently cited included (1) the need for auditors with technical skills or industry-specific knowledge, (2) the reputation of the firm, and (3) the capacity of the firm. Finally, some expressed concerns about further consolidation in the industry and the limited number of alternatives were they to change auditors under existing independence rules."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The number of public accounting firms widely considered capable of  providing audit services to large national and multinational public  companies decreased from eight (the \u201cBig 8\u201d) in the 1980s to four (the \u201cBig  4\u201d) today.

While officers and directors of a public company  are responsible for the preparation and content of financial statements that  fully and accurately reflect the company\u2019s financial condition and the  results of its operations, public accounting firms, which function as  independent external auditors are expected to provide an additional  safeguard.  The external auditor is responsible for auditing companies\u2019  financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing  standards (GAAS) to provide reasonable assurance that a company\u2019s  financial statements are fairly presented in all material respects in  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).", "Public accounting firms offer a broad range of services to their clients.  In  addition to traditional audit and attest and tax services, firms also offer  consulting services in areas such as information technology.  Although all  of the Big 4 firms continue to offer certain consulting services, three of the  Big 4 have sold or divested portions of their consulting businesses.Following the implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley, SEC issued new  independence rules in March 2003, which place additional limitations on  management consulting and other nonaudit services that firms could  provide to their audit clients.  Sarbanes-Oxley also requires auditors to  report to and be overseen by a public company\u2019s audit committee, which  consists of members of the company\u2019s board of directors who are required  to be independent.
