Reductions in the federal government\u2019s deficit or increases in the surplus help increase national saving and expand domestic capital available for private investment. At the same time, however, reducing the deficit places constraints on the government\u2019s discretionary spending which finances most federal investment. The constraints on discretionary spending have again tightened with the enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Recent congressional initiatives have sought to promote long-term private sector economic growth by increasing federal investment. The National Research Investment Act of 1998 (S. 1305), a bipartisan bill, would almost double total R&D funding between 1999 and 2008 at 12 selected agencies. In addition, the President\u2019s budget for fiscal year 1999 proposed three new investment funds: (1) the Research Fund for America, which includes a broad range of investment in knowledge, (2) the Environmental Resources Fund, which includes several environmental programs identified by the President as investment programs, and (3) the Transportation Fund for America, which includes highway and airport programs. You have both expressed interest in the future of spending for investment and indicated that better information on recent investment trends would help decision-making."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["We previously reported that the current budget structure does not highlight, for decision-making purposes, the differences between spending for long-term investment and current consumption because it treats all expenditures the same. Nor does the current budget process encourage the Congress to make explicit decisions about how much spending overall should be devoted to programs having a direct bearing on long-term growth and productivity.", "In our 1993 report, we suggested that establishing investment targets within a framework similar to that contained in the Budget Enforcement Act is the most promising way to incorporate an investment component into budget decision-making. In that report we concluded that the most appropriate definition of investment would include only that federal spending, either direct or through grants, which is specifically intended to enhance the private sector\u2019s long-term productivity. This definition includes spending on (1) some intangible activities, such as R&D, (2) human capital designed to increase worker productivity, particularly education and training, and (3) physical assets to improve infrastructure, such as highways, bridges, and air traffic control systems.", "This definition would not include spending for physical capital designed to achieve federal agency programmatic goals or improve the government\u2019s operating efficiency\u2014such as spending for federal land, office buildings, and defense weapons systems\u2014because such spending does not directly enhance productivity in the private sector. Some budget functions and subfunctions\u2014such as international affairs, recreational resources, and law enforcement and justice\u2014have been excluded from this analysis because we believe the bulk of spending in these subfunctions does not directly enhance productivity. This definition of investment was also used in our November 1993 report on incorporating an investment component in the federal budget and in our 1997 report on trends in federal investment outlays."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objective, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The objective of this assignment was to update the data we provided last year on the trend in the federal budget\u2019s actual and future estimated investment outlays. This report includes actual investment outlays for fiscal years 1981 through 1997 and estimates contained in the President\u2019s 1999 budget for fiscal years 1998 through 2003. As agreed with your offices, the analysis was done on a macro basis, using aggregate data by investment category and budget function and subfunction. We did not analyze data at either the agency or account level.", "Also, as agreed with your offices, we reexamined the items to be included in the definition of investment, specifically related to Defense R&D. We discussed different categories of Defense R&D with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Congressional Research Service staff. As a result, we changed the categories of Defense R&D included as investment spending from what was included in last year\u2019s report to more accurately reflect what we believe to promote private sector economic growth. We now include the categories of basic and applied research rather than basic and developmental research as in last year\u2019s analysis. This adjustment lowers the amount attributed to total investment, Defense investment, and R&D, but does not significantly alter the overall trend data. In order to make comparisons between the 1998 and 1999 budget estimates, we recast the 1998 data using our revised categories for Defense R&D.", "Outlay data used for this analysis were extracted from the automated information system that OMB used to prepare the President\u2019s annual budget request. We traced totals to published budget documents but did not independently verify this information. Reported actual outlay data (including offsetting collections but excluding offsetting receipts) for fiscal years 1981 through 1997 were used for both investment and total federal outlays; the President\u2019s estimates for his policy as shown in the 1999 budget were used for fiscal years 1998 through 2003. Annual GDP numbers and GDP implicit price deflators used in calculating constant dollar values for investment for fiscal years 1981 through 2003 were obtained from the Historical Tables accompanying the President\u2019s 1999 budget.", "Our work was done from March 1998 through May 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overall Investment Trends", "paragraphs": ["The President\u2019s policy estimates of what we have categorized as investment spending for fiscal year 1999 amount to $126.7 billion, which is 6.1 percent of total outlays and 1.5 percent of GDP. Actual total federal outlays for investment as a share of total outlays decreased from a high of 8.8 percent in 1981 to 6 percent in 1997. While investment rose in some years, the overall trend after 1982 was relatively flat, as shown in figure 1. Investment outlays for fiscal years 1998 to 2003 are projected to rise from 6 percent to 6.2 percent in 2000 and then decline to 5.9 percent in 2003. The estimates for 1998 through 2002 using the 1999 budget estimates are higher than those for the corresponding period contained in the 1998 budget both in dollars and as a percent of total outlays.", "The share of total outlays categorized as investment may be influenced as much by increases in noninvestment outlays as by investment outlays themselves. Accordingly, to offer assurance that the investment trend line was not a function of the level of overall federal outlays, we analyzed the outlays\u2019 share of GDP. As shown in figure 2, we found that actual investment outlays as a percent of GDP followed the same pattern as investment outlays as a percent of total federal outlays. From a high of 2.3 percent of GDP in 1981, investment outlays fell to 1.5 percent of GDP in 1997. While the decline was not steady from year to year, the overall trend was downward. Estimates in the President\u2019s 1999 budget rise from 1.4 percent of GDP in 1998 to 1.5 percent in 2000 and then decline to 1.4 percent by 2003. As figure 2 shows, these estimates for the 1998 through 2002 period are higher in all years than the corresponding estimates from the 1998 budget.", "Figure 3 shows nondefense outlays for investment as a share of total outlays. Nondefense outlays dropped from 8.5 percent of total outlays in 1981 to a low of 5.3 percent in 1990, then rose to 6.3 percent in 1995 and fell to 5.8 percent in 1997. Estimates in the 1999 budget rise slightly to 5.9 percent in 2000 and decline to 5.6 percent in 2003.", "As shown in figure 4, nondefense outlays as a percent of GDP show a similar pattern. As in the case of total outlays, the 1999 budget plans to dedicate a higher percentage of total outlays to nondefense investment from 1998 through 2002 than did the 1998 budget.", "The spending pattern is different when analyzed in terms of constant dollars. As shown in figure 5, in constant dollars, investment spending dropped from $105 billion in 1981 to $83 billion in 1984. However, it increased somewhat steadily to $110 billion in 1995 before dropping to $103 billion in 1997. Estimates in the 1999 budget increase from $105 billion in 1998 to $111 billion in 2000 before dropping to $109 billion in 2003.
