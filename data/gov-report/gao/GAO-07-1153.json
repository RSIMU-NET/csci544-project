This funding supported, for example, programs aimed at alleviating poverty and the suffering of refugees, as well as funding international drug interdiction efforts. State primarily uses grants and cooperative agreements to deliver this type of assistance. State manages its development and humanitarian assistance programs centrally, obligating about 80 percent of the funds and making awards from headquarters. State uses a variety of oversight approaches. Grants officers and grants officer representatives have formal oversight responsibilities, but other staff also carry out functions informally. A mix of headquarters and overseas staff monitor program implementation. State's strategic workforce planning does not reflect its foreign assistance activities. A key principle of strategic workforce planning is to define the critical skills and competencies that will be needed to achieve current and future programmatic goals. State has not defined its staff needs to manage and monitor its foreign assistance programs and has not collected critical information on current staff with these responsibilities. Moreover, GAO found inconsistent training and skills requirements for staff involved in foreign assistance oversight. For example, grants officers--who are responsible for the legal aspects of entering into, amending, and terminating awards--must meet educational and training requirements, while grants officer representatives--who are delegated some monitoring responsibilities--do not. Further, a recent State survey suggests that Foreign Service officers overseas recognize that there is a gap in their foreign assistance management skills. Various State officials have concerns about the department's ability to effectively manage its development and humanitarian assistance. Finally, State has not used strategic workforce planning to align F Bureau budget reforms with staffing and skill requirements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Secretary of State has designated foreign assistance as a pillar of the  The Secretary of State has designated foreign assistance as a pillar of the  Transformational Diplomacy Initiative, which aims to integrate U.S.  Transformational Diplomacy Initiative, which aims to integrate U.S.  foreign assistance activities into overall diplomatic efforts.

Moreover, State\u2019s mission planning  process only tracks staff time by strategic objective and cannot identify  staffing devoted to a specific program.", "State workforce planners said they do not have a systematic way of  identifying personnel working on foreign assistance unless it is obvious  from their job title. In response to our request for information, the  workforce planners were able to identify about 300 foreign assistance- related full-time positions in headquarters functional bureaus. They said  State\u2019s most recent domestic staffing model does not contain the critical  information necessary to identify foreign assistance-related functions in  the regional bureaus.", "Furthermore, State does not have a systematic way of identifying all staff  officially designated as grants officer representatives, because State does  not maintain a comprehensive list of these designees. Grants officers  stated that the letters designating the grants officer representatives are  included in the grants file; however, State\u2019s current grants database  management system does not capture information on grants officer  representatives, according to Administrative Bureau procurement officials.  Thus there is no systematic workforce information on staff to whom  foreign assistance responsibilities are delegated. Moreover, it is not clear  whether staff with grants management responsibility who are not officially  appointed as grants officer representatives are bound by the same  responsibilities, authorities, and limitations described in the designation  letter."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Does Not Have Consistent Training Requirements for Staff Managing Foreign Assistance Activities", "paragraphs": ["In accordance with internal control standards all personnel should possess  and maintain a level of competence that allows them to accomplish their  assigned duties, as well as understand the importance of developing and  implementing good internal control. This includes identifying appropriate  knowledge and skills as well as providing needed training. However, as  State does not have complete data that would allow it to identify any gaps  in the numbers, skills, and competencies it needs to manage foreign  assistance programs and develop strategies\u2014such as providing training\u2014 to address those gaps, State cannot assure itself that all employees who  manage and monitor foreign assistance activities have the necessary skills.", "We found that State has inconsistent training and skills requirements for  its staff involved in foreign assistance oversight. For example, grants  officers must meet a number of requirements under State Grant Policy  Directive 1 to obtain a Grants Officer Warrant to award federal assistance.  This directive establishes State\u2019s policy that grants officers possess the  minimum qualifications necessary to ensure that federal assistance  agreements issued by State are sound and in compliance with laws and  regulations. The directive requires domestic applicants to meet specific  education and training qualifications to obtain a grants warrant\u2014such as  completion of a 56-hour course in grants management training and 4-year  course of study leading to a bachelor\u2019s degree. The warrant limits the  dollar amount of awards the officers can make. In contrast, State does not  have agencywide training requirements for grants officer representatives  who are often delegated some of the grants officers\u2019 oversight  responsibilities. For example, State Policy Directive 16 states that  education and special training may be considered when designating grants  officer representatives, but it does not provide specifics on what training  and education to consider. Further, grants officers do not have control  over whether or not the grants officer representatives are qualified,  because the bureau for which the assistance award is made generally  appoints the grants officer representative when it submits the award  package to the grants officer for final processing. For example, Near  Eastern Affairs Bureau and INL grants officers stated that program staff  with subject area knowledge are designated as grants officer  representatives and that these staff do not have to meet any specific  training requirements.", "Overseas staff with foreign assistance management responsibilities also do  not always have to meet foreign assistance management specific training  or experience requirements. For example, INL officials said that Foreign  Service officers applying for their bureau\u2019s overseas positions did not have  to meet any specialized management skill requirements. INL human  resources officials added that INL has difficulty matching staff with the  assignments because there is no guidance on skills requirements. Further,  some DRL and G/TIP officials stated that overseas staff generally lacked  the training to monitor their grants. Moreover, State\u2019s Inspector General  reported that Foreign Service officers overseas with MEPI responsibilities  lacked grants related training. The Inspector General further reported that  political and economic officers supporting small bilateral MEPI grants and  larger regional initiatives did not have grants training and showed an  uncertain grasp of their oversight responsibilities and of MEPI  expectations. Lack of properly trained staff could negatively impact  State\u2019s ability to effectively deliver foreign assistance, and would be an  internal control weakness that puts grants at risk.", "Several of the Administration Bureau and Near Eastern Affairs Bureau  grants officers we interviewed recommended that all grants officer  representatives receive training, such as the grants management courses  offered by FSI: \u201cIntroduction to Grants and Cooperative Agreements for  Federal Personnel\u201d and \u201cMonitoring Grants and Cooperative Agreements.\u201d  The former course is required for Public Diplomacy officers substantially  involved in pre and postaward assistance processes overseas. Any Federal  personnel responsible for overseeing administrative, financial, or program  performance of grant recipients would benefit from the latter class,  according to the FSI course catalog.", "Although State does not have agencywide training requirements, some  individual bureaus do. For example, DRL has internal training  requirements for bureau staff who serve as grants officer representatives,  requiring them to complete the two FSI classes on grants management,  according to DRL officials. In addition, PRM officials stated that the  bureau\u2014which does not designate grants officer representatives\u2014 requires its headquarters and overseas staff to take the FSI\u2019s Population,  Refugee and Migration Officers Monitoring and Evaluation Workshop. FSI  also offers a week-long introductory orientation for staff who work on  refugee issues led by PRM officials.", "Moreover, an FSI survey in response to employee requests for grants  management training suggests that Foreign Service officers overseas  recognize that there is a gap in their foreign assistance management skills.  FSI officials stated that the Institute conducted a needs assessment,  including a survey, in response to anecdotal information about the need  for the training. The officials said that based on the survey responses, FSI  created a new training course\u2014Managing Foreign Assistance Awards  Overseas. According to FSI, the new training was designed to meet the  changing needs of Foreign Service officers under the Diplomatic  Readiness and Transformational Diplomacy Initiatives. The 3-day elective  course is geared toward economic and political officers who need to learn  the fundamentals of assistance awards management and who will have  project management or oversight responsibilities. According to FSI, the  course targets officers who will design, develop, and oversee assistance  programs at post in support of mission performance plan goals, and is not  geared toward officers providing assistance on activities managed from  headquarters. FSI began offering the course in April 2007. The FSI officials  said they were not aware of any additional training needs or proposed  training related to foreign assistance management."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Officials Concerned About Department\u2019s Ability to Effectively Manage Grants", "paragraphs": ["Grants officers and other officials whom we met with expressed concern  about their ability to handle their grant management responsibilities to  ensure that federal funds are being spent as intended. For example, we  interviewed all five Administrative Bureau grants officers responsible for  awarding grants for some of the bureaus and offices in our scope. We also  interviewed Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs and INL grants officers. The  Administrative Bureau grants officers who are responsible for much of  State\u2019s development and humanitarian assistance awards stated that they  did not have sufficient time to fully oversee the implementation of the  grants, including pre and postaward activities. Preaward activities include  determining the level of competition, soliciting the proposal, and selecting  the grantee. Postaward activities include the monitoring required to  ensure a recipient is in adherence with State, bureau, and program  requirements.", "Various officials with whom we spoke expressed concerns about  preaward management activities. Two of the Administrative Bureau grants  officers told us they were concerned about whether program and regional  bureau staff were sufficiently knowledgeable to solicit proposals and  competitively select grantees. These grants officers stated they generally  are not involved in the process for soliciting proposals and selecting the  grantee because of their workload. Instead, the program bureau is  responsible for the review and selection of assistance recipients prior to  the award. The grants officers said that, as a result, they did not know  whether the solicitations complied with relevant laws and regulations. For  example, one of the grants officers did not believe a program bureau  selecting grantees had sufficiently advertised its grant solicitations to  reach the most potential grantees possible. Other State officials with  whom we met raised this same issue. Moreover, in June 2006, State\u2019s  Inspector General raised concerns about the lack of competition for some  foreign assistance awards, reporting that PRM had not consistently  followed State or U.S. government policies that require applications for  federal assistance to be solicited in a manner that provides for  competition. In response, PRM established policies and procedures that  require that all awards are advertised and that relevant State regulations to  justify noncompetitive awards are complied with, according to PRM  officials.", "The Administrative Bureau grants officers and other officials with whom  we spoke also discussed postaward activities. For example, three of the  grants officers told us they were concerned about the lack of time they  had to devote to the grants after funds are obligated. They said they  receive a number of program and financial reports from the grantees at the  same time and consequently do not have enough time to thoroughly  review them. They said that they rely on the grants officer representatives,  who are not subject to agencywide training requirements, to review the  reports and notify them of problems. The grants officers further stated that  their workload did not permit them to close out the grants and that they  had to rely on what the grantee reported.", "Grants officers and other officials also discussed issues related to site  visits to monitor the grantees. For example, Administrative Bureau grants  officers expressed concerns over their lack of opportunity to make site  visits. They said that the program bureaus responsible for the grants would  have to set aside travel funds for them to travel, but that this is rarely  done. Most of the grants officers we interviewed said that they have not  traveled overseas for monitoring visits and that they rely on the grants  officer representatives to perform this duty. However, some of the  Administrative and Near Eastern Affairs Bureau grants officers said the  grants officer representatives do not consistently inform them of  upcoming site visit. Grants Policy Directive 16 requires the grants officer  representatives to obtain prior approval from the grants officer before  visiting the grantee\u2019s place of performance to evaluate progress or  performance. For example, one of the grants officer said the grants officer  representative does not consult with her on whether there are financial  issues to be addressed, and another stated that the grants officer  representatives focus more on programmatic rather than management or  financial issues. Both stated that they do not receive any reports after site  visits.", "We also met with about 20 DRL program and policy officers who serve as  grants officer representatives, and they generally indicated that grant  oversight would be improved by more frequent site visits to monitor  grantee activity. The DRL grants officer representatives said they make  site visits as workload, travel funds, and conditions in the country permit.  A G/TIP grants officer representative expressed similar concerns, stating  that G/TIP does not have the time or the budget to visit every grantee.  State\u2019s Inspector General has found the lack of monitoring to be an issue  in the past, and reported in 2005 that G/TIP did not adequately monitor its  grantee activities. The report found that the grants officer for G/TIP relied  on a G/TIP grants officer representative who in turn relied on overseas  posts to monitor grantee activity. The Inspector General found very few  embassy evaluations verifying monitoring had been occurring and  recommended that G/TIP improve its recordkeeping."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Has Not Yet Integrated Workforce Planning into Foreign Assistance Reform Efforts", "paragraphs": ["State is implementing foreign assistance budgetary reforms without  considering the potential impact of these reforms on its staffing and skills  requirements, which does not conform to strategic workforce principles.  One such principle is that an agency\u2019s management lead the effort to align  its human capital program with current and emerging mission and  programmatic goals. The Secretary of State recently established the F  Bureau within State to serve as an umbrella leadership structure for  aligning and coordinating all foreign assistance, policy, planning, and  oversight. Since its establishment, the F Bureau has developed a strategic  framework for foreign assistance and established new priority objectives.  The budget reforms could result in some countries and programs receiving  more funding, while others receive less. Such changes could shift where  staff with foreign assistance responsibilities are needed from one bureau  to another or from headquarters to overseas missions. For example, the  fiscal year 2008 budget request includes INCLE funds for many countries  that had no such funding in previous years. However, as of July 2007, State  had not begun to align human capital resources with the reforms,  according to a senior F Bureau official. The official said that the F Bureau  would eventually address human capital requirements, but he did not  provide a time frame. Further, State\u2019s Human Resources Bureau officials  told us they had not attended meetings in which foreign assistance budget  decisions were made that could potentially impact human capital  requirements.

Moreover, bureaus and offices that  manage development and humanitarian assistance programs could not  readily provide data on staffing devoted to foreign assistance activities,  particularly overseas staffing.

We then reviewed the  portion of the U.S. budget that funded development and humanitarian  assistance and used State allotment reports to capture the fiscal accounts  that were available to State for obligation between fiscal years 2000 and  2006.", "To identify overall funding supporting U.S. government foreign assistance  activities, we reviewed the U.S. budget general fund to identify  International Affairs (function 150) budget accounts. Function 150 budget  accounts are classified by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as  those related to  international development and humanitarian assistance (function 151),   international security assistance (152),   the conduct of foreign affairs (153),   foreign information and exchange activities (154), and  international financial programs (155).", "We focused on the general fund because it contains the fiscal accounts  that are funded from regular congressional appropriations, as opposed to  accounts that are nonbudgetary or receive appropriations from other  general fund accounts, or trust funds that hold foreign government  payments, gifts, or contributions. To capture funds available for obligation,  including the congressional appropriation as well as funds carried over  from the previous year, we used the amounts shown on line 23.90 (total  budgetary resources available for obligation) of the program and financing  table of the Department of State and Other International Programs budget  appendix for fiscal years 2002 through 2008. We used the budgets for  these years because they have final (actual) amounts for fiscal years 2000  through 2006. If line 23.90 was not applicable for a certain account, such  as when no unobligated funds were being carried over, we used line 22.00  (new budget authority). For accounts that had not received new funds, we  used line 21.40 (unobligated balance brought forward from the previous  year).", "To identify the 150 budget accounts from which State received funding, we  used Treasury budget identification codes as well as assistance account  information obtained from State\u2019s office of the director of foreign  assistance. We also referred to Treasury Financial Management Service\u2019s  combined statement on appropriations and outlays to identify accounts  from which State received 150 funds and accounts State sent to other  agencies, such as the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative account. From the  function 150 fiscal accounts we separated out development and  humanitarian budget lines (function 151) as well as the economic support  fund. While the economic support fund is not a function 151 account, we  included it in our scope of development and humanitarian assistance fiscal  accounts because it was a primary account that State used for funding this  type of assistance.", "To identify State\u2019s share of the 151 account, we used allotment reports  provided by State\u2019s resource management office that reported how much  development and humanitarian assistance State received annually, by  fiscal account. These allotment amounts included funds carried over from  the previous year, and so represented funds available to State for  obligation. We used transfer data from State\u2019s resource management office  to identify transfers of the economic support fund and other fiscal  accounts to the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement  account (INCLE) and the Andean Counterdrug Initiative. We determined  State\u2019s allotment and transfer information was sufficiently reliable for our  purposes, through (1) discussions with State resource management  officials and (2) cross-checks with the U.S. budget appendix, the Treasury  Financial Management Service\u2019s combined statement, and publicly  available information from the U.S. Agency for International Development  (USAID).", "To identify State\u2019s approaches to managing programs, we reviewed  program information, including obligations data, monitoring plans, trip  report templates, grant policy directives, and grants data.

Based on our analysis and discussions with the officials, we determined  that these data are sufficiently reliable for our purposes.
