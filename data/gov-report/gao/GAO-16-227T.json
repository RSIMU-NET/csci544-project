Although the results of GAO's survey provide VBA with data about users' satisfaction with VBMS, the absence of user satisfaction goals limits the utility of survey results.

In addition, the Director stated that the Program  Management Office intends to develop a capability to automatically  associate veterans\u2019 correspondence when a new piece of evidence to  support a claim is received electronically or scanned into VBMS. The  office also plans to integrate VBMS with VA\u2019s Integrated Disability  Evaluation System, which contains the results of veterans\u2019 disability  medical examinations, as well as with external systems that contain  military service treatment records for veterans, including those at the  National Personnel Records Center.", "Further, while VBMS was planned to support the processing of disability  compensation and pension benefits, VBA has not yet developed and  implemented end-to-end pension processing capabilities in the system.  Without such capabilities, the agency must continue to rely on three  legacy systems to process pension claims.

The Director of the Program Management Office  stated that VBA is currently analyzing commercial IT solutions that can  meet the business requirements for appeals, such as providing document  navigation capabilities. According to the Director, VBMS, nevertheless, is  expected to be part of the appeals modernization solution because  components of the system, such as the eFolder and certain workload  management functionality, are planned to continue supporting appeals  management.", "In the Director\u2019s view, the fact that VBMS requires additional development  beyond 2015 does not reflect a delay in completing the system\u2019s  development. Instead, the additional time is a consequence of decisions  to enlarge the program\u2019s scope over time. The Director stated that the  system\u2019s original purpose had been to serve primarily as an electronic  document repository, and that the program has met this goal.", "In addition, the Director said that, as the program\u2019s mission has expanded  to support the department\u2019s efforts to eliminate the disability claims  backlog, the office has had to re-prioritize, add, and defer system  requirements to accommodate broader departmental decisions and, in  some cases, regulatory changes. For example, the office was tasked with  developing functionality in VBMS to meet regulatory requirements for  processing disability claims using mandatory forms. Officials in the  office said they were made aware of this requirement well after system  planning for the March 2015 release had been completed, which had  introduced significant complexity to their development work.", "Finally, VBA included in its strategic road map a number of objectives  related to VBMS that are planned to be addressed in fiscal year 2016.  Officials in the Program Management Office stated that they intend to  develop tactical plans that identify expected capabilities to be provided in  future releases.", "Nevertheless, due to the department\u2019s incremental approach to  developing and implementing VBMS, VBA has not yet produced a plan  that identifies when VBMS will be completed and can be expected to fully  support disability and pension claims processing and appeals. Thus, it will  be difficult for the department to hold its managers accountable for  meeting the time frame and for demonstrating progress.

In 2011, VBA submitted to the  Office of Management and Budget a life-cycle cost estimate for VBMS of  $934.8 million. This estimate was intended to capture costs for the  system\u2019s development, deployment, sustainment, and general operating  expenses through the end of fiscal year 2018. However, as of July 2015,  the program\u2019s actual costs had exceeded the 2011 life-cycle cost  estimate. Specifically, VBMS received approximately $1 billion in funding  through the end of fiscal year 2015 and the department has requested an  additional $290 million for the program in fiscal year 2016.", "A significant concern is that the Program Management Office has not  reliably updated the VBMS life-cycle cost estimate to reflect the program\u2019s  expanded scope and timelines for completion of the system. This is  largely attributable to the fact that the office has developed cost estimates  for 2-year project cycles that are used for VBMS milestone reviews under  the Office of Information and Technology\u2019s Project Management  Accountability System.", "When asked how the Program Management Office arrived at the cost  estimates reported in the milestone reviews, program officials stated that  they developed rough order of magnitude estimates for each business  need based on expert knowledge of the system, past development and  engineering experience, and lessons learned. However, while this  approach may have provided adequate information for VBA to prioritize  VBMS system requirements to be addressed in the next release, it has  not produced estimates that could serve as a basis for identifying the  system\u2019s funding needs. Because it is typically derived from limited data  and in a short time, a rough order of magnitude analysis is not equivalent  to a budget-quality cost estimate and may limit an agency\u2019s ability to  identify the funding necessary to efficiently execute a program.", "In addition, the Program Management Office\u2019s annual operating plan,  which is generally limited to high-level information about the program\u2019s  organization, priorities, staffing, milestones, and performance measures  for fiscal year 2015, also shows estimated costs totaling $512 million for  VBMS development from fiscal years 2017 through 2020. However,  according to the Director of the Program Management Office, this  estimate was also developed using rough order of magnitude analysis.  Further, the estimate does not provide reliable information on life-cycle  costs because it does not include estimated IT sustainment and general  operating expenses.", "Thus, even though the Program Management Office developed rough  order of magnitude cost estimates for VBMS, these estimates have not  been sufficiently reliable to effectively identify the program\u2019s funding  needs. Instead, during the last 3 fiscal years, the Director has had to  request an additional $118 million in IT development funds to meet  program demands and to ensure support for ongoing development  contracts. Specifically, in May 2013, VA requested $13.3 million to  support additional work on VBMS. Then, during fiscal year 2014, VA  reprogrammed $73 million of unobligated IT sustainment funds to develop  functionality to transfer service treatment records from the Department of  Defense to VA, and to support development of VBMS-Core functionality.  In December 2014, the Program Management Office identified the need  for additional fiscal year 2015 funds for ongoing system development  contracts for VBMS-Core and VBMS-Awards, and, in late April 2015,  department leadership submitted a letter to Congress requesting  permission to reprogram $31.7 million to support work on these contracts,  the National Work Queue, and other VBMS efforts.", "According to the Program Management Office Director, the need to  request additional funding does not represent additional risk to the  program, but is the result of VBMS\u2019s success. The Director further noted  that, as the Program Management Office has identified opportunities to  increase functionality to improve the electronic claims process, their  funding needs have also increased. Nevertheless, evolution of the VBMS  program illustrates the importance of continuous planning, including cost  estimating, so that trade-offs between cost, schedule, and scope can be  effectively managed. Further, without a reliable estimate of the total costs  associated with completing work on VBMS, stakeholders will have a  limited view of VBMS\u2019s future resource needs and the program is at risk  of not being able to secure appropriate funding to fully develop and  implement the system.

From September 2013 through  April 2015, VBA reported a decrease in average response times for  VBMS-Core and VBMS-Rating. It attributed the decrease in response  times to continuous engineering improvements to system performance.  Program officials also explained that the difference in response times  between modules was due to the type of information that is being pulled  into each module from various other VBA systems. For example, both  VBMS-Core and VBMS-Rating require information from the VBA  corporate database, but VBMS-Core is populated with data from multiple  VBA systems in addition to the corporate database.", "Program officials told us that specific goals for mean transaction response  times have not been established because they feel that adequate tools  are in place to monitor system performance and provide alerts if there are  response time issues. For example, VBMS performance is monitored in  real time by dedicated staff at a contractor\u2019s facility, users have access to  a live chat feature where they can provide feedback on any issues they  are experiencing with the system, and the VBMS help desk offers another  avenue for users to provide feedback on the system\u2019s performance. The  officials also noted that, because transaction response times have  decreased, which can be indicative of an improvement to system  performance, they are focusing their resources on adding additional  functionality instead of trying to get the system to achieve a specific  average transaction response time.", "While VBA\u2019s monitoring of VBMS\u2019s performance is commendable and the  system\u2019s performance and response times have improved over time, the  system is still in development and there is no guarantee that performance  will remain at current levels as the system evolves. Performance targets  and goals for VBMS response times would provide users with an  expectation of the system response times they should anticipate, and  management with an indication of how well the system is performing  relative to performance goals.

Critical defects also have  extensive user impact and do not have workarounds. High severity  defects can have major user impact, leading to significant loss of system  functionality. Medium severity defects can have moderate user impact  and lead to moderate loss of functionality. For high and medium severity  defects, workarounds could exist.

Nevertheless, even with the workarounds, high and medium  severity open defects, which by definition impact system functionality,  degraded users\u2019 experiences with the system. Continuing to deploy  system releases with defects that impact system functionality increases  the risk that these defects will diminish users\u2019 ability to process disability  claims in an efficient manner. Accordingly, we recommended that VA  reduce the incidence of high and medium severity level defects that are  present at the time of future VBMS releases. The department agreed with  this recommendation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VBA Had Not Conducted a Survey to Obtain Users\u2019 Feedback or Established Related Goals; GAO Found that Satisfaction with the System Varied", "paragraphs": ["Our September 2015 report noted that, in addition to having defined  program goals and related performance targets, leading practices identify  continuous customer feedback as a crucial element of IT project  success. Particularly for projects like VBMS, where development  activities are iterative, customer and end user perspectives and insights  can be solicited through various methods\u2014user acceptance testing,  interviews, complaint programs, and satisfaction surveys\u2014to validate or  raise questions about the project\u2019s implementation.", "Further, leading practices emphasize that periodic customer satisfaction  data should be proactively used to improve performance and demonstrate  the level of satisfaction the project is delivering. The Office of  Management and Budget has developed standards and guidelines in  survey research that are generally consistent with best practices and  call for statistically valid data collection efforts to be used in fulfilling  agencies\u2019 customer service data collection. These leading practices also  stress the importance of centrally integrating all customer feedback data  in order to have more complete diagnostic information to guide  improvement efforts.", "VA has used a variety of methods for obtaining customer and end user  feedback on the performance of VBMS. For example, the department  solicits end user involvement and feedback in the iterative system  development process based on user acceptance criteria. According to  the Senior Project Manager for VBMS Development within the Office of  Information and Technology, at the end of each development cycle and  before a new version of VBMS is deployed, end users are involved in  user acceptance testing and a final customer acceptance meeting.", "The department also provides training to a subset of end users\u2014known  as \u201csuperusers\u201d\u2014on the updated functionality introduced in a new version  of VBMS. These superusers are expected to train the remaining users in  the field on the new version\u2019s features. The department tracks the overall  satisfaction level with training received after each VBMS major release.", "However, this tracking is limited to superusers\u2019 satisfaction with the  training, rather than with their satisfaction with the system.", "Further, the department solicits customer feedback about the system  through interviews. For example, the Director of the Program  Management Office stated that the Under Secretary for Benefits hosts a  weekly phone call with bargaining unit employees as a \u201cpulse check\u201d on  VBA transformation activities, including VBMS. According to this official,  the VBA Office of Field Operations also offers an instant messaging chat  service to all regional office employees to solicit feedback about the latest  deployment of VBMS functionality.", "Another method in which the department obtains customer input is  through a formal feedback process. For example, according to the  Director, VA provides national service desk support to assist users in  troubleshooting system issues and identifying system defects. In addition,  VBMS applications include a built-in feature that enables users to provide  feedback to the Program Management Office on problems with the  system. According to the Director, the feedback received by the office  also helps to identify user training issues.", "Nevertheless, while VA has taken these various steps to obtain feedback  on the performance and implementation of VBMS, it has not established  goals to define user satisfaction that can be used as a basis for gauging  the success of its efforts to promote satisfaction with the system. Further,  while the efforts that have been taken to solicit users\u2019 feedback provide  VBA with useful insights about particular problems, data are not centrally  compiled or sufficient for supporting overall conclusions about whether  customers are satisfied. In addition, VBA has not employed a customer  satisfaction survey of claims processing employees who use the system  on a daily basis to process disability claims. Such a survey could provide  a more comprehensive picture of overall customer satisfaction and help  identify areas where the system\u2019s development and implementation  efforts might need additional attention.", "According to the Director of the Program Management Office, VBA has  not used a survey to solicit feedback because of concern that such a  mechanism may negatively impact the efficiency of claims processors in  completing disability compensation claims on behalf of veterans. Further,  the Director believed that the office had the benefit of receiving ongoing  end user input on VBMS by virtue of the intensive testing cycles, as well  as several of the other mechanisms by which end users have provided  ongoing feedback. Nevertheless, without establishing user satisfaction  goals and collecting the comprehensive data that a statistically valid  survey can provide, the Program Management Office limits its ability to  obtain a comprehensive understanding of VBMS users\u2019 satisfaction with  the system. Thus, VBA could miss opportunities to improve the efficiency  of its claims process by increasing satisfaction with VBMS. Therefore, we  recommended that VA develop and administer a statistically valid survey  of VBMS users to determine the effectiveness of steps taken to make  improvements in users\u2019 satisfaction. The department agreed with this  recommendation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most Types of Users Reported Satisfaction with VBMS, but Decision Review Officers Were Generally Dissatisfied", "paragraphs": ["In response to a statistical survey that we administered, most of the  VBMS users reported that they were satisfied with the system that had  been implemented at the time of the survey. These users (claims  assistants, veteran service representatives, supervisory veteran service  representatives, rating veterans service representatives, decision review  officers, and others) were satisfied with the three modules of VBMS.", "Specifically, an estimated 59 percent of the claims processors were  satisfied with VBMS-Core; an estimated 63 percent were satisfied with  the Rating module, and an estimated 67 percent were satisfied with the  Awards module.", "Nevertheless, while a majority of users were satisfied with the three  modules, decision review officers expressed considerably less  satisfaction than other users with VBMS-Core and VBMS-Rating.  Specifically, for VBMS-Core, an estimated 27 percent of decision review  officers were satisfied compared to an estimated 59 percent of all roles of  claims processors (including decision review officers) who were satisfied.  In addition, for VBMS-Rating, an estimated 38 percent of decision review  officers were satisfied, compared to an estimated 63 percent of all roles of  claims processors.", "Decision review officers were considerably less satisfied with VBMS in  comparison to all roles of claims processors in additional areas. For  example, an estimated 26 percent of decision review officers viewed  VBMS-Core as an improvement over the previous legacy system or  systems for establishing claims and storing and reviewing electronic  documents related to a claim in an eFolder. In contrast, an estimated 58  percent of all users (including decision review officers) viewed the Core  module as an improvement.", "In addition, an estimated 26 percent of decision review officers viewed  VBMS-Rating as an improvement over the previous systems with respect  to providing Web-accessible tools, including rules-based rating  calculators, to assist in making claims rating decisions. In contrast, an  estimated 55 percent of all roles of claims processors viewed the Rating  module as an improvement. For VBMS-Awards, an estimated 61 percent  of all roles viewed this module as an improvement over the previous  systems to automate the award and notification process.", "Similarly, in considering the three modules, a majority of users (including  decision review officers) would have chosen VBMS over the legacy  system or systems. However, decision review officers indicated that they  were less likely to have chosen VBMS-Core and VBMS-Rating over  legacy systems. Specifically, an estimated 27 percent of decision review  officers would have chosen VBMS-Core compared to an estimated 60  percent of all roles of claims processors. In addition, an estimated 27  percent of decision review officers would have chosen VBMS-Rating  compared to 61 percent of all roles that would have chosen the system  over the legacy system or systems. For VBMS-Awards, an estimated 67  percent of all roles would have chosen this module over the previous  systems.", "Decision review officers perform an array of duties to resolve claims  issues raised by veterans and their representatives. They may also  conduct a new review or complete a review of a claim without deference  to the original decision, and, in doing so, must click through all documents  included in the e-Folder. Survey comments from decision review officers  stated, for example, that reviews in the VBMS paperless environment  take longer because of the length of time spent loading, scrolling, and  viewing each document (particularly if the documents are large, such as a  service medical record file). Additionally, multiple decision review officers  commented that it is easier and faster to review documents in a paper file.  Although such comments provide illustrative examples of individual  decision review officers\u2019 views and are not representative, according to  the Director of the Program Management Office, decision review officers\u2019  relative dissatisfaction is not surprising because the system does not yet  include functionality that supports their work, which primarily relates to  appeals processing. To improve this situation, we recommended that VA  establish goals that define customer satisfaction with the system and  report on actual performance toward achieving the goals based on the  results of our survey of VBMS users and any future surveys VA conducts.  The department concurred with this recommendation.", "In conclusion, while VA has made progress in developing and  implementing VBMS, additional capabilities to fully process disability  claims were delayed beyond when the system\u2019s completion was originally  planned. Further, in the absence of a plan that identifies when and at  what cost the system can be expected to fully support disability  compensation and pension claims processing and appeals, holding VA  management accountable for meeting a schedule, while ensuring  sufficient program funding, will be difficult. Also, without goals for system  response times, users do not have an expectation of the response times  they can anticipate, and management lacks an indication of how well the  system is performing. Furthermore, continuing to deploy system releases  with defects that impact functionality increases the risk that these defects  will diminish users\u2019 ability to process disability claims in an efficient  manner. Lastly, although the results of our survey provide VBA with  useful data about users\u2019 satisfaction with VBMS (e.g., the majority of  users are satisfied), without having goals to define user satisfaction, VBA  does not have a basis for gauging the success of its efforts to improve the  system. As we stressed in our report, attention to these issues can  improve VA\u2019s efforts to effectively complete the development and  implementation of VBMS. Fully addressing our recommendations, as VA  agreed to do, should help the department give appropriate attention to  these issues.", "Chairman Miller, Ranking Member Brown, and Members of the  Committee, this concludes my prepared statement.
