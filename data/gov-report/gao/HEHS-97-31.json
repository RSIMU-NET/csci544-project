The implicit foundation level represents the minimum total funding that a state\u2019s districts could spend per student if they were to make an equal local tax effort. Our approach helps explain the structural forces that drive the inequities between wealthy and poor districts.

States with higher income levels can provide more funding for their students. In the 1991-92 school year, states\u2019 average income per weighted pupil ranged from $41,385 in Utah to $160,761 in New Jersey. States also vary in the number of students with additional educational needs, such as poor or disabled students, who tend to have education costs higher than average. For example, the student poverty rate among states in 1989 ranged from about 33 percent in Mississippi to under 8 percent in New Hampshire.", "In addition, localities\u2019 ability to raise revenues varies widely. Localities raise revenues primarily through property taxes and, to a lesser extent, through local sales and income taxes. However, a heavy reliance on local property taxes as a major source of school revenue has produced funding disparities because school districts\u2019 property tax bases vary widely. Localities with low property values usually have low funding per pupil even with high tax rates; localities with high property values have high funding per pupil even with low tax rates. Since the late 1960s, the funding gaps arising from the continued reliance on local tax revenues have led to litigation challenging the constitutionality of state school finance systems, with varying results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Achieving Equitable School Finance Systems Involves Complex Issues", "paragraphs": ["Researchers concerned about the equity of school finance systems\u2014that is, the distribution of education funding\u2014have focused on two important definitions of equity: vertical equity and fiscal neutrality. Vertical equity recognizes that legitimate differences occur among children and that some students, such as those who are disabled, have low academic achievement, or limited English proficiency, need additional educational services. After adjusting the pupil count to give greater weight to those pupils who need extra educational services and adjusting the funding for cost differences in educational resources, some experts would argue that funding per weighted pupil should be nearly equal among districts. Fiscal neutrality asserts that no relationship should exist between educational spending per pupil and local district property wealth per pupil (or some other measure of fiscal capacity). That is, the quality of education should be a function only of the entire state\u2019s wealth, not of a locality\u2019s. Unlike vertical equity, which calls for nearly equal funding per weighted pupil among districts after adjustments have been made, fiscal neutrality allows for differences in funding as long as they are not related to the districts\u2019 taxable wealth.", "In addition to equity, researchers are also concerned about the adequacy of educational resources. Education funding is termed adequate if it enables each student to achieve some minimum level of academic performance. Not much is known, however, about the level of funding needed to achieve a certain level of performance.

In general, states have used one or both of the following equalization strategies: added new state or local money to the school finance system to increase funding for poor districts or redistributed the available funding to poor districts by modifying school finance formulas. Redistributing education revenues may also include recapturing the local revenues raised above an established level in wealthy districts and giving them to poor districts.", "One of the more common funding formulas used to equalize the ability of districts to raise education revenues is the foundation program. A foundation program sets an expenditure per pupil\u2014the minimum foundation\u2014at a level that would provide at least a minimum-quality education for every pupil. Usually, districts must put forth a minimum local tax effort to receive state aid, which makes up the difference between what localities raise by the required local tax effort and the foundation amount. This funding formula results in states targeting more state education funds, on a per pupil basis, to those districts with low tax bases than to those with high tax bases.", "Despite the seeming simplicity of this funding formula, equalizing school finance systems is a complex and difficult undertaking. In a recent report, we reviewed the experiences of three states that had used one or both of the equalization strategies noted above. Although these states reported reduced funding gaps, their legislative solutions reflected citizens\u2019 concerns about increased taxes to raise more state revenues and concerns of wealthy districts that wanted to maintain existing spending levels."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Wealthy Districts Had More Education Funding per Weighted Pupil Than Poor Districts in Most States", "paragraphs": ["Although most states pursued strategies to supplement the local funding in their poorest districts, the strategies generally did not offset the advantage of wealthy districts in raising local funds.

In three states the opposite occurred\u2014the total funding decreased as district income increased. Among the 37 states whose school funding favored wealthier districts, the amount of funding available as district income increased varied widely. At the high end of the 37 states, students in Maryland had about $25 more in total funding for a $1,000 increase in income per weighted pupil above the state average.

Using a foundation funding model and assuming all districts made an equal local tax effort, we estimated the implicit foundation level that each state\u2019s equalization policies in school year 1991-92 could have supported. This implicit foundation level is an estimate of the minimum amount of total funding that states\u2019 districts could spend per student if districts were to make an equal minimum local tax effort.This new measure, for the first time, allows analysts to examine the extent to which the funding gap between poor and wealthy districts is due to state equalization policies (state share and state targeting) and the extent to which it is due to local policies (relative differences in local tax efforts).

For each district, we graphed how much total funding per weighted pupil is associated with a given level of tax effort. Since poor districts generally receive more state funding per weighted pupil than wealthy districts, in this example we assigned the poor district $2,500 in state funding per weighted pupil, twice the amount the wealthy district was assigned. Therefore, the line for the poor district starts out higher (the district has more state money) on the graph than the line for the wealthy district (which has less state money). As figure 4 shows, as both districts increase their local tax effort, the wealthy district raises more local revenue than the poor district for a given level of tax effort. For any given tax effort past a certain point (where the lines cross on fig. 4), the wealthy district\u2019s local revenue more than offsets the additional state money that poor districts receive\u2014therefore, the total funding in wealthy districts exceeds total funding in poor districts.
