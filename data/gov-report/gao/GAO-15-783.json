Some of the workforce growth is attributed to the establishment of the Disaster Acquisition Response Team (DART) in 2010, which has the primary mission of deploying to provide disaster contracting support, such as contracting for blankets or debris removal. DART has gradually assumed responsibility for administering the majority of disaster contract spending, but FEMA does not have a process for prioritizing the team's work during disasters. Without such a process, FEMA is at risk of developing gaps in contract oversight during major disasters. Further, in 2011, FEMA established an agreement that regional contracting officers would report to headquarters supervisors for technical oversight while continuing to respond to regional supervisors\u2014who have responsibility for administrative duties\u2014for everyday operations. This agreement has led to challenges for FEMA in cohesively managing its workforce, including heightening the potential for an environment of competing interests for the regional contracting officers. Further, FEMA has not revisited this agreement on annual basis as called for in the agreement. As a result, it does not incorporate lessons learned since its creation 4 years ago.", "FEMA has not fully implemented 2006 Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act (PKEMRA) contracting reforms due in part to incomplete guidance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that the FEMA Administrator establish procedures to prioritize DART's workload, revisit the agreement for oversight of regional contracting officers, and improve guidance on PKEMRA requirements.

In  fiscal years 2013 and 2014, FEMA obligated more than $2.1 billion for its  disaster and non-disaster contracts. The focus of this report is FEMA\u2019s  disaster contracting, which during this period included obligations of $631  million from the FEMA headquarters contracting offices primarily  responsible for supporting disasters, and almost $137 million from  FEMA\u2019s regional offices.", "Buying needed products or services in a timely manner is essential,  particularly when supporting an active disaster, but these needs must be  balanced with other requirements, including following contracting laws  and regulations. Congress passed the Post-Katrina Emergency  Management Reform Act of 2006 (PKEMRA) to address various  shortcomings in FEMA\u2019s disaster response capabilities. Among the more  than 300 reform provisions are 4 requirements for DHS and FEMA to  improve contracting practices to strengthen preparedness and  accountability. In 2008, GAO reported on actions taken by DHS and  FEMA to implement those requirements and found that FEMA had  generally made preliminary progress but work remained to fully  implement the provisions.", "You asked us to review FEMA\u2019s contracting practices in support of  disasters and its efforts to implement requirements from PKEMRA. This  report addresses the extent to which FEMA has (1) made efforts to build  and manage its contracting workforce and structure to support disasters  since the enactment of PKEMRA and (2) adopted contracting reforms  identified in PKEMRA and demonstrated good management practices to  enhance its disaster contracting.", "To assess FEMA\u2019s efforts to build and manage its contracting workforce  and structure, we reviewed and analyzed data on FEMA\u2019s workforce  since Hurricane Katrina, which occurred in 2005, to identify staff size,  rates of attrition, and years of experience. To assess the reliability of the  workforce data used in the review, we reviewed information on the data  collection process and compared key data elements from the workforce  data to statements about start dates, home offices, and deployments  made by officials that we interviewed. We concluded the workforce data  was sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this review. To understand  how FEMA manages its workforce, including the contracting officers who  deploy to disaster areas, we met with officials in the Office of the Chief  Procurement Officer (OCPO) that support disaster contracting activities  and contracting officials and their supervisors in FEMA\u2019s 10 regional  offices. We reviewed available workforce documents, including training  materials and requirements for deployment, to determine the range of  activities carried out by regional and headquarters contracting staff. We  analyzed the agreement that governs headquarters\u2019 role in regional  contracting to determine the roles and responsibilities of regional offices  and headquarters in disaster contracting. We also reviewed guidance  from the Office of Federal Procurement Policy and FEMA regarding  training requirements for contracting officers. Further, we reviewed  federal internal control standards to determine if any major performance  challenges exist. We also assessed the extent to which FEMA relies on  contractors to support its acquisition function by identifying acquisition  support contracts and interviewing contracting officials. We found that  FEMA\u2019s use of acquisition support contracts was limited.", "To assess FEMA\u2019s adoption of PKEMRA contracting reforms and good  management practices that support requirements for internal controls, we  analyzed data from the Federal Procurement Data System-Next  Generation (FPDS-NG) to identify contracts awarded by offices principally  involved in planning for or responding to disasters. Because the  PKEMRA contracting reforms only apply to disaster support contracts, we  focused on contracting offices most likely to award such contracts. We  identified the contracting offices based on our analysis of FEMA\u2019s  obligations in FPDS-NG, which we confirmed with senior FEMA  contracting officials. From these offices, we selected a non-representative  sample of 27 contracts and task orders with obligations in fiscal years  2013 and 2014 and confirmed that they supported disaster response  efforts. Sixteen of the contracts and orders were selected using a  stratified random sample that reflected key elements of PKEMRA  contracting reforms and the other eleven were selected through a  nonprobability sample selected based on factors including high cost.  Although the information collected from our review of contracts is not  generalizable to all relevant contracts, it was valuable for supplementing  interviews with FEMA contracting officials in the contracting offices most  likely to support disaster contracts and from FEMA\u2019s 10 regions. To  understand steps taken to implement PKEMRA contracting requirements,  we spoke to officials from DHS OCPO and FEMA policy officials. We also  reviewed FEMA\u2019s quarterly reports to Congress on contracting activities,  and spoke to officials responsible for these reports, to determine if the 27  contracts and task orders we studied were accurately reported. Further,  we reviewed documentation related to good management practices,  including the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and DHS guidance on  required contracting reviews. Additional details on our objectives, scope,  and methodology can be found in appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2014 to September  2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Senior level FEMA officials said that  morale was a challenge in addition to the high demand for contracting  officers across the government. In one region, a regional supervisor  stated that contracting officers can easily find other opportunities for  advancement without the hassles of disaster contracting, especially if  they hold certain kinds of warrants, such as for construction contracts.  Headquarters officials noted that the recent reorganization was  implemented partly to create more opportunities for promotion and  improve morale because staff will leave if there are not enough  opportunities. In addition, the officials said they have also prioritized hiring  efforts to rebuild their workforce after recent years of limited hiring, which  affected morale."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Created a Team of Disaster Contracting Officers to Provide Increased Oversight, but Has Not Established a Process for Prioritizing Workload", "paragraphs": ["In a 2010 business case to justify hiring additional contracting staff,  OCPO officials said it had substantially added to the size of its contracting  workforce in the years since Hurricane Katrina, but that it did not have  enough specialized contracting staff to manage the contract  administration and oversight requirements of several simultaneous large- scale disasters or a catastrophic event. FEMA identified contract  oversight as a priority after a DHS Inspector General report found that  FEMA incurred over $5 million in excessive contract costs because of  inadequate controls during Hurricane Katrina. To address the need for  improved contract oversight, in 2010, FEMA created 18 new contracting  officer positions to form DART, a team whose primary purpose is to  support contract administration for disasters. Most DART members are  located in three regional offices when not deployed to disasters, but are  considered headquarters staff for management purposes. If a region  needs additional contracting assistance for a disaster, it can come from  reservists, who have limited procurement authority as purchasing agents  and can support smaller disasters, and from DART if larger contracts or  contracts that require specific warrants are needed. For example, FEMA  officials reported that a DART member was deployed to a recent disaster  in Alaska because none of the regional contracting officers had the  architecture warrant needed to support the disaster. To illustrate how  FEMA deploys DART, Figure 7 shows how and when DART members  were deployed to support Hurricane Sandy response efforts. For  example, two of the three DART contracting officers in Oakland,  California deployed to Hurricane Sandy.", "In its 2010 business case, OCPO stated that with DART, FEMA would be  able to deploy experienced personnel to joint field offices to provide  increased oversight of complex contracts during a disaster. These  oversight duties would include making necessary modifications to  complicated contracts and monitoring of contractor performance, such as  assessing contractor compliance with the terms of awarded contracts and  tracking costs and invoice payments.", "Since its establishment in 2010, DART has gradually assumed more  responsibility for administering the majority of FEMA\u2019s disaster contract  spending, which senior officials explained was the original intent.

For example, in a  2014 memo, FEMA\u2019s Head of Contracting Activity noted that he had  asked for DART\u2019s assistance in augmenting headquarters staff to  close out contracting actions, even though DART is normally reserved  for disaster response support. In addition, FEMA officials stated that  DART has been called upon to provide support in a region that was  without a contracting officer since November of 2014.", "As DART has assumed more responsibilities, FEMA has not established  a process for prioritizing workload during busy disaster seasons. FEMA  officials in charge of DART said that they review requests for DART\u2019s  assistance on an ad hoc basis and follow FEMA\u2019s standard agency policy  about how to redistribute their work if DART members were suddenly  deployed to a disaster. While FEMA policy addresses the process for  transitioning contract files from one contracting officer to another, it does  not address how decisions will be made to prioritize which contracts the  deployed DART member will remain responsible for during their  deployment and which contracts will transition to another contracting  officer. If a disaster were to strike, DART contracting officers said they  would take some of their current workload with them while other tasks  might have to wait until they could return to their normal contracting  duties, or be reassigned to other contracting officers. Federal internal  control standards call for agencies to document responsibilities through  policies and have mechanisms in place to react to risks posed by  changing conditions. Although disaster response often occurs in a  changing environment, FEMA\u2019s 2010 business case for establishing  DART and the policy for transitioning contract files do not provide a  standardized process through which requests for assistance will be  assessed and prioritized, or how individuals\u2019 workloads will be prioritized  during disasters. Without additional guidance that specifies FEMA\u2019s  criteria for prioritizing DART contracts and is tailored for a workforce  expected to frequently deploy in support of disasters, FEMA risks creating  oversight gaps that may affect its largest contracts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agreement Establishing Headquarters and Regional Responsibilities Poses Challenges for FEMA to Cohesively Manage Its Contracting Workforce", "paragraphs": ["In 2011, FEMA created a formal agreement between the regions and  headquarters to establish a new role for FEMA\u2019s OCPO in overseeing  regional contracting staff.

FEMA instituted this agreement in response to a  2009 DHS Inspector General report which recommended, in keeping with  DHS guidance and federal internal control standards, that only  contracting officials should manage the technical performance of  contracting officers. The report stated that having the contracting  officer\u2019s performance and career advancement controlled by someone  who is not a contracting professional was an internal control risk and  created a potential conflict-of-interest situation for the contracting officer.  As a result of this agreement, regional contracting officers have a dual  reporting chain to both OCPO and their supervisor within the region.", "The 2011 agreement outlines responsibilities of the regional contracting  officer\u2019s supervisors in OCPO and in the region.

While the current arrangement is an improvement  over the prior situation, where regional contracting officers had no  reporting chain to the headquarters Chief Procurement Officer, we found  four challenges with the current agreement that limit cohesive  implementation: it creates the potential for competing interests, limits full  visibility into the contracting officers\u2019 workload, does not mitigate the  potential for miscommunication between headquarters and regions, and  does not reflect new training requirements.", "Competing interests. With respect to operational control, we found that  the dual reporting chain to both headquarters and regional mission  support, set forth in the service level agreement, heightens the potential  for an environment of competing interests for the regional contracting  officers. Specifically, in some regions, supervisors have assigned duties  outside of a contracting officer\u2019s responsibilities. In other cases,  contracting officers have experienced pressure from program officials to  make decisions that may not be appropriate. In both situations, being  physically located in a regional office where their regional supervisor is  not a contracting professional gives contracting officers less standing to  resist requests; for example:", "Based on our discussions with regional supervisors and contracting  officers, we found that regional supervisors in three regions had asked  contracting officers to take on additional duties outside of their  contracting responsibilities. In one case, an internal review at FEMA  showed that a regional contracting officer did not deploy to a disaster  because he was carrying out non-contracting tasks as requested by a  regional supervisor not typically responsible for overseeing  contracting officers. As a result of the internal review, FEMA  reassigned the contracting officer to a regional mission support  supervisor to follow the management structure used in other regions.", "Contracting officers in four regions reported resistance from regional  program staff in following contracting processes, such as meeting  competition requirements. One mission support supervisor explained  that when there are questions about contracting processes, she does  not necessarily understand what the contracting officer is required to  do in order to adhere to contracting regulations. In one case  contracting officers reported that program staff wanted them to  eschew contracting requirements and award a noncompetitive  contract. The program officials complained to the regional supervisor,  who in turn pressured the contracting officers to make the award.", "In a July 2010 report, we found that the potential exists for program  offices, which play a significant role in the contracting process, to exert  pressure on contracting officers or that may not result in the best use of  taxpayer dollars. Further, a 2008 Office of Federal Procurement Policy  memorandum states that agencies should consider where an acquisition  function is placed because it may be viewed as an administrative support  rather than as a business partner, so that contracting requirements are  circumvented. Under the current agreement, the risks associated with  the divided structure of FEMA\u2019s regional contracting offices, and actions  that may be taken to mitigate these risks, are not specifically addressed.", "Limited insight into contracting officers\u2019 work. Dividing supervisory  responsibilities between headquarters and regional staff has resulted in  cases where neither had full insight into contracting officers\u2019 work, in both  the operational control and training areas of responsibility. In some cases,  problems were not detected by management and led to gaps in oversight;  for example:", "A regional supervisor reported discovering poor contract  administration after the departure of a contracting officer. The  problems included: awarding a contract to an incorrect vendor,  miscommunicating about the period of performance on a contract, and  neglecting to send a copy of a contract to a vendor.", "Contracting officers in three regions discovered overdue invoices, and  contracting officers in one of the regions said they had to reestablish  creditability with the local vendor community that had been lost due to  unpaid invoices left by previous contracting staff. Contracting officers  said this situation increased some vendors\u2019 unwillingness to work with  FEMA, and cited it as a potential barrier to competition in geographic  areas where there are relatively few vendors available.", "Regional supervisors in one region stated that they were unaware of  the extent of the training requirements for contracting officers until one  of their contracting officers temporarily lost his warrant after not  meeting them. Regional supervisors noted that it was difficult to  operate without one of their contracting officers and ultimately decided  to ask for help from headquarters and said that DART temporarily  supported the region.", "Senior FEMA officials noted that they recently established a quality  review team in headquarters that will provide more oversight to help  ensure contract actions and documentation prepared by regional and  headquarters contracting officers adhere to government-wide and  agency-specific regulations. The quality review team is to examine  contract files for contracts starting at $500,000 and above, while  contracting staff are to conduct peer reviews of contracts below $500,000.", "Challenges with communication and coordination. Overall,  headquarters and regional supervisors said that even with the agreement  in place, communication and coordination are challenging across most of  the areas of divided responsibilities. For example, one regional supervisor  said that it was difficult to address personnel issues without being the  official performance reviewer, as headquarters retains this function under  the agreement. In another region, the regional supervisor said he was not  made aware of an escalating disagreement between a regional  contracting officer and headquarters, until the day before a task order  needed to be awarded. With the current task order set to expire, the  regional supervisor said that the region ultimately ceded to headquarters\u2019  preferences, even though the contracting officer felt pressured to do so.  The regional supervisor noted that the current agreement with OCPO  does not adequately address the roles of headquarters or regional  supervisors, especially when there is a difference of opinion about how to  manage staff, and further, it was difficult to find someone at headquarters  to discuss how to handle the situation. A headquarters supervisor noted  that the dual reporting structure sometimes created confusion about who  was supposed to make specific decisions. For example, regional staff  were not sure who would decide how workload would be covered while  contracting officers were at training. Key practices for successful  collaboration among government agencies include clear roles and  responsibilities, compatible policies and procedures, and articulation of a  common outcome. Additionally, internal control standards require the  easy flow of information throughout the organization, especially between  functional activities such as procurement and production.", "Addressing changes in training requirements. The agreement does  not reflect current training requirements for contracting officers.  Specifically the agreement states that contracting officers could satisfy  their ongoing training requirements through online courses available at  the time the agreement was written and that these online courses would  not require the regions to pay for contracting officers\u2019 travel costs to take  the training. However, in 2014, FEMA issued guidance that required  contracting officers to obtain classroom training to fulfill their requirements  for ongoing training, and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy  increased classroom requirements needed for contracting officers to  advance to the next certification level. Contracting officers in three  regions told us that meeting these requirements would likely require travel  funds due to the scarcity of course availability in some regions. One  regional supervisor noted that these travel funds would be paid out of the  region\u2019s training budget, even if there is no fee for a course. In one  region, a contracting officer reported that she had to cancel her travel  plans the day before her scheduled departure for a course due to lack of  funding. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy had previously  established guidance in 2008 that encourages agencies to provide  contracting staff with resources for continuous learning efforts, as skills  and knowledge gaps can inhibit contracting officers\u2019 ability to properly  oversee the types of contracts used. Without addressing recent changes  to training requirements, there is a risk that contracting officers will not  meet training requirements.", "Although the formal agreement between the regions and OCPO states  that both parties are to revisit it on an annual basis, senior FEMA  headquarters officials stated this has not occurred and that they did not  see a need to revisit it because they had not received feedback that the  regions wanted to do so. As a result, the agreement does not address the  concerns identified above, and has not been updated in the more than 4  years since its creation to reflect good practices or lessons learned."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Contracting Reforms Are Not Fully Implemented and Disaster Contract Management Practices Are Inconsistent", "paragraphs": ["FEMA has taken actions to address most of the four PKEMRA  requirements we examined, but the agency has not fully implemented  them.

However, we found that confusion exists about key  requirements, including the 150-day limit on certain noncompetitive  contracts and transitioning awards to local vendors. This confusion is  furthered by a lack of specific guidance on how to implement these  requirements, including a clear definition of the term local contracting. In  addition, DHS has taken no action on the requirement involving limits on  subcontracting. See table 2 for more information.", "Our review of 27 disaster support contracts and task orders included 13  that were not competitively awarded, which contracting officers explained  as necessary due to unusual and compelling urgency. More than half\u20148  of the 13\u2014exceeded the PKEMRA time limit of 150 days, which was put  in place to reduce the use of noncompetitive contracts. However, we  found that FEMA had not approved any of these to exceed 150 days, as  required. These 8 contracts and task orders exceeded this time limit from  a few months to one and a half years. DHS acquisition regulations require  that this approval be given by FEMA\u2019s senior acquisition official, the Head  of Contracting Activity, who reported that he had rarely been asked to  approve extensions beyond the 150 days during his time in office.", "For the eight contracts and task orders that exceeded the 150-day limit,  contracting officers were either unaware of the time limitation or did not  take steps to get approval from the Head of Contracting Activity as  required. For example, five of the eight were for hotels to house FEMA  employees in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. Contracting  officials explained that these contracts, which totaled almost $6 million in  fiscal year 2013 and 2014 obligations, were urgent because of difficulties  FEMA faced in finding enough hotel rooms at government per diem rates  for deployed FEMA employees. A FEMA report following the hurricane  noted that almost 10,000 employees were deployed to support Hurricane  Sandy. At the same time, more than 11,000 displaced survivors from New  York and New Jersey were housed in hotels and motels in the area.  While this situation was clearly urgent in the immediate aftermath of the  hurricane, we found no documentation in the contract files as to why the  hotel rooms were still needed more than 150 days after the disaster or  why they did not obtain the necessary approval to extend the contracts.  The other three contracts that exceeded the 150-day time limit included:", "A $66 million task order for architect and engineering technical  assistance awarded after Hurricane Sandy, which was extended a  year and a half beyond the 150-day limit. Contracting officials did not  realize that the 150-day PKEMRA limit applied to the order.", "A $200,000 contract for leases of mobile home park spaces to provide  temporary housing for Hurricane Sandy disaster victims, which was  extended more than a year beyond the 150-day limit. Contracting  officials explained that such services are often not competed because  of the limited number of available vendors in disaster areas, but the  contract file did not contain a justification for exceeding the PKEMRA  requirement.", "A $200,000 contract for security services after Hurricane Irene, which  struck the New York area in August 2011. The contract had a  justification but was it not approved by the Head of Contracting  Activity as required. This contract exceeded the 150-day limit by about  a year.", "Contracting officers in two regions and DART contracting officers said  they might not transition a noncompeted contract to a competed award  after 150 days because it may not be a priority, noting that adequate  vendor performance, workload prioritization, and the potential costs to re- compete the contract as factors that may be considered.", "In addition to the case studies we reviewed, FEMA contracting officials in  five regions were confused by the 150-day requirement for noncompeted  disaster support contracts or the appropriate use of the \u201curgent and  compelling\u201d justification for noncompetitive contract awards. For example,  in several instances we were told that the 150-day restriction was not  absolute, or that all contracts are considered urgent in a disaster. While  the FAR provides some flexibility for disaster contracting, officials are to  justify noncompeted contracts and meet the 150-day restriction for  disaster contracts justified based on an urgent need. One official also said  they were not aware of any guidance on the appropriate use of the  urgency justification for disaster contracts. While this information is  included in the DHS\u2019s justification and approval guide and a 2008 FEMA  standard operating procedure for sole source justification and approvals,  FEMA does not address this requirement in training materials or other  guidance to its contracting officers. For example, FEMA\u2019s desk guide and  disaster contracting training course do not mention this disaster-specific  150-day restriction. Senior FEMA contracting officials said the  requirements will be reviewed in future training updates.", "In accordance with PKEMRA, FEMA has submitted quarterly reports to  Congress since December 2007 that list all disaster contracting actions,  including details on contracts awarded by noncompetitive means.  However, in our review of reports to Congress in fiscal years 2013 and  2014, we found that some did not capture all of FEMA\u2019s noncompetitive  task order actions. We found that $32 million in noncompetitive  obligations were not reported in fiscal year 2013. This number included  more than $14 million in obligations to a $66 million technical assistance  award that was not competed because of an urgent need for services  immediately following Hurricane Sandy. A FEMA official explained that  there had been an error in the data compilations prior to mid-2013 that  inadvertently excluded noncompeted task orders issued under  competitively awarded contracts. The official stated that FEMA has since  updated its process to capture these types of awards, including  implementing additional quality control reviews such as comparisons with  federal procurement data sources and adding more people in the review  process. As a result, the FEMA official stated that the quarterly reports  submitted after the third quarter of fiscal year 2013 are accurate. We  confirmed that similar task orders were included in FEMA\u2019s fiscal year  2014 reports, but FEMA officials told us that they have not notified  Congress of the errors in prior reports and do not plan to do so.

PKEMRA also required FEMA to develop a  contracting strategy that maximized the use of advance contracts to the  extent practical and cost-effective. As we found in 2006 following  Hurricane Katrina, agencies need to have competitively awarded  contracts in place before a disaster to be effective. According to FEMA,  establishing contracts for goods and services in advance ensures they  can rapidly mobilize resources in immediate response to disasters and  can reduce the need to buy disaster relief and recovery items through  noncompetitive contracts. In 2008 we found that FEMA provided  Congress with a list of categories of the products and services suitable for  establishing contracts in advance and a plan for maximizing the use of  these contracts, as required by PKEMRA. FEMA officials explained that  indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts facilitate the goal of  having contracts available if there is a disaster. In addition, as part of  their overall acquisition strategy, FEMA officials said that they use other  advance vehicles through which they obtain goods and services,  including interagency agreements and mission assignments, which are  work orders directed to other federal agencies to complete a specified  task.

FEMA headquarters maintains a list of these  contracts through its shared document management system and  identifies additional contracts in training sessions, but we found that  contracting officers in three regions were not aware of such information  and did not know how to access the contracts. These contracting officers  only learned about the list when they were told to use the list for certain  items, such as fuel and translation services. In one case, a regional  contracting officer tried to establish a contract in advance for fuel but was  stopped because he was not aware that these efforts violated policy to  use a headquarters contract for this item. Another contracting officer had  a similar experience when trying to award a contract for translation  services. We found that the information in FEMA\u2019s lists and training  material do not comprehensively identify all of the advance contracts or  vehicles available. For example, officials told us that FEMA has an  interagency agreement with another agency to provide law enforcement  and security forces, which is one of the service categories that FEMA  previously identified as appropriate for advance contracts. However, this  interagency agreement is not identified in FEMA\u2019s lists or training  materials. A senior contracting official explained that these services may  no longer need to be on the advance contract list since FEMA makes an  effort to award security contracts to local law enforcement as part of their  local business efforts. Fire and rescue support services are another  requirement met by mission assignment to another agency that is not  identified in FEMA\u2019s list or training materials.", "PKEMRA also requires that FEMA coordinate advance contracts with  state and local governments and that FEMA encourage state and local  governments to engage in similar pre-planning for contracting. Our review  found that outreach with state and local governments varied greatly,  limiting FEMA\u2019s ability to support advance contracting efforts. Several  regions, including two with a larger number of contracting staff and more  disaster contracting experience, described how they engage in advance  contracting efforts.", "One region\u2019s contracting officers began disaster pre-planning and  conducted outreach to state vendors in an effort to build internal  advance contract capacity. Contracting officers said these efforts have  since expanded to help several states access contracts awarded in  advance, such as General Services Administration schedule  contracts.", "Similarly, contracting officials from another region emphasized that  they take the initiative to engage in strategic planning to identify needs  and conduct regular outreach to local businesses across the region.  They told us these activities facilitate local awards and provide for  multiple sourcing options during a disaster. They said these pre- planning efforts are often efficient enough to have the bulk of a  disaster\u2019s contracting in place soon after the disaster.", "In contrast, contracting staff in the other FEMA regions have more limited  capacity for outreach or do not know that it is expected. One regional  contracting officer said that he does not have any contacts within the  state and has not taken steps to coordinate regional advanced contracts.  Other regional contracting officials said they would like to do more  outreach to states, but find it difficult with their current workloads or  staffing shortages.

While this is  permissible, the contracting officer would not be able to call the  contract local and would have to document the action in the contract  file.", "Several contracting officers said that they would like additional  clarification on local area contracting requirements, specifically what  could be considered local. One said there were so many different  approaches that she was not sure which ones were correct.", "Confusion over the definition of local was evident in the contract files we  reviewed. Our analysis found that FEMA awarded 13 of the 26 contracts  or task orders to vendors located outside the counties declared as  disasters, but in only one of the cases was the award to a non-local  vendor documented or otherwise addressed as required. Among these  were two task orders issued under contracts that had been awarded  before the disaster; these task orders exceeded 180 days but were not  transitioned to local vendors as required by FEMA policy. See figure 9.", "The two awards that did not transition to local vendors after 6 months  were housing inspection and technical assistance task orders, which are  services that account for the majority of FEMA\u2019s disaster contract  obligations. A contracting official explained that they do not have a  process for moving these awards to local vendors after 6 months,  although FEMA\u2019s 2010 guidance specifies that such contracts require  transition. Further, contracting officials had incorrectly identified 4 of the  13 contracts as local in FEMA\u2019s data systems.

Further, FEMA\u2019s Emergency Contracting Desk  Guide misconstrues the local requirement, incorrectly stating that  contracts must be set aside for local vendors unless a written justification  is provided. In contrast, the FAR states that local preference may take the  form of local area set-asides or an evaluation preference.

However, DHS has not issued a final rule. DHS policy officials  said they have delayed implementing this rule because of comments they  received that indicate the limitation would have a negative impact on  small businesses.

FEMA contracting officials must respond quickly to acquire  goods and services to assist survivors, but they must do so while  complying with federal law and FAR requirements. They must also work  within the joint field office structure and deployment processes that may  result in multiple contracting officials supporting individual contracts at  different points in time, particularly in cases where staff is deployed to  support the region. These conditions can present challenges to good  management of disaster support contracts. The issues we saw in the files  reviewed and heard from contracting staff included the following:  Incomplete documentation: In one region, mission support and  contracting staff reported not receiving any files from contracts that  had been awarded at the joint field office; others only learned of  contracts when they received vendor invoices after the joint field office  had closed. In another region, a deployed contracting officer awarded  several contracts for hotels during the immediate response to  Hurricane Sandy but returned to headquarters shortly thereafter  before having an opportunity to bring the contract files up to date.

Prompt contract closeout is critical to ensure that all  government debts are paid and unneeded funds are de-obligated.  FEMA officials told us they are trying to address this issue by setting  the goal for deployed staff to close out 90 percent of files before  returning to their home office.

These included contracts and orders that were (1) not  competed and justified based on an unusual and compelling urgency;  (2) not awarded in advance through indefinite-delivery indefinite- quantity contracts (IDIQs) to understand how decisions regarding  advance and local contracts were made; and (3) from the products  and services FEMA obligated the most money during the time period  to understand how FEMA spends the majority of its contracting dollars  for disaster-support.", "Eleven contracts and orders were selected from the random sample  or to reflect the regional offices we visited, based on factors including  their representation of PKEMRA elements, such as local contracts in  that region, or significant obligations relative to other contracts  awarded by the region.", "We reviewed the contract files for the 27 contracts and task orders to  identify the documents related to the PKEMRA requirements, such as  justifications for noncompetitive contracts exceeding 150 days and  documentation of non-local awards, and compared this information to  requirements stated in PKEMRA, the Federal Acquisition Regulation  (FAR), and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and FEMA  acquisition guidance. Although the information collected from our review  of contracts is not generalizable to all relevant contracts, it was valuable  in supplementing interviews with FEMA contracting officials in the  contracting offices most likely to support disaster contracts and from  FEMA\u2019s 10 regions.", "To understand steps taken to implement PKEMRA contracting  requirements, we spoke to DHS officials from the Office of the Chief  Procurement Officer (OCPO) and FEMA policy officials. We also  reviewed FEMA\u2019s quarterly reports to Congress on contracting activities,  including noncompetitive awards, and spoke to officials responsible for  these reports, to determine if they accurately reported information  identified in the 27 contracts and orders we reviewed. We compared  FEMA\u2019s 2007 report on the categories of products and services most  appropriate for advance contracting and compared the categories to  FEMA\u2019s current lists of available advance contracts to determine the  extent to which FEMA has established contracts for products and  services identified in 2007 and how that information is made available in  FEMA\u2019s training and guidance. We also met with contracting officers in  FEMA\u2019s 10 regional offices and from the headquarters offices most likely  to award contracts supporting disaster relief efforts to discuss their  understanding of PKEMRA\u2019s requirements. In addition, we met with  officials responsible for FEMA\u2019s Local Business Transition Team to  discuss their role in supporting local vendors. We reviewed  documentation related to good management practices, including the FAR  and DHS guidance on required contracting reviews. Additionally, we met  with contracting officials responsible for most of the contracts and orders  we examined to clarify questions we had regarding the contract files.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2014 to September  2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Molly Traci, Assistant Director;  Jennifer Dougherty; Brett Caloia; LeAnna Parkey; Manuel A.
