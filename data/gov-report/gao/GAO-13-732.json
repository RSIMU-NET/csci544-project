S&T, the Coast Guard, and DNDO conduct these R&D activities and S&T has responsibility for coordinating and integrating R&D activities across DHS. The Centers of Excellence are a network of university R&D centers that provide DHS with tools, expertise, and access to research facilities and laboratories, among other things. GAO was asked to review DHS's border and maritime R&D efforts.", "This report addresses (1) the results of DHS border and maritime security R&D efforts and the extent to which DHS has obtained and evaluated feedback on these efforts, and (2) the extent that DHS coordinates its border and maritime R&D efforts internally and externally with other federal agencies and the private sector. GAO reviewed completed and ongoing R&D project information and documentation from fiscal years 2010 through 2013 and interviewed DHS component officials, among other actions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Between fiscal years 2010 and 2012, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) border and maritime research and development (R&D) components reported producing 97 R&D deliverables at an estimated cost of $177 million. The type of border and maritime R&D deliverables produced by DHS's Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate, the Coast Guard, and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) varied, and R&D customers we met with reported mixed views on the impact of the R&D deliverables they received. These deliverables were wide-ranging in their cost and scale, and included knowledge products and reports, technology prototypes, and software. The Coast Guard and DNDO reported having processes in place to collect and evaluate feedback from its customers regarding the results of R&D deliverables. However, S&T has not established timeframes and milestones for collecting and evaluating feedback from its customers on the extent to which the deliverables it provides to DHS components--such as US Customs and Border Protection (CBP)--are meeting its customer's needs. Doing so could help S&T better determine the usefulness and impact of its R&D projects and deliverables and make better-informed decisions regarding future work.", "DHS has taken actions and is working to develop departmental policies to better define and coordinate R&D, but additional actions could strengthen internal and external coordination of border and maritime R&D. S&T's Borders and Maritime Security Division, the Coast Guard, and DNDO reported taking a range of actions to coordinate with their internal DHS customers to ensure, among other things, that R&D is addressing high priority needs. However, work remains to be done at the agency level to ensure border and maritime R&D efforts are mutually reinforcing and are being directed towards the highest priority needs. For example, officials from university centers of excellence reported difficulties in determining DHS headquarters contacts, and officials from the primary land-border security R&D center reported delayed and cancelled projects due to the inability to obtain data. DHS could help ensure that the approximately $3 million to $4 million a year dedicated to the university Centers of Excellence is used more effectively by more carefully considering potential challenges with regard to data needs, access issues and data limitations before approving projects."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS S&T establish timeframes and milestones for collecting and evaluating feedback from its customers to determine the usefulness and impact of its R&D efforts, and ensure that potential challenges with regard to data reliability, accessibility, and availability are reviewed and understood before approving Centers of Excellence R&D projects. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Conducting border and maritime research and development (R&D) to  deliver technologies for detecting, preventing, and mitigating terrorist  threats is vital to enhancing the security of the nation. The Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) conducts research, development, testing, and  evaluation of new technologies that are intended to achieve a range of  homeland security goals, including detecting and preventing the  unauthorized entry of persons or contraband into the United States;  preventing and responding to nuclear, biological, explosive, and other  types of attacks; and securing U.S. ports and inland waterways. DHS\u2019s  Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate, the U.S. Coast Guard, and  the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) conduct these R&D  activities, although S&T has overall responsibility for coordinating and  integrating R&D activities across DHS. S&T funding for R&D grew  steadily until 2010 and has served a wide variety of research areas. S&T  also carries out R&D through its Office of University Programs, which  manages and coordinates 12 University Centers of Excellence. The  Centers of Excellence are a network of university R&D centers that  provide DHS with tools, technologies, subject matter expertise, and  access to laboratories and research facilities, among other things.  Recently, Congress and others have raised questions about S&T\u2019s ability  to demonstrate the impact of its investments\u2014in terms of value, tangible  products, and advances to the homeland security mission\u2014as well as  questions about the extent to which S&T is leveraging R&D already under  way in the private sector and at other governmental agencies, including  the Department of Defense. Accordingly, Congress has directed S&T to  demonstrate how its R&D efforts are timely, with results well defined, and  based on clear and sensible priorities.", "In September 2012, we reported that DHS did not have a department- wide policy defining R&D or guidance directing its components how to  report R&D activities. As a result, DHS did not know its total annual  investment in R&D, which limited the department\u2019s ability to oversee  components\u2019 R&D efforts and align them with agency-wide R&D goals  and priorities. We also reported that DHS\u2019s R&D efforts were fragmented  and overlapping, which increased the risk of unnecessary duplication.  Specifically, DHS had not developed a policy defining who was  responsible for coordinating R&D and what processes should be used to  coordinate it, and did not have mechanisms to track all R&D activities at  DHS that could help prevent overlap, fragmentation, or unnecessary  duplication. We recommended that DHS develop policies and guidance  for defining, reporting and coordinating R&D activities across the  department, and that DHS establish a mechanism to track R&D projects.  DHS agreed with these recommendations and planned to make decisions  about how to address these actions by May 2013. As of August 2013,  DHS had not made a decision about how it specifically plans to address  these recommendations.", "In addition to our work on R&D across DHS, we have also reported  extensively on the challenges that DHS has faced in deploying  technologies and infrastructure to secure U.S. land borders and the  maritime sector. These continued challenges highlight the importance of  effectively conducting, testing, and evaluating R&D technologies before  they are transitioned to the customers who will operationally deploy them.  For example, in November 2011, we reported on the U.S. Customs and  Border Protection\u2019s (CBP) technology deployment plan for the Arizona  border\u2014the Arizona Border Surveillance Technology Plan\u2014which was  expected to cost approximately $1.5 billion over 10 years. Specifically,  we reported that CBP did not have the information needed to fully support  and implement the technology deployment plan in accordance with DHS  and Office of Management and Budget guidance. Further, in September  2010, we reported on the challenges DHS faced in its efforts to test,  evaluate, and operationalize maritime container security technologies.  We have also reported on DHS\u2019s efforts and challenges in developing  technologies\u2014such as sensors and transponders\u2014capable of detecting  and tracking small vessels in ports, technologies for detecting and  reporting intrusions into and the tracking of cargo containers as they pass  through the global supply chain, and the scanning of cargo through  advanced automated radiography systems.", "As the result of past technology challenges and questions about the  extent to which border and maritime R&D investments are being  overseen and coordinated effectively across DHS, you requested that we  review DHS\u2019s border and maritime R&D efforts. Accordingly, this report  addresses the following two questions:  1.  What have been the results of DHS\u2019s border and maritime security  R&D and to what extent has DHS obtained and evaluated feedback  on these efforts?  2.  To what extent does DHS coordinate its border and maritime R&D  efforts internally (with other DHS components and end users) and  externally with other federal agencies and the private sector?", "To answer the first objective, we focused our review on the components  and offices receiving direct R&D appropriations related to border and  maritime security\u2014specifically, DHS S&T, the Coast Guard, and DNDO.  To determine the results of DHS\u2019s recent R&D efforts, we asked officials  from each R&D office to identify the deliverables their offices produced  from fiscal years 2010 through 2012, including the cost of each  deliverable. We corroborated the DHS-identified lists of deliverables and  their costs with varied documentary evidence, including congressional  budget justifications, DHS materials prepared for independently produced  R&D reviews, and other published material. We determined that the  information on deliverables and costs was sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of providing an overview of Border and Maritime R&D;  limitations to the data are noted in the report. For each component, we  selected deliverables to reflect a range of product types and recipients  and then asked DHS to identify the customers that received those  deliverables. For the purposes of this report, we relied on DHS to identify  who its customers were\u2014in other words, those agencies that worked  closest to S&T over the course of a project. We also refer to the reports,  prototypes, software, or other project outputs as R&D deliverables. We  selected these definitions because they are in keeping with those used by  S&T. Given that S&T, the Coast Guard, and DNDO have different roles  with respect to conducting and managing R&D, we selected different  numbers of deliverables to review within each component. Specifically,  given S&T\u2019s role as the lead R&D agency for DHS and its wider variety of  customers, we interviewed every customer of S&T Border and Maritime  Security Division\u2019s identified deliverables (20 of 20 deliverables). We met  with 35 percent of the customers of the Coast Guard\u2019s completed  deliverables (8 of 23 deliverables) and 12 percent of the customers of  DNDO\u2019s deliverables (5 of 42 deliverables, which included one  discontinued project). We met with fewer DNDO customers because the  majority of DNDO\u2019s R&D projects are merged into new or continuing  DNDO R&D efforts. Further, these efforts do not transition to customers  outside of DNDO. In other words, DNDO\u2019s R&D customers were other  DNDO R&D offices, and accordingly, we selected a smaller number of  these DNDO project managers for follow-up. To corroborate customer  views on the effectiveness, timeliness, and other aspects of the  deliverables, we interviewed multiple customers per deliverable where  possible and also validated customer views with the relevant DHS project  managers where possible. Further, we evaluated DHS\u2019s efforts to assess  the impact of its R&D against selected best practices from the National  Academy of Sciences for evaluating the relevance and impact of R&D  and best practices for project management.", "To evaluate DHS\u2019s ongoing R&D efforts, we met with S&T Borders and  Maritime Security officials and Coast Guard, DNDO, and S&T Office of  University Programs officials. We corroborated information received on  DHS R&D efforts through interviews with CBP (including the Office of  Technology Innovation and Acquisition, Office of Border Patrol, Office of  Air and Marine, Office of Information and Technology, and Office of Field  Operations) and interviews with officials from three DHS University  Centers of Excellence. Further, we conducted site visits to the Coast  Guard\u2019s Research and Development Center in New London, Connecticut;  CBP\u2019s Office of Border Patrol\u2019s Tucson Sector, Arizona; and one of  DNDO\u2019s research contractors in North Billerica, Massachusetts, to  observe and discuss DHS R&D projects and R&D results. The results of  the site visits are not generalizable to all R&D projects, but provided  important observations and insights into border and maritime R&D efforts  across three different components. To address the second objective, we  used the information we gathered above and insights from our interviews  with DHS components, R&D project managers, and R&D customers to  identify how DHS coordinates its R&D efforts internally, externally, on a  per-project basis, and with the private sector. We compared these efforts  with DHS\u2019s strategic plans, project management plans, and other  published guidance related to coordination, as well as with best practices  for coordination among federal agencies and best practices for effective  evaluation design. To evaluate DHS\u2019s efforts to conduct and coordinate  R&D with its university research partners, we interviewed five universities  representing three DHS Centers of Excellence that conduct border and  maritime R&D\u2014including a site visit to the University of Arizona, Tucson.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2012 through  September 2013 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DHS Border and Maritime R&D Roles, Responsibilities, and Processes", "paragraphs": ["Within DHS, three components have responsibilities for conducting  border and maritime R&D\u2014S&T, the Coast Guard, and DNDO. S&T has  five technical divisions responsible for managing the directorate\u2019s R&D  portfolio and coordinating with other DHS components to identify R&D  priorities and needs. The Borders and Maritime Security Division (BMD)  is responsible for most of S&T\u2019s border and maritime related R&D, and its  primary DHS customer is CBP. Most of S&T\u2019s R&D portfolio consists of  applied and developmental R&D, which is R&D that can be transitioned to  use within 3 years, as opposed to longer-term basic research. In  addition to conducting projects for its DHS customers, S&T conducts  projects for other federal agencies and first responders.", "The S&T Office of University Programs also manages the DHS Centers of  Excellence, which constitute a network of universities that conduct  research for DHS component agencies on topics ranging from animal  disease defense to catastrophic event preparedness. Of the nine funded  centers, two are dedicated to border and maritime R&D\u2014The National  Center for Border Security and Immigration (NCBSI), led by the University  of Arizona in Tucson and the University of Texas at El Paso, and the  Center for Maritime, Island and Remote and Extreme Environment   Security (MIREES), led by the University of Hawaii and Stevens Institute  of Technology. Centers are typically funded through cooperative  agreements for 5-to-6 year periods, with a review period each year.  Ideas for projects to be undertaken by the centers are solicited at  technical workshops with component-level subject matter experts, where  the centers and DHS officials discuss technical or informational  challenges. The Office of University Programs drafts these topics into  research questions which the Office publishes in a funding opportunity  announcement. The Office of University Programs then examines  proposals it receives based on how the research could potentially further  DHS\u2019s mission. Centers also hold annual meetings where officials are  expected to brief DHS leadership on their work and their plans.  Additionally, DHS stakeholders will give presentations on their technology  needs and challenges. The centers are then expected to incorporate  these needs and challenges into their programs.  The Coast Guard is a multimission, maritime military service within  DHS. The Coast Guard\u2019s R&D efforts are conducted and managed by  its Research, Development, Test, & Evaluation (RDT&E) Program, which  consists of the Office of RDT&E and the Research and Development  Center. The center performs research, development, testing, and  evaluation in support of all Coast Guard missions, as required. The  majority of the Coast Guard\u2019s R&D products are knowledge products,  such as acquisition analysis studies or technical reports, as opposed to   specific pieces of technology or prototypes. Its end users are typically  other units within the Coast Guard, such as its Office of Boat Forces or  Deployable Specialized Forces.", "DNDO also conducts R&D applicable to border and maritime security, as  it relates to its mission of detecting the use of an unauthorized nuclear  explosive device, fissile material, or radiological material in the United  States. After its establishment, in 2005, DNDO assumed responsibility  from S&T for certain nuclear and radiological R&D activities, and its R&D  efforts are primarily conducted and managed by its Transformational and  Applied Research Directorate (TARD). DNDO\u2019s R&D efforts result in  technology prototypes, development of software, and computer modeling  for the detection of radioactive and nuclear materials. These efforts are  crosscutting, meaning they can be used in more than just a border and  maritime environment.", "Each of DHS\u2019s border and maritime R&D organizations uses a different  process to determine which R&D projects to pursue. S&T BMD reaches  out to DHS-level officials as well as with operational-level end users, such  as Border Patrol agents, to discuss needs, resources, and priorities and  to determine which projects to initiate and also which projects should be  continued or discontinued. BMD officials said that depending upon whom  they speak with\u2014that is, headquarters-level officials versus field-level  operators\u2014they often receive different answers regarding needs and  priorities. Further, it is the role of the S&T project manager to facilitate  agreement and consensus among the different offices within the  component. The Coast Guard seeks input from its internal offices and its  long-term strategies to identify capability gaps or ideas for new  technological solutions, which are then evaluated based on available  funding and other priorities into a prioritized ranking of projects that can  be typically executed within 2 fiscal years. Some projects require more  than 2 years. DNDO officials stated that their process for selecting and  prioritizing projects is based on a review of capability gaps and  government priorities in accordance with the Global Nuclear Detection  Architecture as well as the Nuclear Defense R&D Road Map fiscal years  2013 to 2017. DNDO officials also stated that they consider what  technologies exist before considering advanced technology development  and their goal is to complete an R&D project with a proof-of-concept study  or a prototype."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS\u2019s Border and Maritime R&D Budget and Projects", "paragraphs": ["The S&T Directorate, DNDO, and the Coast Guard are each appropriated  funding for R&D. Table 1 provides DHS\u2019s R&D budgets from fiscal years  2010 through 2013 for the various entities that conduct border and  maritime R&D. A portion of each component\u2019s budget is dedicated to  border and maritime R&D. However, as we reported in September 2012,  DHS did not know how much its components invest in R&D, making it  difficult to oversee R&D efforts across the department. For example, we  reported that data DHS submitted to OMB showed that DHS\u2019s R&D  budget authority and outlays were underreported because DNDO did not  properly report its R&D budget authority and outlays to OMB for fiscal  years 2010 through 2013. Specifically, for fiscal years 2010 through 2013,  DHS underreported its total R&D budget authority by at least $293 million  and outlays for R&D by at least $282 million because DNDO did not  accurately report the data. We also identified an additional $255 million  in R&D obligations for fiscal year 2011 by other DHS components.  Further, we found that DNDO did not report certain R&D budget data to  OMB, and R&D budget accounts include a mix of R&D and non-R&D  spending, further complicating DHS\u2019s ability to identify its total investment  in R&D.", "As of June 2013, DHS had 95 ongoing R&D projects related to border  and maritime security. See table 2 below for the number and total  anticipated cost of ongoing border and maritime R&D projects by  performing office.", "It is important to note the total amount of resources and spending  dedicated to R&D projects, and the final result and impact of these  projects can vary dramatically based on the scope and purpose of the  project. Some R&D projects aim to produce a specific prototype or piece  of technology for an end user, such as sensors that CBP can use to  better detect tunnels, nonlethal weapons Coast Guard can use to disable  a boat\u2019s outboard engines, or a range of contraband marker systems.", "Other projects may produce software to integrate information technology  systems, such as software to integrate and display information gathered  by multiple sensor systems. Finally, other projects may produce a report  or knowledge product, which aims to inform an acquisition decision, such  as providing the preliminary research required for developing a statement  of work\u2014a key step in the acquisition process.

An R&D deliverable can yield a variety of results. For example,  an R&D deliverable, such as a report or a prototype, can be provided to a  customer and then transitioned into an acquisition program or further  developed by that customer; delivered, but not used for various reasons,  or discontinued prior to delivery.", "Twenty-nine projects were discontinued prior to their delivery to a  customer. There were a variety of reasons that projects were  discontinued, and it is important to note that the discontinuation of a  project or deliverable did not necessarily mean that it was a failed R&D  project. In some cases, the R&D results demonstrated that there was no  technologically feasible option to address a problem or that a certain type  of technology would not provide the desired solution. For example, DHS\u2019s  Office of University program officials stated that they expect to routinely  discontinue projects that are not demonstrably innovative, progressing, or  have no identifiable end user, and reallocate resources to new innovative  projects or to projects with specified customer interest. Further, according  to the officials, project discontinuation is a good outcome in many  circumstances where research success cannot be foretold. These officials  added that it is a necessary part of a portfolio-based research strategy.  Office of University program R&D and discontinued research projects are  discussed in more detail later in this report.", "Projects are also discontinued or merged into other projects because of a  lack of available data, budget cuts, or DHS management determining that  a project was no longer a priority to its potential customers. For example,  S&T BMD officials stated insufficient funding resulted in the  discontinuation of 2 projects, and for 2 other projects, the customer\u2019s  priorities shifted and the R&D was terminated. In addition, DNDO stated  that it determined that some methods for detection of shielded nuclear  material were feasible but too costly and that certain detection devices  would be too large for practical use in the field, so the R&D was  discontinued. Table 3 provides the costs of R&D projects with  deliverables, including discontinued projects, for fiscal years 2010 through  2012. See appendix I for a list of all the R&D projects and their  deliverables for fiscal years 2010 through 2012 by component or office,  project type, and their associated costs.", "DHS R&D deliverables were wide-ranging in their cost, scope, and scale.  For example, agencies reported producing deliverables ranging from the  development of imaging and radar prototypes to container screening  devices and written market analyses of commercially available  technologies. These 97 deliverables fell into three general categories: (1)  knowledge products or reports; (2) technology prototypes; and (3)  software, as listed in table 4.", "Knowledge products or reports: Thirty-eight of the 97 deliverables (39  percent) resulted in knowledge products that contained analysis and  comparison testing of technologies, summarized field testing of  technologies, or developed reference materials for use by DHS  components. For example, one of the DHS Centers of Excellence  developed formulas and models to assist in randomizing Coast Guard  patrol routes and connecting networks together to assist in the detection  of small vessels. Additionally, the Coast Guard conducted a technology  evaluation to help its acquisition office determine the best tactical radios  for use by law enforcement boarding teams.", "Technology prototypes: Twenty-eight of the 97 deliverables (29 percent)  resulted in technology prototypes, such as the development of new  sensors, imaging equipment, or devices for detecting nuclear material.  For example, S&T BMD developed prototype radar and upgraded video  systems for use by Border Patrol agents and a prototype scanner to  screen interior areas of small aircraft without removing panels or the  aircraft skin. See figure 1 for an example of a prototype product  developed by BMD for CBP.", "Software: Thirty-one of the 97 deliverables (32 percent) resulted in the  development of software, such as algorithms used in detection systems.  For example, BMD developed software that enables intelligence  personnel to quickly survey large areas of ocean and find vessels of  interest. Additionally, DNDO developed software that extracts data from  radiation portal monitors and uses the data to improve algorithms used in  detecting radioactive material."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Customers Reported Mixed Views on the Impact of DHS\u2019s Border and Maritime R&D Project Deliverables", "paragraphs": ["S&T BMD, the Coast Guard, and DNDO\u2019s R&D customers had mixed  views regarding the impact of the R&D products or deliverables they  received. Of the 126 R&D deliverables or projects DHS completed or  discontinued from fiscal years 2010 through 2012, we interviewed DHS- identified customers or other relevant officials for 33 of these (19  customers and 6 program managers of 20 S&T BMD deliverables, 8  Coast Guard customers or other relevant officials of 8 deliverables or  completed projects, and 2 DNDO project managers of 5 projects. Given  our scope, we discussed ongoing and completed projects managed by  S&T\u2019s Office of University Programs with Coast Guard and CBP, but did  not systematically follow up with the recipients of each deliverable  produced by the border and maritime related Centers of Excellence.", "Of the 20 S&T BMD deliverables, the customers of 7 deliverables stated  that the deliverables met their office\u2019s needs, customers of 7 did not, and  customers of 4 did not know, and customers for 2 could not be identified,  as detailed below in table 5. For example, customers within CBP\u2019s Office  of Technology Innovation and Acquisition reported that BMD\u2019s analysis  and test results on aircraft-based use of wide area surveillance  technology helped CBP to make a decision on whether it should pursue  acquiring such technology. Another customer (DHS personnel assigned  to the Joint Interagency Task Force South United States Southern  Command) reported that software developed by BMD to enable analysts  to quickly find and characterize small maritime vessels in an image  showing large areas of ocean was highly valuable and met their office\u2019s  needs.", "Conversely, of 20 deliverables, customers of 7 deliverables reported that  the deliverable did not meet their office\u2019s needs. In cases where  customers said that the deliverables were not meeting their needs, the  customers explained that budget changes, other ongoing testing efforts,  or changes in mission priorities were the reasons deliverables had not  met their needs, and customers pointed out that their relationship with  S&T had been positive and highly collaborative. In other cases,  customers pointed out that while the deliverable had not been used as  intended, it informed their office\u2019s decision making and helped to rule out  certain technologies as possibilities. In this regard, the customers felt the  R&D was successful, despite the fact that the deliverable had not or was  not being used. Further, customers of 4 deliverables did not know or  could not determine if the deliverable met their office\u2019s needs, and  customers for 2 deliverables could not be identified by S&T, CBP, or the  Coast Guard. BMD officials described, for example, why some of these  older projects did not have identifiable customers and also described  actions it had taken to help ensure that new projects have clear,  committed customers. Under S&T\u2019s former process for initiating  projects\u2014which was carried out under S&T\u2019s former Undersecretary and  dissolved by its current Undersecretary\u2014BMD officials said that the  potential existed to engage in R&D without a clear commitment from a  customer. In February 2012, S&T issued a new project management  guide that requires project managers to specify the customer by office  and name, and to describe customer support for the project, including  how the customer has demonstrated commitment for and support of the  project. BMD officials said they believed this new process would prevent  future R&D funding from going towards projects without a clear customer.", "The Coast Guard reported producing 23 deliverables from fiscal year  2010 through fiscal year 2012, and we met with officials involved with 8 of  those projects, as listed in table 6. For 4 of 8 deliverables, Coast Guard  officials reported that the deliverables had met internal Coast Guard  needs. For example, one customer reported using a Coast Guard report  on secure tactical radio communications systems to jump-start market  research and to help develop a statement of work in developing the  acquisition documents for the new radios. The customer said that the  Coast Guard report did a good job of defining requirements and  summarizing the needs of the operational end users\u2014in this case, Coast  Guard boarding teams. Ultimately, the customer said 762 radios were  acquired and end users reported the radios were a vast improvement  over what they had possessed in the past. For 3 of 8 deliverables, the  impact was unknown because the research was ongoing. Finally, for 1 of  8 deliverables, the customer was unknown or could not be determined.  For example, for the Low-Cost Swimmer Detection System, DHS S&T  was identified as the customer, but an S&T official we spoke with said  that S&T was the project manager and the Coast Guard was actually the  customer. Ultimately, the project did not continue due to changes in Coast  Guard budget priorities.", "Regarding the 15 Coast Guard deliverables we did not discuss with  customers, many of these were identified by the Coast Guard as  deliverables but were different in nature from the deliverables discussed  with S&T\u2019s customers. Further, the nature of the customers was different,  too, since in some cases the customer was the Coast Guard\u2019s own R&D  Center in order to support maintaining the R&D Center\u2019s capabilities for  conducting technological and analytical support. For instance, while many  of S&T\u2019s deliverables were prototypes or demonstrations for customers  outside of S&T, the Coast Guard\u2019s deliverables were used within the  Coast Guard and included such things as the independent validation and  verification of the Coast Guard\u2019s maritime security risk analysis model,  analysis support, and the Deepwater Horizon spill response.", "DNDO reported producing 42 deliverables\u2014which encompassed 6  discontinued projects and 36 projects that were either transitioned to the  next phase of DNDO R&D or were completed and ended from fiscal years  2010 through 2012. We met with officials involved with 5 of those  projects, as listed in table 7. According to DNDO Transformational and  Applied Research Directorate (TARD) officials, they consider a project  completed when it results in either a prototype or a knowledge product for  integration into an acquisition program. Specifically, 17 of 36 projects  were part of another ongoing DNDO project or Small Business Innovative  Research project and 19 of 31 projects were commercialized or  concluded. DNDO R&D is different from the R&D of S&T or the Coast  Guard for many reasons. For one, a DNDO project may start at a very low  technology readiness level, in other words at the basic research level, but  may end up being merged into other similar efforts in order to achieve a  higher project goal. In these cases, the R&D customers are DNDO project  managers, rather than an external DHS customer, such as CBP. We  discussed 5 DNDO R&D deliverables at various R&D phases with DNDO  officials\u20144 of which were deliverables from ongoing or completed  projects and 1 of which was a discontinued project, as shown below in  table 7.", "Given the different nature of DNDO\u2019s R&D efforts, we discussed the  outcomes of DNDO\u2019s completed deliverables with their project managers  and senior DNDO officials. DNDO TARD officials stated that their primary  customers are themselves and DNDO\u2019s Acquisitions Directorate. We also  met with officials from the DNDO directorates responsible for taking early- stage R&D work and moving it toward later-stage development and  acquisitions. These officials said that the early stage R&D at DNDO feeds  into the prioritized ranking of gaps in the global nuclear detection  architecture, as well as into the analysis-of-alternatives phase of  DNDO\u2019s solutions development process. Two of the 5 projects we  discussed had moved from early-stage R&D into other projects further  along in DNDO\u2019s project management process. Two of the 5 projects  were completed, with 1 project providing information that informed DNDO  decision-making processes, and the other project resulting in a  commercialized product. Last, with regard to the 1 discontinued project,  DNDO officials said there were many lessons learned, but that the  particular project\u2019s technology was determined to be too expensive to  continue pursuing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Feedback Processes and Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["Both the Coast Guard and DNDO reported having processes in place for  gathering the views of customers regarding the results of R&D  deliverables. For example, the Coast Guard RDT&E Program has a  process in place for surveying its customers following the completion of a  project and reported using this information for future R&D planning. The  Coast Guard\u2019s survey instrument seeks feedback on the following items:  customer satisfaction, timeliness, utility, and communications, among  other things. The feedback step is part of the Coast Guard\u2019s Continuous  Project Process. We reviewed 5 completed surveys from Coast Guard  customers. The feedback included specific suggestions for improvements  in the R&D process and positive comments regarding meeting customer  needs and communication.", "DNDO officials identified several ways in which they seek feedback from  customers on the usefulness of their deliverables. For instance, in its  solutions development process guide, DNDO provides direction to project  managers on engaging in initial, small-quantity production of a system so  that the customer can thoroughly test the system in order to gain a  reasonable degree of confidence as to whether the system actually  performs to the agreed upon requirements before contracts for mass  production are signed. For example, during the development of the  Multimodal Automated Resolution, Location, and Identification of Nuclear  Material project, DNDO managers reported gaining feedback from CBP  officials through their participation in the R&D, since it is CBP who will be  the eventual end user of the technology. DNDO also details in its  solutions development process guide how it works with customers to test  fielded technology solutions, including documenting lessons learned and  obtaining feedback as part of its R&D continuous development process.  DNDO\u2019s internal R&D customers (other directorates) stated that they  provided feedback on DNDO\u2019s R&D efforts through other mechanisms  such as letters prioritizing technology needs and gaps. Coast Guard and  DNDO officials also stated that it is not difficult to obtain feedback from  their R&D customers, since their customers are generally within their own  organizations.", "Though S&T Borders and Maritime Security project managers seek  feedback during their project execution, BMD does not gather and  evaluate feedback from its customers to determine the impact of its  completed R&D efforts and deliverables, making it difficult to determine if  the R&D is meeting customer needs. Further, in some cases, the  customer of S&T\u2019s R&D was not clear. For example, on BMD\u2019s Wide Area  Motion Imagery project, BMD officials said that CBP was the customer of  this deliverable, but CBP officials we spoke with did not know who was  using the results of the R&D. However, on a project level, BMD officials  stated that their office prepared reports related to this project and was told  that the reports were helpful in CBP\u2019s broader consideration of options for  new airborne sensor systems. In another S&T project, a Coast Guard  customer identified by BMD was involved in testing the technology (the  Tethered Aerostat Radio Processor) for BMD, but was not involved in the  request for the R&D or in a position to make a determination on the extent  to which the project met the Coast Guard\u2019s needs. Similarly, a CBP  customer identified by BMD was aware of two R&D deliverables that BMD  said were transitioned to his office, but the official was unable to provide  additional information on the project\u2019s impact. As we mentioned above,  S&T recently made policy changes that require project managers to  specify a project\u2019s customer by office and name and to describe customer  support for the project at a project\u2019s outset. This change should help  assist S&T in seeking feedback from its customers upon completion of a  project.", "For five projects, S&T BMD project managers and customers we met with  could not provide definitive information on whether the deliverables had  achieved their intended goals. For example, S&T and CBP officials  agreed that R&D efforts on the Aviation Scanner project\u2014a prototype  scanner to screen interior areas of small aircraft without removing panels  of the aircraft skin; however, the impact on CBP\u2019s mission needs or its  future acquisitions is unknown pending future demonstration and testing  in 2013. The National Academy of Sciences have stated that evaluating  the relevance and impact of R&D is a key stage of the R&D process and  that measuring the impact of R&D activities requires looking to the end  users and stakeholders for an evaluation of the impact of a research  program, such as through polling or systematic outreach.", "According to S&T BMD officials, since they deal with multiple DHS  components and are not within the same agencies as its customers, it is  sometimes difficult to identify who the customer of the R&D is and also  difficult to determine what the impact of the R&D was. S&T officials also  stated that in S&T\u2019s 2012 update to its project management guide, in its  project closeout process, S&T has included a step to collect feedback  from all relevant customers and a template for collecting this feedback.  However, the S&T officials stated that this has not yet been carried out  and that much work remains to be done to ensure this outreach and  feedback is collected. BMD officials agreed that a more rigorous feedback  process would provide S&T leadership a better understanding of how  S&T is serving its customers and public.", "While S&T has developed a process and template to collect feedback at  the end of each project and incorporated this into its project management  plan, it does not plan to survey customers each time it provides a  deliverable to the customer. As previously noted, S&T projects are often  conducted over several years before they are concluded or in some  cases merged into other projects. These projects also often produce  multiple deliverables for a customer that meet a specific operational need.  For example, the Ground Based Technologies project began in fiscal year  2006 and is slated to continue through fiscal year 2018. During this  period, S&T has provided multiple R&D deliverables to CBP\u2014including  test results comparing different ground based radar systems, as  previously mentioned. The National Academy of Sciences has stated that  feedback from both R&D failures and successes may be communicated  to stakeholders and used to modify future investments. Moreover, S&T  has not established timeframes and milestones for when it will begin  collecting and evaluating feedback on these projects nor stated if and  when it plans to begin gathering feedback on deliverables, and  incorporate it into its broader processes for setting R&D priorities and  portfolios. According to A Guide to the Project Management Body of  Knowledge, which provides standards for project managers, specific  goals and objectives should be conceptualized, defined, and documented  in the planning process, along with the appropriate steps, time frames,  and milestones needed to achieve those results. Establishing time  frames and milestones for collecting and evaluating feedback from its  customers could help S&T better determine the usefulness and impact of  its R&D projects and deliverables and make better-informed decisions  regarding future work."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Taken Steps to Coordinate Border and Maritime R&D, but Opportunities Exist to Further Strengthen Internal and External Coordination", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DHS Uses Various Approaches to Internally Coordinate R&D; Broader Efforts to Develop Departmental Policies for Overseeing and Coordinating R&D Are Ongoing", "paragraphs": ["S&T\u2019s BMD, the Coast Guard, and DNDO reported taking a range of  actions to coordinate with one another and their customers to ensure that  R&D is addressing high priority needs.

The annual project cycle involves  the selection and ranking of its R&D portfolio extending out 2 fiscal  years. To develop this portfolio, the Coast Guard has both an annual  idea submission process and annual workshops, where officials  develop the R&D Center project portfolio. Ideas for new projects can  come from any rank or office, and R&D Center officials said that they  will consider all the ideas they receive.", "Technology transition agreements: The Coast Guard RDT&E  Program also uses internal technology transition agreements to  ensure that internal Coast Guard customers and stakeholders are  prepared to move forward with an R&D prototype product when  delivered. These technology transition agreements are non-binding  agreements, internal to the Coast Guard, for ensuring the coordination  and transition of R&D products.", "Technology summits: In an effort to enhance awareness of R&D  efforts across DHS, in February 2012, the Coast Guard hosted a joint  science and technology summit wherein the Coast Guard, BMD, and  S&T Office of University Programs officials gave overview briefs of  their respective work. The summit discussion included such topics as  the value of routine meetings between the Coast Guard\u2019s R&D  program and various S&T divisions, as well as the successes that  S&T has had working with CBP and the potential for the Coast Guard  to determine if it can identify and replicate successful ways to  increase its interactions with S&T.", "DNDO also has several mechanisms for coordinating its R&D efforts that  vary depending upon the maturity of the technology. For technologies that  are close to deployable, DNDO\u2019s Architecture and Plans Directorate,  which does not conduct R&D, engages directly with CBP and other  potential customers to identify what technology enhancements the  components need and then formulates plans and recommendations for  solutions. For example, DNDO officials testified in 2010 that DNDO had  outfitted the Coast Guard with over 5,000 personal radiation detectors,  and officials from the Architecture and Plans Directorate reported working  closely with the Coast Guard to add a radiological nuclear module to the  Coast Guard\u2019s terrorism risk model. DNDO\u2019s Transformational and  Applied Research Directorate, which does conduct R&D, works with less  mature technologies and therefore does not always interact directly with  the operational components.", "While BMD, the Coast Guard, and DNDO were each taking actions to  coordinate with their R&D customers, work remains to be done at the  departmental level to ensure border and maritime R&D efforts are  mutually reinforcing and are being directed toward the highest priority  needs. We recently highlighted coordination of R&D efforts as a  challenge for DHS and we made recommendations for improving  coordination. We reported that S&T, which is statutorily required to  coordinate R&D efforts across the department, has taken some steps to  coordinate R&D efforts across DHS, but that the department\u2019s R&D  efforts are fragmented and overlapping, which increases the risk of  unnecessary duplication. We recommended in September 2012 that  DHS develop a description of the department\u2019s processes and roles and  responsibilities for overseeing and coordinating R&D investments and  efforts. As of June 2013, DHS had not made a decision about how it  specifically planned to address these recommendations. BMD officials  reported in June 2013 that the directorate\u2019s efforts would likely begin at  the project and office levels (specifically through the office level strategic  plans S&T\u2019s Homeland Security Advanced Research Project Agency is  developing with CBP and the Coast Guard), and from there, move to a  departmental level.

Projects at the centers have 5-year work plans that go  through a mid-point review process with component-agency input where  they can be reevaluated and modified. To solicit ideas for new projects,  the Office of University Programs holds technical workshops with  component-level subject matter experts. The component subject matter  experts will discuss a technical or informational challenge they have, and  as a group, the workshop participants will discuss what key research  questions need to be addressed imminently. The Office of University  Programs will draft these issues into more formalized research questions  and put them out to the universities and centers. The office then  examines proposals it receives based on how the research can further  DHS\u2019s missions. Office of University Programs officials stated that the  office\u2019s process for soliciting research topics and evaluating proposals is  good and that it keeps the centers flexible. Center officials also reported  collaborating on a variety of projects with non-DHS customers, such as  DOD (specifically the Army Research Laboratory and the Air Force Office  of Scientific Research), NOAA, the National Institute of Health, the  National Science Foundation, and the Department of Justice.", "However, officials from DHS\u2019s primary land border security Center of  Excellence reported challenges with respect to a lack of clarity regarding  protocols for access to DHS information when conducting R&D.  Specifically, officials from this center reported that they have been  regularly unable to obtain data from CBP to complete research it was  conducting on CBP\u2019s behalf, which resulted in delays and terminated  R&D projects. These officials reported that of 4 discontinued projects and  9 completed projects, 4 projects experienced delays, incomplete data, or  incorrect data. Office of University Programs staff stated that  misunderstandings surrounding procedures regarding nongovernmental  personnel access to data can be a challenge.", "DHS Office of University Programs officials said in June 2013 that they  have not fully developed all of the procedures regarding sharing  government data. However, the officials said that under the terms of the  cooperative agreements between the Office of University Programs and  the centers, CBP has no obligation to provide government-generated data  of any kind. The officials said that this is because universities generally  operate under the principle of publishing at will, which could limit the  ability of DHS to restrict the publication of potentially sensitive  information. The Office of University Programs provides several avenues  for DHS components to be involved with the centers and potential  projects, including writing funding opportunity announcements for centers,  selecting projects to fund, reviewing and negotiating work plans, and  recommending corrections. But given the challenges raised by the  primary border security center, the Office of University Programs could  help ensure that the approximately $3 million to $4 million a year  dedicated to each university center is used more effectively by more  carefully considering data needs, potential access issues, and potential  data limitations with its federal partners before approving projects. We  have previously stated that identifying data sources and collection  procedures is one of the five key steps to an effective evaluation design.  Further, we have stated that in selecting a product\u2019s design, agencies  should determine a design\u2019s limitations as a result of the information  required or the scope and methodology\u2014such as questionable data  quality or reliability, inability to access certain types of data, or security  classifications or confidentiality restrictions\u2014and to address how these  limitations will affect the product. Given the challenges raised by officials  from both universities leading the R&D for land border security, a more  rigorous review of potential data-related challenges and limitations at the  start of a project could help R&D customers (such as CBP) identify data  requirements and potential limitations up front so that money is not  allocated to projects that potentially cannot be completed. DHS Office of  University Programs officials agreed that making sure their clients take  additional steps to identify data requirements up front could help address  these challenges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Taken Steps to Coordinate with and Leverage R&D Efforts of Other Federal Agencies", "paragraphs": ["DHS\u2019s R&D agencies reported regularly coordinating with the Department  of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Energy (DOE) in the  development of new border and maritime security technologies on both  an individual project level and at a departmental level.

Specifically, DNDO officials said DNDO has an interagency  agreement with DOD to develop long range nuclear detection devices.  DNDO also has a memorandum of understanding with DOD\u2019s Defense  Threat Reduction Agency, DOE\u2019s National Nuclear Security  Administration, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to  coordinate national nuclear detection R&D programs. Further, Coast  Guard officials reported partnering with the Navy to develop unmanned  aerial surveillance technologies capable of launching from the deck of a  cutter and to develop systems to disable a boat\u2019s outboard engines, as  shown in figure 2.", "Additionally, Coast Guard, DNDO, and S&T have used the facilities at  several of DOE\u2019s national laboratories, including the Pacific Northwest  National Laboratory, the Savannah River National Laboratory, and the  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Within S&T, the Office of  National Laboratories is responsible for helping facilitate cooperative  agreements between the national labs and DHS components and is to  review all statements of work issued from DHS to the national  laboratories. However, we reported in September 2012 that 11 DHS  components had reimbursed the national laboratories for R&D between  fiscal years 2010 and 2013, but the Office of National Laboratories could  not provide us with any information on those activities and told us it did  not track them. Instead, the Office of National Laboratories told us it  used other means to monitor DHS work at the laboratories such as  relationships with components and S&T, reviewing task orders sent to the  laboratories from DHS, visiting laboratories, and laboratories self- reporting their work.", "Though it does not report conducting R&D, offices within CBP also  reported coordinating directly with DOD offices\u2014such the Joint Non- Lethal Weapons Program, Army Research, Development, and  Engineering Command, and the Army\u2019s Acquisition, Technology, and  Logistics Office\u2014in the development and testing of particular  technologies. For example, CBP\u2019s Office of Air and Marine reported  visiting the Navy\u2019s laboratory facilities to learn more about the Navy\u2019s  efforts to develop a device capable of disabling a boat\u2019s outboard engine  through a directed energy source. The Navy was conducting this research  in collaboration with the Coast Guard and the officials from the Office of  Air and Marine asked to be kept apprised of the project\u2019s progress and to  be allowed to participate in any testing and demonstrations of prototypes.  DHS officials also reported participating with DOD on a variety of working  groups, including the Air Domain Working Group and the Executive  Aviation Commonality Working Group.", "These collaborative relationships have had benefits for DOD as well. For  instance, officials from the Office of Air and Marine reported working with  the Navy when it was developing new ocean surveying software for  tracking vessel movements. The Navy needed a specific number of  testing hours on an air platform as well as sensor operators familiar with  sea search radar systems before the software could move ahead in its  development. The Office of Air and Marine and the Navy agreed, via a  memorandum of agreement, to adapt the Navy\u2019s software to three  different types of Office of Air and Marine aircraft. The Navy funded the  nonrecurring engineering and the Office of Air and Marine paid to install  and integrate the software on its aircraft. Additionally, officials from CBP  reported working with DOD to conduct joint testing on a vehicle  immobilization device. The officials said that DOD had the funding to do  the testing, but needed vehicles, which CBP had. CBP conducted the  field testing of the devices and shared the data with DOD. In a 2011  testimony, a senior DOD official said that DOD and DHS were  cosponsoring a tunnel detection capability demonstration and that  technologies resulting from these efforts were expected to be fielded  domestically and abroad.", "Despite successes in the development of new security technologies, DHS  and DOD have had fewer successes in the repurposing of already- existing DOD technologies for border and maritime security. CBP has an  agreement with S&T to work with DOD on repurposing its technologies,  such as laser scopes, radios, and surveillance equipment and DHS and  DOD have tested some of these technologies in south Texas, but have  identified several challenges with using the equipment. For example, the  laser scopes used by DOD do not meet the eye safety requirements in  place for federal law enforcement officers operating within U.S. borders.  Second, radios that are developed by DOD for use in foreign countries do  not always meet Federal Communications Commission requirements for  use in the United States and cannot be easily reprogrammed.  Additionally, use of certain surveillance aircraft used by DOD overseas is  restricted in U.S. airspace and such aircraft therefore cannot be used by  CBP. Officials from CBP\u2019s Office of Field Operations said that they were  offered equipment from DOD, but were unable to acquire it because it did  not meet specific CBP security requirements and was not compatible with  CBP\u2019s existing operations and maintenance contracts. Specifically, Office  of Field Operations officials said their office cannot service DOD\u2019s  equipment with its existing vendor service contracts, and that operations  and maintenance is a major factor in whether CBP can add something  new to its fleet. For instance, officials from the Office of Field Operations  said their office was offered DOD small X-ray vans. The office sent  officials to inspect the vans and they concluded it would have required a  substantial investment on CBP\u2019s part to get the vans into working  condition and to upgrade them so that they could be integrated into CBP\u2019s  existing fleet.

The six BMD program  managers we spoke with\u2014who were responsible for managing projects  resulting in 18 R&D deliverables and 3 of BMD\u2019s current portfolios\u2014said  that at the start of every new project, they canvass industry experts to  gather information on the current state of the art technologies, to gain  expertise, and to identify where DHS\u2019s R&D efforts would be most  beneficial. For example, as part of its project to research technologies to  detect cross-border underground tunnels, BMD reached out to officials in  the mining and oil industries to discuss their respective areas of expertise  in using underground sensor systems. From this, BMD determined that  the currently available technologies were not ideal for the type of  detection capabilities DHS needed and used this information in  developing a more effective sensor system for DHS.", "The Coast Guard also identified several avenues through which it  coordinates with the private sector. For instance, the Coast Guard\u2019s  RDT&E Program uses broad agency announcements to survey industry  to learn what technologies are already available.

Further, since  2000, the Coast Guard RDT&E Program has participated in the Coast  Guard Innovation Exposition, which has assisted in informing Coast  Guard decision makers about research that is completed, underway, or  planned. The Innovation Exposition was designed to provide a forum to  exchange ideas and collaborate within the Coast Guard and with its  government, industry, and academic partners. Because of budget  constraints, the Coast Guard suspended the exposition beyond 2011 and  has stated that it is reevaluating the goals and outcomes of the  expositions in terms of their cost and benefits.", "DNDO reported engaging in similar forms of private industry outreach.  For instance, DNDO hosts an annual industry day that is attended by  officials from industry, academia, national laboratories, and others. As  part of the industry day, DNDO reported collaborating with the private  sector to discuss ways to enhance existing radiation detection devices  and develop new technologies that will meet the needs of federal, state,  and local law enforcement officials through programs such as the  Commercial First initiative and the Graduated Radiation and Nuclear  Detector Evaluation and Reporting program. DNDO officials reported  signing an industry engagement policy in April 2013 which stated how  DNDO plans to meet directly with vendors to learn about new  technologies. The policy provides guidance and a standard operating  procedure for DNDO employees on holding structured meetings with  vendors and exchanging information when researching commercially  available technologies. It also identifies fundamental procurement  principles, and provides guidance for meeting with vendors and industry  representatives.", "Beyond its project-level outreach, DHS S&T officials identified what they  refer to as technology foraging as the directorate\u2019s approach for  identifying and adapting already-available technologies in the private  sector. In a draft June 2013 document, S&T stated that technology  foraging is a formal and structured method for identifying technologies  and research and that project managers should use this knowledge to, in  part, conduct more informed project planning. To help integrate  technology foraging into its regular project management, S&T established  a Technology Foraging Office within its Research and Development  Partnerships Group. S&T officials reported that staff from this office is  available to provide technology foraging services to S&T project  managers upon request. For example, in July 2013, S&T reported  leveraging a coastal-weather radar system at the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to supplement software S&T  developed that lets the Coast Guard sweep a bay with radar as a way to  track small anonymous boats or other vessels that transport drugs or  other illegal contraband. Further, S&T invested $11 million in a private,  not-for-profit strategic investment firm designed to coordinate advances in  commercial technologies with the needs of the U.S. intelligence and  security communities.
