Sound decisions on the current results and future direction of vital federal government programs and policies are made more difficult without such information. Until the problems discussed in GAO's audit report on the U.S. government's consolidated financial statements are adequately addressed, they will continue to (1) hamper the federal government's ability to reliably report a significant portion of its assets, liabilities, costs, and other information; (2) affect the federal government's ability to reliably measure the full cost as well as the financial and nonfinancial performance of certain programs and activities; (3) impair the federal government's ability to adequately safeguard significant assets and properly record various transactions; and (4) hinder the federal government from having reliable financial information to operate in an economical, efficient, and effective manner."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["For the ninth consecutive year, certain material weaknesses in internal control and in selected accounting and financial reporting practices resulted in conditions that continued to prevent GAO from being able to provide the Congress and American people an opinion as to whether the consolidated financial statements of the U.S. government are fairly stated in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Three major impediments to an opinion on the consolidated financial statements continued to be (1) serious financial management problems at the Department of Defense, (2) the federal government's inability to adequately account for and reconcile intragovernmental activity and balances between federal agencies, and (3) the federal government's ineffective process for preparing the consolidated financial statements. Further, in our opinion, as of September 30, 2005, the federal government did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and compliance with significant laws and regulations due to numerous material weaknesses. More troubling still is the federal government's overall financial condition and long-term fiscal imbalance. While the fiscal year 2005 budget deficit was lower than 2004, it was still very high, especially given the impending retirement of the \"baby boom\" generation and rising health care costs. Importantly, as reported in the fiscal year 2005 Financial Report of the United States Government, the federal government's accrual-based net operating cost--the cost to operate the federal government--increased to $760 billion in fiscal year 2005 from $616 billion in fiscal year 2004. This represents an increase of about $144 billion or 23 percent. The federal government's gross debt was about $8 trillion as of September 30, 2005. This number excludes such items as the gap between the present value of future promised and funded Social Security and Medicare benefits, veterans' health care, and a range of other liabilities, commitments, and contingencies that the federal government has pledged to support. Including these items, the federal government's fiscal exposures now total more than $46 trillion, representing close to four times gross domestic product (GDP) in fiscal year 2005 and up from about $20 trillion or two times GDP in 2000. Given these and other factors, a fundamental reexamination of major spending programs, tax policies, and government priorities will be important and necessary to put us on a prudent and sustainable fiscal path. This will likely require a national discussion about what Americans want from their government and how much they are willing to pay for those things. We continue to have concerns about the identification of misstatements in federal agencies' prior year financial statements. Frequent restatements to correct errors can undermine public trust and confidence in both the entity and all responsible parties. The material internal control weaknesses discussed in this testimony serve to increase the risk that additional errors may occur and not be identified on a timely basis by agency management or their auditors, resulting in further restatements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am most pleased to be here today and commend your subcommittee\u2019s  tradition of oversight hearings on this and other financial management  issues throughout the year.

However,  in evaluating the nation\u2019s fiscal condition, it is critical to look beyond the  short-term results and consider the overall long-term financial condition  and long-term fiscal imbalance of the government\u2014that is, the  sustainability of the federal government\u2019s programs, commitments, and  responsibilities in relation to the resources expected to be available. More  important than the large increase in the government\u2019s net operating cost in  fiscal year 2005 and persistent short-term budget deficits, fiscal  simulations by GAO and others show that over the long term, we face large  and growing structural deficits due primarily to known demographic  trends, rising health care costs, and lower federal revenues relative to the  economy.", "As I have testified before, the current financial reporting model does not  clearly, comprehensively, and transparently show the wide range of  responsibilities, programs, and activities that may either obligate the  federal government to future spending or create an expectation for such  spending. Thus, it provides a potentially unrealistic and misleading picture  of the federal government\u2019s overall performance, financial condition, and  future fiscal outlook. The federal government\u2019s gross debt in the U.S.  government\u2019s consolidated financial statements was about $8 trillion as of  September 30, 2005. This number excludes such items as the current gap  between the present value of future promised and funded Social Security  and Medicare benefits, veterans\u2019 health care, and a range of other  liabilities (e.g., federal employee and veteran benefits payable),  commitments, and contingencies that the federal government has pledged  to support. Including these items, the federal government\u2019s fiscal  exposures now total more than $46 trillion, representing close to four  times gross domestic product (GDP) in fiscal year 2005 and up from about  $20 trillion or two times GDP in 2000. About one third of the  approximately $26 trillion increase resulted from enactment of the  Medicare prescription drug benefit in fiscal year 2004. (See table 1.) The  federal government\u2019s current fiscal exposures translate into a burden of  about $156,000 per American or approximately $375,000 per full-time  worker, up from $72,000 and $165,000 respectively, in 2000. Furthermore,  these amounts do not include future costs resulting from Hurricane  Katrina or the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.", "In addition to the approximately $46 trillion of estimated fiscal exposures  discussed above, there are exposures that are not included in those figures  because the amounts of the exposures are not currently estimable. For  example, the Department of Energy, in the footnotes to its fiscal year 2005  financial statements, disclosed that its environmental liability estimates do  not include cleanup costs at sites for which there is no current feasible  remediation approach, such as the nuclear explosion test area at the  Nevada Test Site. It is important to understand the nature and extent of  these types of additional exposures in the long-term fiscal planning for the  federal government.", "Additionally, tax expenditure amounts are not required to be disclosed,  nor are they disclosed, in agency or the U.S. government\u2019s consolidated  financial statements. Tax expenditures are reductions in tax revenues that  result from preferential provisions, such as tax exclusions, credits, and  deductions. These revenue losses reduce the resources available to fund  other programs or they require higher tax rates to raise a given amount of  revenue. As we reported in September 2005, the number of tax  expenditures more than doubled since 1974, and the sum of tax  expenditure revenue loss estimates tripled in real terms to nearly $730  billion in 2004. Under the most recent estimates, this has risen to more  than $775 billion in 2005. Enhanced reporting on tax expenditures would  ensure greater transparency and accountability for revenue forgone by the  federal government and provide a more comprehensive picture of the  federal government\u2019s policies and fiscal position.", "Further, additional changes are needed to communicate important  information to users about current operating results and the long-term  financial condition of the U.S. government and annual changes therein. In  particular, the government\u2019s financial statements should clearly  communicate to the user:  the on-budget or operating results versus unified budget results for the  year;  the long-term sustainability of federal government programs\u2014areas to  consider include  the relationship of the federal government\u2019s existing  commitments/responsibilities, including social insurance, to  appropriate measures, such as GDP and per capita amounts,  the government's long-term fiscal imbalance in relation to appropriate  measures, such as GDP, and  the magnitude of the potential alternatives for resolving the long term  deficits, such as the rate of tax increases or spending reductions  necessary to balance the government's long-term finances;  inter-generational equity issues, e.g., assessing the extent to which  different age groups may be required to assume financial burdens for  commitments already made; and   a liability at the governmentwide level for funds held by Social Insurance  trust funds.", "Another tool that would serve to more effectively communicate the federal  government\u2019s finances to the public would be a Summary Annual Report.  Such a report would summarize, in a clear, concise, and transparent  manner, key financial and performance information included in the  Financial Report of the United States Government.", "The federal government\u2019s financial condition and long-term fiscal  imbalance present enormous challenges to the nation\u2019s ability to respond  to emerging forces reshaping American society, the United States\u2019 place in  the world, and the future role of the federal government. GAO\u2019s long-term  simulations illustrate the magnitude of the fiscal challenges associated  with an aging society and the significance of the related challenges the  government will be called upon to address. Figures 1 and 2 present these  simulations under two different sets of assumptions. In figure 1, we start  with the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s (CBO) 10-year baseline\u2014 constructed according to the statutory requirements for that baseline.  Consistent with these requirements, discretionary spending is assumed to  grow with inflation for the first 10 years and all tax cuts currently  scheduled to expire are assumed to expire. After 2016, discretionary  spending is assumed to grow at the same rate as the economy, and  revenue is held constant as a share of GDP at the 2016 level. In figure 2,  two assumptions are changed: (1) discretionary spending is assumed to  grow at the same rate as the economy after 2006 rather than merely with  inflation, and (2) all expiring tax provisions are extended. For both  simulations, Social Security and Medicare spending is based on the 2005  Trustees\u2019 intermediate cost projections, and we assume that benefits  continue to be paid in full after the trust funds are exhausted. Medicaid  spending is based on CBO\u2019s December 2005 long-term projections under  midrange assumptions.", "As these simulations illustrate, absent policy changes on the spending or  revenue side of the budget, the growth in spending on federal retirement  and health entitlements will encumber an escalating share of the  government\u2019s resources. Indeed, when we assume that all the temporary  tax reductions are made permanent and discretionary spending keeps  pace with the economy, our long-term simulations suggest that by 2040  federal revenues would be adequate to pay only some Social Security  benefits and interest on the federal debt. Neither slowing the growth in  discretionary spending nor allowing the tax provisions to expire\u2014nor both  together\u2014would eliminate the imbalance.", "Although revenues will be part of the debate about our fiscal future,  assuming no changes to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other  drivers of the long-term fiscal gap would require at least a doubling of  taxes\u2014and that seems to be highly implausible. Accordingly, substantive  reform of Social Security and our major health programs is critical to  recapturing our future fiscal flexibility. Ultimately, the nation will have to  decide what level of federal benefits and spending it wants and how it will  pay for these benefits. Our current path also will increasingly constrain  our ability to address emerging and unexpected budgetary needs and  increase the burdens that will be faced by future generations. Continuing  on this fiscal path will mean escalating and ultimately unsustainable  federal deficits and debt that will serve to threaten the standard of living  for the American people and ultimately our national security.", "As these simulations illustrate, regardless of the assumptions used, the  problem is too big to be solved by economic growth alone or by making  modest changes to existing spending and tax policies. Rather, a  fundamental reexamination, reprioritization, and reengineering of major  spending programs, tax policies, and government priorities will be  important to recapture our fiscal flexibility and update our programs and  priorities to respond to emerging social, economic, and security changes.  Ultimately, this will likely require a national discussion about what  Americans want from their government and how much they are willing to  pay for those things."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Restatements of Agencies\u2019 Financial Statements", "paragraphs": ["According to Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards  (SFFAS) No. 21, Reporting Corrections of Errors and Changes in  Accounting Principles, prior period financial statements presented should  only be restated for corrections of errors, when such errors caused the  financial statements to be materially misstated.

At least 7 of the 24 CFO  Act agencies restated certain of their fiscal year 2004 financial statements  to correct errors. During fiscal year 2005, we reviewed the causes and  nature of the restatements made by several Chief Financial Officers (CFO)  Act agencies in fiscal year 2004 to their fiscal year 2003 financial  statements and recommended improvements in internal controls and audit  procedures to prevent or detect future similar errors. Generally, the  reasons for the restatements we reviewed were agencies\u2019 lack of effective  internal controls over the processing and reporting of certain transactions  and the failure of the auditors to design and/or perform adequate audit  procedures to detect such errors. During our review, we noted that the  extent of the restatements to the agencies\u2019 fiscal year 2003 financial  statements varied from agency to agency, ranging from correcting two line  items on an agency\u2019s balance sheet to correcting numerous line items on  several of another agency\u2019s financial statements.

Appendix I  describes the material deficiencies in more detail and highlights the  primary effects of these material weaknesses on the consolidated financial  statements and on the management of federal government operations.  These material deficiencies were the federal government\u2019s inability to    satisfactorily determine that property, plant, and equipment and  inventories and related property, primarily held by the Department of  Defense (DOD), were properly reported in the consolidated financial  statements; reasonably estimate or adequately support amounts reported for certain  liabilities, such as environmental and disposal liabilities, or determine  whether commitments and contingencies were complete and properly  reported;   support significant portions of the total net cost of operations, most  notably related to DOD, and adequately reconcile disbursement activity at  certain federal agencies;   adequately account for and reconcile intragovernmental activity and  balances between federal agencies;    ensure that the federal government\u2019s consolidated financial statements  were consistent with the underlying audited agency financial statements,  balanced, and in conformity with GAAP; and  resolve material differences that exist between the total net outlays  reported in federal agencies\u2019 Statements of Budgetary Resources and the  records used by Treasury to prepare the Statements of Changes in Cash  Balance from Unified Budget and Other Activities.", "Due to the material deficiencies and additional limitations on the scope of  our work, as discussed in our audit report, there may also be additional  issues that could affect the consolidated financial statements that have not  been identified.", "In addition to the material weaknesses that represented material  deficiencies, which were discussed above, we found the following four  other material weaknesses in internal control as of September 30, 2005.  These weaknesses are discussed in more detail in appendix II, including  the primary effects of the material weaknesses on the consolidated  financial statements and on the management of federal government  operations. These material weaknesses were the federal government\u2019s  inability to  implement effective processes and procedures for properly estimating the  cost of certain lending programs, related loan guarantee liabilities, and  value of direct loans;   determine the extent to which improper payments exist;  identify and resolve information security control weaknesses and manage  information security risks on an ongoing basis; and   effectively manage its tax collection activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Systems Problems at Agencies Continue to Hinder Accountability", "paragraphs": ["For fiscal year 2005, 18 of 24 CFO Act agencies were able to attain  unqualified opinions on their financial statements by the November 15,  2005, reporting deadline established by the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) (see app. III). The independent auditor of the Department  of State subsequently withdrew its qualified opinion on the department\u2019s  fiscal year 2005 financial statements and reissued an unqualified opinion  on such financial statements dated December 14, 2005. As a result, 19 CFO  Act agencies received unqualified opinions on their fiscal year 2005  financial statements. However, irrespective of these unqualified opinions,  many agencies do not have timely, reliable, and useful financial  information and effective controls with which to make informed decisions  and ensure accountability on an ongoing basis.

Recent actions taken by the  department to develop an integrated strategy to better understand and  initiate efforts to systematically transform and address weaknesses in its  business operations are encouraging. On September 28, 2005, DOD  approved two key components of its transformation strategy: the Business  Enterprise Architecture and the Business Transition Plan. An enterprise  architecture should provide a clear and comprehensive picture of an  entity, whether it is an organization (e.g., a federal department) or a  functional or mission area that cuts across more than one organization  (e.g., financial management). This picture consists of snapshots of both  the enterprise\u2019s current \u201cAs Is\u201d operational and technological environment  and its target or \u201cTo Be\u201d environment. A transition plan should provide the  capital investment roadmap for transitioning from the current to the target  environment by describing how and when new business systems will be  developed and implemented. In November 2005, we reported that while  DOD had made important progress toward building a foundation upon  which to improve its business operations, it did not fully satisfy the  requirements of the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act  for 2005. For example, we reported that the architecture did not address  how DOD would comply with federal accounting, financial, and reporting  requirements, such as the United States Government Standard General  Ledger.", "In late December 2005, DOD issued its Financial Improvement and Audit  Readiness (FIAR) Plan, a third major component of its business  transformation strategy.

However, unlike the previous plan, the  FIAR Plan does not establish an overall goal of achieving a clean audit  opinion on its departmentwide financial statements by a specific date.  Rather, the FIAR Plan appears to recognize that it will take several years  before DOD is able to implement the systems, processes, and other  changes necessary to fully address its financial management weaknesses.  In the interim, DOD plans to focus its initial efforts on four areas:   (1) military equipment, (2) real property, (3) military retiree eligible health  care fund liabilities, and (4) environmental liabilities. The FIAR Plan also  focuses on the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,  Civil Works because these organizations intend to be ready for audit in  fiscal years 2007 and 2008, respectively.
