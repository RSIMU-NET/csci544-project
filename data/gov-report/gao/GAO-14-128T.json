Recent incidents at federal facilities demonstrate their continued vulnerability to attacks or other acts of violence. To help accomplish its mission, FPS conducts facility risk assessments and provides oversight of approximately 13,500 contract security guards deployed to federal facilities.", "This testimony is based on the results of our September 2013 report (released by the Subcommittee today), previous reports, and preliminary results of work GAO conducted for a report that GAO plans to issue to the Chairman later this year. GAO discusses (1) challenges FPS faces in ensuring contract security guards deployed to federal facilities are properly trained and certified and (2) the extent to which FPS and select federal agencies' facility risk assessment methodologies align with standards issued by the ISC. To perform this work, GAO reviewed FPS and guard company documentation and interviewed officials about oversight of guards. GAO also reviewed FPS's and eight federal agencies' risk assessment documentation and compared it to ISC's standards. These agencies were selected based on their missions and types of facilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Protective Service (FPS) faces challenges ensuring that contract guards have been properly trained and certified before being deployed to federal facilities around the country. In a September 2013 report, GAO found that providing active-shooter-response and screener training is a challenge for FPS. For example, according to officials at five guard companies, their contract guards have not received training on how to respond during incidents involving an active-shooter. Without ensuring that all guards receive this training, FPS has limited assurance that its guards are prepared for such a threat. Similarly, officials from one of FPS's contract guard companies stated that 133 (about 38 percent) of its approximately 350 guards have never received screener training. As a result, those guards may be using x-ray and magnetometer equipment at federal facilities that they are not qualified to use, raising questions about their ability to properly screen access control points at federal facilities--one of their primary responsibilities. We were unable to determine the extent to which FPS's guards have received active-shooter-response and screener training. FPS agreed with GAO's 2013 recommendation that they take steps to identify guards that have not had required training and provide it to them. GAO also found that FPS continues to lack effective management controls to ensure its guards have met its training and certification requirements. For instance, although FPS agreed with GAO's 2010 and 2012 recommendations that it develop a comprehensive and reliable system for managing information on guards' training, certifications, and qualifications, it still does not have such a system. Additionally, 23 percent of the 276 guard files GAO examined (maintained by 11 of the 31 guard companies we interviewed) lacked required training and certification documentation. Examples of missing items include documentation of initial weapons and screener training and firearms qualifications.", "GAO's preliminary results indicate that several agencies, including FPS, do not use a methodology to assess risk at their facilities that aligns with the Interagency Security Committee's (ISC) risk assessment standards. Risk assessments help decision-makers identify and evaluate security risks and implement protective measures to mitigate the risk. ISC's standards state that agencies' facility risk assessment methodologies must: 1) consider all of the undesirable events identified by ISC as possible risks to federal facilities, and 2) assess the threat, vulnerability, and consequence of specific undesirable events. Most commonly, agencies' methodologies that GAO reviewed are inconsistent with ISC's standards because they do not assess facilities' vulnerabilities to specific undesirable events. If an agency does not know its facilities' potential vulnerabilities to specific undesirable events, it cannot set priorities to mitigate these vulnerabilities. In addition, as GAO reported in August 2012, although federal agencies pay FPS millions of dollars to assess risk at their facilities, FPS's risk assessment tool is not consistent with ISC's risk assessment standards because it does not assess consequence (i.e., the level, duration, and nature of loss resulting from undesirable events). As a result, FPS and the other non-compliant agencies GAO reviewed may not have a complete understanding of the risks facing approximately 57,000 federal facilities located around the country (including the 9,600 protected by FPS)."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["DHS and FPS agreed with GAO's recommendations in its September 2013 report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to be here to discuss the results of our September 2013  report, which the Subcommittee is releasing today, and the efforts of the  Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Federal Protective Service  (FPS) to protect the nearly 9,600 federal facilities that are under the  control and custody of the General Services Administration (GSA). The  2012 shooting at the Anderson Federal Building in Long Beach,  California, and the results of our 2009 covert testing and FPS\u2019s ongoing  penetration testing demonstrate the continued vulnerability of federal  facilities. Moreover, the challenge of protecting federal facilities is one of  the major reasons why we have designated federal real property  management as a high-risk area.", "FPS is authorized (1) to protect the buildings, grounds, and property that  are under the control and custody of GSA, as well as the persons on the  property; (2) to enforce federal laws and regulations aimed at protecting  such property and persons on the property; and (3) to investigate   FPS conducts its mission  offenses against these buildings and persons. by providing security services through two types of activities: (1) physical  security activities\u2014conducting security assessments and recommending  countermeasures aimed at preventing incidents\u2014and (2) law  enforcement activities\u2014proactively patrolling facilities, responding to  incidents, conducting criminal investigations, and exercising arrest  authority. To accomplish its mission, FPS currently has almost 1,200 full- time employees and about 13,500 contract guards deployed at federal  facilities across the country. It expects to receive approximately $1.3  billion in fees for fiscal year 2013.", "Since 2008, we have reported on the challenges FPS faces with carrying  out its mission, including overseeing its contract guards and assessing  risk at federal facilities. FPS\u2019s contract guard program is the most visible  component of the agency\u2019s operations, and the agency relies on its  guards to be its \u201ceyes and ears\u201d while performing their duties. However,  we reported in 2010 and again in 2013 that FPS continues to experience  difficulty ensuring that its guards have the required training and  certifications. Before guards are assigned to a post (an area of  responsibility) at a federal facility, FPS requires that they all undergo  employee fitness determinations and complete approximately 120 hours  of training provided by the contractor and FPS, including basic training  and firearms training. Among other duties, contract guards are  responsible for controlling access to facilities; conducting screening at  access points to prevent the introduction of prohibited items, such as  weapons and explosives; and responding to emergency situations  involving facility safety and security. FPS also faces challenges  assessing risks at the 9,600 facilities under the control and custody of  GSA. For instance, in 2012, we reported that FPS\u2019s ability to protect and  secure federal facilities has been hampered by the absence of a risk  assessment program that is consistent with federal standards.", "GAO, Federal Protective Service: Challenges with Oversight of Contract Guard Program  Still Exist, and Additional Management Controls Are Needed, GAO-13-694 (Washington,  D.C.: September 2013). testimony discusses (1) challenges FPS faces in ensuring contract  security guards deployed to federal facilities are properly trained and  certified and (2) the extent to which FPS and select federal agencies\u2019  facility risk assessment methodologies align with federal risk assessment  standards issued by the Interagency Security Committee (ISC). To  identify challenges associated with ensuring FPS\u2019s contract guards are  properly trained and certified, we analyzed selected guard services  contracts active as of September 2012 and FPS\u2019s Security Guard  Information Manual. We drew a non-generalizable sample of 31 contracts  from FPS\u2019s 117 guard services contracts (one contract for every guard  company with which FPS has contracted for non-emergency guard  services). A subset (11) of the 31 guard contracts was chosen based on  geographic diversity and geographic density of contracts within FPS  regions to allow us to conduct file reviews for multiple contracts during  each of four site visits that we conducted. For each of these 11 contracts,  we reviewed the contracts as well as a random sample of guard files  associated with each contract. The remaining 20 guard services contracts  we selected were the most recent contract for each of the remaining  guard companies that FPS had contracted with as of November 2012. We  also interviewed officials from each of the 31 contract guard companies.", "To determine the extent to which contract guard companies documented  compliance with FPS\u2019s guard training and certification requirements, we  examined documentation related to our non-generalizeable sample of 11  contracts, as previously discussed. From these 11 contracts, we  randomly selected 276 guard files to review for compliance with FPS  requirements. For each guard file, we compared the file documents to a  list of requirements contained in FPS\u2019s Administrative Audit and  Protective Security Officer File Review Forms, which FPS uses to  conduct its monthly guard file reviews.", "To identify the management controls and processes FPS and the guard  companies use to ensure compliance with training, certification, and  qualification requirements, we reviewed FPS\u2019s procedures for (1)  conducting monthly guard file reviews; (2) documenting compliance with  guard training, certification, and qualification requirements; and (3)  monitoring performance. We also visited 4 of FPS\u2019s 11 regions to discuss  how regional officials ensure that guards are qualified to be deployed to  federal facilities. We selected the 4 regions to provide geographic density  of contracts in the region to facilitate reviews of guard files, diversity in the  size of guard companies, and geographic diversity. In addition, we  interviewed officials from each of FPS\u2019s 31 guard companies regarding  their policies and procedures for complying with FPS\u2019s guard training and  certification requirements. While the results of our work are not  generalizeable, about 40 percent of the GSA facilities with guards are  located in the four regions where we conducted our site visits and our  review of guard files involved 11 of FPS\u2019s 31 guard companies. To  assess the extent to which FPS\u2019s monthly guard-file review results  identified files with missing documentation of training, certifications, and  qualifications, we compared FPS\u2019s monthly file review results from the  month in which we conducted our file review for each of the 11 contracts  to identify guard files that were included in both our review and FPS\u2019s  monthly review. We identified any discrepancies between the reviews and  used FPS\u2019s file review forms to examine the discrepancies.", "To determine the extent to which FPS and select federal agencies\u2019 facility  risk assessment methodologies align with ISC\u2019s risk assessment  standards, we reviewed and analyzed risk assessment documentation  and interviewed officials at nine federal agencies and compared each  agency\u2019s methodology to ISC\u2019s standards. The nine selected agencies  include: Department of Energy, Office of Health, Safety, and Security;  Department of Interior; Department of Justice, Justice Protective Service;  Department of State, Diplomatic Security; Department of Veterans Affairs;  Federal Emergency Management Agency; Federal Protective Service;  Nuclear Regulatory Commission; and Office of Personnel Management.  These agencies were selected to achieve diversity with respect to the  number and types of agencies\u2019 facilities, as well as the agencies\u2019  missions.", "We conducted our ongoing work from August 2012 to October 2013 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

According to FPS  officials, the agency provides guards with information on how they should  respond during an active-shooter incident as part of the 8-hour FPS- provided orientation training. FPS officials were not able to specify how  much time is devoted to this training, but said that it is a small portion of  the 2-hour special situations training.documents, this training includes instructions on how to notify law  enforcement personnel, secure the guard\u2019s area of responsibility,  appropriate use of force, and direct building occupants according to  emergency plans.", "According to FPS\u2019s training  However, when we asked officials from 16 of the 31 contract guard  companies we spoke to if their guards had received training on how  guards should respond during active-shooter incidents, responses  varied.

However, in our September 2013 report, we found that FPS  has not provided required screener training to all guards. Screener  training is important because many guards control access points at  federal facilities and thus must be able to properly operate x-ray and  magnetometer machines and understand their results. In 2009 and 2010,  we reported that FPS had not provided screener training to 1,500 contract  guards in one FPS region. In response to our reports, FPS stated that it  planned to implement a program to train its inspectors to provide screener  training to all of its contract guards. However, 3 years after our 2010  report, guards continue to be deployed to federal facilities who have  never received this training. For example, an official at one contract guard  company stated that 133 of its approximately 350 guards (about 38  percent) on three separate FPS contracts (awarded in 2009) have never  received their initial x-ray and magnetometer training from FPS. The  official stated that some of these guards are working at screening posts.  Further, officials at another contract guard company in a different FPS  region stated that, according to their records, 78 of 295 (about 26  percent) guards deployed under their contract have never received FPS\u2019s  x-ray and magnetometer training. These officials stated that FPS\u2019s  regional officials were informed of the problem, but allowed guards to  continue to work under this contract, despite not having completed  required training. Because FPS is responsible for this training, according  to guard company officials no action was taken against the company.  Consequently, some guards deployed to federal facilities may be using x- ray and magnetometer equipment that they are not qualified to use \u2500thus  raising questions about the ability of some guards to execute a primary  responsibility to properly screen access control points at federal facilities.
