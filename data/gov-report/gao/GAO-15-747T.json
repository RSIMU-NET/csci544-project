HUD implemented the MTW  demonstration program, which was authorized by the Omnibus  Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996, in 1999.", "The program is intended to give participating PHAs the flexibility to  design and test innovative strategies for providing and administering  housing assistance. The program has three statutory purposes: to  reduce costs and achieve greater cost-effectiveness in federal  housing expenditures, give families with children incentives to obtain  employment and become self-sufficient, and increase housing choices  for low-income families. To put in place the innovations intended  under the program\u2019s authorizing legislation, PHAs may request  waivers of certain provisions in the United States Housing Act of  1937, as amended. For example, PHAs may combine the funding  they are awarded annually from different programs\u2014such as public  housing capital funds, public housing operating funds, and voucher  funds\u2014into a single, authority-wide funding source. As of June 2015,  39 PHAs were participating through the end of their fiscal year 2018.", "FSS Program. FSS was authorized in 1990 to help families receiving  vouchers or living in public housing become self-sufficient through  case management and referrals to education, training, and other  supportive services. HUD has historically received separate FSS  appropriations for public housing residents and Housing Choice  Voucher recipients, but Congress combined the appropriations in  fiscal year 2014. PHAs use grant funds to pay program coordinators who link residents to the supportive services they need to achieve  self-sufficiency. Families in the FSS program sign contracts with their  PHAs requiring that all family members become independent of cash  welfare assistance and that the head of the family seek and maintain  employment.", "Voucher Program. The voucher program was authorized under  Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended. In  recent years, the voucher program has helped provide affordable  rental housing to about 2 million very low- or extremely low-income  households annually. Approximately 2,400 PHAs administer the  voucher program on HUD\u2019s behalf. Under the program, an assisted  household pays either 30 percent of its monthly adjusted income in  rent or the PHA-established minimum rent (up to $50). The remainder  of the rent\u2014the difference between the lesser of the unit\u2019s gross rent  (rent plus utilities) or a local \u201cpayment standard\u201d and the household\u2019s  payment\u2014is paid through a HUD-subsidized \u201cvoucher.\u201d The payment  standard is based on the HUD-determined fair market rent for the  locality, which HUD annually estimates for metropolitan and  nonmetropolitan areas. Participating PHAs can set payment  standards (that is, pay subsidies) of between 90 and 110 percent of  the fair market rent for their areas. The voucher program is not an  entitlement program. Therefore, the amount of budget authority  Congress provides through annual appropriations limits the number of  households that the program can assist. Historically, appropriations  for the voucher program (or for other housing programs) have not  been sufficient to assist all households that HUD identified as having  worst-case housing needs\u2014households with very low incomes that  pay more than 50 percent of their incomes in rent, live in substandard  housing, or both.", "IHBG Program. Native American tribes primarily receive assistance  for low-income housing through the IHBG program under the Native  American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996  (NAHASDA) program.  NAHASDA reorganized the system of  housing assistance that HUD provided to Native Americans by  eliminating or incorporating several separate programs into a single  block grant program\u2014the IHBG program\u2014and created the Title VI  Loan Guarantee (Title VI) program to assist grant recipients with  private market financing. HUD\u2019s Office of Native American Programs  within PIH administers NAHASDA. IHBG is a formula grant program,  and participating tribes may choose to receive housing funds directly  or through a tribally designated housing entity (TDHE) that  administers the housing program on their behalf. As of January 2015,  566 federally recognized and 5 state-recognized Indian tribes with  membership levels ranging from a few hundred to a few hundred  thousand are eligible to receive IHBG funds annually to provide their  members with adequate and affordable housing. Families eligible for  NAHASDA-funded assistance must be low-income Indian families\u2014 those whose income does not exceed 80 percent of the area median  income\u2014residing on a reservation or in an Indian area.", "Pub.

First, we found that guidance on  reporting performance information did not emphasize the importance of  accurate outcome-oriented information. We noted that PHAs participating  in MTW (MTW agencies) reported annually on their activities, including  efforts to reduce administrative costs and encourage residents to work.  But the usefulness of this information was limited because it was not  consistently outcome oriented. For example, for similar activities designed  to promote family self-sufficiency, one MTW agency reported only the  number of participants, which is generally considered an output, and  another agency did not provide any performance information. To be  consistent with the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA), we  noted that HUD\u2019s guidance on reporting performance information should  indicate the importance of outcome-oriented information.", "Second, we reported in 2012 that HUD had not identified the performance  data needed to assess the results of similar MTW activities across PHAs  or of the program as a whole. Obtaining performance information from  demonstration programs is critical, because the purpose of a  demonstration is to test approaches to identify those that provide positive  results. Since 2009 HUD had been requiring agencies to provide  information on the impact of MTW activities, including benchmarks and  metrics, in their annual MTW reports. We found that while these reports  were informative, they did not lend themselves to quantitative analysis  because the reporting requirements did not call for standardized data,  such as the number of residents who found employment.", "Further, we found that HUD had not established performance indicators  for MTW. According to GPRAMA, federal agencies should establish  efficiency, output, and outcome indicators for each program activity as  appropriate. Federal internal control standards also require the  establishment of performance indicators. As we noted in 2012, specific performance indicators for the MTW program could be based on the three  statutory purposes of the program. For example, agencies could report on  the savings achieved (reducing costs).", "In light of these shortcomings, we recommended that HUD (1) improve its  guidance to MTW agencies on providing performance information in their  annual reports by requiring that such information be quantifiable and  outcome oriented, (2) develop and implement a plan for quantitatively  assessing the effectiveness of similar activities and the program as a  whole, and (3) establish performance indicators for the program.", "HUD subsequently implemented all three of these recommendations.  Specifically, in May 2013 HUD revised the reporting requirements for  MTW agencies and began requiring them to report quantifiable and  outcome-oriented information on MTW activities. Also, in 2015 HUD  developed a five-step plan to quantitatively assess both the effectiveness  of similar activities across agencies and the program as a whole.  According to this plan, HUD will assign standard metrics for all of the  implemented and proposed activities of each MTW agency and ensure  that agencies conducting similar activities report annually on the same set  of metrics. HUD has taken steps to implement this plan by, for example,  issuing guidance to MTW agencies on how to assign the metrics to  activities. Additionally, in 2013 HUD established standard measures that  correlate with each of the statutory objectives of the MTW program. For  each measure, HUD will be able to calculate quantitative results for the  program as a whole and determine whether they are positive, neutral, or  negative.", "Finally, we indicated in our 2012 report that while HUD had identified  some lessons learned on an ad hoc basis, it did not have a systematic  process in place for identifying them. As previously noted, obtaining  impact information from demonstration programs is critical. Since 2000,  HUD had been identifying some activities that could be replicated by  other PHAs. For example, a HUD-sponsored contractor developed five  case studies to describe issues and challenges involved in implementing  MTW. However, these efforts had shortcomings. In most cases, the  lessons learned were chosen based on the opinions of HUD or contracted  staff and largely involved anecdotal (or qualitative) data rather than  quantitative data. We reported in 2012 that because HUD had not  developed criteria and a systematic process for identifying lessons  learned, HUD was limited in its ability to promote useful practices for  broader implementation. We recommended that HUD create a process to  systematically identify lessons learned. HUD agreed and in response  stated that once its revised reporting requirements were implemented, the  resulting data would inform an effort to establish lessons learned. As of  June 2015, HUD had provided information on the steps it will take to  systematically identify promising practices. We are in the process of  reviewing this information to determine if it fully satisfies our  recommendation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD Has Begun Taking Steps to Improve Participation and Outcome Data on the Family Self- Sufficiency Program", "paragraphs": ["In a July 2013 report, we found that the number of families participating in  HUD\u2019s FSS program could not be reliably assessed. According to HUD  guidance, PHAs that received FSS grants were required to update  information about each participating family at least annually. As a part of  these updates, PHAs were expected to indicate whether the family was  actively participating in or had exited the program. For those families that  had exited the program, PHAs were required to indicate whether they had  completed the program or stopped participating for other reasons. In  general, PHAs were to report these data using HUD\u2019s Public and Indian  Housing Information Center (PIC) system.", "We found that many PIC records lacked information on when and why the  participating family exited the FSS program before completion. For  example, while HUD\u2019s PIC data indicated that 14,690 families began  participating in the FSS program in fiscal year 2006, data on exits for the  5-year program were missing for nearly half of these families. According  to HUD officials with responsibility for implementing the FSS program, the  records could have been incomplete or incorrect for several reasons. For  example, if a participating family had left public housing or the voucher  program, the responsible PHA might not have updated the FSS portion of  PIC to reflect the departure. The officials also told us that no HUD staff  had been given specific responsibility for monitoring the completeness of  participants\u2019 records in PIC. We determined that not analyzing the extent  to which PHAs had reported required data limited HUD\u2019s ability to  effectively oversee the program.", "During our work for the July 2013 report, we also noted that HUD required  PHAs to enter summary output and outcome data annually in a  spreadsheet-based reporting tool. These data were to include, among  other things, the number of households that had increased their incomes  or moved to nonsubsidized housing and the number of residents that had  obtained high school diplomas. However, we found that PHAs also had  not consistently reported such information, a condition that was  exacerbated by a lack of program-specific reporting guidance. Further, we  found that HUD lacked a strategy for using the data it collected on the  FSS program, whether through PIC or its spreadsheet-based reporting  tool. Internal control standards underline the importance not only of  collecting but also using information to achieve programmatic goals\u2014in  this case, helping families increase self-sufficiency.", "To address limitations in HUD\u2019s oversight of the FSS program, we  recommended that HUD develop and implement a process to better  ensure that data on FSS participant grants were complete. We stated  that such a process should include steps to identify missing data and the  reasons for the omissions and to help ensure that the data were  complete. HUD agreed with this recommendation and in May 2014  implemented modifications to the PIC system. According to HUD, the  modifications established a system of checks within PIC that would alert  PHA users if the information they submitted was incomplete or appeared  to be incorrect. In June 2015, HUD reported that between June 2014 and  May 2015 the new system had generated 36,802 alerts notifying PHAs  that they needed to correct their information before resubmitting it to  HUD. According to HUD, the agency also has taken initial steps to  improve its spreadsheet-based tool and prevent PHA users from  submitting incomplete data. HUD officials told us that they would provide  documentation of PHAs\u2019 use of the tool and HUD\u2019s analysis of the data  collected by July 30, 2015.

To  improve what is known about and better inform Congress on residents\u2019  progress towards self-sufficiency, we recommended that HUD develop  and implement a strategy for regularly analyzing FSS participation and  outcome data. We noted that such a strategy could include identifying  PHAs from which lessons could be learned as well as PHAs that might  need assistance improving completion rates or outcomes. HUD agreed  with this recommendation, and in March 2014 the agency established  criteria for identifying high-performing and poorly performing FSS  grantees using data from PIC. According to HUD, the agency will annually  assess changes in earned income and FSS program graduation rates,  among other factors. In June 2015, HUD stated that it would provide  documentation of the use of the criteria to identify high-performing and  poorly performing FSS grantees.

HUD neither agreed nor disagreed with our recommendation.  However, consistent with our recommendation, in the President\u2019s budgets  for fiscal years 2013-2016, HUD proposed a number of statutory changes  to streamline administrative requirements for the voucher program. In  addition, in January 2015 HUD published a proposed rule that included a  number of program and administrative simplification measures for the  voucher program. For example, the proposed rule includes a provision  that would permit PHAs to conduct streamlined annual reexaminations for  families with fixed incomes. According to HUD, the department will  publish a final rule no later than December 2015. Further, in April 2015  HUD released its voucher program administrative fee study.

Furthermore, these options are not mutually exclusive\u2014that is, the cost  savings or additional households served could be greater if both options  were implemented.", "We found that because about 90 percent of voucher program funds are  used to pay subsidies, decreasing the subsidy, which would increase the  household contribution toward rent, would yield the greatest cost savings.  Our March 2012 report estimated the effect of several options that  changed either the minimum rents households were required to pay or  used different formulas for calculating required household payments. In  identifying and assessing these options, we reviewed proposals included  in draft legislation and reports from HUD, the Congressional Budget  Office, and housing industry groups.

Requiring assisted households to pay 30  percent of their gross income (rather than income adjusted for certain  deductions and exclusions) in rent would yield an estimated annual  savings of $513 million or allow PHAs to serve an estimated 76,000  additional households, based on household characteristic and rent data  as of December 2010. A rent structure based on gross income would  eliminate the deductions and exclusions that households currently may  claim. Simplification of the rent calculation could also reduce the potential  for improper payments resulting from program administrator rent  calculation errors.", "While each of these options could reduce costs or create administrative  efficiencies, each also involves trade-offs that should be considered  before any changes are implemented. Under each option, some  households would have to pay more in rent than they currently pay.  Setting a minimum rent of $75 would increase the rent for 11 percent of  assisted households, and requiring households to pay 30 percent of gross  income would increase the rent for 86 percent of households. The  options also would have varying effects on different types of households,  such as families with children, persons with disabilities, and the elderly.  We also noted disparities by geographic area, such as high-cost versus  low-cost rental markets.

HUD  spends considerable resources in overseeing the more than 2,400 PHAs  that administer the voucher program. According to a 2008 HUD study, the  department dedicated from more than half to two-thirds of its oversight  resources to PHAs that administered 400 or fewer vouchers and 10  percent of all units.

We recommended that to increase  consistency and reduce time and cost for IHBG recipients HUD, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Interior, and  the Indian Health Service should initiate an interagency effort to  develop and implement a coordinated environmental review process  for all agencies overseeing tribal housing development. We suggested  that the agencies determine if designating a lead agency would be  appropriate. HUD agreed with the recommendation. In June 2015,  HUD told us it would continue collaborating with the other agencies to  develop a coordinated environmental review process that would  simplify efforts to develop tribal housing.collaborating agencies hoped to have some recommendations on the  process by September 2015.", "Potential reduction in training opportunities and program  support. In fiscal year 2012, HUD instituted new training and  technical assistance procedures according to revised language in the  NAHASDA appropriation legislation. These procedures changed both  the way that HUD made funds available to provider organizations and  IHGB recipients\u2019 options for requesting training and technical  assistance. Specifically, Congress stopped appropriating a set-aside  to the National American Indian Housing Council (NAIHC)\u2014which had  previously served as the primary provider of external training and  technical assistance to IHBG recipients\u2014and directed HUD to provide  grants on a competitive basis to national and regional organizations.", "Until fiscal year 2012, Congress appropriated approximately $2 million to $3.5 million  annually as part of a set-aside in the NAHASDA appropriation to NAIHC. concluded that a more comprehensive approach would include input  from tribes that had not yet used HUD\u2019s new procedures so that their  concerns could be addressed. Additionally, we found that HUD had  not shared promising housing practices across grant recipients in an  easily accessible manner. We recommended that HUD (1) expand its  training feedback mechanism to include input from recipients that had  not yet used the new procedures, and (2) collect and disseminate  promising approaches that recipients had used to address housing  challenges. HUD disagreed with the first recommendation, noting  that it already had a fully functioning feedback mechanism for training  and technical assistance. However, HUD subsequently outlined  actions it had taken to broaden its solicitation of input from IHBG  recipients through various outreach efforts, including events attended  by tribal housing officials. HUD has also developed a location on its  website that collects and disseminates best practices on housing  development to tribes, TDHEs, and the general public. As a result, we  consider both recommendations to be implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD\u2019s Office of Public and Indian Housing Faces Other Ongoing Challenges", "paragraphs": ["As we and HUD\u2019s Inspector General have found in previously issued  work, PIH faces a number of ongoing program management challenges.

HUD\u2019s rental  assistance programs, which include public housing and voucher  programs, are among the programs at risk of having significant  improper payments.

HUD has made progress in implementing some of our  recommendations, but additional actions are needed to address others.  We look forward to continuing to work with this committee in overseeing  PIH and other HUD programs to ensure that they are operating in the  most effective and efficient manner.
