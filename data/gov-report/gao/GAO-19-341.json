Half of these metrics are not meeting targets. While the Department of Defense (DOD) has a plan for improving R&M, its guidance is not in line with GAO's acquisition best practices or federal internal control standards as it does not include specific, measurable objectives, align improvement projects to meet those objectives, and prioritize funding. If the R&M requirements are not met, the warfighter may have to settle for a less reliable and more costly aircraft than originally envisioned.", "In 2019, the F-35 program will start modernization efforts\u2014estimated to cost $10.5 billion\u2014for new capabilities to address evolving threats, without a complete business case, or a baseline cost and schedule estimate.

The  characteristics of the services\u2019 variants are similar, but each service\u2019s  variant also has unique operating requirements. For example, the Marine  Corps requires that the F-35B be capable of operating from aircraft  carriers, amphibious ships, and main and austere operating bases alike,  requiring the ability to conduct short take offs and vertical landings.", "In March 2005, we found that the F-35 program had started development  without adequate knowledge of the aircraft\u2019s critical technologies or a  solid design. Further, DOD\u2019s acquisition strategy called for high levels of  concurrency between development and production, which runs counter to  best practices for major defense acquisition programs. In our prior work,  we identified the F-35 program\u2019s lack of adequate knowledge and high  levels of concurrency as the major drivers of the program\u2019s significant  cost and schedule growth, and other performance shortfalls.", "Since the development program began in 2001, it has been restructured  three times with revised cost and schedule estimates. The most recent  restructuring was initiated in 2010 when the program\u2019s cost estimates  exceeded certain thresholds established by statute\u2014a condition known  as a critical Nunn-McCurdy breach. DOD subsequently certified to  Congress in June 2010 that the program was essential to national  security and needed to continue. DOD then established a new acquisition  program baseline in 2012 that added $162.7 billion to the program\u2019s cost  estimate and extended the original delivery schedule by 5-6 years. Since  then, the program\u2019s cost and schedule estimates, as well as the expected  number of aircraft to be delivered, have remained relatively stable, as  shown in table 1.", "Of the F-35\u2019s $406 billion estimated acquisition cost, DOD needs a  majority of the funding ($270.3 billion) to purchase aircraft over the next  26 years. Of that future funding, the program plans to spend between  $9.6 billion and $14 billion each year through fiscal year 2031. In addition,  the program\u2019s sustainment costs to operate and maintain the F-35 fleet  over the next 52 years are estimated to be $1.12 trillion.", "Though the program\u2019s total planned quantities have been relatively  stable, the program\u2019s timeframes for procuring these aircraft have  changed multiple times. Since the start of development, the program has  pushed the procurement of more than half of the total aircraft planned into  the future, mostly due to significant concurrency between development  and production. Specifically, the program office had originally planned to  procure almost 2,000 aircraft by fiscal year 2019. However, according to  the current plan, by the end of 2019, the program will have procured just  over 500 aircraft.", "The F-35 baseline aircraft development program was complete in April  2018, when developmental testing concluded. As we reported in June  2018, the program office reported it had met all nine of its capability  thresholds\u2014or the minimum acceptable value for each capability\u2014and  delivered three of those nine capabilities. However, we also reported that  the program has to complete operational testing before DOD can  determine if the six remaining capabilities have been delivered. The  purpose of operational testing is to assess the effectiveness, suitability,  survivability, lethality, and mission capability of the F-35, including the  information systems and the air vehicle, in an operationally representative  environment. Operational testing includes cyber security assessments,  some of which have been conducted.", "Production of the F-35 began in 2007 while development was in its early  stages and before developmental flight testing had started. As a result of  this concurrent development, the 357 aircraft delivered through 2018 will  need retrofits to fix deficiencies and design issues found during testing.  The program\u2019s total estimated cost of concurrency is $1.4 billion. The  program office plans for over 500 aircraft to be procured by the time  operational testing is completed. Until operational testing is complete,  there is a risk that additional problems with the aircraft may be identified.  As a result, the concurrency costs of retrofitting delivered aircraft could  increase."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Operational Testing Has Started", "paragraphs": ["The F-35 program started formal operational testing in December 2018  after a 3-month delay. This testing was delayed for two main reasons: (1)  to resolve critical deficiencies and (2) to accommodate an unexpected  grounding following the crash of an F-35B in September 2018. According  to a test official, the program expects to complete testing in December  2019, about three months later than planned due to delays with the  simulator that is used for more complex testing. Figure 2 shows the  program\u2019s planned end to developmental testing and planned timeframes  for operational testing for 2012 and the past four years and the delays the  program has realized each year since the program was re-baselined in  2012.", "The operational testing was delayed for the following two main reasons.", "Resolution of deficiencies: First, before the program could begin  operational testing, it had to resolve critical deficiencies with the aircraft  that were identified during development testing. The program categorizes  deficiencies according to their potential impact on the aircraft\u2019s  performance.", "Category 1 deficiencies are considered critical and could jeopardize  safety, security, or another requirement.", "Category 2 deficiencies are those that could impede or constrain  successful mission accomplishment.", "In January 2018, the F-35 program had 966 open deficiencies\u2014111  category 1 and 855 category 2. At that time, the program planned to  move forward before resolving all of them. In June 2018, we  recommended that the Secretary of Defense direct the F-35 program to  resolve all these deficiencies before the program\u2019s October 2019 full-rate  production decision. According to DOD officials, over the past year, the  program has made progress in reducing the number of open deficiencies  by resolving, re-categorizing, closing, or combining them. For example, in  2018, the program resolved nearly 50 category 1 deficiencies and re- categorized over 50 others to category 2. As a result, the program  received approval from the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition  and Sustainment to begin formal operational testing with 13 category 1  deficiencies and almost 900 category 2 deficiencies. According to the  Program Executive Officer, none of the open category 1 deficiencies are  a safety of flight concern, and all of them have operational workarounds.", "A current example of an open category 1 deficiency is with lines on the F- 35\u2019s landing gear, which can rupture when a tire blows, potentially  causing loss of a major aircraft system such as the brakes. Such an event  requires some repair work to the landing gear, but contractor officials  explained that it is not a safety concern. According to the program office,  it is not a safety concern because the current workaround for this  deficiency is pilot training to avoid braking on the side of the blown tire.  Program test officials said that testing with deficiencies is not uncommon  and they will continue to work to address them, but some may not be fully  resolved for several years.", "Unexpected grounding: In October 2018, the F-35 fleet was grounded  after the program identified a manufacturing fault with an engine fuel  tube\u2014a component in the F-35 engine produced by Pratt & Whitney. The  fault was found in an inspection that stemmed from an F-35B crash in  September 2018. This was the first crash of an F-35. Of the 23  operational test aircraft, the program replaced the fuel tubes on 18 aircraft  by the start of operational testing in December 2018, which contributed to  the 3-month delay. This and other key technical risks are described in  more detail in appendix III.", "In addition to starting operational testing and the unexpected grounding,  the program and the airframe contractor Lockheed Martin experienced  other major events over the past year, as shown in figure 3.", "For example, the United States completed its first F-35 combat mission in  September 2018 when an F-35B successfully hit a target in Afghanistan.", "The program took steps to mitigate delays to the start of operational  testing. For example, the program office, in coordination with DOT&E,  received approval to conduct some preoperational testing events starting  in January 2018, before the official start date in December. According to  DOT&E officials, the outcome of these preoperational test events should  count towards the completion of operational testing. This included cold  weather testing in Alaska, which took advantage of appropriate weather  conditions.", "Despite the 3-month delay, program officials stated that they consider the  F-35 operational test schedule to be adequate for addressing schedule  risks, which pertain to unresolved deficiencies and potential problems  with the availability of test and support aircraft, ground systems, test  ranges, and necessary test models and simulations. According to a test  official, as of April 2019, some of these risks have been realized, such as  the delay with the simulator, and as a result, the end of operational testing  is now planned for December 2019. In addition, there is the possibility of  new deficiencies emerging from operational testing.", "Unresolved deficiencies: Existing or new deficiencies could  negatively affect test results. According to DOT&E officials, since the  start of operational testing, four new category 1 deficiencies have  been identified, bringing the total to 17. According to DOD officials, it  would not be unexpected during the course of operational testing for  the program to discover additional deficiencies that may require  resolution and re-testing.", "Availability of test and support aircraft: According to test officials,  F-16s and F-18s are needed to represent adversaries during F-35  operational tests. These assets may not be available because they  also support other test programs. According to officials, the F-35  program does not have control over the availability of these aircraft  and must work with the Navy and Air Force to negotiate their use. In  addition, the limited availability of F-35 test aircraft, in part due to R&M  issues and shortages of replacement parts, may also pose a  challenge to completing test events, according to officials.", "Availability of ground systems: Ground systems required for  operational testing, such as the DOT&E developed Radar Signal  Emulators, are late in development and may not be available when  required. According to DOT&E officials, the emulators imitate modern  threat radar capabilities of adversarial nations but their integration with  the test range is approximately a year behind schedule. The program  is currently using other threat simulators. DOT&E officials stated that  they are working to have the radars ready by the spring of 2019, when  needed.", "Availability of test ranges: Test officials at Edwards Air Force Base  expressed concern about the availability of test ranges, which the F- 35 program shares with other programs. According to test officials, the  F-35 was the fifth in line, in terms of priority, to use the range at  Edwards Air Force Base, as of October 2018. DOT&E officials,  however, stated that they did not observe any range availability issues  during the F-35\u2019s first month of operational testing.", "Availability of test models and simulations: According to program  officials, the program\u2019s testing simulator, which runs the F-35\u2019s  mission systems software and provides test scenarios that cannot be  replicated in a real-world environment, will not be complete until at  least November 2019. Completion of the testing simulator was  originally scheduled for the end of 2017.", "Any additional delays in operational testing could affect another upcoming  program decision: DOD\u2019s decision to begin full-rate production in  December 2019.

However, in December  2018, DOT&E reported that, although performance for the four under- performing metrics has shown slow growth over the years, none of these  metrics were meeting interim goals needed to reach requirements at each  variant\u2019s maturity. Each F-35 variants\u2019 R&M performance against these  metrics\u2019 targets is shown in table 2.", "Since the program began tracking R&M performance in 2009, the  program has seen small, annual improvements. Over the past year, all  variants showed a slight improvement in targeted performance levels for  one metric, the mean flight hours between failures (design controlled), but  saw little or no discernable improvement for the four metrics not meeting  targets. However, based on current performance, the program does not  expect to meet those targets by full aircraft maturity. According to F-35  program officials, the ORD R&M metrics should be re-evaluated to  determine more realistic R&M performance metrics, but they have not yet  taken actions to do so. Until it does so, the program office remains  accountable for ensuring those ORD R&M metrics are achieved.", "In June 2018, we recommended that the F-35 program identify what  steps it needs to take to ensure the F-35 aircraft meet R&M requirements  before each variant reaches maturity and update its R&M Improvement  Program (RMIP)\u2014DOD\u2019s action plan for prioritizing and funding R&M  improvement projects\u2014with these steps. DOD concurred with our  recommendation but has yet to take substantive actions to address it. It  did, however, complete 16 improvement projects since we last reported  on this. Despite completing these projects, there were not significant  gains in the R&M metrics not meeting targets. Program officials advised,  however, that measurable improvements in R&M can take time to  manifest.

The F-35 program office has  not prioritized or dedicated funding in its budget to improve R&M in part  because program officials explained that they have been focused on  initiatives intended to lower the cost of the aircraft. Further, any current  funding for R&M improvement projects comes from the program\u2019s  operation and maintenance funds, which are only available for one fiscal  year. Officials further explained that, if such funding runs out or is used by  the program for other efforts, then R&M projects will go unfunded or be  suspended until new funding is available. In fiscal year 2018, for example,  while some R&M improvement projects were completed, several other  projects were suspended when that year\u2019s funding ran out. According to  officials, these projects may not be started back up until fiscal year 2019.  In addition, most of the R&M improvement projects that were approved in  fiscal year 2018 were not funded.

According to DOD, to improve production  affordability, the F-35 program office is continuing to make investments to  lower the price of an F-35A to below $80 million by lot 13. To realize this  goal, the F-35 program office and the prime contractor are increasing the  production rate and investing in various initiatives to lower production  costs. For example:", "According to the program office, it has invested a total of $320.3  million in efforts to improve manufacturing processes that it estimates  could result in up to $7.9 billion in savings over the life of the program.

However, over the past year, several metrics for the F- 35Bs and F-35Cs saw a decline. According to Lockheed Martin, it faced  several challenges with the increased production rate which led to these  declines.", "For example, since January 2018, the contractor hired around 900  new personnel, nearly 30 percent of its workforce, all of whom needed  training. According to officials, this influx of new personnel led to an  increase in the average labor hours for the F-35C and the number of  hours required for scrap, rework, and repair of the F-35B and F-35C.  According to the contractor, as the newly hired personnel gain more  experience in the production processes, the average labor hours it  takes to build an F-35C should start decreasing again.", "The contractor faced several production quality issues and parts  delays, which it worked to address over the past year. For instance,  we reported last year that due to a fault in the production process,  Lockheed Martin halted deliveries after the Air Force identified  corrosion between the aircraft\u2019s surface panels and the airframe  because Lockheed Martin did not apply primer when the panels were  attached. The program office stated that Lockheed Martin and the F- 35 Program Executive Officer reached a mutual agreement on the  cost to resolve this issue, the details of which have not been disclosed  publicly.", "With the production rate increase, the supply chain was strained to  deliver parts on time, which led to increases in material shortages for  key components, such as the radar.", "Pratt & Whitney has also increased production over the past year and has  shown similar manufacturing performance for the F-35 engine as in past  years; however, it had fewer on-time deliveries in 2018 due to the  challenges it faced, including an increase in the average number of  quality issues per engine.

One  recent hurdle that it overcame was resolving many critical deficiencies  found during developmental testing, which allowed the program to begin  operational testing this past December. Other hurdles remain, including  with the F-35\u2019s reliability and maintainability (R&M). Four of the eight  R&M metrics continue to fall short of meeting performance targets.  Program officials stated that the Operational Requirements Document  (ORD) R&M targets need to be re-evaluated to determine more realistic  R&M performance metrics but have not yet taken actions to do so. Until  the program re-evaluates the targets, it is accountable for achieving those  requirements.", "Furthermore, funding improvement efforts have not been a priority for the  program. As a result, over the past year, some projects were started,  several were halted while underway, and others are on hold, waiting for  funding. As long as targets under all of the R&M metrics continue to fall  short, the U.S. military services and the taxpayer will have to settle for  aircraft that are less reliable and more costly to maintain than originally  planned. Also, with continuing concerns about the program\u2019s long-term  affordability, the program is missing a prime opportunity to infuse  affordability into the aircraft\u2019s future with better R&M performance. As the  program is considering revisions to its R&M Improvement Program  (RMIP), it is in a good position to clearly define and communicate its R&M  objectives for the aircraft to meet the targets under all of its eight R&M  metrics. Until it does so, the program office will not know whether the  steps it is taking now are sufficient to ensure each F-35 variant achieves  its R&M requirements in the future.", "As we have reported in the past, the F-35 program started its  development before it was ready. It is now at risk of doing the same thing  with the Block 4 modernization effort. Since we last reported in June  2018, the program has still not established a solid business case to  commit funding and other resources to developing new capabilities for the  aircraft. This could result in the program delivering technologies late and  over cost estimates. Finally, the program has committed a significant  amount of funding to support Block 4, but it has not completed an  independent cost estimate of the life-cycle cost. Consequently, Block 4  may follow in the footsteps of the F-35\u2019s baseline program which saw  significant cost and schedule growth during its development.
