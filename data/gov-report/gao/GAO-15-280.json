The steps it has taken include the creation of tools that organize and disseminate research findings to certain targeted stakeholder groups and the development of plans for a publicly available database that includes CER. For example, AHRQ's marketing plans\u2014customized plans to help convey key messages about AHRQ's research\u2014include various informational tools to disseminate CER, such as research summaries that communicate research findings to clinicians, consumers, caregivers, and policymakers. However, the agency has not clearly defined how to disseminate information to certain stakeholder groups specified in the law, nor has it identified and documented time frames to implement the marketing plans and distribute the associated informational tools, as would be consistent with federal internal control standards, which state that significant events need to be clearly documented to ensure management goals are carried out. Additionally, in order to implement PPACA's requirement for developing a publicly available database that contains CER evidence, AHRQ officials told GAO that they plan to create a web page to list and provide users with links to existing publicly available databases that could be used to search for CER, but they have not documented a specific implementation plan that includes time frames and strategies to address known potential limitations, such as difficulties that certain users may face in searching the databases for CER results.", "HHS's Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) has coordinated among various agencies to fund projects intended to build data capacity for CER, but its approach lacks key elements needed to ensure its effectiveness. For example, these projects include an effort to better standardize data that could be used in multiple research projects. However, HHS's approach to building data capacity for CER lacks key elements, such as defined objectives, milestones, and time frames, that are necessary to ensure effectiveness. ASPE officials worked with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology to develop a strategic road map to guide both the identification and selection of ASPE's projects beginning in fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2019. Although the February 2014 strategic framework for the road map highlighted several priority objectives, such as enabling the collection of standardized clinical data, these objectives were broad and not clearly defined. For example, although ASPE identified and considered related, ongoing federal and non-federal data infrastructure projects in an attempt to identify needs or gaps, among other things, its strategic road map is unclear on the timing and level of coordination that would be necessary for its projects to work together with these related projects to improve data capacity.

CER includes comparisons of drugs, medical devices, tests, surgeries,  and ways to deliver health care. Specifically, it can help determine which  intervention may be most effective or beneficial for a given patient.  However, the availability of this information is often limited, resulting in  more than half of medical treatments that may be delivered without clear  evidence of their effectiveness, according to the Institute of Medicine.  This uncertainty contributes to high variability in managing clinical  problems, with costs and outcomes differing markedly across the country.

To identify stakeholder groups, we took several  steps.

The four studies we selected were  systematic reviews\u2014syntheses of existing comparative clinical  effectiveness research\u2014and each aligned with one of AHRQ\u2019s 14 priority  conditions and with one of the top four chronic diseases and conditions  for adults identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  We then requested the marketing plans for these four studies and  compared the organizations listed in those plans to the targeted groups  specified in PPACA. We selected and obtained information from four  stakeholder groups\u2014a physicians\u2019 group; a health care providers\u2019 group;  a professional association; and a patient advocacy group\u2014that appeared  most frequently in the marketing plans, from among 56 stakeholder  organizations mentioned in the plans two or more times. For stakeholder  groups that were specified in PPACA but not included in the marketing  plans for the four studies, we requested additional documentation from  AHRQ to determine the extent to which these stakeholder groups may  have appeared in other marketing plans. We also interviewed an official  from an additional stakeholder group\u2014a health plan\u2014because AHRQ  staff indicated that they partnered with this organization to disseminate  information, although it was not included in the marketing plans. Findings  based on information we obtained from these stakeholders cannot be  generalized to all targeted groups.

From fiscal year 2012 through 2013, AHRQ  has obligated about $37 million of the estimated $731 million it expects to  receive through 2019 from the PCORTF on its dissemination activities.", "Development and distribution of CER findings. AHRQ contributes to  the dissemination of CER in various ways, including through the  development of systematic reviews, technical briefs, and research  summaries that explore the benefits and harms of treatments. In  particular, a key method to disseminate CER is through systematic  reviews\u2014syntheses of existing research that compare the effectiveness  and harms of different healthcare interventions. A systematic review is an  assessment and evaluation of all research studies that address a  particular clinical issue. Researchers use an organized method of  locating, assembling, and evaluating a body of literature on a particular  topic. Systematic reviews typically include a description of the findings  from the research studies.", "AHRQ identifies topics for systematic review of CER, such as  cardiovascular disease and arthritis, by evaluating topics nominated by  individuals or groups against program selection criteria, in order to  determine if the topic is appropriate or not appropriate for review. In  addition to using its own criteria to identify CER topics for systematic  reviews and dissemination, AHRQ documentation states that the agency  will consult with experts, such as those from NIH, and review literature to  determine whether any similar systematic reviews of relevant studies  have already been conducted by other agencies or research  organizations in order to reduce potential duplication. Topics selected  for a systematic review are further refined with input from key stakeholder  groups, technical experts, and patients to develop focused research  questions. According to AHRQ officials, research funded by PCORI is  not yet included in these systematic reviews because PCORI research is  not yet complete.", "For each systematic review AHRQ synthesizes CER findings from  existing research, and the agency disseminates these findings to various  targeted stakeholder groups. From June 2012 to June 2014, AHRQ  synthesized CER findings through 74 systematic reviews. (See appendix I  for a listing of the 74 systematic reviews for which AHRQ disseminated  CER findings.) Once a systematic review is complete, AHRQ follows  procedures included in its dissemination guidance materials to develop a  marketing plan that identifies key messages and targeted stakeholder  groups, as well as the types of dissemination mechanisms it will use to  conduct outreach. AHRQ officials told us they distribute CER results  generally by using the same mechanisms as we previously reported in  2012. These mechanisms include social media, as well as AHRQ\u2019s  website and AHRQ\u2019s Effective Healthcare Program website. According  to AHRQ officials, the agency determines which specific mechanisms will  be used to disseminate CER results by considering the unique  characteristics of the research, such as its type, potential impact, and  stakeholder groups most likely to use its findings. For example, CER  identified as being of particular interest to specific specialties may be  disseminated to certain clinical professional associations.", "Tools to organize and disseminate CER. AHRQ\u2019s marketing plans  include various informational tools to disseminate CER. Informational  tools include (1) patient decision aids that walk patients through options  and choices that patients should consider in working with their clinicians  to make informed health care decisions; (2) continuing education and  medical education modules to help clinicians understand and use CER  findings; (3) slide sets to assist clinicians, researchers and other health  professionals with education and training needs; and (4) short, plain- language research summaries that communicate research findings to  clinicians, consumers, caregivers, and policymakers. For example, the  marketing plan for the systematic review titled, Childhood Exposure to  Trauma: Comparative Effectiveness of Interventions Addressing  Maltreatment, was developed for a systematic review that examines  evidence about interventions for maltreated children. The marketing plan  included the specific informational tools to be used to disseminate this  project\u2019s findings, such as research summaries for clinicians, a summary  of treatments for parents and caregivers, a continuing education module  for health care providers, and a slide presentation on the topic.", "They  on all CER that has been conducted. National Library of Medicine officials  told us that they have informally consulted with AHRQ on its plans and  agree with this approach. In November 2014, AHRQ officials told us that  they were sharing their planned approach with senior HHS officials for  review and approval.", "Feedback and evaluation process. As required by PPACA, AHRQ  officials told us they receive feedback on dissemination efforts and  materials from stakeholders, both formally and informally. For example,  officials said that for some of their projects, AHRQ convenes focus groups  and advisory panels to assess the needs of stakeholder groups and  determine how best to disseminate materials. Some stakeholders we  spoke to told us that they have provided feedback to AHRQ on materials  the agency has disseminated; however, they were uncertain about the  extent to which their feedback was incorporated into AHRQ\u2019s  dissemination efforts. AHRQ conducted a feedback assessment and  issued a March 2012 feedback report that highlighted stakeholders  perspectives about the agency\u2019s disseminated materials. In this report,  AHRQ noted that although there is a growing awareness about its  disseminated materials, clinicians raised concerns about the timeliness of  the information included in the materials, among other things. Officials  told us that the agency may conduct future feedback assessments, but  they do not know when these will occur and which targeted stakeholder  groups will be included.", "AHRQ also has funded an evaluation to assess its CER dissemination  activities and materials supported by the Recovery Act. In September  2013, IMPAQ International\u2014the contractor that conducted the  evaluation\u2014issued presentation slides as its final report. The evaluation  indicated that stakeholders\u2019 exposure to AHRQ\u2019s CER information, such  as the number of website visits and dissemination materials requested,  increased over time with AHRQ\u2019s dissemination efforts. The final report  also included feedback from certain stakeholder groups through focus  groups and surveys. For example, clinicians who participated in focus  groups indicated that they typically had little to no experience with the  CER information that AHRQ disseminates to clinicians, and suggested  that AHRQ more visibly promote the benefits and credibility of this  information and then integrate the results and products into existing,  easy-to-access sources of medical information focused on point-of-care  decision-making. AHRQ officials told us that they plan to award a contract  to evaluate the CER dissemination mechanisms\u2014along with the  materials they use to share CER findings\u2014that they continued under  PPACA. This evaluation project, according to officials, is under  development as staff and senior leadership determine the objectives and  methods for the study. Although AHRQ staff have not documented their  plans as of November 2014, they told us that the evaluation is likely to  measure progress on process and intermediate outcome goals of  dissemination activities\u2014similar to the last CER evaluation conducted for  Recovery Act investments where the agency assessed the level of  awareness, understanding, use, and perceived benefits of CER.

Although AHRQ has outlined its  dissemination process in various documents, it has not clearly identified  and documented time frames for one of its key dissemination activities\u2014 to implement marketing plans and distribute associated informational  tools. According to GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, significant events need to be clearly documented to ensure  management goals are carried out.which together describe the key activities of its dissemination process,  including the steps the agency takes to identify key CER findings from  systematic reviews, draft and finalize its marketing plans, and distribute  its informational tools to the public. While certain AHRQ documents  highlight time frames associated with key dissemination activities, we did  not identify any documents that specify time frames for when the  marketing plans are to be implemented and associated informational tools  are to be distributed to stakeholder groups. Once the marketing plans are  finalized, the informational tools are to be distributed to targeted  stakeholder groups after results of the research have been posted online,  such as publication in a major journal. AHRQ officials said they would  expect to distribute the informational tools as soon as the results of the   AHRQ has several documents  research have been posted; however, the dissemination guidance  materials we reviewed did not specify time frames for the completion of  the implementation of the marketing plans and distribution of  informational tools. Without identifying and documenting time frames for  these key activities, AHRQ cannot ensure that CER findings are  disseminated in a timely manner or that the dissemination process is  consistently implemented by all parties. Setting time frames is especially  important for dissemination given the length of time and uncertainty  inherent in applying CER findings; the large volume of CER research  expected from PCORI in the near future, which will increase AHRQ\u2019s  dissemination responsibilities; and the need to maximize the investment  of PCORTF appropriations made through fiscal year 2019.", "Dissemination plan for some stakeholders identified in PPACA has  not been clearly defined. Additionally, AHRQ has not determined how it  will disseminate information to certain stakeholder groups identified in  law, and its dissemination to some of these groups has been limited.

Although as of October 2014 there were no specific marketing plans  that identified private or federal health plans to receive disseminated CER  information, AHRQ officials told us they have conducted outreach to  these groups. For example, we spoke to a representative at a private  health plan who confirmed receipt and use of AHRQ disseminated CER  materials. For federal health plans, AHRQ officials said that they worked  with the Office of Personnel Management, which manages the Federal  Employees Health Benefits Program, and this program encouraged  health plans to use an AHRQ report on the comparative effectiveness of  autism treatments when determining coverage decisions. AHRQ officials  noted that some health plans told them that CER information without a  corresponding cost analysis is insufficient in informing coverage   Without a defined plan for  decisions. Officials also told us that AHRQ found challenges translating  CER findings into clinical decision support applications; plans are  underway to determine next steps.", "Implementation plans for addressing the requirement to create a  publicly available database have not been documented. As of  November 2014, AHRQ officials also have not developed and  documented a specific implementation plan to create a publicly available  database for CER. GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government state that management should compare actual performance  to plans, and as previously noted, should document significant events.  The agency formerly acknowledged its plan to address the PPACA  requirement to build a publicly available database during our prior work in  2012,existing databases has not been documented and is in the process of  being fully vetted with senior leadership. Additionally, while AHRQ  officials told us that their instructions on how to search databases for CER  will be aimed at the general public, they have not yet determined how  effective these tactics will be to meet the needs of various user groups,  such as non-researchers who may be unfamiliar with research databases.  For example, officials have not determined if or how they may seek  feedback from potential users or test the instructions or search terms to  see if they meet potential users\u2019 needs. Additionally, AHRQ officials told  us they have not determined how to address potential limitations with this  new approach. Without taking steps to develop and document an  implementation approach that includes time frames and strategies to  address potential limitations and AHRQ\u2019s plans to assess whether its  tactics meet the needs of various users, the agency does not have  reasonable assurance that it will implement the PPACA requirement in a  timely or effective manner.   but AHRQ has since modified this plan, and the new plan to use  NIH\u2019s consultation role regarding AHRQ\u2019s dissemination efforts is  unclear. AHRQ is required by law to consult with NIH regarding  dissemination efforts, and agency officials told us they meet informally  with NIH staff. NIH officials concurred. AHRQ officials said that they have  had interactions with NIH on specific dissemination projects of interest to  specific NIH institutes or centers, such as the National Cancer Institute.  AHRQ and NIH have not determined what role NIH should take in the  dissemination process, or which NIH officials should be involved.  Previous GAO work has identified key practices that can help federal  agencies collaborate effectively when they work together to achieve  goals. This work highlighted, for example, the importance of agreeing on  roles and responsibilities and establishing compatible policies,  procedures, and other means to operate across organizational  boundaries. While coordination between the two entities has been  informal and limited to specific NIH institutes or centers at this time,  AHRQ officials told us that there is a designated AHRQ official that serves  as a liaison to NIH to work on this effort.

Standard  practices for project management call for agencies to conceptualize,  define, and document specific goals and objectives in the planning  process, along with the appropriate steps, milestones, time frames, and  resources needed to achieve those results.", "Although the updated February 2014 strategic framework for the road  map highlighted a purpose\u2014to identify a set of investment opportunities  for developing CER data infrastructure to build CER data capacity\u2014and  included guiding principles and objectives, it did not clearly define those  objectives, nor did it include other elements such as milestones or time  frames that would help allow for monitoring and reporting on progress.  Specifically, ASPE identified several guiding principles, such as ensuring  that data infrastructure projects are \u201cnon-duplicative of other related  federal and non-federal investments\u201d and \u201cachieve synergy with PCORI  and AHRQ.\u201d It also included priority objectives, such as further enabling  the collection of standardized clinical data, but many of the objectives  were broad and not clearly defined\u2014and did not specify milestones or  time frames\u2014as would be consistent with effective project management.", "Although ASPE identified and considered related, ongoing federal and  non-federal data infrastructure investments in an attempt to identify needs  or gaps, opportunities where contributions could be made, and ways to  avoid duplication, its strategic road map was unclear on the timing and  level of coordination necessary for its investments to work together with  existing projects\u2014such as PCORI\u2019s PCORnet initiative\u2014to improve data  capacity. For example, ASPE officials were not clear on how precisely the  standards for common data elements resulting from the ONC Standard  Data Capture initiative could be incorporated into PCORnet or other  existing publicly funded data networks, although ASPE does plan to make  them available for use, and officials told us that they will work with other  HHS agencies and PCORI to determine adoption strategies.  Furthermore, the ONC Standard Data Capture initiative is not expected to  be completed until 2016, which occurs after PCORI\u2019s common data  model for the PCORnet initiative is expected to be used for conducting  research, beginning in September 2015. Having more clearly defined  objectives and establishing milestones and time frames can also help  ASPE assess how it expects the results of its CER investments to build  data capacity, and how they will be coordinated in a timeline with many  other entities\u2019 existing and planned efforts. Moreover, this information can  help ASPE officials understand the extent to which their efforts are not  duplicative and align with other federal efforts.", "ASPE officials told us that as of October 2014, they are planning to award  a contract for developing an evaluation framework that will be used to  assess the effectiveness of their CER data infrastructure projects. They  also told us that they monitor and assess the 10 individual projects by  collecting quarterly reports and assessing progress against the  statements of work that were developed for each project. However, it is  unclear from ASPE\u2019s strategic road map whether these efforts will be  sufficiently timely and coordinated with other federal and non-federal  efforts to result in improvements to CER data capacity."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Comparative clinical effectiveness research can give health care  providers information to help decide which treatments may be most  beneficial for a given patient, and it also can inform decisions by patients  and caregivers. However, this information is often incomplete or  unavailable. While HHS has multiple, ongoing efforts to meet its  requirements under PPACA related to CER, it has not determined how it  will fully address some of these requirements, particularly those related to  dissemination and data capacity building.", "Disseminating CER in a timely manner is particularly challenging given  the length of time and uncertainty inherent in applying research findings  to help improve health care practice. AHRQ, for instance, has taken steps  to disseminate CER and documented these processes, including time  frames for some, but not all, of its key dissemination activities. Such time  frames may become especially important due to the large volume of CER  research expected from PCORI in the near future, which will increase  AHRQ\u2019s dissemination responsibilities, and the need to maximize the  investment of PCORTF appropriations made through fiscal year 2019.  Additionally, effective dissemination of research findings involves multiple  stakeholders, some of which are specified in PPACA. Without clear plans  to target each of these stakeholder groups, including federal and private  health plans and vendors of health information technology focused on  clinical decision support, it is unclear whether pertinent CER findings are  being directed to key targeted stakeholders identified in PPACA and  presented in a meaningful way to those groups. Other aspects of AHRQ\u2019s  dissemination process, such as its plans for a publicly available database  of CER\u2014including whether AHRQ\u2019s instructions and CER search terms  will be effective to meet the needs of various potential users in the  general public\u2014and its collaboration with NIH on dissemination activities,  have not been fully defined.", "HHS\u2019s plan to build data capacity involves identifying projects that would  enhance existing data resources for CER. While HHS has a strategic  road map with information on projects that it is funding to build the  capacity for CER data, the road map does not include key elements, such  as clearly defined objectives, milestones, and time frames needed to  assess the agency\u2019s progress toward the goal of building data capacity  for CER, as would be consistent with practices for effective project  management. Without defining these key elements, for example, it is  unclear to what extent ASPE\u2019s projects will build on or contribute to other  similar federal or non-federal activities, rather than being duplicative.  ASPE officials, for instance, could use more defined objectives and time  frames to help them better assess the extent to which the CER projects  they choose to fund will be useful and timely for other relevant federal and  non-federal work, such as PCORI\u2019s PCORnet initiative."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that HHS fully addresses its dissemination requirements  under PPACA, we recommend that the Secretary of Health and Human  Services direct AHRQ to take the following four actions:  1.  identify and document time frames for the implementation and  distribution of marketing plans and informational tools;  2.  expand dissemination efforts to federal and private health plans and  vendors of health information technology focused on clinical decision  support;  3.  document and complete plans to develop a publicly available  database, including plans to meet the needs of various potential users  in the general public; and  4.  develop specific plans on how it will collaborate with NIH on its  dissemination activities.", "In addition, to ensure that HHS fully addresses the PPACA requirements  to build data capacity for CER, the Secretary should direct ASPE to  include clearly defined objectives, milestones, and time frames, or other  indicators of performance, in its strategic road map that is used to identify  its PCORTF projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS, and HHS provided written  comments, which are reprinted in appendix III.
