According to FTC, mailed material would generally be considered deceptive if the material included a representation or practice or if the material omitted information that caused a consumer to be misled and eventually suffer some loss or injury, despite the fact that the consumer behaved reasonably under the circumstances.", "Both FTC and the Postal Inspection Service identified various types of mailed material that have been used to induce consumers to remit money, pay upfront fees, or purchase goods or services through deceptive means. However, in many cases, the promised goods or services were not delivered or were not of the quality that consumers may have reasonably expected to receive.  Some examples included lotteries from foreign countries or from states that did not have authorized lotteries. chain letters that required consumers to remit payments to participants in the chain letter scheme for which substantial financial returns were promised but never delivered. mailed material that involved various types of consumer credit schemes, such as loans, credit repair offers, and credit card solicitations, for which advance fees were required. requests for charitable donations from organizations that were not legitimate charities. mailed material that looks as if it has been distributed or endorsed by a government agency, also referred to as government look-alike mail.", "In some instances, mailed material may be illegal in that it violates specific postal or other statutes.  For example, chain letters that request money or other items of value and promise a substantial return to the participants are generally illegal.  Such letters are considered a form of gambling and sending them through the mail violates section 1302 of Title 18 of the U.S.Code, the Postal Lottery Statute.", "To obtain updated information about the extent and nature of consumers\u2019 problems with deceptive mail, as well as consumer education efforts, we attempted to contact the 17 federal, state, and local agencies and nongovernmental organizations that we contacted for our September 1998 testimony.  In our earlier work, we identified these agencies and organizations as those which had been involved in dealing with consumers\u2019 complaints about questionable or deceptive mail marketing practices involving mailed sweepstakes material and cashier\u2019s check look-alikes. The 17 agencies and organizations included 2 federal agencies\u2014FTC and the Postal Inspection Service\u2014as well as other state and local government agencies and nongovernmental organizations such as state attorneys general offices for such states as Florida and West Virginia; local government offices that handled consumer protection issues; and various nongovernmental organizations including (1) American Association of Retired Persons; (2) National Consumers League, which established National Fraud Information Center; and (3) Direct Marketing Association.", "Based on our most recent work efforts, we obtained information from 12 of the 17 agencies and organizations, which are listed in attachment II to this statement.  At the 12 agencies and organizations, we interviewed officials and reviewed documents to obtain available information about the extent and nature of consumers\u2019 deceptive mail problems and consumer education efforts.  Also, we obtained and analyzed consumer complaint data from FTC and Postal Inspection Service databases.  In addition, during the course of our work, we obtained from FTC, the Postal Inspection Service, and 45 state attorneys general offices information on specific law enforcement actions involving organizations, companies, and individuals that attempted to defraud consumers through the use of deceptive mail.", "To obtain information about the consumer complaint process at the Postal Service, we interviewed postal headquarters officials in the Postal Inspection Service and the Postal Service\u2019s Office of Consumer Advocate. Also, we interviewed postal officials at various field locations in different parts of the country who were knowledgeable about the consumer complaint process.  Specifically, we spoke with consumer affairs and marketing officials in postal district offices and inspectors in Postal Inspection Service offices located in the metropolitan areas of Dallas, Texas; Los Angeles, California; and Washington, DC. In addition, to obtain insight into how the consumer complaint process was implemented, we visited 15 postal field facilities, including post offices and stations, that were located in the metropolitan areas of Dallas, Texas; Los Angeles, California; and Washington, DC.  These locations were selected mainly because staff from our Dallas Regional Office, as well as headquarters staff, were available to conduct face-to-face meetings with appropriate postal field employees.", "In addition, we had an outside contractor conduct a survey to obtain opinions from the U.S. adult population about specific types of deceptive mail.

Once a household was reached, one adult was selected at random using a computerized procedure based on the birthdays of household members.  The survey was conducted over a 5-day period, including both weekdays and weekends, and up to four attempts were made to reach each telephone number.", "To ensure that survey results could be generalized to the adult population 18 years of age and older in the continental United States, results from the survey were adjusted by ICR to account for selection probabilities and to match the characteristics of all adults in the general public according to such demographic groups as age, gender, region, and education.  Because we surveyed a random sample of the population, the results of the survey have a measurable precision or sampling error.  The sample error is stated at a certain confidence level.  The overall results of our survey question regarding the public\u2019s opinion about misleading or deceptive mail are surrounded by 95 percent confidence levels of plus or minus 4 percentage points or less.", "The practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce nonsampling errors.  As in any survey, differences in the wording of questions, in the sources of information available to respondents, or in the types of people who do not respond can lead to somewhat different results.  We took steps to minimize nonsampling errors.  For example, we developed our survey question with the aid of a survey specialist and pretested the question prior to submitting it to ICR.", "We did our work from November 1998 through July 1999, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
