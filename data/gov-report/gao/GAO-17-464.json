GSA identified 35 lessons learned from previous telecommunications contract transitions that identify actions that agencies should take. In transition guidance released to agencies, GSA fully addressed 17 of the 35 lessons. Two lessons from previous transitions were not appropriate for the current transition. GSA partially addressed an additional nine lessons. Seven lessons were not addressed at all (see figure). For example, GSA's guidance did not address the previous lesson that agencies should not assume that a transition to a new contract with the same vendor will be easier than a change in vendors. By not including all lessons learned in its plans and guidance to agencies, GSA limits agencies' ability to plan for actions that will need to be taken later in the transition. As a result, agencies face an increased risk that they could repeat prior mistakes, including those that could result in schedule delays or unnecessary costs.", "Selected agencies\u2014the Departments of Agriculture (USDA), Labor (DOL), and Transportation (DOT); the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Social Security Administration (SSA)\u2014have yet to fully apply most of the five planning practices previously identified by GAO as key to a successful telecommunications transition. The practices encompass: (1) developing inventories, incorporating strategic needs into transition planning, (2) incorporating strategic needs into transition planning, (3) developing a structured transition-management approach, (4) identifying resources necessary for the transition, and (5) establishing transition processes and measures of success. SEC fully implemented one practice, partially implemented three practices, and did not implement another. The other four agencies partially implemented each of the five practices. Agencies provided various reasons for not following planning practices, including uncertainty due to delays in GSA awarding the new contracts, plans to implement practices later as part of established agency procedures for managing IT projects, and a lack of direction and contractor assistance from GSA.

We noted that the agencies were generally implementing the  practices, but three of them had not fully implemented some of the key  activities of the practices and were not planning to do so. For example,  one agency was using key project management processes in its transition  planning efforts, and five had plans to use them. Regarding identifying  human capital needs, two agencies had identified their resource needs,  and three had plans to identify them. Also, one of the agencies did not  plan to identify its human capital needs. We made recommendations to  those agencies that had not implemented key practice activities and did  not plan to do so, focused on addressing the gaps in transition planning.

The knowledge can be  used to plan the communication activities for the current project.", "GSA compiled lessons learned from previous telecommunications  transitions, including 35 lessons that described actions that agencies  should take during future transitions. Two of these lessons address  issues that are not appropriate for the current transition, leaving 33  lessons for agencies.", "GSA subsequently disseminated a number of these lessons learned to  agencies via various sources, including transition plans and guidance. For  example, to prepare for the current transition from Networx to EIS, GSA  developed plans, documents, presentations, and other transition-related  guidance sources in which it discussed lessons learned resulting from the  prior transitions.", "Table 1 describes the transition guidance for EIS that GSA provided to  agencies at two intervals: by December 2016, when GSA had initially  planned to issue the EIS contracts, and between January and April 2017,  to account for new guidance issued after contract awards were delayed.", "However, while the transition plans and guidance that GSA issued to  agencies included discussions of lessons learned, they did not do so  comprehensively or consistently. First, none of these sources addressed  all 33 of the agency-focused lessons that GSA had identified.

The EIS  Acquisition and Transition presentation to small agencies addressed 6 of  the 33 lessons. Second, even when GSA guidance addressed a previous  lesson, it did not always include all aspects of the lesson. Overall, when  GSA\u2019s guidance addressed a lesson, it more frequently addressed the  lesson partially rather than fully. For example, one lesson called for  agencies to recognize the possibility that they might change vendors and  to develop plans to mitigate the risks from such a change. However,  although one guidance source (the 2012 Lessons-Learned report) told  agencies to plan for a change in vendors, it did not specify that they plan  to mitigate associated risks. In addition, another lesson stressed that the  coordination of service disconnects and activations by different vendors  was essential. One guidance source (GSA White Paper: NS2020  Transition Strategy) discussed the need for coordinated disconnects, but  did not discuss activations by different vendors. Figure 2 lists the number  of lessons that were fully, partially, or not addressed within each of GSA\u2019s  various transition guidance documents.", "When the information provided in GSA\u2019s guidance is considered  collectively, significant gaps in communicating previous lessons learned  are evident.

However, we do not agree with many of GSA\u2019s assessments of  the lessons that were not addressed. For example, one lesson that GSA  said was not applicable in December 2016 addressed being prepared for  the possibility that the agency\u2019s current vendor will not be chosen for the  new contract. Because the EIS contracts had not been awarded, this was  still a possibility which agencies should consider. Another lesson that was  not addressed is the need to allow service changes during the  transition\u2014an issue we maintain is still relevant due to the length of time  needed to complete a transition.", "In addition, one lesson that GSA said was more appropriate for later in  the transition states that agency contracting officers should meet with  GSA contracting officers for advice.

Finally, they should align the identified needs  and opportunities with the agency\u2019s mission, long-term IT plans, and  enterprise architecture plans  Two of the selected agencies (SSA and USDA) had partially addressed  the first activity, related to determining future telecommunications needs.  Specifically, SSA documented future requirements based on interviews  with stakeholders. However, SSA did not document that it based the  identified needs on its existing inventory. In addition, USDA created a  preliminary set of future telecommunications needs. However, these  needs had not been finalized. According to officials responsible for  USDA\u2019s transition, finalization is expected in October 2017, which will  allow time for USDA components and vendors to provide feedback that  will be integrated into the preliminary set of future telecommunications  needs. The remaining three agencies (DOL, DOT, and SEC) had not  begun to identify future needs based on their current inventories.", "With regard to the second activity of the practice, two agencies (DOL and  SSA) had completed efforts to identify areas for the optimization and  sharing of telecommunications and IT resources. In addition, one agency  had partially implemented this activity. Specifically, USDA had identified  options for optimization, but as of July 2017, it was still working with its  components and vendors to evaluate the options. According to agency  officials, they expect to reach a decision on options in October 2017, but  this schedule is not documented.", "With regard to the two other agencies, DOT\u2019s future plans were unclear  because it was awaiting IT investment management approval. Further,  officials with SEC stated that the commission would address this practice  later in 2017. None of these agencies had documented plans or  timeframes for completing this activity.", "Consistent with the third activity of this practice, USDA had evaluated the  costs and benefits of new technology and alternative options for meeting  its telecommunications needs. SSA had partially addressed this activity in  that it had begun to evaluate the cost and benefits of upgrading agency  bandwidth, but had not yet evaluated costs and benefits for introducing  other new technology and alternatives for meeting the agency\u2019s  telecommunications needs. SSA officials said they planned to conduct  such an analysis at a later time but had not documented plans to do so.  The other three agencies had not yet addressed this activity.", "Finally, in addressing the fourth activity, three of the five agencies had  begun to determine whether their needs and opportunities were aligned  with their mission, long-term IT plans, and enterprise architecture plans,  although they had not yet completed these activities. Specifically, DOT  had demonstrated that its identified needs and opportunities aligned with  its mission. However, it did not demonstrate a similar alignment with its  long-term IT plans and enterprise architecture plans. In addition, SSA had  begun to align identified transition needs and opportunities with the  agency mission and long-term IT plans. However, it had not fully identified  its transition needs or evaluated those needs against its enterprise  architecture. SSA also had determined that its identified  telecommunications needs aligned with its long-term plans, as they  related to two ongoing modernization projects. However, the agency did  not show that the needs aligned with its enterprise architecture. USDA  also had aligned identified needs with its mission and enterprise  architecture plans. However, the agency had not aligned identified needs  and opportunities with its long-term IT plans. The remaining two agencies,  DOL and SEC, had not yet implemented this practice.", "Table 3 summarizes the extent to which the five agencies performed a  strategic analysis of their telecommunications requirements. \u25cf Practice activity has been fully implemented.  \u25d2 Agency has partially implemented practice activity.  \u25cb Agency has not implemented practice activity.", "Three of the agencies attributed their limited progress on this practice to  their use of established agency IT management processes and their  related time frames. DOL transition officials (who are within the  department\u2019s OCIO) stated that they had begun to manage the transition  within the agency\u2019s systems development life cycle process, but it was  too early for most planning activities to be completed. DOT officials stated  that their agency was conducting a network assessment, causing a delay  in fulfilling this planning practice. The officials also said that their agency\u2019s  specific management plans had not been finalized because the agency  intended to manage the transition as a project within its IT investment  management process; however, they had not yet gotten approval to do  so. Further, officials from SEC\u2019s OCIO stated that they were following  internal agency best practices for managing a project and adherence to  the systems development life cycle.", "Additionally, officials at three agencies described plans to address this  practice at a later time. DOL officials stated that they planned to issue a  request for information to ask vendors what new technologies are  available to meet the Department\u2019s needs and to suggest changes to the  existing telecommunications infrastructure. When we discussed this issue  in December 2016, SEC officials stated that some actions could not be  completed until GSA awards the EIS contract because they do not yet  know what services will be available or their prices. In addition, SSA\u2019s  telecommunications management division director stated that several  activities were initially delayed due to GSA not providing promised  contractor assistance, which required the agency to obtain assistance on  its own. However, the director added that SSA\u2019s transition is now on  schedule, and it has begun addressing this practice using contractor  support.", "While the selected agencies\u2019 established IT management processes can  contribute to the fulfillment of the practice related to identifying strategic  needs, the limited time available for the transition leaves agencies with a  short window in which to make such determinations. As a result of the  delays in identifying their needs, agencies will have less time to  implement the resulting changes while meeting the deadlines for  transitioning off of the Networx contracts.", "Also, agencies that do not fully assess the costs and benefits of  alternatives for meeting their telecommunications needs may not be  taking full advantage of the transition as an opportunity to optimize their  telecommunications services. Further, agencies that do not identify areas  for optimization and sharing miss opportunities to upgrade their  telecommunications services, or to shift service to more cost-effective  technology. If agencies do not incorporate strategic requirements into  their planning, they risk making decisions that are not aligned with their  long-term goals. Without aligning needs and opportunities with missions  and plans, agencies risk missing opportunities to use the new contract to  address their highest priorities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Agencies Have at Least Partially Developed a Structured Transition Management Approach", "paragraphs": ["To accomplish Practice 3\u2014establishing a structured transition  management approach\u2014 the previously identified transition planning  practices state that agencies should complete three activities.

Transition plans written by the  agencies identified management teams and stakeholders responsible for  their transitions. However, of the five agencies, only SSA had defined all  of the roles and responsibilities identified in the practice. For example,  DOT and SEC defined roles for project and information security  management and contract expertise, but did not define roles for asset and  human-capital management and legal expertise. DOL and USDA defined  roles for project management and contract expertise, but did not define  roles for asset, human capital, and information security management, and  legal expertise.", "The selected agencies generally had made more limited progress on the  second activity of Practice 3, regarding communicating their transition  plans. SSA had implemented this practice, while three other agencies had  not yet done so. One other agency, SEC, had partially implemented the  practice.

However, the plan did not address  other key aspects of this practice, including identifying key local and  regional transition officials and points of contact responsible for  disseminating information to employees and working with the vendor to  facilitate transition activities.", "Four of the five agencies had begun using the types of management  processes described in the third activity in Practice 3. Specifically, DOT,  SEC, SSA, and USDA had demonstrated the use of established project  management processes for their transitions, which included the use of  schedules, task lists, and risk assessments. However, none of these  agencies demonstrated that configuration or change management  processes, which reduce the risks associated with technical and  operational changes, were being applied to the transition. Further, the fifth  agency, DOL, had not addressed this practice.", "Table 4 summarizes the extent to which the five selected agencies had  established a structured transition management approach.", "The agencies cited several reasons for not fully implementing the  practice. Regarding the establishment of a management team with  defined roles, DOT officials stated that some stakeholders were not  involved in the early stages of the transition because the department  typically does not involve all stakeholders until later in the project  management life cycle. The officials also said that development of a  communications plan and implementation of change and configuration  management would be completed at a later time. However, DOT had not  documented a plan or schedule for doing so.", "SEC officials stated that the agency had legal and human capital  expertise on the project; however, because SEC is a small agency,  individuals cannot always be dedicated to a project. The officials also  stated that the agency intended to handle communications through its  established practice of weekly calls between IT staff and regional  managers, although this process had not been documented. Additionally,  the officials stated that formal change and configuration management  practices apply to all of the agency\u2019s IT projects, but did not demonstrate  that those practices applied to its telecommunications transition.", "For SSA, the telecommunications management division director stated  that, the EIS transition is part of a modernization effort that is subject to  agency requirements to use established change and configuration  management processes. As a result such practices will also be used in  the transition. However, SSA did not document this approach.", "In addition, DOL officials stated that once an integrated project team has  been formed, the transition effort is expected to proceed through the  traditional systems development life cycle, which will address the practice  activities related to project and change management. Similarly, USDA  officials stated that the department plans to assign human capital  resources later in the management process. Both departments\u2019 officials  also described plans to use configuration and change management  processes during the transition to EIS, but those plans were not  documented. These officials did not identify specific dates by which their  planned actions are expected to be completed.", "Agencies that do not use a sound management approach risk additional  financial costs, extended timelines, and disruptions to the continuity of  their telecommunications systems. Further, without establishing lines of  communication and identifying local and regional points of contact,  agencies may lack the quality of information that is necessary for  comprehensive understanding, accountability, and shared expectations  among all those with transition responsibilities. Finally, by not defining key  roles and responsibilities for the transition, the agencies risk extending  their transition period as they attempt to assign appropriate personnel and  update them on transition progress and issues.

Next,  agencies should identify the organizational need for investments and  assess benefits versus costs to justify any resource requests. Agencies  should also determine staffing levels that may be required throughout the  transition effort, as well as ensure that personnel with the right skills are in  place to support the transition effort. Skills needed for this activity are  project management, asset management, contract and legal expertise,  human capital management, and information security expertise. Finally,  agencies should require training for those carrying out the transition or  operating and maintaining newly transitioned technology.", "One selected agency (USDA) fully implemented the first activity in  Practice 4, having identified the level of funding needed to support its  transition planning. Three other agencies (DOT, DOL, and SSA) identified  funding for part of the transition effort but did not identify funding to  support other parts of the effort. Specifically, DOT developed a rough  estimate for transition planning support, but this estimate had not been  approved and it did not account for funds used for planning efforts  completed prior to fiscal year 2017. Further, cost projections that DOL  and SSA developed did not account for all years of transition support and  the agencies did not provide evidence that the costs accounted for the  transition management team. The fifth agency (SEC) had not identified its  funding needs for the transition.", "For the second activity of Practice 4, DOL demonstrated that it had  identified the funding needed for transition project management, but not  for software and hardware upgrades, the establishment of a reliable  inventory, or the costs and benefits to justify any resource requests. In  addition, SSA and USDA identified the need for transition resources,  including staffing, but did not document cost-benefit justifications for those  resources. The remaining two agencies (DOT and SEC) had not  implemented this activity.", "Three agencies also had partially implemented the third activity of the  practice.

DOT and SEC had not addressed this  practice.", "With regard to the fourth activity of the practice, four agencies (DOL,  DOT, SEC, and USDA) demonstrated that their agencies had provided  training to transition support staff. However, none of these agencies  showed that they had conducted an analysis to identify all of the training  needed for the transition, including training on new equipment or services.  The fifth agency (SSA) had not implemented this practice. Table 5  summarizes the extent to which the five agencies identified resources for  their transitions.", "Officials at the five agencies generally explained that they had not  developed specific resource estimates for their transition efforts because  they did not have an immediate need to do so. DOL officials explained  that, prior to fiscal year 2017, the department had not required additional  funding for the transition because it had leveraged resources from an  existing funded project. In addition, DOT officials stated that they had  conducted early transition planning using existing resources. SEC officials  stated that, based on past experience, the department did not require  additional funding or resources to support the transition because it was  considered to be a part of ongoing support funding from its operations  and maintenance budget. SEC officials added that, if something in the  new contracts required a change in current SEC telecommunications  services, they would follow the existing agency process for requesting  supplemental funding.", "In addition, when we discussed these topics July 2017, officials at two  agencies generally expressed uncertainty about the scope of the  transition because they do not know what services would be available  under the new contracts. Once the contracts are awarded, according to  the officials, they expected to be better positioned to plan for needed  resources. SEC officials also said that they planned to take advantage of  transition-related training from GSA when it becomes available. Further,  SSA\u2019s telecommunications management division director said that the  agency plans staffing annually and relies on current year resource usage  to plan staffing needs for future years. The director added that, if  additional staffing or other resources are needed, the request would be  justified to the agency\u2019s oversight board. In addition, the director believed,  based on prior experience, that SSA\u2019s staff are adequately trained, but  did not have any documented analysis to support this assertion.", "While it may be premature to estimate all transition-related resource  needs, agencies that do not take steps to analyze their needs may be  underestimating the complexity and demands of the transition effort.  Additionally, without determining staffing needs for their transition efforts,  agencies risk experiencing gaps in staffing, which may lead to delays and  unexpected costs.

However, we  reviewed the planning documents and did not find any specific  discussions of continuity of operations or critical systems, which are  essential to assuring that the transition does not have a negative  impact on the agency\u2019s ability to complete its mission. We, therefore,  believe that the recommendation is appropriate and disagree with  SSA\u2019s position.", "SSA disagreed with our remaining two recommendations. Specifically,  it disagreed with the recommendation to implement  telecommunications inventory practices. SSA indicated that its  inventory was complete and that the inventory described its process  for maintaining services procured through GSA\u2019s contracts. However,  we reviewed the information SSA provided and concluded that it did  not include complete information on the sites where each service was  provided, limiting the agency\u2019s ability to plan for transition tasks  requiring the physical presence of staff. Further, while the agency had  procedures to update inventory information on local and long distance  services, it did not have similar procedures to update information on  other services ordered from the GSA contracts, such as wireless  (cellular), satellite, fixed data, and collaboration services. We,  therefore, continue to believe that it is important for SSA to complete  these steps.", "Additionally, SSA disagreed with our recommendation to identify legal  expertise and utilize a structured transition management approach.  The agency indicated that it had previously identified legal expertise in  its transition plan. Although legal expertise was not discussed in the  plan that the agency initially provided for our review, SSA provided an  updated plan subsequent to its comments that included this  information. Thus, we revised our report to reflect that the agency had  completed this activity. We also deleted the reference to this activity in  our recommendation.", "Further, in commenting on the second activity discussed in this  recommendation, SSA stated that the telecommunications transition  was part of a broader modernization effort which was subject to  agency guidance that includes the use of configuration and change  management. However, the agency did not provide evidence to  substantiate this position. As a result, we stand by this aspect of our  recommendation. SSA\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix VI.", "In e-mail comments, USDA\u2019s Senior Advisor stated that the  Department agreed with our five recommendations.", "In e-mail comments, an official in DOT\u2019s Office of the Secretary stated  that the Department concurred with our five recommendations.", "Finally, we received technical comments from GSA and USDA, which we  incorporated, as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Administrator of GSA, Chairman of the SEC,  Commissioner of SSA, Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary of Labor,  Secretary of Transportation and other interested parties.

Second,  we identified (with input from GSA) those lessons learned that were  specific to agencies. Third, we reviewed transition plans, guidance, and  other EIS documentation developed by GSA, including presentations,  meeting minutes, and projected timelines provided to agencies. Fourth,  we evaluated each of the planning and guidance sources that GSA  disseminated to agencies to evaluate how completely the lessons learned  were addressed in the guidance. We did this by comparing the key  concepts identified in each lesson learned to the concepts described in  the guidance.", "Based on our assessment, we classified the status of a lesson learned as  \u201cfully addressed\u201d if the lesson learned appeared in at least one planning  and guidance source or if all of the concepts described in a practice were  found collectively in multiple guidance sources; \u201cpartially addressed,\u201d if  part of the lesson learned appeared in at least one document; or \u201cnot  addressed,\u201d if the lesson learned did not appear in any of the planning  and guidance sources.", "To determine the extent to which federal agencies are following  established transition planning practices, we selected five agencies for  review. Using Networx billing data provided by GSA, we identified total  charges for each service and each of 96 agencies for fiscal year 2015.  We first identified the four services with the most fiscal year 2015  spending. We then selected agencies representing a variety of (1) agency  sizes (two large agencies, two medium agencies, and a small agency);  (2) varying agency structures (e.g., two agencies with components vs.  three agencies without); and (3) agency charges for the four most  commonly identified services: Voice Services, Toll Free Service, Private  Line Services, and Combined (Local and Long Distance) at $20 million  dollars for two large agencies, $3 million dollars for two medium agencies,  and $557 thousand for a single small agency. The resulting five  departments and agencies\u2019 selected for review were the U.S. Department  of Agriculture; U.S. Social Security Administration; Department of  Transportation; Department of Labor; and U.S. Securities and Exchange  Commission.", "Because we did not review a statistically representative sample of federal  agencies, we cannot conclude that our results represent the entire federal  government\u2019s level of preparation. However, the five cases studied  illustrate various challenges that these agencies have faced in planning  for the transition to EIS.", "To determine the extent to which the selected agencies have made  adequate preparations for their upcoming transitions, we obtained and  reviewed agency documentation, including strategic plans,  telecommunications inventories, and transition-related documentation,  and interviewed agency officials. We then assessed this information  against each of the activities within the five transition planning practices  identified in our prior report on agency transition planning. Based on our  assessment, we classified the status of agency transition planning efforts  to address each sound planning practice activity as \u201cfully implemented,\u201d if  the agency had fully implemented the practice activity or \u201cnot  implemented,\u201d if the agency did not demonstrate that it had taken any  actions consistent with the activity. We assigned a status of \u201cpartially  implemented\u201d if the agency had taken some, but not all of the actions  included in an activity; had begun the processes to fully implement the  activity; or had approved plans to fully implement the activity at a later  time.", "As part of our review of agency efforts to establish telecommunications  inventories, we gathered copies of the inventories and assessed their  reliability. Specifically, we asked agencies for documentation of their  quality control procedures and practices related to ensuring their  accuracy. Additionally, we also interviewed knowledgeable agency  officials about the systems and processes in place to collect and verify  the data. We determined that the inventory information provided by the  Securities and Exchange Commission was sufficient for our purposes, but  the information provided by the other agencies was not due to the lack of  documented procedures to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the  data. This conclusion was considered during our assessment of their  efforts to apply the planning practice related to inventories.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2016 through August  2017, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
