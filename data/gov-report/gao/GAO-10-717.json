The services did not have life-cycle O&S cost estimates developed at the production milestone for five of the seven aviation systems GAO reviewed, and current DOD acquisition and cost-estimating guidance does not specifically address retaining these estimates. Also, the services' information systems designated for collecting data on actual O&S costs were incomplete, with the Army's system having the greatest limitations on available cost data. without historic cost estimates and complete data on actual O&S costs, DOD officials do not have important information necessary for analyzing the rate of O&S cost growth for major systems, identifying cost drivers, and developing plans for managing and controlling these costs. At a time when the nation faces fiscal challenges, and defense budgets may become tighter, the lack of this key information hinders sound weapon system program management and decision making in an area of high costs to the federal government. DOD generally does not use updated life-cycle O&S cost estimates to quantify cost growth and identify cost drivers for the systems GAO reviewed. The services did not periodically update life-cycle O&S cost estimates after production was completed for six of the seven systems. The F-22A program office had developed an updated life-cycle O&S cost estimate in 2009 and found a 47-percent ($19 billion) increase in life-cycle O&S costs from what had been previously estimated in 2005. GAO's comparisons of estimated to actual O&S costs for two of the seven systems found some areas of cost growth. However, notable changes such as decreases in the numbers of aircraft and flying hours occurred in both programs after the production milestone estimates were developed, complicating direct comparisons of estimated to actual costs. According to federal guidance, agencies should have a plan to periodically evaluate program results as these may be used to determine whether corrections need to be made and to improve future cost estimates. However, DOD acquisition and cost estimation guidance does not require that O&S cost estimates be updated throughout a system's life cycle or that information on program changes affecting the system's life-cycle O&S costs be retained. The services' acquisition and cost-estimation guidance that GAO reviewed does not consistently and clearly require the updating of O&S cost estimates after a program has ended production. DOD has several departmentwide and service-specific initiatives to address O&S costs of major systems. One DOD program funds projects aimed at improving reliability and reducing O&S costs for existing systems. Other initiatives are aimed at focusing attention on O&S cost requirements and reliability during the acquisition process. In a recent assessment, DOD identified weaknesses in O&S cost management, found deficiencies in sustainment governance, and recommended a number of corrective actions. Many of DOD's initiatives are recent or are not yet implemented."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD take steps to retain life-cycle O&S cost estimates for major systems, collect additional O&S cost elements in its visibility systems, update life-cycle O&S cost estimates periodically after systems are fielded, and retain documentation of program changes affecting O&S costs for use in cost analysis. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) spends billions of dollars each year to  sustain its weapon systems. These operating and support (O&S) costs can  account for a significant portion of a weapon system\u2019s total life-cycle costs  and include costs for, among other things, repair parts, maintenance, and  contract services, as well as the personnel associated with a weapon  system. Weapon systems are costly to sustain in part because they often  incorporate a technologically complex array of subsystems and  components and need expensive spare parts and logistics support to meet  required readiness levels. In addition, the high tempo of military  operations in Iraq and Afghanistan has increased wear and tear on many  weapon systems, escalating their O&S costs well beyond peacetime levels.  Many of the key decisions affecting a weapon system\u2019s O&S costs are  made while the system is still in the acquisition process. For example,  acquisition-based decisions about the design, materials, and technology  for the system affect the logistics support that is eventually needed to keep  the system available and ready after it is fielded. Controlling O&S costs is  critical to ensure future affordability of defense budgets. Life-cycle O&S  costs for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the newest aircraft being acquired  for the Air Force, Navy, and Marines, are now estimated at about $916  billion and its operating costs per hour are expected to exceed the legacy  aircraft it is replacing.", "To improve DOD\u2019s organization and procedures for acquiring weapon  systems, Congress passed the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of  2009 (\u201cthe Act\u201d). The Act contains provisions regarding improving the  accuracy of cost estimates for major defense acquisition programs. The  Act also directs GAO to review the growth in O&S costs of major weapon  systems and to provide the results of this review not later than 1 year after  the date the legislation is enacted. We provided the preliminary results of  our review to the congressional defense committees in May 2010. This  report provides the final results of our review and addresses (1) the extent  to which life-cycle O&S cost estimates developed during acquisition and  actual O&S costs are available for major weapon system program  management and decision making; (2) the extent to which DOD uses life- cycle O&S cost estimates for major weapon systems after they are fielded  to quantify cost growth and identify its causes; and (3) the efforts taken by  DOD to reduce O&S costs for major weapon systems.", "The Act also requires us to review weaknesses in operations affecting the  reliability of financial information on the systems and assets to be  acquired under major defense acquisition programs. We are issuing a  separate report in response to that provision of the Act. Furthermore, the  Act directs the DOD Director of Cost Assessment and Program  Evaluation, within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), to review  existing DOD systems and methods for tracking and assessing O&S costs  on major defense acquisition programs. In addition, we have conducted  prior work on weapon system O&S cost issues and made  recommendations for better managing and controlling costs. The Related  GAO Products section at the end of this report provides additional  information on our prior work.", "To conduct this review, we collected and analyzed data on seven major  aviation weapon systems: the Navy\u2019s F/A-18E/F; the Air Force\u2019s F-22A, B- 1B, and F-15E; and the Army\u2019s AH-64D, CH-47D, and UH-60L. We focused  on aviation systems to allow us to compare O&S cost growth, where  possible, across the selected systems. We selected systems that had  reached initial operating capability after 1980, incurred several years of  actual O&S costs, and had relatively large fleets. We also selected the  systems to reflect varied characteristics in terms of military service,  mission, support strategy, and aircraft age. We did not select weapon  systems with known limitations of available cost data. The results from  this nonprobability sample cannot be used to make inferences about all  aviation systems or major weapon systems because the sample may not  reflect all characteristics of the population. We obtained life-cycle O&S  cost estimates, where available, that the services had developed to support  the decision to proceed with production of the aircraft. We obtained data  on actual O&S costs from the services\u2019 Visibility and Management of  Operating and Support Costs (VAMOSC) systems, which are information  systems designated by DOD as the authoritative sources to provide  visibility over these historical data. In our analysis of O&S costs, we have  adjusted DOD data to reflect constant fiscal year 2010 dollars, unless  otherwise noted. We also interviewed and obtained pertinent documents,  including directives, instructions, regulations, memorandums, and  manuals, from acquisition, program management, cost analysis, and  logistics officials to understand how O&S costs were estimated, tracked,  managed, and controlled in accordance with applicable laws and policies;  and to identify factors that have led to cost growth.

Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives.

O&S costs include the direct and  indirect costs of sustaining a fielded system, such as costs for spare parts,  fuel, maintenance, personnel, support facilities, and training equipment.  According to DOD, the O&S costs incurred after a system has been  acquired account for at least 70 percent of a system\u2019s life-cycle costs and  depend on how long a system remains in the inventory. Many of the key  decisions affecting O&S costs are made during the acquisition process,  and a weapon system\u2019s O&S costs depend to a great extent on its expected  readiness level and overall reliability. In general, readiness can be  achieved either by building a highly reliable weapon system or supporting  it with a more extensive logistics system that can ensure spare parts and  other support are available when needed. If a weapon system has a very  high expected readiness rate but its design is not reliable, O&S costs may  be high and more difficult to predict.

As part of  the process, the DOD component or joint program office responsible for  the acquisition program is required to prepare life-cycle cost estimates,  which include O&S costs, to support these decision milestones and other  reviews. Under the current acquisition process, decision makers at  milestone A determine whether to approve a program to enter into  technology development. Although very little may be known about the  system design, performance, physical characteristics, or operational and  support concepts, DOD guidance states that rough O&S cost estimates are  expected to primarily support plans that guide refinement of the weapon  system concept. At milestone B, a decision is made whether to approve  the program to enter into engineering and manufacturing development. At  this point, according to the guidance, O&S cost estimates and comparisons  should show increased fidelity, consistent with more fully developed  design and support concepts. At this stage, O&S costs are important  because the long-term affordability of the program is assessed, program  alternatives are compared, and O&S cost objectives are established. The  program must pass through milestone C before entering production and  deployment. DOD\u2019s guidance states that at milestone C and at the full-rate  production decision review, O&S cost estimates should be updated and  refined, based on the system\u2019s current design characteristics, the latest  deployment schedule, and current logistics and training support plans.  Further, the guidance states that O&S experience obtained from system  test and evaluation should be used to verify progress in meeting  supportability goals or to identify problem areas. Lastly, O&S cost  objectives should be validated, and any O&S-associated funding issues  should be resolved, according to the guidance.", "OSD\u2019s Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office has established  guidance regarding life-cycle O&S cost estimates that are developed at  acquisition milestone reviews and has defined standards for preparing and  presenting these estimates.

This 2007 guidance\u2014which went into effect after the systems selected for  our review passed through the production milestone\u2014updated and refined  the guidance issued in May 1992. The cost element structure in the 2007  guidance is similar to that of the 1992 guidance, with some key differences.  For example, separate cost elements for intermediate-level and depot-level  maintenance under the 1992 structure were combined into one  maintenance cost element area in 2007. Cost elements for continuing  system improvements were included under sustaining support in 1992 but  separately identified in the 2007 structure. Also, cost elements for  contractor support are no longer separately identified as a single cost area  in the 2007 structure but are spread over other areas.

These systems were developed in  response to long-standing concerns that the services lacked sufficient data  on the actual costs of operating and supporting their weapon systems. For  example, according to a Naval Audit Service report, in 1975 the Deputy  Secretary of Defense directed the military departments to collect actual  O&S costs of defense weapon systems. In 1987, the Senate Committee on  Appropriations requested that each service establish a capability within 4  years to report accurate and verifiable O&S costs for major weapon  systems. In 1992, DOD required that the O&S costs incurred by each  defense program be maintained in a historical O&S data-collection system.

First, DOD used immature  technologies and components in designing its weapon systems, which  contributed to reliability problems and acted as a barrier to using  manufacturing techniques that typically help reduce a system\u2019s  maintenance costs. In contrast, commercial companies ensure they  understand their operating costs by analyzing data they have collected on  equipment they are currently using. Second, DOD\u2019s acquisition processes  did not consider O&S costs and readiness as key performance  requirements for new weapon systems and placed higher priority on  technical performance features. Further, DOD continued to place higher  priority on enhanced safety, readiness, or combat capability than on O&S  cost management after system fielding. Third, DOD\u2019s division of  responsibility among its requirements-setting, acquisition, and  maintenance communities made it difficult to control O&S costs, since no  one individual or office had responsibility and authority to manage all O&S  cost elements throughout a weapon system\u2019s life cycle. Fourth, the  services\u2019 VAMOSC systems for accumulating data to analyze operations  and support actions on fielded systems did not provide adequate or  reliable information, thus making it difficult for DOD to understand total  O&S costs.", "We have also reported on the effect of DOD weapon system sustainment  strategies on O&S costs. For example, we reported in 2008 that although  DOD expected that the use of performance-based logistics arrangements  would reduce O&S costs, it was unclear whether these arrangements were  meeting this goal. The services were not consistent in their use of business  case analyses to support decisions to enter into performance-based  logistics arrangements. Also, DOD program offices that implemented these  arrangements had not obtained detailed cost data from contractors and  could not provide evidence of cost reductions attributable to the use of a  performance-based logistics arrangement.

DOD officials  we interviewed noted that the department has not placed emphasis on  assessing and managing weapon system O&S costs compared with other  priorities. Moreover, our prior work has shown that rather than limit the  number and size of weapon system programs or adjust requirements,  DOD\u2019s funding process attempts to accommodate programs. This creates  an unhealthy competition for funds that encourages sponsors of weapon  system programs to pursue overambitious capabilities and to  underestimate costs.", "DOD acquisition guidance has required the development of life-cycle cost  estimates for acquisition milestone reviews since at least 1980. Based on  the historical acquisition milestones for the five systems with missing  estimates, the approximate dates that the production milestone life-cycle  O&S cost estimates should have been prepared were 1980 for the Army\u2019s  CH-47D, 1985 for the Air Force\u2019s F-15E, 1989 for the Army\u2019s UH-60L and  the Air Force\u2019s B-1B, and 1995 for the Army\u2019s AH-64D.

The two systems for which  cost estimates were available had the most recent production milestones  of the systems in our sample.", "Under GAO\u2019s guidance for cost-estimating best practices, issued in 2009,  thorough documentation and retention of cost estimates are essential in  order to analyze changes that can aid preparation of future cost  estimates. However, with the exception of the Army, current DOD and  service acquisition and cost estimation guidance do not specifically  address requirements for retaining O&S cost estimates and the support  documentation used to develop the estimates. For example, although  DOD\u2019s cost-estimation guidance emphasizes the need for formal, complete  documentation of source data, methods, and results, neither it nor DOD\u2019s  acquisition policy specifically addresses retention of cost estimate  documentation.", "Naval Air Systems Command officials said they retained the  production milestone O&S cost estimates for the F/A-18E/F because  this was a good practice; however, they were not aware of any Navy  guidance that required such retention. While the Navy\u2019s current  acquisition and cost analysis instructions state that records created  under the instructions should be retained in accordance with the  Navy\u2019s records management guidance, the records management  manual does not clearly identify any requirements for retaining  acquisition cost estimates for aircraft. In addition, we found that  although the estimate for the F/A-18E/F was retained, some of the  supporting documentation was incorrect or incomplete.", "The Air Force\u2019s acquisition and cost estimation guidance is also  unclear with regard to retention of cost estimates.

According to service officials, the F-22A, the F-15E, and the B-1B incurred  support equipment replacement and O&S modification costs, and the F- 22A incurred interim contractor support costs. Air Force officials  responsible for the VAMOSC system told us that actual cost data on these  three cost elements are contained in another information system, the Air  Force General Accounting and Finance System\u2013Reengineered, but the  data are not identifiable because procurement officials often do not apply  the established accounting and budgeting structure when they entered into  procurement contracts. Further, the Air Force lacks a standard structure  for capturing contractor logistics support costs that could provide  additional visibility over both procurement and O&S costs. For example,  although program officials said the F-22A was supported under interim  contractor support in 2006 and 2007, no F-22A interim support costs were  included in the VAMOSC system.", "Further, according to officials, a recent change in the way the Air Force  funds repair parts also introduced inaccuracies into that service\u2019s  VAMOSC system. Starting in fiscal year 2008, the Air Force centralized the  funding of its flying operations at higher-level commands that support a  number of aircraft and bases. For example, the Air Force Material  Command now funds flying operations for most active units. Prior to that  time, the Air Force provided funding for repair parts directly to lower-level  organizational units that paid for each part when ordered. Under the new  process, the higher-level commands provide funding for repair parts to the  Air Force Working Capital Fund based on the anticipated number of flying  hours and an estimated rate necessary to purchase repair parts per hour of  use. Since repair parts funding is now based on such estimates, there have  been differences between the amounts provided and the actual costs  incurred. For example, officials indicated that in fiscal year 2008  overpayments of $430 million were provided for repair parts, and in fiscal  year 2009 the overpayment amount was $188 million. Although the total  overpayment amount can be identified, the Air Force cannot identify  which specific programs overpaid, so the entire overpayment amount was  recorded against the B-1B\u2019s O&S costs in the Air Force accounting system.  VAMOSC system officials were aware of this inaccuracy and removed the  amount from the B-1B\u2019s O&S costs within the VAMOSC system. However,  because these officials said they do not have the information necessary to  apply the appropriate amount of the refund to the appropriate programs,  they placed the funds into an account not associated with a particular  weapon system.

Navy officials are  currently attempting to add direct civilian personnel costs from the Navy\u2019s  Standard Accounting and Reporting System. However, since it is difficult  to identify these costs by weapon system, aggregated civilian personnel  costs are currently captured within a separate section of the VAMOSC  system. In addition, Navy officials said indirect infrastructure costs are  captured in the aggregate within a separate section of the VAMOSC system  and are not reported within the O&S costs of each weapon system.

Also, many of the costs were allocated based on  demand, quantity, and price assumptions. That is, if more than one  weapon system used a repair part, the costs for this part were allocated to  each weapon system based on the number of aircraft. While this may be a  reasonable allocation method, the VAMOSC system may not reflect the  actual O&S costs for the weapon systems that used the part.", "We reported on deficiencies of the Army\u2019s VAMOSC system in 2000. Our  prior work found that the Army did not have complete and reliable data on  actual O&S costs of weapon systems. Specifically, the Army\u2019s VAMOSC  system did not collect data on O&S cost elements such as contractor  logistics support, supply depot support, and software support. Further, we  reported that the VAMOSC system did not contain cost data on individual  maintenance events, such as removal and assessment of failed parts. We  concluded that without complete O&S cost data, Army program managers  could not assess cost drivers and trends in order to identify cost-reduction  initiatives. Although we recommended that the Army improve its VAMOSC  system by collecting data on additional O&S cost elements, the Army has  not made significant improvements. According to Army officials  responsible for the VAMOSC system, it was designed to collect  information from other information systems. Therefore, it cannot collect  data on other cost elements unless another information system captures  these costs. According to Army officials, two information systems that the  Army is developing\u2014the General Fund Enterprise Business System and  the Global Combat Support System\u2014may enable the service to collect  additional O&S cost data in the future.", "Even with these planned information systems, it is unclear what additional  O&S cost data will be collected, how quickly the Army will be able to  incorporate the data into its VAMOSC system, what resources may be  needed, or what additional limitations the service may face in improving  its VAMOSC system. Army officials, for example, do not expect the  General Fund Enterprise Business System to become fully operational  until the end of fiscal year 2012, and full operation of the Global Combat  Support System will occur later, in fiscal year 2015. Army officials also  said while they have requested that additional O&S cost data be collected  by weapon system, it is too early to tell whether these data will be  collected."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "The Services Generally Do Not Use Updated Life-Cycle Estimates to Assess O&S Cost Growth for Fielded Weapon Systems", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Life-Cycle O&S Cost Estimates Were Not Periodically Updated after Fielding for Six of the Seven Systems Reviewed", "paragraphs": ["For six of the seven systems selected for our review, the services did not  periodically update life-cycle O&S cost estimates after the systems were  fielded, even though most of the systems have been in DOD\u2019s inventory for  over a decade.

According to Office of Management  and Budget guidance on benefit-cost analysis, agencies should have a  plan for periodic, results-oriented evaluation of the effectiveness of federal  programs. The guidance also notes that retrospective studies can be  valuable in determining if any corrections need to be made to existing  programs and to improve future estimates of other federal programs. In  addition, cost-estimating best practices call for such estimates to be  regularly updated. The purpose of updating the cost estimates is to  determine whether the preliminary information and assumptions remain  relevant and accurate, record reasons for variances so that the accuracy of  the estimate can be tracked, and archive cost and technical data for use in  future estimates. Despite the benefit-cost analysis guidance and cost- estimating best practices, service officials for six of the seven aviation  weapon systems we reviewed could not provide current, updated O&S  cost estimates that incorporated actual historical costs or analysis of  actual costs compared to the estimate prepared at the production  milestone.

When the F-22A program office  updated the 2005 cost estimate in 2009, it found a 47-percent increase in  life-cycle O&S costs. The 2009 estimate of about $59 billion to operate  and support the F-22A is $19 billion more than was estimated in 2005. The  increase in life-cycle O&S costs occurred despite a 34-percent reduction in  fleet size from 277 aircraft projected in the 2005 estimate to 184 aircraft  projected in the 2009 estimate. The program office also compared the two  estimates to identify areas of cost growth. According to the program  office, the projected O&S cost growth was due to rising aircraft repair  costs, unrealized savings from using a performance-based logistics  arrangement to support the aircraft, an increased number of maintenance  personnel needed to maintain the F-22A\u2019s specialized stealth exterior,  military pay raises that were greater than forecast, and personnel costs of  Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve units assigned to F-22A units  that were not included in the production milestone estimate.", "A 2007 independent review by the Air Force Cost Analysis Agency also  projected future O&S cost growth for the F-22A. According to Air Force  Cost Analysis Agency officials, the review was initiated because cost data  showed the F-22A\u2019s cost per flying hour was higher than projected in the  2007 President\u2019s Budget, prompting concerns that the future O&S costs of  the aircraft were underestimated. Specifically, the fiscal year 2007 actual  cost per flight hour was $55,783, about 65 percent higher than the $33,762  projected in the 2007 President\u2019s Budget. The Air Force Cost Analysis  Agency estimated that in 2015 (when the system would be fully mature),  the F-22A\u2019s projected cost per flight hour would be $48,236, or 113 percent  higher than the $22,665 cost per flight hour in 2015 that had been  estimated in 2005. The estimated cost per flight hour increased  $8,174 because fixed O&S costs did not decrease in proportion to the  reductions in the number of planned aircraft (277 to 183) and annual  flight hours per aircraft (366 to 277);  $4,005 because the formula used in the 2005 estimate to calculate the  cost to refurbish broken repair parts understated the potential costs;  $2,414 for engine depot maintenance costs due to higher-than- previously-projected engine cycles per flying hour;  $2,118 for higher costs for purchasing repair parts not in production or  with diminishing manufacturing sources;  $2,008 because of unrealized economies of scale for repair parts due to  smaller quantity purchases (based on reduced aircraft and flying  hours);  $1,670 for additional costs for munitions maintainers, training  munitions, and fuel consumption associated with a new capability\u2014an  air-to-ground mission; and  $1,641 for additional maintenance due to lower levels of weapon  system reliability than projected in the production milestone O&S cost  estimate.", "The remaining $3,542 cost per flight hour increase identified by the Air  Force Cost Analysis Agency\u2019s review was due to changes in personnel  requirements, a new requirement to remove and replace the stealth  coating mid-way through the aircraft\u2019s life, labor rate increases, immature  engine repair procedures, and the administrative cost of Air National  Guard units assigned to active duty units or active duty units assigned to  Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard units."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Changes over Time Complicate Comparisons of Estimated to Actual O&S Costs for Two Systems", "paragraphs": ["For the two aviation systems where both estimated and actual O&S cost  data were available, we found that although there were some areas of cost  growth, direct comparisons between estimated and actual costs were  complicated in part because of program changes that occurred after the  estimates were developed at the production milestone.

Although the F-22A has been supported under contractor logistics support  arrangements since before 2005, the estimates included the costs for  government-provided logistics support of the aircraft. For example, for  fiscal years 2005 through 2009, the O&S cost estimate projected that  contractor logistics support would cost $736 million. However, actual  contractor logistics support costs for the F-22A were $2.1 billion. For fiscal  years 2005 through 2009, F-22A contractor logistics support costs were 60  percent of the total actual O&S costs reported in the Air Force\u2019s VAMOSC  system. Due to the use of this support arrangement, however, the Air  Force\u2019s VAMOSC system reports all of the amounts paid to the F-22A  contractor under a single cost element instead of under multiple individual  cost elements. In contrast, program officials confirmed that various  contractor-provided cost elements\u2014such as repair parts, materials and  supplies, depot maintenance, and sustaining support\u2014were included in  the production milestone O&S cost estimate as separate items. Further,  according to officials, prior to 2008 the program office did not obtain from  the contractor cost reports that provide details of how the amounts paid to  the contractor were spent in terms of DOD\u2019s recommended O&S cost  elements by fiscal year. Therefore, it is not possible to compare a  significant amount of the actual O&S costs for the F-22A to the production  milestone estimate at the cost element level.", "Of the remaining F-22A O&S costs not covered by contractor logistics  support, mission personnel costs constituted the largest proportion\u2014 approximately 22 percent\u2014of the total actual O&S costs reported for  fiscal years 2005 through 2009. Compared with the estimates developed in  2005, actual mission personnel costs were $34 million (20 percent) higher  for fiscal year 2008 and $113 million (62 percent) higher for fiscal year  2009. The 2005 estimate provided for 1,335 maintenance personnel for  each F-22A wing (which was projected to number 72 aircraft), but  according to Air Force officials the current authorized personnel for an F- 22A wing (now numbering 36 aircraft) is 1,051 maintenance personnel.  While the number of aircraft per wing was reduced by half, the number of  personnel was reduced by about 21 percent. According to officials,  although the change in wing composition from three squadrons of 24  aircraft to two squadrons of 18 aircraft reduced personnel requirements,  additional personnel who were not included in the 2005 estimate are now  required to support the aircraft\u2019s added air-to-ground mission, an  increased maintenance requirement for the aircraft\u2019s stealth exterior, and  other maintenance requirements that were determined through a 2007  staffing study. In addition, Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve  units were not included in the 2005 estimate, so the personnel costs of  these units resulted in higher actual costs.

However, program changes  complicate direct comparisons between estimated and actual costs, as  they do for the F-22A. For example, the Navy estimated that it would have  428 aircraft in fiscal year 2009, but the actual number of aircraft was 358,  about 16 percent less. Similarly, the Navy estimated that the aircraft fleet  as a whole would fly 780,628 hours from fiscal year 1999 through 2009, but  the aircraft fleet actually flew 625,067 hours, or 20 percent less.

(App. III presents a more  detailed comparison of actual and estimated O&S costs for the F/A-18E/F.)  In discussing findings from this comparison with cost analysts at the Naval  Air Systems Command, they provided the following explanations for key  changes we identified:    Fuel costs were higher than estimated because the price of fuel has  increased overall since the estimate was developed in 1999. Further,  when the estimate was developed, it was assumed the F/A-18E/F  aircraft\u2019s fuel consumption would be similar to that of the F/A-18C/D.  However, this did not prove to be an accurate analogy, and the F/A- 18E/F\u2019s fuel consumption has been higher than that of the earlier  model aircraft. The analysts also said that some of the increased fuel  costs for fiscal year 2005 through 2009 may also be attributed to  increased refueling activity of the F/A-18E/F after the retirement of the  S-3B aircraft.", "Depot maintenance costs were higher than estimated, in part because  the engine was repaired by a contractor under a performance-based  logistics arrangement, but the estimate projected costs for  government-provided support. The government repair estimate  included a large initial investment of procurement funds\u2014which are  not considered O&S costs\u2014for spare parts. The Navy subsequently  changed the engine repair concept to a performance-based logistics  arrangement with less expensive spare parts and reduced the initial  investment by about 15 percent. However, as a result of the new  arrangement, depot maintenance costs increased. Further, the 1999  estimate purposefully excluded some engine depot-maintenance costs  in order to keep a consistent comparison with similar costs for the  F/A-18A-D models. (These costs were instead included in the estimate  as costs for repair parts.) However, after adjusting for these issues,  actual engine depot maintenance costs in fiscal years 2007 and 2009  were higher by a total of approximately $64 million, and Navy officials  could not explain this variance.

Also, fuel costs increased $142 million (18 percent) during  these years. According to program officials, this increase was mainly due  to higher fuel prices rather than increased consumption. Cost for repair  parts grew $398 million (51 percent), and program officials attributed  some of this growth to higher costs for materials used during depot repair,  as well as higher prices paid for labor, storage, and handling. Further,  officials said that several avionics systems on the F-15E have been  replaced and the costs to repair some of the new components are higher.  Depot maintenance costs increased $124 million (16 percent) and program  officials said this increase was due to increasing rates for depot work,  noting that the Air Logistics Centers increased their rates because of  higher material costs.

In 2003, we reported that DOD did not  consider O&S costs and readiness as key performance requirements for  new weapon systems and placed higher priority on technical performance  features. In 2007, DOD began requiring the services to establish an  ownership cost metric during the requirements determination and  acquisition processes for weapon systems in order to ensure that O&S  costs are considered early in decision making.

While the ownership cost metric includes many  of OSD\u2019s recommended O&S cost elements, such as energy (fuel, oil,  petroleum, electricity, etc.), maintenance, sustaining support, and  continuous system improvements, it does not include personnel and  system-specific training costs. In 2008, OSD expanded the use of the  ownership cost and materiel reliability metrics, along with the materiel  availability key performance parameter, to all major defense acquisition  programs that provide information to Congress in Selected Acquisition  Reports. In a July 2008 memorandum intended to reinforce the use of the  life-cycle metrics, OSD requested that these programs develop target goals  for each metric within 60 days. In a December 2008 memorandum, OSD  asked the services to begin reporting against the target goals on a quarterly  basis. According to OSD officials, they are working with the services to  improve the accuracy and submission of the reported cost information.", "We also previously noted that DOD used immature technologies in  designing its weapon systems, which contributed to reliability problems  and acted as a barrier to using manufacturing techniques that typically  help reduce a system\u2019s maintenance costs. DOD has identified insufficient  reliability designed in the system during acquisition as one of the key  reasons for increases in O&S costs. Based on the recommendation of the  DOD Reliability Improvement Working Group, DOD\u2019s primary acquisition  instruction was updated in 2008 to include guidance directing program  mangers to develop reliability, availability, and maintainability strategies  that include reliability growth as an integral part of design and  development. Further, the instruction states that reliability, availability,  and maintainability shall be integrated within systems engineering  processes; documented in system plans; and assessed during  programmatic reviews.", "DOD has also taken steps to improve the information available for cost  estimating and monitoring of actual O&S costs. In 2008, we reported that  for the performance-based logistics arrangements we reviewed, program  offices often did not have detailed cost data that would provide insights  regarding what the program office was spending for various aspects of the  support program. That same year, DOD\u2019s primary acquisition instruction  was updated to include a requirement that sustainment contracts provide  for detailed contractor cost reporting for certain major programs to  improve future cost estimating and price analysis. However, the  instruction does not provide details as to the timing or content of such  cost reporting. Officials in OSD Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation  are currently drafting additional guidance to clarify the cost-reporting  requirement.", "Additionally, OSD Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation initiated an  effort in 2008 to collect actual operational testing and evaluation  information and make it available to cost analysts for use in developing  weapon system cost estimates. According to OSD officials, actual test data  could improve these estimates by providing cost analysts more accurate  information. In support of the initiative, the services have collected over  150 test data reports from their operational testing agencies. Although cost  analysis officials indicated that they have not yet used the test data in  preparing cost estimates, there is a high level of interest in the information  contained in the test reports as evidenced by the number of times the data  have been accessed.

Although one Army command had an O&S cost- reduction program, none of the services had cost-reduction programs  implemented servicewide. According to Army officials, the most direct  aviation O&S cost-reduction initiative within that service is the Aviation  and Missile Life Cycle Management Command\u2019s O&S Cost Reduction  program. Under the program, the command investigates fielded aviation  systems with high failure rates and high costs and attempts to reduce costs  by funding projects aimed at reliability improvements, life-cycle  extensions, and acquisition cost reductions. According to Army officials,  the annual budget for this program is $10 million to $12 million per year,  and most projects predict at least a 2.5 to 1 return on investment.  Examples of funded projects include developing a fuel additive and  reducing corrosion in CH-47 aircraft blades. Officials also noted that other  Army initiatives during the last several years include a renewed emphasis  on the importance of estimating total life-cycle costs during the weapon  system acquisition process and the establishment of draft guidance for the  inclusion of Operations and Maintenance funding projections within  acquisition program affordability charts used during certain weapon  system acquisition reviews. In addition, the Army conducts annual  weapon systems reviews at which program managers present current and  emerging life-cycle weapon system funding requirements based on the  latest Army or program office cost estimate developed for the system.  Army officials said these initiatives can help the Army in better managing  O&S costs.", "While the Navy could not identify initiatives designed specifically to  reduce O&S costs for its aviation systems, Navy officials said the Naval  Aviation Enterprise, a working group of naval aviation stakeholders, was  established in 2004 to meet multiple goals, including exchanging  information to reduce O&S costs. Through cross-functional teams, subject- matter experts collaborate to resolve problems and improve operations.  The Navy stated that, as a result of this initiative, it achieved O&S cost  savings of $50 million from its flying-hour program in fiscal year 2005.  Additionally, Navy officials cited the establishment of Fleet Readiness  Centers as an initiative that could lead to O&S cost reduction in aviation  systems. Created as part of the Base Realignment and Closure process in  2005, the Fleet Readiness Centers aim to improve maintenance efficiency  and reduce costs by combining intermediate- and depot-level maintenance  personnel. As a result, the Navy expects avoidance of unwarranted  maintenance procedures, reduced turnaround times, an increase in  completed repairs, and reduced maintenance costs. Although the Navy is  expected to achieve cost savings from the Fleet Readiness Centers, we  reported in 2007 that the projected savings are likely to be overstated.", "The Air Force also lacks initiatives specifically designed to reduce O&S  costs of aviation systems. Air Force officials noted, however, that  improved management of O&S costs could result from its Expeditionary  Logistics for the 21st Century program. The program is a logistics process- improvement effort that was started in 2005 under a larger program called  Air Force Smart Operations for the 21st Century, which is the guiding  program for all transformation efforts within the Air Force.

With regard to O&S costs, the report cited  inadequate visibility of O&S costs as one of several problems that hinder  weapon system life-cycle support management. According to the report,  DOD does not have adequate visibility of O&S costs; lacks a process to  systematically track and assess O&S costs; and lacks valid, measurable  sustainment metrics to accurately assess how programmatic decisions will  affect life-cycle costs. Further, the report states that DOD cannot identify,  manage, and mitigate major weapon system cost drivers. To address  identified deficiencies in O&S cost management, the Product Support  Assessment Team recommended (1) establishing an O&S affordability  requirement, including linking O&S budgets to readiness, (2) developing  and implementing an affordability process with all DOD stakeholders  (such as the financial and program management communities), and (3)  increasing the visibility of O&S costs and their drivers across the supply  chain.", "In addition to the deficiencies identified with regard to O&S cost  management, the Product Support Assessment Team also found  deficiencies in DOD\u2019s sustainment governance. Governance is defined by  the Product Support Assessment Team as the consistent and cohesive  oversight across the management, policies, processes, and decision  making for sustainment to ensure that sustainment information is a critical  component of weapon system acquisition and throughout the life cycle.  The report noted that every programmatic decision made during the life  cycle of a weapon system should be made with the knowledge of how that  decision will affect the life-cycle support of that system. However, the  report stated that this has been difficult within DOD due to the lack of  perceived relative importance of long-term costs and lack of valid,  measurable support metrics, especially cost projections. To address  identified deficiencies in sustainment governance, the Product Support  Assessment Team recommended (1) strengthening guidance so that  sustainment factors are sufficiently addressed and governed at key life- cycle decision points, (2) issuing DOD policy to require the services to  conduct independent logistics assessments prior to acquisition  milestones, and (3) creating a post-initial-operating-capability review that  includes an assessment of known support issues and potential solutions.  OSD has formed three Integrated Product Teams to further develop and  lead the implementation of the Product Support Assessment Team  recommendations over a 3-year period. While the report highlighted some  of the limitations on assessing and managing O&S costs, the current  recommendations do not identify specific actions or enforcement  measures.", "One of the first changes resulting from the Product Support Assessment  Team recommendations was a new DOD effort in April 2010 to begin  reviews of sustainment costs for all acquisition category ID weapon  system programs and address sustainment factors at milestone decision  and other review points during the acquisition process. Under new DOD  guidance, program managers for these programs are to use a sustainment  chart to facilitate the reviews and provide information on support strategy,  metrics, and costs in a standardized format. Specifically, the chart should  include the original O&S cost baseline, as reported in the initial Selected  Acquisition Report for the system, as well as current program costs  according to the most recent projections. Further, the current estimated  total O&S costs for the life cycle of the system should also be included,  along with the antecedent system\u2019s cost for comparison."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "No Single Individual or Entity Is Empowered to Control O&S Costs", "paragraphs": ["A related factor that has historically challenged DOD\u2019s ability to reduce  weapon system O&S costs is that no single individual or entity within the  department is empowered to control these costs. A variety of offices  within the services and DOD are involved in the decision making that  affects sustainment. Though DOD has designated the program manager as  responsible for many aspects of weapon system life-cycle sustainment  planning, many decisions and processes are outside of the program  manager\u2019s control. Using aviation systems as an example, these decisions  and processes include budget determination, funding processes, the  number and pay of personnel assigned to support aircraft, the number of  aircraft procured, the number of hours flown, the aircraft basing locations,  and the rates charged by depot maintenance facilities. After the aircraft  are produced, program managers have only a limited ability to directly  affect O&S costs. Army aviation officials, for example, indicated that  during the sustainment phase, program managers control only the budgets  for program-related logistics and engineering support, retrofit  modifications, and technical manuals, which account for only a small  percentage of total O&S costs.", "In addition, it is likely that multiple individuals will serve as the weapon  system\u2019s program manager over its life-cycle. For example, the average  tenure for a program manager is roughly 17 months, whereas the average  life of a major weapon system often exceeds 20 years. This turnover  results in program managers bearing responsibility for the decisions of  their predecessors, making it difficult to hold the program manager  accountable for growth in the system\u2019s O&S costs.

While the military services are required to develop life-cycle  O&S cost estimates to support production decisions, DOD cannot fully  benefit from these estimates if they are not retained. If cost-estimating  best practices are followed, the estimates, among other things, can provide  a benchmark for subsequent cost analysis of that system, enable the  identification of major cost drivers, and aid in improving cost estimating  for future systems. Similarly, in the absence of more complete historical  data on a weapon system\u2019s actual O&S costs in their VAMOSC systems, the  services are not in a good position to track cost trends over time, compare  these actual costs with previous estimates, and determine whether and  why cost growth is occurring. While all the services\u2019 VAMOSC systems  have deficiencies, the Army\u2019s system has the greatest limitations. We  reported on these limitations 10 years ago and recommended  improvements, but the Army has not made significant improvements since  then.", "Moreover, without periodically updating life-cycle O&S cost estimates and  documenting program changes affecting O&S costs after a system is  fielded, DOD managers lack information necessary to compare actual  performance to planned or expected results, as stated in federal standards  for internal control. DOD has begun to recognize that greater management  emphasis should be placed on better managing weapon system O&S costs,  as indicated by several current and planned initiatives. The department  furthermore has acknowledged deficiencies in O&S cost visibility and  noted that every programmatic decision made during the entire life cycle  of a DOD weapon system should be made with the knowledge of how that  decision will affect the life-cycle sustainment of that system. Finally, citing  the economic and fiscal challenges the nation faces along with the  prospects for greatly reduced defense budgets, the Secretary of Defense  highlighted the need for DOD to take a more aggressive approach to  reducing its spending and finding efficiencies where possible in order to  better afford its force structure and weapon system modernization  priorities.

To the extent possible, data  collected on actual O&S costs should be comparable to data presented  in life-cycle cost estimates. To oversee compliance with this new  requirement, DOD should require the services to identify any gaps  where actual cost data are not being collected and maintained and to  identify efforts, along with timelines and resources, for filling these  gaps.", "Direct the Army to develop and implement a strategy for improving its  VAMOSC system. This strategy should include plans for incorporating  additional cost elements from other information systems, time frames  for expanding on existing cost elements, and resources required to  improve the VAMOSC system.", "Require the services to periodically update their life-cycle O&S cost  estimates for major weapon systems throughout their life cycle. These  updates should provide an assessment of cost growth since the prior  estimate was developed and account for any significant cost and  program changes.", "Develop guidance for documenting and retaining historical  information on weapon system program changes to aid in effective  analysis of O&S costs.

Specifically, the department fully concurred with four recommendations  and partially concurred with two. The department\u2019s written comments are  reprinted in appendix IV. DOD also provided technical comments that we  have incorporated into this report where applicable.", "DOD concurred with our four recommendations to revise guidance to  require the services to retain life-cycle O&S cost estimates and support  documentation used to develop the cost estimates; develop guidance for  documenting and retaining historical information on weapon system  program changes to aid in effective analysis of O&S costs; require that the  Director of the Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation retain any  independent life-cycle O&S cost estimates prepared by that office, along  with support documentation used to develop these cost estimates for  major weapon systems; and revise DOD guidance to require the services to  periodically update life-cycle O&S cost estimates for major weapon  systems throughout their life cycle and assess program changes and cost  growth. While DOD concurred with our recommendation to periodically  update life-cycle O&S cost estimates for major weapon systems, the  department noted that the Navy is concerned about the additional cost and  personnel related to this requirement. We maintain that periodic estimates  that quantify and assess changes in weapon systems O&S costs will assist  with the identification of prospective areas for cost reduction and improve  DOD\u2019s ability to estimate O&S costs in the future. Therefore, the resulting  benefits from periodic analysis of O&S costs will likely be greater than the  incremental costs associated with the additional resources.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation to identify the cost  elements needed to track and assess major weapon systems\u2019 actual O&S  costs for effective cost analysis and program management, require the  services to collect and maintain these elements in their VAMOSC systems,  and require the services to identify elements where actual cost data are  not being collected and maintained, along with efforts for filling these data  gaps. However, the department noted that while DOD will coordinate  internally to address this issue, the Director of the Cost Assessment and  Program Evaluation office should be directed to take this action in lieu of  the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics.  DOD\u2019s comments further noted that these two OSD offices would  coordinate with one another to implement other recommendations we  made. We have modified our recommendations to reflect that both the  Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics and  the Director of the Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office will  need to play key roles in implementing these recommendations.", "DOD also partially concurred with our recommendation that the Army  develop and implement a strategy for improving its VAMOSC system. DOD  stated that while the Army will develop such a strategy, the Army  maintains that its military personnel costs are collected by a separate  database, the Army Military-Civilian Cost System, and although the costs  are not captured by weapon system fleet, the data are sufficient for O&S  cost -estimating purposes. The Army also pointed out that it has made  progress in collecting contractor logistics support cost data. Specifically,  the Army stated that guidance issued in 2008 has led to cost-reporting  requirements (that is, requirements that the contractor provide details  regarding support costs by cost element) being included in new support  contracts. Further, the Army noted that a future information system  should be able to capture contractor support cost data. As we stated in our  report, new Army systems may improve the availability of actual O&S cost  data. However, these systems are still being developed. Even with these  planned information systems, it is unclear what additional O&S cost data  will be collected, how quickly the Army will be able to incorporate the  data into its VAMOSC system, what resources may be needed, or what  additional limitations the service may face in improving its VAMOSC  system. We based our recommendation on DOD guidance regarding the  VAMOSC systems. As we state in our report, DOD required that the O&S  costs incurred by each defense program be maintained in a historical O&S  data-collection system and designated the services\u2019 VAMOSC systems as  the authoritative source for these cost data. Therefore, we continue to  believe the Army needs a strategy for improving the cost data available in  its VAMOSC system.", "While generally concurring with our recommendations, DOD\u2019s response  noted that there are over 150 major defense acquisition programs across  the departments and agencies, ranging from missile defense systems to  combat vehicles, with each program having unique challenges in data  reporting.

While we solicited DOD\u2019s and the services\u2019 inputs to try to  avoid selecting weapon systems with known data limitations, we agree  with DOD and our report clearly states that we selected a nonprobability  sample for our review and, therefore, the results cannot be used to make  inferences about all major weapon systems. DOD\u2019s response also noted  that while our report recognizes the recent initiatives the department has  established to track and prevent future O&S cost growth, the effects of  these initiatives are generally not reflected in the systems we analyzed.  According to DOD\u2019s comments, a review of at least one pre\u2013major defense  acquisition program would have allowed us to assess the potential long- term effect of these initiatives with respect to controlling O&S cost  growth. While we agree that a review of the effectiveness of recent  initiatives would be beneficial in the future, many of the initiatives were  only implemented in the last several years and are likely too new to  demonstrate improvements. Further, the scope of our work was limited to  a comparison of the original O&S cost estimates developed for selected  major weapon systems to the actual O&S costs incurred in order to assess  the rate of cost growth. Therefore, we selected systems that had  previously passed through DOD\u2019s acquisition process, achieved initial  operating capability, and been fielded for at least several years.

The Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA)  conducted the study for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology and Logistics. According to an IDA analyst, the  study began in 2007 and was completed in April 2009. We did not evaluate  the study\u2019s methodology, results, or conclusions.", "The intent of the study was to demonstrate various analytic methods for  monitoring major weapon system reliability, maintainability, availability,  and O&S costs against baseline targets throughout the life cycle. IDA  obtained O&S cost estimates developed by the Air Force during the  acquisition of the C-17, compared them to actual fiscal year 2009 O&S  costs (estimated using DOD\u2019s recommended cost element structure), and  developed an updated life-cycle cost estimate using actual O&S cost data.  In its report, IDA showed that the C-17\u2019s estimated life-cycle O&S costs  increased from $91.6 billion to $118.1 billion (29 percent) from 1985  through 2009. The estimated cost growth occurred despite a decrease in  the total aircraft inventory from a projected 210 down to an actual total of  190. Further, the study reported that the C-17\u2019s cost per flight hour  increased 43 percent from an estimated $13,989 in 1985 to an estimated  $19,995 in 2009. According to the study, major cost drivers were fuel  consumption, materials and supplies, repair parts, airframe overhaul,  engine overhaul, and sustaining engineering/program management.", "According to IDA\u2019s report, the C-17 program experienced changes during  and after acquisition that affected the comparison of the updated O&S cost  estimates\u2014developed using actual O&S costs\u2014to the originally estimated  O&S costs. The report grouped the factors that caused O&S cost growth  into three categories: internal program factors, external program factors,  and accounting factors.", "According to an IDA analyst involved with the study, variances due to  internal program factors are defined as those that were influenced by  the aircraft\u2019s program managers. Such factors identified in the study  included system design, reliability, and maintenance support concepts.  For example, the report noted that the C-17 transitioned from planned  government-provided support to contractor logistics support, and this  change greatly complicated the analysis and became a major aspect of  the study. IDA attributed cost increases for sustaining  engineering/program management, contractor field service  representatives, contractor training support, and engine depot- maintenance costs to this change in support concept. Further, the C- 17\u2019s airframe weight increased during development, which led to  increased fuel consumption and higher fuel costs. Finally, system  modifications increased in scope, which led to additional cost  increases.", "Changes in costs due to external program factors are defined as those  that were generally beyond the control of program managers,  according to the IDA analyst. These factors included changes to  system quantities or delivery schedules, basing and deployment plan  changes, and higher system-operating tempos due to contingencies.  For example, the change from 210 to 190 aircraft reduced total costs; a  change to the mix of active and reserve units from 73 percent active to  90 percent active increased costs; and personnel costs increased due  to growth in incentive pay, housing, and medical care costs.", "Finally, according to the IDA analyst, variances from accounting  factors are defined as those that resulted from differences in the way  costs were categorized over time. Accounting factor changes that  affected C-17 O&S costs included a change in the scope of DOD\u2019s  indirect costs; changes in personnel accounting; and changes to the  timing of the weapon system\u2019s phase-in, steady state, and phase-out  periods.", "On the basis of its C-17 analysis, IDA concluded that any mechanism to  track and assess weapon system O&S costs against baseline estimates  would require a systematic and institutional methodology that does not  currently exist within DOD. According to the report, the methodological  approach that was used in the study was ad hoc, labor intensive, and  dependent on analyst judgment. The study suggested that, in the absence a  more systematic, institutional methodology, DOD could instead track  major O&S cost drivers\u2014such as reliability, fuel consumption,  maintenance manning per aircraft, and dollars per airframe overhaul.  However, the exact metrics DOD used would depend on how the  department plans to use the data in managing the O&S costs of its weapon  systems and how the data would be used in decision making."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Analysis of Changes between Estimated and Actual O&S Costs for the Navy\u2019s F/A-18E/F", "paragraphs": ["This appendix provides a detailed breakdown, by cost element, of total  estimated and actual operating and support (O&S) costs for the Navy\u2019s  F/A-8E/F for the period of fiscal years 1999 through 2009 (see table 5).
