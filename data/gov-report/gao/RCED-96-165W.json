GAO noted that NPS: (1) overstated its projections of future returns under the Concessions Policy Act by assuming it could increase franchise fees as contracts expired and that monies and franchise fees would remain in the same proportions; (2) overstated its projections of future returns under H.R. 773 and S. 309 by assuming that the bills would increase competition and that it would gradually extinguish the concessioners\u2019 processory interest; and (3) understated its projections of future returns under H.R. 2491 by assuming that the bill\u2019s performance incentive would impede competition.", "Land Management Systems: Progress and Risks in Developing BLM\u2019s Land and Mineral Record System.

August 31, 1995.", "ABSTRACT: The Bureau of Land Management\u2019s (BLM) Automated Land and Mineral Record System/Modernization, which is estimated to cost $428 million, is intended to improve BLM\u2019s ability to record, maintain, and retrieve land description, ownership, and use information. To date, the Bureau has been completing most of the project\u2019s tasks according to the schedule milestones set in 1993. In coming months, the work will become more difficult as BLM and the primary contractor try to complete, integrate, and test the new software system and meet the current schedule. The Bureau is trying to maintain the project schedule, but slippages may yet occur because little time was allocated to deal with unanticipated problems. BLM recently sought to obtain independent verification and validation to ensure that the new system software meets the Bureau\u2019s requirements. A key risk remains, however. BLM\u2019s plans include stress testing only a portion of the Automated Land and Mineral Record System/ Modernization, rather than the entire project, to ensure that all systems and technology can successfully process workloads expected during peak operating periods. By limiting the stress test, BLM cannot be certain that the system\u2019s information technology will perform as intended during peak workloads.", "National Parks: Difficult Choices Need to Be Made About the Future of the Parks. GAO/RCED-95-238. August 30, 1995.", "ABSTRACT: GAO concludes that there is cause for concern about the health of national parks. Visitor services were deteriorating at most of the park units that GAO reviewed. Services were being cut back, and the condition of many trails, campgrounds, and other facilities was declining. Trends in resource management were less clear because most park managers lacked enough data to determine the overall condition of their parks\u2019 natural and cultural resources. In some cases, parks lacked an inventory of the resources under their protection. Two factors strongly affected the levels of visitor services and the management of park resources\u2014(1) additional operating requirements placed on parks by laws and administrative requirements and (2) increased visitation, which drives up the parks\u2019 operating costs. These two factors seriously eroded funding increases since the mid-1980s. The national park system is at a crossroads. Although the system continues to grow, conditions at the parks have been deteriorating and the dollar amount of the maintenance backlog has soared from $1.9 billion in 1988 to more than $4 billion today. Congress is faced with the following difficult policy choices: (1) increasing the amount of financial resources going to the parks, (2) limiting or reducing the number of units in the park system, and (3) reducing the level of visitor services. The Park Service should be able to stretch available resources by operating more efficiently and by improving its financial management and performance measuring systems.", "Federal Lands: Information on the Use and Impact of Off-Highway Vehicles.

Some BLM and Forest Service locations have targeted their monitoring and enforcement to the most heavily used or the most environmentally sensitive lands. Also, some have formed coalitions with state governments, local communities, and private groups to supplement their resources for off-highway vehicle programs. As the agencies continue to inventory, map, and post signs to identify their off-highway vehicle areas, roads, and trails, they should be able to implement the executive orders more fully.", "Natural Resources Management Issue Area Plan: Fiscal Years 1996-97.

Federal agencies\u2019 concessions policies and practices are based on at least 11 different laws and, as a result, vary considerably. GAO concludes that more competition is needed in awarding concessions contracts and that the federal government needs to obtain a better return from concessioners for the use of its lands, including obtaining fair market value for the fees it charges ski operators. GAO supports the changes proposed by the four bills to current concessions policies and practices.", "National Parks: Views on the Denver Service Center and Information on Related Construction Activities. GAO/RCED-95-79. June 23, 1995.", "ABSTRACT: One of the major organizational units of the National Park Service is the Denver Service Center, which supports construction activities throughout the park system. The Center works with individual parks in planning, designing, and building projects, which range from rehabilitating historic structures to building new visitor centers to repairing and replacing utility systems. Parks are expected to use the Center\u2019s services for projects costing more than $250,000, although exceptions are granted if the parks have the expertise needed for the projects and they receive approval from Park Service headquarters. In response to congressional concerns about the quality of services provided by the Center, GAO surveyed park managers on the quality and the timeliness of those services. This report also (1) describes how the Park Service sets priorities for funding construction projects and how the priorities may be modified during congressional consideration of the Park Service\u2019s annual appropriations requests, (2) describes the process the Park Service uses to develop cost estimates for projects, and (3) provides information on the makeup of projects\u2019 contingency and supervision funds.", "National Park Service: Difficult Choices Need to Be Made on the Future of the Parks.

Visitor services are being cut back and the condition of many trails, campgrounds, exhibits, and other facilities is declining. The Park Service estimates that since 1988 the backlog of deferred maintenance has more than doubled to $4 billion. The following two factors have had a major impact on the level of visitor services and resource management activities: (1) additional operating requirements resulting from more than 20 federal laws affecting the parks and (2) an increase in the number of visitors. Since substantial increases in appropriations seem unlikely in today\u2019s tight budget climate, difficult choices must be made on the future of the national parks. These choices involve generating more revenue within the parks, limiting the number of parks in the system, and reducing the level of visitor services and expectations.", "Federal Lands: Information on Land Owned and on Acreage with Conservation Restrictions.

However, the decrease is skewed because of two unique land transfers in Alaska\u2014the transfer of about 76 million acres of federal land to the state of Alaska in accordance with the Alaska Statehood Act of 1958 and the transfer of about 36 million acres to native Alaskans in accordance with the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971. Excluding these two large land transfers, the amount of land managed by the four agencies actually increased by 34 million acres. During the same 29-year period, the number of acres managed by the four agencies that were set aside for conservation purposes increased from about 51 million acres at the end of fiscal year 1964 to about 271 million acres at the end of fiscal year 1993.", "National Park Service: Better Management and Broader Restructuring Efforts Are Needed.

Although the Park Service\u2019s restructuring plan addresses some of the challenges facing the agency, such as the need to meet the demands of an expanding system, growing numbers of visitors, and increasingly complex resource protection problems, the plan does not address the potential to improve operations through land management collaboration among Interior\u2019s three land management agencies and Agriculture\u2019s Forest Service.

GAO/RCED-95-22. October 31, 1994.", "ABSTRACT: The Santini-Burton Act, enacted in 1980, authorized the sale of about 7,000 acres of federal lands within Clark County, Nevada, to allow more orderly development of the communities there. The federal lands were owned by the Bureau of Land Management. The act also required the bulk of the proceeds from the land sales to be used for a buyout program in which the government would purchase environmentally sensitive private lands around Lake Tahoe in an effort to stem further degradation of the lake. Concerns have been raised about whether property owners in the Lake Tahoe Basin have been treated fairly when the lands were acquired under the act. This report determines the extent to which (1) the Forest Service acquired lands within the basin under the act\u2019s buyout program, (2) the classification of lands within the basin as environmentally sensitive may have harmed their value, and (3) the Forest Service\u2019s acquisition of environmentally sensitive land in the basin may have involved the federal government taking private property under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.", "National Park Service: Reexamination of Employee Housing Program Is Needed.

The Park Service has an inventory today of about 4,700 housing units. Nearly half of the housing inventory is more than 30 years old. Park Service estimates of what it would cost to repair, rehabilitate, repair, and replace this housing inventory have increased significantly during the past several years; the total estimate is now more than half a billion dollars. This report (1) describes the Park Service\u2019s housing program and compares it with the housing programs run by two other large land management agencies\u2014the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management\u2014and (2) identifies options that are available to the Park Service to deal with its housing problems.", "Federal Lands: Fees for Communications Sites Are Below Fair Market Value. GAO/RCED-94-248. July 12, 1994.", "ABSTRACT: The Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) are the two major federal agencies whose lands are used as sites to broadcast radio, television, and other electronic signals. These sites, mainly located in the western United States, are for the most part leased to private entities that build and operate communications facilities. The annual fees being charged for such communications sites are, in many cases, significantly below fair market value. Forest Service and BLM officials estimate that charging fees on the basis of fair market value would boost total federal revenues by more than 500 percent\u2014from about $4 million to about $23 million annually. Although the Forest Service and BLM have been trying to set fees reflecting fair market value, annual appropriations legislation has limited the amount by which these fees can be increased. As long as these limits are in effect, the fees charged will not reflect fair market value. Both the Forest Service and BLM lack reliable and complete information needed to manage their communications site programs. In addition, many unauthorized communications users are operating on Forest Service lands, and annual inspections to ensure that the sites are properly maintained are rarely done. GAO summarized this report in testimony before Congress; see: Federal Lands: Fees for Communications Sites Are Below Fair Market Value, by John H.

GAO/T-NSIAD-94-227. June 29, 1994.", "ABSTRACT: Military operations had not been hampered at the six withdrawn sites GAO visited in Alaska, Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico, but these operations had constrained resource management activities. Military commanders at five of the sites said that they changed some training exercises to accommodate concerns for wildlife; at one site, officials expressed concern about meeting training needs because of environmental constraints. However, the Defense Department restricted access to three sites, making it difficult for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to carry out resource management activities. Such restrictions and the overall military presence have led BLM to assign a low priority to resource management on military lands. A lack of information on resource conditions prevents an overall assessment of the impacts. The six sites could improve resource management by enhancing interagency cooperation and by strengthening systems to monitor resource management actions. Resource management at the Goldwater Range in Arizona was an example of effective cooperation between BLM and the military.", "Federal Lands: Land Acquisitions Involving Nonprofit Conservation Organizations.

GAO/RCED-94-24. May 26, 1994.", "ABSTRACT: Although the Interior and Justice Departments maintain that the federal government has never had a trust responsibility to native Hawaiians, the state of Hawaii disagrees. Hawaiian state courts and the state\u2019s Attorney General have concluded that the federal government had a trust responsibility during the territorial period, and the state\u2019s Attorney General believes that such a responsibility continues today. In GAO\u2019s opinion, territorial governors lacked authority to withdraw Hawaiian homelands for nonfederal public purposes through executive orders and proclamations. However, many of these unauthorized withdrawals appear to have (1) benefitted native Hawaiians or (2) involved lands that were unsuitable for authorized homeland uses, such as homesteading or leasing, during the territorial period. Territorial governors also lacked authority under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act to withdraw homelands for federal purposes through executive orders or other means. Because such withdrawals took place more than 50 years ago, there is no guarantee that all information relevant to these withdrawals is still available. Therefore, GAO is unable to express an opinion on the propriety of homeland withdrawals for federal purposes. GAO believes that the methodology used by a consultant to the state to estimate the lost income from and the current market value for parcels of lands was generally reasonable.", "Natural Resources: Defense and Interior Can Better Manage Land Withdrawn for Military Use.

These restrictions and the military presence led BLM to assign a low priority to resource management on military land. At three sites, BLM allocated considerably less money to manage lands used for military training than for other property under its care. All six sites had opportunities to improve resource management by strengthening cooperation between BLM and the military and by beefing up monitoring of progress on planned resource management actions.

April 18, 1994.", "BACKGROUND: GAO reviewed whether the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) used emergency appropriated funds for the repair and replacement of national wildlife refuge facilities damaged by Hurricane Iniki. GAO noted that: (1) FWS did not have authorization to use emergency funds for reconstruction work at two refuges; (2) FWS planned to use emergency funds for enlarging selected buildings at one refuge and remodeling the visitors\u2019 center at another refuge; (3) approximately $12.8 million in emergency disaster assistance was appropriated to FWS for construction projects; and (4) of the amount appropriated, FWS allocated $6.2 million for the rehabilitation of the refuges.", "Forest Service Management: Issues To Be Considered in Developing a New Stewardship Strategy. GAO/T-RCED-94-116. February 1, 1994.", "ABSTRACT: Budgetary constraints and scientific findings on ecosystem management will challenge the Forest Service as never before to find new ways to achieve program goals with fewer resources. GAO testified that the Forest Service needs to work closely with Congress to get a better return on the sale or use of natural resources on public lands. It also needs to work with Congress and other federal land management agencies to find ways to work more efficiently and to manage federal lands so as to preserve the nation\u2019s natural resources and sustain their long-term economic productivity. GAO believes that a coordinated interagency strategy may be needed to link Forest Service reforms to changes being considered by other federal land management agencies. The goal would be to coordinate and integrate these programs, activities, and functions so that these agencies can function as a unit on the local level.", "The Gettysburg Address: Issues Related to Display and Preservation. GAO/RCED-94-12. January 26, 1994.", "ABSTRACT: Of the five known original manuscripts of the Gettysburg Address, two are in the collection of the Library of Congress. Since 1979, the Library\u2019s two drafts have been displayed during the spring and the summer at the Gettysburg National Military Park, which is run by the Park Service. The Library plans to substitute a high-quality facsimile for display at the park after 1994, a move the Park Service opposes. This report discusses (1) the risks inherent in exhibiting a draft at the park or elsewhere, (2) whether the Park Service has met the Library\u2019s exhibition and preservation requirements and can meet future requirements, and (3) the estimated cost of exhibiting the document at the park in the current or an upgraded facility versus the cost of building a comparable facility at the Library. GAO notes that exhibiting the drafts at the park has allowed millions of Americans to see the original documents in a historic setting and that the Park Service seems capable of meeting evolving exhibition and preservation requirements. The conference report accompanying the fiscal year 1994 legislative branch appropriations act supports exhibiting an original draft in Gettysburg and encourages the Library and the Park Service to reopen discussions on extending the loan of the address. Ultimately, it is Congress\u2019 call as to where the drafts should be displayed.", "National Park Service: Activities Outside Park Borders Have Caused Damage to Resources and Will Likely Cause More.

GAO/T-RCED-94-72. November 9, 1993.", "ABSTRACT: According to managers at the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), access to more than 50 million acres of public land in the United States is inadequate, a situation that can potentially reduce the public\u2019s recreational opportunities and interfere with the government\u2019s land management. Private landowners are increasingly unwilling to grant public access across their land because of concerns about vandalism and potential liability or because of desires for privacy or exclusive personal use. To overcome access problems, the Forest Service and BLM may acquire all rights and interests associated with the land or obtain perpetual easements. In fiscal years 1989-91, the Forest Service and BLM acquired permanent legal public access to about 4.5 million acres of federal land. The two agencies had plans as of October 1991 to open another 9.3 million acres of federal land to the public.", "Fisheries Management: Administration of the Sport Fish Restoration Program. GAO/RCED-94-4. November 8, 1993.", "ABSTRACT: The long-term decline in the quality of sport fishing in the United States prompted the creation in 1950 of the Sport Fish Restoration Program, which seeks to restore, conserve, and enhance the nation\u2019s sport fishery resources. During fiscal years 1998-92, the program received nearly $1 billion in federal funding. In response to congressional concerns about the program\u2019s rapid expansion and about whether program money was being used for its intended purposes, this report determines (1) the extent to which the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) used these funds to run the program, (2) whether FWS\u2019 use of program funds for special investigations helped the agency to achieve the program\u2019s goals, (3) whether the states allocated the required amount of funds to freshwater and marine projects, and (4) the extent to which the states programmed funds to enhance fish habitat. GAO limited its review to five coastal states\u2014California, Florida, North Carolina, Texas, and Washington\u2014that historically have either received the largest apportionments of program funds or have underwritten a diverse range of sport fish projects.", "Department of the Interior: Transfer of the Presidio From the Army to the National Park Service. GAO/RCED-94-61.

The extent to which the costs to rehabilitate the Presidio\u2019s buildings and run the Presidio will be offset by tenant payments and philanthropic donations, however, is unknown. Thus, the level of future annual appropriations needed to manage the Presidio cannot be estimated with any certainty at this time. Given the costs and the potential impact of the Presidio\u2019s rehabilitation on the Park Service\u2019s deferred maintenance and reconstruction backlog, close oversight by the Department of the Interior and Congress is warranted.

GAO/RCED-93-192. September 30, 1993.", "ABSTRACT: The National Park Service, which has been housing park employees since 1916, now has an inventory of about 5,200 housing units. Park Service records suggest that about 40 percent of this inventory is in \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d condition, needing no more than routine maintenance; about 15 percent was rated \u201cpoor\u201d to \u201cobsolete,\u201d requiring extensive repairs. Most of the Park Service housing is used to shelter (1) seasonal employees, (2) permanent employees at isolated parks, and (3) permanent employees at more-accessible parks who provide visitor services or protect government property. GAO questioned the justification for about 12 percent of the units. For example, at 11 nonisolated parks GAO visited, park managers subjectively determined the need for housing instead of relying on an analysis of local housing availability, as required by Park Service guidance. GAO could not verify the accuracy of the Park Service\u2019s $546 million estimate for employee housing repair and replacement. Park Service officials claim that a sizable backlog of repairs exists because rental income has covered only about half of all maintenance costs and operating funds have not been enough to make up the difference. Rental income has been limited because (1) the Park Service reduces its rates because of factors such as isolation and lack of amenities and (2) Congress has set a cap on rental rate increases.", "Bureau of Reclamation: Unauthorized Recreation Facilities at Two Reclamation Projects.

GAO reviews the federal government\u2019s policy and practices for (1) evaluating short-term concessioners\u2019 overall performance; (2) ensuring that short-term concessioners comply with federal, state, and local health and safety laws and regulations; (3) ensuring the reasonableness of the prices charged to the public by short-term concessioners; and (4) setting fees for the use of federal land by short-term concessioners.", "Federal Land: Little Progress Made in Improving Oversight of Concessioners. GAO/T-RCED-93-42. May 27, 1993.", "ABSTRACT: Concessioners are often the primary operators in recreation areas containing some of the nation\u2019s greatest national treasures. Despite GAO\u2019s warnings during the past three years, however, federal agencies are still doing a poor job of managing concessioners on federal land. The agencies lack enough data to adequately manage concession operations, they cannot demonstrate that they are receiving a fair return, and they have to revise or develop some policies to improve their management of concessioners. Deterioration in federal areas is widespread, and the existing infrastructure\u2014approaching $200 billion in value\u2014is increasingly run down; the cost of deferred maintenance in the national parks and forests alone is nearly $3 billion. The federal government has a huge investment in its recreation resources, and GAO believes that the government needs to ensure that it is fairly compensated for the use of its land, the visiting public is provided with healthy and safe services, and the nation\u2019s recreation resources are adequately protected for future generations.", "National Park Service: Scope and Cost of America\u2019s Industrial Heritage Project Need to Be Defined. GAO/RCED-93-134. May 14, 1993.", "ABSTRACT: America\u2019s Industrial Heritage Project consists of several sites scattered throughout southwestern Pennsylvania that will explain how the region\u2019s iron and steel, coal, and transportation industries contributed to the nation\u2019s industrial growth. The project is expected to revitalize the region\u2019s economic base through tourism. Much uncertainty exists, however, about the development and the completion of the project. Although one estimate pegs the cost of completing the project at about $355 million, including $155 million in federal funds, this estimate lacks documentation and the final scope of the project has yet to be defined. Uncertainty also exists about the operation and maintenance of project sites on nonfederal land. Although some of the sites will be run by the National Park Service, other projects built on nonfederal land are to be run by nonfederal entities. Yet GAO was told that federal funds will be used for up to 5 years to run several projects on nonfederal land. Finally, it is unclear who will be responsible for managing, operating, and maintaining the projects. The Southwestern Pennsylvania Heritage Commission, part of the Interior Department, has been overseeing the project\u2019s implementation, but the Commission\u2019s term expires in November 1998. Although the Commission favors the establishment of a not-for-profit corporation that would run all the projects, it has yet to make a final choice among the options being considered.", "Forest Service: Little Assurance That Fair Market Value Fees Are Collected From Ski Areas. GAO/RCED-93-107. April 16, 1993.", "ABSTRACT: Ski operators on Forest Service land are required to pay the government fees that are based on fair market values. Although these ski operators had $737 million in gross sales in 1991, they paid the government only about $13.5 million in fees. GAO concludes that the current fee system does not ensure that the Forest Service receives fair market values for using its land. When the graduated rate fee system was put into place more than 20 years ago, it was expected that rates would be adjusted periodically to reflect economic changes. Yet the rates by which fees are calculated have not been updated in more than two decades. The fee system developed by the ski industry also does not deliver fees that reflect fair market value. GAO agrees with the Forest Service that a simplified system is desirable. The goal of developing a simpler system, however, must be secondary to ensuring that fees are based on fair market value.", "Natural Resources Management: Issues to Be Considered by the Congress and Administration. GAO/T-RCED-93-5. February 2, 1993.", "ABSTRACT: This testimony discusses GAO\u2019s December 1992 transition series report entitled Natural Resources Management Issues (GAO/OCG-93-17TR). During this era of budgetary constraints, Congress and the new administration face hard choices in how to protect the nation\u2019s natural resources. Current funding is inadequate to handle the declining condition of the nation\u2019s natural resources and related infrastructure on federal lands. A number of proposals to obtain a better return for the sale or use of natural resources have not succeeded, GAO believes, because (1) the full extent of the staffing and funding shortfalls facing federal natural resources management agencies has not been clearly articulated and (2) the proposals and the dialogue surrounding them have not focused on the need to encourage uses that are compatible with sustaining the nation\u2019s natural resources for future generations.", "Natural Resources Management Issues.

The new concessioner should have enough revenue to pay the promissory note for the purchase price, cover operating expenses, and make a reasonable profit. GAO has not, however, reviewed the assumptions that the Park Service used to calculate its cash flow projections. Although the new concessioner will be required to implement some portion of the 1980 Yosemite General Management Plan, which seeks to reduce congestion in the park, the Park Service has not yet finalized what those requirements or the associated cost will be. Finally, the transfer of interests in the agreement between the Curry Company\u2019s parent firm\u2014MCA, Inc.\u2014and the middleman in the sale\u2014the National Park Foundation\u2014does not constitute a gift to the Foundation.

Poor management by the National Park Service and lack of data, however, make it impossible to determine whether the government is getting a fair return on the use of its facilities. A lack of policy guidance has led to inconsistent determinations of building use fees. Furthermore, a lack of complete and centralized data has left the Park Service in a quandary as to how many concession agreements contain the assignment of federally owned facilities; how many federally owned facilities are used by concessioners; and what other agreements have been reached on the repair, maintenance, and improvement of these facilities. As a result of this lack of data, the total compensation for the use of federally owned facilities is unknown.", "Federal Lands: Reasons for and Effects of Inadequate Public Access. GAO/RCED-92-116BR. April 14, 1992.", "ABSTRACT: The public\u2019s access to more than 50 million acres, or 14 percent, of the land managed by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is considered inadequate by agency managers. Private landowners\u2019 unwillingness to grant public access to their land has increased during the past decade as the public\u2019s use of public land has increased. Factors contributing to inadequate access are private landowners\u2019 concerns about vandalism and potential liability or their desire for privacy and exclusive personal use. To resolve the public access problem, the Forest Service and BLM can acquire either all rights and interests associated with the land (fee simple acquisition) or perpetual easements (limited controls over the land that are binding on succeeding owners). In fiscal years 1989-91, the Forest Service and BLM acquired permanent, legal public access to about 4.5 million acres of federal land. As of October 1991, the two agencies had about 3,300 actions pending to open another 9.3 million acres of federal land to the public.", "Federal Lands: Oversight of Long-Term Concessioners.

Although the full extent of illegal trade is unknown, the value of such trade into and out of the United States is estimated at up to $250 million annually. Despite recent increases in the Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s (FWS) wildlife inspection program, the program has had difficulty in accomplishing its mission of monitoring wildlife and intercepting wildlife trade. Given current budget constraints and downsizing within the federal government, increases in program funding are unlikely. GAO raises questions about the program\u2019s efficiency and effectiveness. The passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement is likely to increase wildlife trade among the countries that are party to the agreement\u2014the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The expected rise in trade will increase the workload of FWS inspectors, who are already stretched thin along the U.S. borders.

A predominant number of the species protected under the Act have the major share of their habitat on nonfederal lands. Specifically, of the 781 listed species for which the Fish and Wildlife Service was responsible as of May 1993, 712 (or over 90 percent) have habitat on nonfederal lands and of these, 516 have over 60 percent of their total habitat on nonfederal lands. Two processes authorized under the Act have addressed potential conflicts between the effort to protect species and land use activities on nonfederal lands.

GAO/RCED-95-7. November 14, 1994.", "ABSTRACT: Of the nearly 900 species listed under the Endangered Species Act, one quarter can be found on national wildlife refuges. These listed species include plants, birds, and mammals. Although a significant portion of the current habitat for 94 listed species is on 66 wildlife refuges, many other listed species use refuge lands on a temporary basis for breeding or migratory rest stops. Refuges and refuge staff contribute to the protection and the recovery of listed species in several ways. First, the refuges themselves represent about 91 million acres of secure habitat, including more than 310,000 acres that have been acquired by the Service specifically for the protection of listed species. Second, refuge staff are taking steps to protect and recover listed species. Third, refuge staff, by identifying specific actions that can help a species recover, help to develop recovery plans that the Fish and Wildlife Service requires for listed species. Funding limitations constrain efforts to manage wildlife refuges. Two 1993 Interior Department reports found that available funding was not enough to meet established objectives for refuges because the level of funding has not kept pace with the rising costs of managing existing refuges.", "California Fire Response.

GAO/RCED-94-170. August 3, 1994.", "ABSTRACT: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the Commerce Department operates a fleet of 18 ships that supports its programs in fisheries and oceanographic research, and hydrographic charting and mapping. Because the fleet is old and technologically obsolete, NOAA has concluded that fleet replacement and modernization are critical to supporting its mission requirements. In this report on the cost-efficiency, accounting, and operating practices of NOAA vessels compared with other federal and private research vessels, GAO found that NOAA has generally agreed with previous studies that it experiment with contracting and chartering the services of private vessels as an alternative to acquiring new ships. NOAA\u2019s current fleet modernization plan, however, focuses on the acquisition of new vessels and does not fully consider the role that contracted and chartered vessels could play. Because NOAA does not have the data it needs to adequately assess whether use of private ships could meet its needs, the agency has no assurance that its fleet modernization plans are the most cost-effective means of meeting future program requirements.", "Endangered Species Act: Impact of Species Protection Efforts on the 1993 California Fire.

GAO/RCED-94-122. May 10, 1994.", "ABSTRACT: The 1993 Pacific whiting harvest was controversial. The Department of Commerce rejected the Pacific Fishery Management Council\u2019s proposed allocation of the whiting harvest between the shoreside and at-sea processing sectors. The Council had proposed that up to 74 percent of the 1993 harvest be allocated to those fishing vessels delivering their catch to shoreside processors and that the rest be made available to vessels delivering their catch to at-sea processors. After much deliberation, Commerce\u2014one day before the opening of the 1993 fishing season\u2014approved an allocation of 30 percent to the shoreside sector and 70 percent to the at-sea sector. GAO concludes that the allocation decision for the 1993 Pacific whiting harvest was made in accordance with federal agency decision-making procedures and regulations. Commerce rejected the Council\u2019s recommendation because of inadequate support. The timing of the decision, which differed little from the timing of the 1992 decision, was the result of the considerable time that federal officials spent deliberating the Council\u2019s proposed shift in the 1993 allocation between the two processing centers.", "Ocean Research Vessels: NOAA Fleet Modernization Plan. GAO/T-RCED-94-52. October 21, 1993.", "ABSTRACT: The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s (NOAA) $1.9 billion fleet modernization plan calls for acquiring 24 new or refurbished vessels during a 15-year period. Several reports, including those from GAO and the Department of Commerce, have encouraged NOAA to use more private sector ship services to cut costs. So far, however, NOAA has used contracting on a very limited basis, and its fleet modernization plan makes few provisions for vessel contracting. NOAA needs to experiment with contracting and leasing options to determine whether the private sector can effectively meet NOAA\u2019s mission requirements. In experimenting with contracting, NOAA will need to grant contractors flexibility in how they do the work so that NOAA obtains the cost and operational data it needs to determine the extent that contracting can meet mission needs.", "Endangered Species: Public Comments Received on Proposed Listings. GAO/RCED-93-220BR. September 30, 1993.", "ABSTRACT: One issue likely to be debated during the reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act is whether a scientific peer review is needed of decisions to list species as endangered and threatened under the act. The act requires that these decisions be based on the best available scientific and commercial data, and peer review has been suggested as a way to ensure this. This briefing report provides information on the public comments that were provided in response to species\u2019 being proposed for listing, the extent and nature of questions raised about the biological basis for the proposed listings, and the frequency of public hearings on proposed listings. GAO also discusses the number of petitions to list, delist, or reclassify species that the Fish and Wildlife Service found not merited.", "Protected Species: Marine Mammals\u2019 Predation of Varieties of Fish. GAO/RCED-93-204. September 10, 1993.", "ABSTRACT: According to government officials, the hunting of steelhead salmon by California sea lions at Ballard Locks in Seattle, Washington, is the only documented case in which predation by one species is threatening the existence of another, although federal officials suspect that the adverse predation of fish by protected seals may also be occurring at the Columbia River and in the state of Maine. Efforts to counteract the predation at Ballard Lock, including relocating the sea lions and driving them away from the locks, have been unsuccessful. Other possible options include capturing and holding the sea lions during the steelhead\u2019s migration and making structural changes to the locks and the accompanying spillway. The National Marine Fisheries Service has considered but rejected the possibility of controlling the sea lion population through lethal means.", "Natural Resources Restoration: Use of Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Settlement Funds. GAO/RCED-93-206BR. August 20, 1993.", "ABSTRACT: Under the civil settlement stemming from the 1989 grounding of the supertanker Exxon Valdez\u2014the largest oil spill in U.S. history\u2014Exxon agreed to pay a total of $900 million in 11 annual payments. Under the criminal settlement, Exxon was fined $150 million and required to pay $50 million each to the federal government and the state of Alaska to help restore areas damaged by the spill. This briefing report provides information on the amount and distribution of money that Exxon has paid through December 1992 under the settlements. GAO also discusses issues surrounding the functioning of the Trustee Council, which was created to coordinate damage assessments and to seek funds from responsible parties to clean up natural resources. GAO concludes that Alaska and federal trustees managing the oil spill settlement funds will have to address several issues before there can be confidence that the money is being spent for natural resources restoration and other intended purposes.", "Endangered Species: Factors Associated With Delayed Listing Decisions. GAO/RCED-93-152. August 5, 1993.", "ABSTRACT: Delays by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) in listing six species as either threatened or endangered were due to several factors, the most common of which were FWS concerns about the sufficiency of biological data and concerns about potential economic and other impacts. GAO found that the conservation agreements for the Bruneau Hot Springsnail and the Jemez Mountains salamander were inconsistent with FWS policy and guidance. Whether a conservation agreement is an appropriate means of protecting species that would otherwise warrant listing is a decision for FWS to make. On the basis of its findings, however, GAO concludes that a conservation agreement, if it is to be an effective alternative to listing, should (1) address known threats to a species that would otherwise warrant listing, (2) provide for monitoring to ensure that the agreement\u2019s mechanisms for protecting the species are properly and fully implemented, and (3) be implemented in a timely manner.", "Species Protection: National Marine Fisheries Service Enforcement Efforts. GAO/RCED-93-127BR. June 21, 1993.", "ABSTRACT: During 1991 congressional hearings, shrimp fishermen from the Gulf of Mexico complained that federal agencies were overly aggressive in enforcing regulations requiring turtle eluder devices, which create a hole in shrimp nets allowing trapped turtles to escape. This briefing report examines how enforcement practices under the Endangered Species Act compare with the enforcement of other fisheries and marine protection laws. GAO presents statistical data on the level of federal agencies\u2019 enforcement efforts and penalties assessed to enforce four major fisheries and marine species protection laws in the southeastern United States.", "Wetlands Protection: The Scope of the Section 404 Program Remains Uncertain. GAO/RCED-93-26. April 6, 1993.", "ABSTRACT: The environmental benefits of swamps, marshes, and bogs\u2014long considered fit only for draining and filling\u2014are increasingly recognized today. Wetlands provide vital habitat for wildlife as well as improve water quality and control soil erosion. How to protect these areas has become a major regulatory issue in the 1990s. Under the Section 404 program, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is in charge of granting permits to anyone wanting to dredge and fill in navigable waters, including wetlands. GAO made several suggestions in a July 1988 report (GAO/RCED-88-110) on how the Corps could improve program management. This report discusses (1) the extent to which the Corps has acted on GAO\u2019s recommendations, (2) legislative and other developments that have occurred since the 1988 report that affect the program, and (3) the extent to which budgetary constraints have affected program administration.", "Endangered Species: Potential Economic Costs of Further Protection for Columbia River Salmon. GAO/RCED-93-41. February 23, 1993.", "ABSTRACT: Despite federal and regional outlays of more than $1.3 billion to improve salmon runs in the Columbia River Basin, certain salmon stocks\u2014especially those that spawn far upstream in the Snake River and its tributaries\u2014have reached critically low levels. As a result, the Snake River sockeye salmon was designated an endangered species in 1991, while the Snake River fall chinook and spring/summer chinook were listed as threatened species the following year. In looking into the potential economic costs and effectiveness of efforts to protect these salmon stocks, GAO found that a preliminary estimate of lost jobs due to salmon protection will be unavailable until mid-1993 at the earliest. However, preliminary estimates of the value of goods and services foregone\u2014a measure of net economic costs\u2014suggest that the economic costs of salmon protection may range from $2 million to as high as $211 million annually. According to the more than 300 agencies and organizations GAO contacted, no studies address how effective any of the proposed protection measures may be in increasing the number of adult salmon returning to spawn. Past evaluation of measures to maintain and improve salmon runs either did not address the issue or were inconclusive.", "Wildlife Management: Many Issues Unresolved in Yellowstone Bison-Cattle Brucellosis Conflict. GAO/RCED-93-2. October 21, 1992.", "ABSTRACT: Montana succeeded in eradicating brucellosis from its cattle herds in 1985, allowing Montana ranchers to ship their cattle to other states without first testing them for the disease. Cattlemen are concerned about the possibility that brucellosis, a contagious disease that can cause abortions and infertility in domestic cattle, may be spread from Yellowstone Park\u2019s free-roaming bison and elk herds to livestock grazing along the park borders, thereby jeopardizing Montana\u2019s ability to freely transport cattle across state lines. Although its policy is not to restrict the movement of the park\u2019s bison and elk, the National Park Service has, in an attempt to reduce the risk of brucellosis transmission, killed more than 10,000 bison that have wandered out of the park in recent years. This report provides information on the (1) scientific evidence that brucellosis can be transmitted from bison and elk to domestic cattle, (2) economic damage that might arise from such transmission, and (3) management alternatives for preventing or reducing the likelihood of such transmission.", "Natural Resources Protection: Reelfoot Lake Lease Terms Met, but Lake Continues to Deteriorate. GAO/RCED-92-99. August 17, 1992.", "ABSTRACT: Under an agreement signed in 1941, the Fish and Wildlife Service assumed responsibility for maintaining Reelfoot Lake, the largest natural lake in Tennessee, including controlling siltation and the growth of undesirable vegetation. Because the lake, which is used extensively by fishermen, boaters, and wildlife enthusiasts, captures drainage from adjacent eroding cropland, it has been silting up over the years and is increasingly swampy in areas; today, more than 40 percent of the lake is three feet deep or less. This report (1) discusses the extent to which the Fish and Wildlife Service has complied with terms of the lease agreement and (2) identifies the main causes of the lake\u2019s deterioration, options for improving the lake\u2019s condition, and barriers to implementing these options.", "Coastal Barriers: Development Occurring Despite Prohibition Against Federal Assistance. GAO/RCED-92-115. July 17, 1992.", "ABSTRACT: Coastal islands buffer the U.S. mainland from hurricanes and are an important source of habitat for fish and wildlife, including some endangered species. More and more islands, despite being highly unstable, are being developed because of their natural beauty and the dwindling supply of beachfront property. This development has also been spurred by the availability of national flood insurance and other federal assistance. Congress, in an effort to cut down on environmental damage and the government\u2019s exposure to losses from storm damage, passed legislation a decade ago that prohibits new federal financial assistance on most coastal islands. Although this legislation has discouraged development on some coastal islands and other islands are unlikely to be developed any time soon because they are either inaccessible or unsuitable for building, significant development has occurred since 1982 in some attractive and accessible islands. Extensive new development can be expected in these and similar areas in the future. Most federal agencies have not provided new financial assistance for the coastal islands. Two exceptions involve the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which underwrote flood insurance obtained by ineligible property owners, and the Air Force, which granted an easement on land within Florida\u2019s Eglin Air Force Base at no cost to a quasi-state agency that wanted to build a bridge to one of the coastal islands. GAO also discovered that permits issued by agencies such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have allowed development on certain coastal islands.", "Endangered Species: Contract Funding For Selected Species. GAO/RCED-92-218. July 17, 1992.", "ABSTRACT: GAO looked at whether individuals or groups that petition the Fish and Wildlife Service to put plants and animals on the endangered species list later receive agency funds to study those same plants and animals. According to Fish and Wildlife Service officials, agency contracting policies do not prohibit petitioners from receiving Endangered Species Act funding to study the same species for which they have submitted petitions. Of the 228 contracts for studying endangered species that GAO examined, 38 had been awarded to study the same species covered by the petitions. But in only one case was a petitioner associated with a Fish and Wildlife Service award. In this instance, the principal investigator for the organization receiving funding was the same person who had petitioned for the species to be placed on the endangered species list.", "Endangered Species: Past Actions Taken to Assist Columbia River Salmon. GAO/RCED-92-173BR. July 13, 1992.", "ABSTRACT: Concerns about declining populations of wild salmon prompted the National Marine Fisheries Service to list several kinds of Snake River salmon as either endangered or threatened species. This briefing report examines past efforts to reverse declines in salmon runs. GAO discusses the actions, and their costs, that federal agencies and organizations in the Pacific Northwest have taken to maintain and restore runs of salmon\u2014both wild and hatchery-bred. GAO also discusses the results of studies and research on the effectiveness of the salmon recovery measures undertaken.", "Hydroelectric Dams: Proposed Legislation to Restore Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries. GAO/T-RCED-92-80. July 9, 1992.", "BACKGROUND: GAO discussed the Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act, focusing on: (1) the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\u2019s (FERC) authority to license dams on the Elwha River; (2) the Department of the Interior\u2019s position on removal of the dams to restore fisheries; and (3) who should pay the costs if the dams are removed. GAO noted that: (1) the Glines Canyon Dam is within the boundaries of a national park, where FERC does not have the authority to license dams; (2) Interior, FERC, and the National Marine Fisheries Service believe that removing both dams offers the best prospects for restoring the Elwha River fisheries and their surrounding ecosystem; and (3) the cost of removing the dams should be allocated among parties in proportion to the benefits they have received from the dams or will receive from the restoration of the river.", "Hydroelectric Dams: Interior Favors Removing Elwha River Dams, but Who Should Pay Is Undecided. GAO/RCED-92-168. June 5, 1992.", "ABSTRACT: The Department of the Interior\u2019s position is that in order to restore fisheries in the Elwha River, two dams will have to be removed. As of May 1992, Interior has not worked out with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission whether the dams should be removed and who should pay for the cost of removing them. Proposed legislation before Congress would involve federal acquisition of the two dams and subsequent comprehensive analysis of the most effective and reliable alternative for fully restoring, enhancing, and protecting the ecosystem, fisheries, and wildlife of the Elwha River basin. GAO believes that a better understanding of the estimated costs and potential liabilities would provide for more informed public policy decisions on whether and how best to restore the ecosystem and fisheries of the Elwha River and who should be responsible for paying the costs of restoration. GAO summarized this report in testimony before Congress; see: Hydroelectric Dams: Proposed Legislation to Restore Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries, by Keith O. Fultz, Director of Planning and Reporting in the Resources, Community, and Economic Development Division, before subcommittees of the House Committee on Merchant Marines and Fisheries. GAO/T-RCED-92-80, July 9, 1992 (10 pages).", "Endangered Species Act: Types and Number of Implementing Actions. GAO/RCED-92-131BR. May 8, 1992.", "ABSTRACT: This briefing report examines how two federal agencies\u2014the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)\u2014have implemented the Endangered Species Act of 1973, which sets forth processes for protecting plants and animals. Habitat designation has taken place for less than 20 percent of the species listed as endangered. Agency officials doubt whether designating critical habitats provides much additional benefit for a species, and critical habitat designation is considered a low priority. During fiscal years 1987 through 1991, when other federal agencies asked FWS or NMFS to consider the effect of proposed actions such as construction on a listed species, the two agencies allowed such projects to proceed as planned more than 90 percent of the time. While more than 650 domestic species are on the endangered species list, 600 others are recognized by the agencies as potentially imperiled. At the present pace of listing, it will take FWS until 2006 to list these species as endangered or threatened. Compounding this problem are the estimated 3,000 additional species that may be threatened or endangered in the future. The agencies attribute their slowness to resource constraints.", "Great Lakes Fishery Commission: Actions Needed to Support an Expanded Program. GAO/NSIAD-92-108. March 9, 1992.", "ABSTRACT: Sea lampreys, eel-like parasites that prey on fish, are native to the Atlantic Ocean but gained entry to the Great Lakes through the Erie Canal in the late 19th century. In response to concerns about decimated fish stocks, the Great Lakes Fishery Commission was created in 1955 to check the sea lamprey population. This report discusses (1) whether the Commission, a joint U.S.-Canadian venture, uses an ecosystem management approach that considers the potential harmful effects of sea lamprey control efforts; (2) what progress the Commission has made in adopting nonchemical methods to control the sea lamprey; and (3) if the Commission could effectively spend more funding on research for alternative control methods.", "Wildlife Protection: Enforcement of Federal Laws Could Be Strengthened. GAO/T-RCED-92-26. February 3, 1992.", "ABSTRACT: Federal statutes and international treaties give the Department of the Interior\u2019s Fish and Wildlife Service adequate authority to protect wildlife. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act does not, however, give the Service the authority to conduct a search and seizure without a warrant, as do other laws protecting wildlife. GAO continues to believe that it would enhance the Service\u2019s enforcement authority if the act were amended to provide such search and seizure authority. The Service investigates more than 10,000 suspected violations each year and maintains a conviction rate averaging more than 90 percent for cases prepared for prosecution. The agency cannot, however, investigate many more suspected violations or respond to state requests to participate in certain investigations because (1) it has a limited number of agents and (2) many of these agents are deskbound for months at a time due to insufficient operating funds. Further, the Service lacks readily available information on suspected violations and other enforcement activities that could help to justify needed resources. Although Interior is developing an information system capable of recording suspected crimes against wildlife, it also needs to (1) ensure that its agents report all known or suspected violations, whether they are investigated or not, and (2) document all state requests for assistance. This information should then be used to substantiate the resources the Service needs to carry out its law enforcement activities effectively.", "Natural Resources Damage Assessment: Information on Study of Seabirds Killed by Exxon Valdez Oil Spill. GAO/RCED-92-22. November 27, 1991.", "ABSTRACT: In the wake of the March 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska\u2019s Prince William Sound, a federally funded study sought to estimate the number of seabirds killed as a result of the accident. This was one of more than 50 damage assessment studies that sought to determine the impact of the spill on natural resources and develop a restoration strategy. The most controversial aspect of the seabird study involved killing 219 seabirds, immersing them in oil, placing them in Prince William Sound, and tracking their drift patterns to discover the number of birds recovered versus the number lost at sea. This report provides information on (1) the request and approval of the seabird damage study and (2) the study\u2019s methodology, which required killing more than 200 seabirds.", "Wetlands Overview: Federal and State Policies, Legislation, and Programs. GAO/RCED-92-79FS. November 22, 1991.", "ABSTRACT: In recent years, the value of wetlands\u2014such as providing fish and wildlife habitat and abating erosion\u2014have become better known. Unfortunately, an estimated 50 percent of all wetlands in the lower 48 states have already been filled or drained, and another 290,000 acres are being lost annually to agriculture and development. This fact sheet provides an overview of federal and state wetlands-related policies, legislation, and programs.", "Wetlands Preservation: Easements Are Protecting Prairie Potholes but Some Improvements Are Possible. GAO/RCED-92-27. November 7, 1991.", "ABSTRACT: Wetlands protected under the Small Wetlands Acquisition Program are located mainly in the Prairie Pothole Region in the upper Middle West, including parts of Montana, the Dakotas, Iowa, and Minnesota. Prairie potholes are shallow, freshwater depressions and marshes that were created by glaciers thousands of years ago. Loss of such habitat is a major reason why populations of some duck species, such as mallards and pintails, have declined about 60 percent over the past 50 years. The Small Wetlands Acquisition Program has successfully helped preserve wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region, primarily because the Fish and Wildlife Service has effectively enforced easements on wetlands. GAO believes that the program could be made even better if the Fish and Wildlife Service were to correct weaknesses in the (1) documentation of waterfowl\u2019s use of wetlands under easement and (2) guidance involving the timeliness with which damaged wetlands are restored and the circumstances under which violators should be issued notices and assessed fines.", "Wilderness Management: Accountability for Forest Service Funds Needs Improvement. GAO/RCED-92-33. November 4, 1991.", "ABSTRACT: To help ensure that Forest Service wilderness areas are protected and maintained in their natural state, Congress increased funding for wilderness management by almost 80 percent during fiscal years 1989 through 1991. The Forest Service, however, diverted more than one-third of the $44.7 million designated for wilderness management to other activities. Of the $28.3 million spent on wilderness management, $10.5 million was used for management expenses\u2014mainly salaries and administrative costs\u2014at organizational levels above the district offices, with the remainder spent on wilderness management at the district level. The Forest Service reported that 112 of the 500 district offices managing wilderness areas saw cuts in funding for fiscal year 1990, including some offices that had earlier reported funding and staffing shortfalls. Contrary to congressional directives, the Forest Service reprogrammed these funds without seeking prior approval by the House Committee on Appropriations. The head of the Forest Service recently outlined several steps to ensure that (1) designated funds are spent as Congress intended, (2) the Committee\u2019s reprogramming procedures are followed, and (3) there is greater accountability over funds designated for wilderness management. In addition, GAO suggests that the Forest Service refine its accounting for expenditures and establish output targets to improve accountability over expenditures of wilderness management funds and the performance of wilderness managers.", "Oil Reserve: Impact of NPR-1 Operations on Wildlife and Water Is Uncertain. GAO/RCED-91-129. August 1, 1991.", "BACKGROUND: Pursuant to a congressional request, GAO reviewed the basis for the disagreements between the Department of Energy (DOE) and its Argonne National Laboratory relating to Argonne\u2019s development of a supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS) for Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 1 (NPR-1), focusing on: (1) the DOE Naval Petroleum Reserves-California (NPRC) and Argonne positions on NPR-1 impacts on endangered species and groundwater quality and how SEIS would discuss those uncertainties; and (2) NPR-1 compliance with environmental laws and regulations governing endangered species, wastewater disposal, and historic preservation activities.", "FINDINGS: GAO found that: (1) between 1981 and 1989, the number of foxes living free within the NPR-1 study area decreased from 164 to between 44 and 58; (2) Argonne concluded in a SEIS draft that NPR-1 operations could have contributed to the decline of foxes in that area; (3) NPRC and Argonne staffs disagreed about how SEIS should describe the effects of NPR-1 operations on endangered foxes and nearby groundwater, primarily due to a lack of definitive data; (4) in September 1990, NPRC notified Argonne that DOE would prepare final SEIS, but it was unclear to what extent DOE would use Argonne\u2019s data and views; (5) DOE and others were conducting research that could provide additional data on factors affecting the fox population and wastewater migration; (6) DOE has not ensured that NPR-1 operations comply with the Endangered Species Act and the National Historic Preservation Act\u2019s regulations; (7) Argonne concluded in a June 1990 SEIS draft that NPR-1 operations violated California wastewater disposal requirements for sumping, but DOE believed that NPR-1 had not violated the requirements, and the state had not made a determination on that issue; (8) factors contributing to the noncompliance included NPRC officials\u2019 lack of knowledge regarding environmental requirements, noncoordination with federal and state agencies having environmental responsibilities, and mismanagement, which could result in legal action, fines, or a temporary shutdown; and (9) NPRC is taking action to address the problems, but unless DOE improves its management controls, similar problems may continue to exist.", "National Forests: Funding Fish and Wildlife Projects.

In 1994, more than 100,000 predators were killed by the program\u2019s field personnel. GAO found that Agriculture field personnel in California, Nevada, Texas, and Wyoming used lethal methods in essentially all instances to control livestock predators. Agriculture\u2019s written policies and procedures call for field personnel to give preference to the use of nonlethal methods when practical and effective. However, according to program officials, this aspect of written guidance does not apply to the control of livestock predators.

GAO found that the four primary federal land management agencies\u2014the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Forest Service\u2014have started to implement ecosystem management. In addition, the administration\u2019s fiscal year 1995 budget request includes $700 million for ecosystem management initiatives. GAO recognizes that, compared with the existing federal approach to land management, ecosystem management may require greater flexibility in planning; in budgeting, authorizing, and appropriating funds; and in adapting management on the basis of new information. However, GAO believes that if ecosystem management implementation is to move forward, it must advance beyond unclear priorities and broad principles.

GAO concludes that current livestock grazing activity on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) allotments in hot desert areas risks long-term environmental damage while not generating enough revenues to provide for adequate management. According to recent data, the economic benefits derived from livestock grazing on BLM lands in the hot desert areas are minimal. The primary economic benefits accrue to about 1,000 livestock operators who hold livestock grazing permit in these areas. Yet many of these operators derive little income from ranching the public lands, who instead place a premium on the traditional lifestyle they are able to maintain via the permits. Conversely, other public land users value the use of desert lands for environmental preservation and recreation. GAO found that BLM lacks the staff needed to collect and evaluate data measuring the impact of livestock grazing on many desert allotments. Without these data, BLM is in no position to assess livestock usage of desert allotments and change usage as needed.", "Surface Mining: Management of the Abandoned Mine Land Fund. GAO/RCED-91-192.

FINDINGS: GAO found that: (1) although NRDC and BLM reports reached different conclusions on the overall condition of the public rangeland, they were not necessarily inconsistent with each other; (2) the different conclusions were attributable more to data interpretation and presentation than to differences in the data; (3) BLM based its conclusion that current range conditions are better than they have been in the past century on studies that lacked supporting documentation and used different methodologies; (4) had BLM calculated its percentages solely on the basis of the land for which it had condition information, as NRDC did, its percentage of rangeland in fair or poor condition would have increased to 61 percent, much closer to the NRDC percentage; and (5) NRDC concluded that the data presented in its report did not show any significant improvement in rangeland condition over the data in its 1985 rangeland status report, and BLM noted that no substantial change should be expected to occur within only a 4-year period.", "Public Land Management: Observations on Management of Federal Wild Horse Program.

GAO/RCED-95-56. December 29, 1994.", "ABSTRACT: The Bureau of Land Management\u2019s (BLM) internal controls cannot guarantee that federal oil and gas leases are not issued to parties who have exceeded the Mineral Leasing Act\u2019s acreage limitation. BLM allows oil and gas lessees to self-certify that they have not exceeded the acreage limitation, and although the agency has procedures for auditing compliance with the requirement, BLM has not done a compliance audit since 1993 because it considers it a low priority. Even when audits were done, BLM\u2019s strategy for selecting lessees was ineffective because it did not target parties for approaching or appearing to exceed the acreage limitation. Finally, BLM has allowed companies that share the same officers, directors, or major stockholders to be considered separate leaseholders under the acreage limitation. GAO discovered one lessee who had exceeded the limitation by more than 190,000 acres in Wyoming and by nearly 27,000 acres in Nevada. Similarly, by presuming that companies are affiliated when they share the same officers, directors, or major stockholders, GAO identified five firms whose aggregate acreage exceeded the limit by more than 800,000 acres in Wyoming, 435,000 acres in New Mexico, and 86,000 acres in Nevada.", "Mineral Resources: Federal Coal-Leasing Program Needs Strengthening.

GAO/RCED-94-126. May 24, 1994.", "ABSTRACT: The government-owned and operated Naval Petroleum Reserve (NPR) in Elk Hills, California\u2014the seventh largest oil field in the lower 48 states\u2014generated oil sales revenues of $327 million in 1992. The Energy Department (DOE) sells most of this oil to California refiners through competitive bids. The prices received by the government for this oil have been lower than prices for crude oil in other parts of the country. GAO concludes that it will be difficult for DOE to boost revenues from NPR oil sales by selling oil to Gulf Coast or midcontinent oil refineries because this oil is of lower quality than other available crudes and shipping costs are high. This report explores other ways that DOE may be able to increase revenues. For example, DOE bills its customers more often than private oil producers do, resulting in buyers making lower bids to compensate for the higher administrative costs. DOE also does not market its oil as aggressively as private producers do. In testimony before Congress, GAO summarized this report and also discussed (1) the relative priority that should be given to several options for improving the readiness and expansion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and (2) the evolving mission of the International Energy Agency; see: Energy Policy: Energy Policy and Conservation Act Reauthorization, by Victor S.

In addition, the bill would repay the helium program debt. Whether the federal budget will be helped or harmed by this legislation will depend on whether private industry can sell refined helium to the government at a lower price. Revenues from the disposal of the existing helium inventory could also affect the federal budget. The choice between Interior and the private industry to meet federal helium needs is ultimately a public policy decision.

Given the uncertainties of future economic variables, such as oil prices and discount rates, GAO believes that Interior should have developed ranges of minimum economic field size estimates for each prospect and then run its model using the derived field sizes.

This legislation allows individuals to stake claims on federal lands and mine ore, including copper, gold, and silver, without compensating the government. In contrast, the government has been receiving royalties for coal and natural gas on federal lands since the 1920s. Congress has considered but has yet to amend the law to ensure that the public receives a fair return for minerals extracted.

GAO/RCED-93-3. October 29, 1992.", "ABSTRACT: During the past several years, the Department of the Interior has been collecting about $4 billion in royalties each year from oil and gas companies that hold mineral leases on federal or Indian lands. Although the Minerals Management Service (MMS) has substantially improved its strategy for auditing royalty payers, these audits still do not provide reasonable assurances that such royalty payments comply with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. The amount of royalties actually audited or verified is very small, increasing the likelihood that noncompliance will go undetected. In addition, the judgmental samples are not representative of all payers and leases; consequently, MMS cannot determine with any degree of confidence such things as the level of compliance by payers or the magnitude of underpayment\u2014that is, the royalties at risk. MMS can, however, require payers to do the additional work needed to correct the system problems found by audits and to compute any additional royalties due.

GAO/RCED-91-1. September 17, 1991.", "ABSTRACT: To prevent the concentration of control over federal oil and gas resources in a few companies or individuals, Congress has limited number of acres of oil and gas leases that one party may control in a single state. An exception to this limitation involves lease acreage within the boundaries of development contracts. These contracts permit oil and gas lease operators and pipeline companies to contract with enough lessees to economically justify large-scale drilling operations for the production and transportation of oil and gas, subject to approval by the Secretary of the Interior, who must find that such contracts are in the public interest. Since 1986 Interior has entered into or approved 10 contracts with 12 lease operators for exploration of largely unleased federal lands\u2014ranging from about 180,000 to 3.5 million acres in four western states\u2014and has designated them as developmental contracts. GAO believes that the 10 contracts do not satisfy the legal requirements for development contracts because they are for oil and gas exploration on largely unleased federal lands, rather than for developing existing leases. By designating the 10 contracts as development contracts, Interior has enabled 9 of the 12 contract parties to accumulate lease acreage that vastly exceeds the statutory acreage limitation. All nine of the contract parties were major or large independent oil companies. As a result, other parties who wish to participate in developing federal oil and gas resources within the four states may be adversely affected because the parties to Interior\u2019s contracts have been able to compete for and obtain lease acreage beyond the statutory acreage limitation. Although Interior believes that the Secretary has the discretion under law to use development contracts in the current manner, in April 1989 it ceased issuing these contracts pending completion of GAO\u2019s review. Congress needs to resolve the matter by amending mineral leasing laws to expressly permit or prohibit Interior to enter into or approve development contracts for oil and gas on largely unleased federal lands or to increase or remove the acreage limitation.", "Trans-Alaska Pipeline: Regulators Have Not Ensured That Government Requirements Are Being Met.

December 23, 1994.", "ABSTRACT: Before the Red Rock Dam and Lake Project near Des Moines, Iowa, began operating in 1969, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers purchased easements from landowners on 29,000 acres within the reservoir\u2019s boundary. The easements give the Corps the right to occasionally flood the easement lands when the dam is forced to hold back water upstream in the reservoir to prevent flooding downstream. Because of heavier-than-expected rainfall during the 1970s and 1980s, the easement lands were flooded more often than the Corps had estimated. In 1985, Congress authorized a buyout program for easement landowners who were willing to sell their land to the Corps; however, few owners have been interested in selling, and their complaints about flooding have persisted. This report (1) determines whether the property within the Red Rock reservoir\u2019s boundary has been inundated beyond the levels permitted by the easements; (2) recommends whether compensation for the easements should be renegotiated with landowners; and (3) reports on actions that the Corps has taken to implement the buyout program.", "Water Markets: Increasing Federal Revenues Through Water Transfers. GAO/RCED-94-164. September 21, 1994.", "ABSTRACT: Most water in the arid western United States delivered through federal projects is used for agriculture, but the demand for water for urban, recreational, and environmental uses is growing. The federal government plays a role in water management in the arid West mainly through water resource projects. Water transfer, in which rights to use water are bought and sold, is seen by many resource economists as a way to reallocate scarce water to new users by allowing those who place the highest economic value on it to purchase it. Those who want more water\u2014such as municipalities\u2014often are willing to pay considerably higher prices for it than the current users, and irrigators who receive subsidized water from federal projects may want to transfer this water to a municipality at a profit. At the same time, these transactions may allow the Bureau of Reclamation to share in the profits.

GAO noted that: (1) most states benefit from the program, but some states use the program more actively than others; (2) Rural Development Administration (RDA) grants generally may not exceed 75 percent of a project\u2019s costs, and rural communities must fund the remaining costs; (3) RDA may fund up to 100 percent of project costs in communities whose residents face significant health risks; (4) RDA has obligated about $25 million of the $50 million in grant funds that Congress specifically targeted for the border states for fiscal years (FY) 1993 and 1994; and (5) RDA anticipates that it will soon begin obligating portions of the FY 1994 grant funds targeted for rural Alaskan villages.", "Water Transfers: More Efficient Water Use Possible, If Problems Are Addressed. GAO/RCED-94-35. May 23, 1994.", "ABSTRACT: Debates over how water from western federal water projects should be used have become more heated in recent years. Farmers use more than 80 percent of the western water withdrawn for use. Environmental problems, such as selenium contamination and salinity, have been linked to agricultural irrigation. Moreover, as urban populations, tourism, and environmental awareness continue to grow, the demand for water increases for cities, recreation, and fish and wildlife habitats. Building dams to meet new demand is often not an option because of their high price tags and harmful environmental effects. Advocated by resource economists and others, water markets, in which rights to use water are bought and sold, would allocate water to its highest economic use by allowing those who place the highest economic value on it to buy it. This report examines (1) the costs and benefits of water transfers; (2) how water markets might be structured to address the impacts on parties outside of transfers; (3) the legal, institutional, and other issues that would need to be addressed to implement a federal water market; and (4) how transfers of water from federal projects could be coordinated with state law.", "Water Subsidies: Impact of Higher Irrigation Rates on Central Valley Project Farmers. GAO/RCED-94-8.

The fixed rates, however, no longer function as intended; they do not cover Interior\u2019s operating costs and have not been enough to repay virtually any of the $1 billion in construction costs owed. Moreover, environmental and water use problems have been linked to the irrigation carried out under these contracts. Studies by agricultural economists suggest that higher water prices would increase irrigation efficiency and conservation, thereby reducing environmental degradation caused by irrigation and freeing up water now used for irrigation for other uses. This report (1) estimates the impact on farm profits of the higher irrigation rates mandated under 1992 legislation and of further rate increases under various scenarios, (2) estimates the financial benefits to the federal government of increasing the irrigation rates, and (3) determines how farmers can mitigate the impact of higher rates.", "Central Utah Project Cost Allocations. GAO/RCED-94-65R. January 25, 1994.", "BACKGROUND: Pursuant to a legislative requirement, GAO reviewed the development of cost accounting standards for the Department of the Interior to follow in allocating costs for the Central Utah Project (CUP). GAO found that: (1) the cost accounting standards developed by the Cost Accounting Standards Board provide a sound basis for allocating CUP costs and additional standards are not needed; (2) its audit of the CUP cost allocation will determine whether Interior\u2019s cost allocation methodology is based on the Board\u2019s standards and whether Interior properly applies the cost allocation methodology; and (3) the Bureau of Reclamation\u2019s experience with the Central Valley Project\u2019s cost allocation should be helpful to Interior in allocating CUP costs.", "Bureau of Reclamation: Information on the Federal Financial Commitment and Repayment Status of the Central Arizona Project.

October 11, 1993.", "ABSTRACT: This testimony focuses on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 management of the Missouri River reservoir system under drought conditions during 1989-90. GAO concludes that the Corps acted consistently with its drought contingency plan in releasing water from the reservoir system during the three-year period and that all of the purposes served by the reservoirs, except flood control, were harmed. The plan does not reflect current economic conditions in the Missouri River Basin. Contrary to the Corps\u2019 beliefs, federal statutes do not require the Corps to give recreation a lower priority than other project purposes\u2014flood control, navigation, irrigation, and hydroelectric power\u2014in deciding on water releases. Congress should consider legislation that would require the Corps to set priorities for operating its reservoir projects on the basis of the economic, environmental, social, and other benefits of all authorized purposes.", "Water Resources: Factors That Lead to Successful Cost Sharing in Corps Projects.

August 12, 1993.", "ABSTRACT: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is required to develop a cost-sharing partnership with local sponsors of water projects that provide flood control, water supply, hydroelectric power, and recreation. The sponsors are generally local and state governments or other government groups, such as flood control districts or port authorities. GAO surveyed sponsors and found that the following three factors contributed most significantly to a successful relationship: (1) good communications between the Corps and the sponsor, (2) the sponsor\u2019s significant involvement in decisions and activities, and (3) the Corps\u2019 responses to the sponsor\u2019s concerns about cost-sharing agreements. Sponsors were concerned about their inability to pay their share of study or project costs. The inability to pay generally related to flood control/damage projects in the Dallas and Chicago regions. The sponsors\u2019 other main concern involved changes in the cost-sharing agreements at different Corps review levels.", "Clean Water Act: Private Property Takings Claims as a Result of the Section 404 Program.

GAO/RCED-93-117. June 8, 1993.", "ABSTRACT: Collecting and reporting data on drought conditions in the United States is a collaborative, multilevel effort led by the federal government. State and local governments make important contributions of work and funding to this effort. Federal, state, and other users are generally satisfied with the data on drought that are collected and distributed by federal agencies. No permanent federal organization is responsible for monitoring drought conditions and planning the government\u2019s response. Instead, individual agencies carry out these activities and arrange to cooperate with one another. When drought has been severe or has had widespread geographic impact, temporary interagency committees have been set up to coordinate the response. Because of the increasingly severe effects that periodic droughts have had on the economy, however, temporary committees may no longer be able to handle the long-term planning needed for such droughts, promptly resolve policy differences among federal agencies, or coordinate the federal response to drought.", "Water Resources: Highfield Water Company Should Not Receive Compensation From the U.S. Army. GAO/RCED-93-49. May 10, 1993.", "ABSTRACT: The Highfield Water Company has claimed that it should receive between $17.7 million and $52 million from the U.S. Army as compensation for lost property and damages. Highfield argues that Fort Ritchie, located in Maryland, excessively pumped the aquifer during periods of drought between 1974 and 1978, thereby depriving the company of water it needed to meet its customers\u2019 needs. As a result, the Maryland Public Service Commission revoked the company\u2019s right to exercise its franchise to sell water to its customers. Highfield is appealing for legislative relief, asserting that it has never received a fair hearing on the merits of its case since court actions were dismissed on technical grounds. After reviewing the case, GAO concludes that Highfield was not damaged by the Fort\u2019s reasonable use of the groundwater and that Highfield neither owned nor had superior rights to the water. As a result, GAO does not believe that Highfield is entitled to any compensation from the Army.", "Water Resources: The Corps of Engineers\u2019 Dredging Program for Small Business Firms.

GAO/RCED-92-89. July 17, 1992.", "ABSTRACT: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has built 26 confined disposal facilities since 1974 to hold bottom sediment dredged from harbors, channels, and other waterways in the Great Lakes area. This mud often contains contaminants, such as chemicals from industry or agricultural runoff, that require special handling. Six of the facilities are already filled to capacity, and 18 others are expected to be filled by 2006. Twelve more facilities are planned, and more sites will be needed in the foreseeable future. The Corps is now deciding whether it or state and local governments should pay the construction costs. Construction of more facilities is at a virtual standstill. Because of concerns from communities and environmental groups, finding suitable disposal sites for contaminated dredged material has been difficult and time-consuming. As a result, the Corps has deferred some dredging and commercial and recreational navigation in some areas has been harmed.", "Bureau of Reclamation: Central Valley Project Cost Allocation Overdue and New Method Needed. GAO/RCED-92-74. March 31, 1992.", "ABSTRACT: This report examines how the Bureau of Reclamation allocates construction costs for the Central Valley Project. Located in California\u2019s Central Valley Basin, the project is the Bureau\u2019s largest water resource project, with authorized construction costs totaling more than $6.5 billion as of September 1990. While primarily devoted to irrigation, the project also provides flood control, hydroelectric power, and recreation uses. GAO (1) discusses the status of the Bureau\u2019s effort to reallocate project costs in accordance with a 1986 congressional mandate, (2) describes the Bureau\u2019s current cost allocation method, and (3) discusses alternative cost allocation methods.", "Water Resources: Corps\u2019 Management of Ongoing Drought in the Missouri River Basin. GAO/RCED-92-4. January 27, 1992.", "ABSTRACT: The Missouri River basin, encompassing all of Nebraska and part of nine other North Central states, is experiencing its most severe drought since the 1930s. GAO reviewed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 management of the Missouri River reservoir system under drought conditions in 1988, 1989, and 1990. Acting consistently with its drought contingency plan, the Corps reduced winter release rates, shortened navigation seasons on the Missouri River, and reduced water levels in the navigation channel. As a result, 17 percent less water was released during the three-year period than would have been released under normal operating conditions. The drought and the Corps\u2019 response to it harmed all reservoir efforts save one\u2014flood control. The Corps\u2019 contingency plan, however, relies on assumptions about the amount of water needed for navigation and irrigation made in 1944 that are no longer valid, and the plan does not reflect the current economic conditions in the Missouri River basin. The Corps\u2019 ongoing study of its operation of the reservoir system is expected to address these issues. The Corps insists that, unless Congress approves changes to existing operating priorities, it must continue to give recreation a lower operating priority than other authorized purposes even if this lower priority results in decreased system benefits. GAO sees no appropriate basis for the Corps\u2019 view. A lawsuit filed in federal court by three upper basin states questions the legality of the Corps\u2019 position on recreation.", "Water Resources: Local Sponsors\u2019 Views on Corps\u2019 Implementation of Project Cost Sharing.

GAO/T-RCED-92-13. October 29, 1991.", "ABSTRACT: This testimony, which is based on an earlier report (GAO/RCED-91-175, Aug. 22, 1991), addresses changes needed before renewal of long-term water service contracts in the Bureau of Reclamation\u2019s Central Valley Project in California. Significant environmental and water use problems are associated with irrigation practices carried out under existing water service contracts. These irrigation practices have contributed to selenium poisoning and increasing salinity in the San Joaquin Valley; some farmers use Central Valley Project water to produce crops that are also eligible for subsidies under Agriculture Department commodity programs; and with 85 percent of the Central Valley Project water dedicated to irrigation under the contracts, the water supply available for wildlife habitat is inadequate. GAO is concerned that renewing the Central Valley Project\u2019s 238 contracts for the same quantities of water for up to 40 years could severely hamper efforts to address existing and future problems. GAO recommends that Congress place a moratorium on all Central Valley Project contract renewals, while temporarily extending existing contracts, and amend legislation to explicitly allow contract renewals for lesser quantities of water and shorter periods of time. GAO also recommends that the Department of the Interior fully analyze the impact of contract renewal and alternative contract provisions.", "Water Subsidies: Views on Proposed Reclamation Reform Legislation. GAO/T-RCED-91-90. September 12, 1991.", "BACKGROUND: GAO discussed four legislative proposals to amend the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982, which permits multiple landholdings to continue to be operated collectively as one large farm while individually qualifying for federally subsidized water. GAO noted that: (1) if the farm operations in the five case studies remain constant, each of the proposals could limit federally subsidized water to some or all of the operations; (2) three of the five large farm operations in the case studies could continue to receive subsidized water on land in excess of the 960-acre limit, under the House bill; (3) under the Senate bill, four of the five large farm operations would be able to continue to receive subsidized water on more than 960 acres; (4) three of the large farm operations could continue to receive subsidized water on land in excess of the 960-acre limit under the Bureau of Reclamation\u2019s draft bill; and (5) the Subcommittee on Water, Power, and Off-Shore Energy Resources\u2019s draft bill could stop the flow of federally subsidized water to more than 960 acres in all five of the case studies. GAO believes that since farmers have ample financial incentive to reorganize their operations in response to any new reclamation legislation enacted, some farmers are likely to reorganize again to be eligible to receive additional federally subsidized water.", "Reclamation Law: Changes Needed Before Water Service Contracts Are Renewed. GAO/RCED-91-175. August 22, 1991.", "BACKGROUND: Pursuant to a congressional request, GAO: (1) identified environmental and water use problems associated with the irrigation practices carried out under the Bureau of Reclamation\u2019s water service contracts in the Central Valley Project (CVP); and (2) determined whether contract renewals would allow such problems to continue. FINDINGS: GAO found that: (1) agricultural drainage has degraded the quality of the San Joaquin Valley\u2019s water supply and soil, poisoning wildlife and threatening agricultural productivity with selenium accumulation and increasing salinity; (2) since most CVP water is dedicated to irrigation through water service contracts, the supply of water available for wildlife habitat is not adequate; (3) some farmers use CVP water to produce crops that are also eligible for subsidies under the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) commodity programs, causing Congress to express concern over the apparent inconsistency between the Bureau\u2019s programs for increasing agricultural production through inexpensive subsidized water and USDA programs for raising prices while limiting production; (4) increased irrigation efficiency and conservation could reduce environmental degradation caused by agricultural runoff and drainage, while freeing water currently diverted for irrigation and other uses, but the low cost of federal irrigation water is a disincentive to increased irrigation efficiency; (5) the Department of the Interior believes that, since long-term renewal of contracts for the same quantities of water is nondiscretionary, it is not required to change its provisions as a result of environmental impact statements; and (6) continuing irrigation practices carried out under existing contract provisions compromise other national interests such as environmental protection and wildlife conservation.", "Water Resources: Corps Lacks Authority for Water Supply Contracts. GAO/RCED-91-151. August 20, 1991.", "BACKGROUND: Pursuant to a legislative requirement, GAO examined whether the Army Corps of Engineers has the legislative authority to operate nine water reservoirs for the purposes for which they are being managed. FINDINGS: GAO found that: (1) with one exception, the Corps has the authority to operate the nine reservoirs for the purposes for which they are being managed; (2) in that exception, the Corps improperly cited the Water Supply Act of 1958 in reallocating storage capacity to municipal and industrial (M&I) water supply and entering into six long-term contracts to supply water to M&I users without expanding those reservoirs; (3) the authority under the Water Supply Act to supply water for M&I needs is limited to what may be accomplished through the construction or expansion of reservoirs, and the act does not provide authority to reallocate existing water storage capacity for M&I purposes at reservoirs previously constructed or modified; and (4) the Corps used the act to enter into 38 water supply contracts and was planning to enter into similar contracts in the future.", "Water Resources: Corps\u2019 Management of 1990 Flooding in the Arkansas, Red, and White River Basins.

FINDINGS: GAO found that: (1) the federal government spent or was contractually obligated for a total of about $320 million for the I&D system; (2) proposed legislation providing for the completion of the system, with some changes, would cost an additional $178 million in federal funds; (3) completion of the I&D system was not economically justified, since the U.S. economy would realize a benefit of only 28 cents for every dollar of project costs; and (4) the financial impacts on the federal government of not completing the I&D system ranged from savings of $133 million, if Congress decided to reallocate sunk costs, to an additional cost of $54 million if Congress decided to forgive the repayment of sunk costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Timber Management", "paragraphs": ["Forest Service: Observations on the Emergency Salvage Sale Program. GAO/T-RCED-96-38. November 29, 1995.", "ABSTRACT: Salvage timber involves dead or dying trees, much of which would be marketable if harvested before it rots. In the past, many sales of salvage timber were delayed, altered, or withdrawn, and some of the timber deteriorated and became unsalable. In response to the millions of acres of salvage timber caused by the devastating fires of 1994, Congress established an emergency salvage timber sale program, which was designed to increase the harvesting of salvage timber by easing environment procedures and eliminating the administrative appeals process. GAO testified that it is too early to say to what extent the changes introduced by the program will boost sales because few sales have been made since the program became effective. Some salvage sale offerings have failed to receive bids mainly because of the terms and conditions of the sales, such as the minimum bid or specific logging requirements or the volume of timber being offered, were unacceptable to potential buyers. In addition, because of the short-term nature of the emergency salvage sale program, more comprehensive information on the universe of marketable salvage timber may help Congress as it assesses the program\u2019s impact and whether additional resources are needed to support it.", "Forest Service: Distribution of Timber Sales Receipts Fiscal Years 1992-94. GAO/RCED-95-237FS. September 8, 1995.", "ABSTRACT: Over the years, the Forest Service\u2019s annual reports to Congress have indicated that receipts from the timber sales program exceeded the expense of preparing and administering the sales. However, these reports did not show the extent to which timber sales receipts were distributed to various Forest Service funds or accounts established for specific purposes, such as reforesting the land and making payments to the states in which the forests are located. GAO found that during fiscal years 1992-94, the Forest Service collected nearly $3 billion in timber sales receipts and distributed about $2.7 billion, or 90 percent, to various Forest Service funds or accounts for specific purposes. The Forest Service deposited the remaining receipts\u2014about $300 million\u2014in the General Fund of the Treasury. Outlays for preparing and administering timbers sales totaled about $1.3 billion for the same period.", "Private Timberlands: Private Timber Harvests Not Likely to Replace Declining Federal Harvests. GAO/RCED-95-51. February 16, 1995.", "ABSTRACT: Timberlands in Washington state, Oregon, and California are owned by the federal government, state and local governments, and the forest products industry or other private parties. Timber harvest volumes from all these sources have decreased during the past five years. Most notable, however, is the drop on federal lands, mainly as a result of efforts to protect the habitats of threatened or endangered species. This report discusses (1) trend data on private timberland acreage and on volumes of timber harvested; (2) requirements for reforestation and the use of active timber management practices, such as fertilization or thinning, on private timberlands; (3) incentive programs to encourage private landowners to actively manage their timberlands and other factors that influence their land management decisions; and (4) federal tax provision that affect timber management decisions, including the changes that occurred in the 1986 Tax Reform Act.", "Tongass Timber Reform Act: Implementation of the Act\u2019s Contract Modification Requirements.

January 31, 1995.", "ABSTRACT: In Alaska\u2019s Tongass National Forest, two companies\u2014the Ketchikan Pulp Company and the Alaska Pulp Corporation\u2014have held 50-year contracts to cut timber. The Forest Service maintains that its existing policy provides consistent treatment of credits in contracts that timber harvesters are awarded for building harvest-related roads. GAO disagrees, believing that the policy gives Ketchikan Pulp a competitive advantage by allowing it to apply \u201cineffective\u201d road credits for a much longer period than timber harvesters that must use short-term contracts. Through the end of fiscal year 1993, Ketchikan Pulp used road credits to pay for 73 percent of the timber harvested. Also, some streamside buffers did not meet the 100-foot minimum. The Forest Service has since taken steps to ensure that this requirement is met. GAO also found that the Forest Service was not following its policy of documenting the environmental effects of changes made to planned timber-harvest boundaries.", "Forest Service: Factors Affecting Timber Sales in Five National Forests. GAO/RCED-95-12. October 28, 1994.", "ABSTRACT: In recent years, debate about the future of the national forest system has focused on ensuring that timber harvests do not exceed the forests\u2019 ability to replenish the available supply of timber. An important component of managing forests on a sustained-yield basis is each forest\u2019s \u201callowable sale quantity\u201d\u2014an estimate of the maximum volume of timber that can be sold from each forest over a 10-year period without impairing other uses of the forest, such as recreation or wildlife habitat. GAO reviewed the allowable sale quantities and the timber sales at five national forests\u2014Deschutes and Mt. Hood in Oregon, Gifford Pinchot in Washington, Ouachita in Arkansas, and Chattahoochee-Oconee in Georgia. The Forest Service did not meet allowable sale quantities in the five forests for a variety of reasons, including (1) limitations in the data and estimating techniques on which the allowable sale quantities were originally based, (2) new forest management issues and changing priorities, and (3) rising or unanticipated costs associated with preparing timber sales and administering harvests. Although forest officials believed that the Service has used the best information available to develop the allowable sale quantities, they later failed to meet these levels. As a result, timber sales for each of the five forests between fiscal years 1991 and 1993 were significantly below the average annual allowable sale quantity.", "Forest Service: Management of Reforestation Program Has Improved, but Problems Continue. GAO/RCED-94-257.

The Forest Service annually collects about $230 million from timber purchasers for reforestation and other activities and deposits it in the fund. In response to congressional concerns over the adequacy of Forest Service control of these funds and their use for appropriate projects, GAO reviewed the Forest Service\u2019s management of the fund. This report describes (1) how the Forest Service plans, implements, and manages Knutson-Vandenberg projects and (2) what changes the Forest Service has made since 1990 in response to previous internal and Office of Inspector General reviews of the program and what additional changes may be necessary.", "Forestry Functions: Unresolved Issues Affect Forest Service and BLM Organizations in Western Oregon.

GAO/RCED-94-185FS. April 26, 1994.", "ABSTRACT: Congress requested that the Forest Service prepare a cost study for its timber program that would analyze how to achieve an annual cost reduction of at least five percent. The Forest Service\u2019s April 1993 report on timber cost efficiency discussed such areas as the overall timber program, the program\u2019s organization, the Timber Sale Program Information Reporting System, financial management, and attempts to monitor cost efficiency. In the year since the study was issued, the Forest Service has made progress toward completing 21 of 23 action items targeted for completion by October 1993 or October 1994. The results of the regional offices\u2019 cost efficiency efforts have been mixed. In addition, the Forest Service has undertaken other, nontimber initiatives, such as reorganizing and downsizing, that could improve the agency\u2019s overall efficiency. Overall, from fiscal year 1992 to fiscal year 1993, the Forest Service reduced its timber program expenses nationally by about 7.2 percent. Total annual timber program expenses declined in six of the nine regions during this period. However, six of the nine regions\u2019 timber sales programs showed a net loss when annual expenses were deducted from revenues for fiscal year 1993.", "Timber Sale Contract Defaults: Forest Service Needs to Strengthen Its Performance Bond and Contract Provisions. GAO/RCED-94-5. October 28, 1993.", "ABSTRACT: The Forest Service has assessed damages totaling about $302 million against purchasers who defaulted in timber sale contracts between January 1982 and March 1993. The Forest Service has collected about $42 million, or 14 percent, of this amount and has determined that about $136 million is uncollectible for a variety of reasons, such as the bankruptcy or the death of the purchaser. Continuing litigation has been the main reason for the delays in the final disposition of the remaining $124 million, most of which is owed by 14 timber purchasers. When many of these defaulted contracts were awarded, the Forest Service had few safeguards in place to protect the government against losses from defaults.", "Since then, the Forest Service has begun requiring purchasers to make down payments and has raised the dollar limit on the performance bond that purchasers must provide. In addition, the Forest Service is considering retaining the down payments until the contracts are substantially complete and clarifying the liability provisions in a new performance bond\u2014measures that GAO strongly supports.", "Cancer Treatment: Actions Taken to More Fully Utilize the Bark of Pacific Yews on Federal Land.

In fiscal year 1991, neither the Forest Service nor the Bureau of Land Management had effective timber sale administrative procedures or utilization standards. As a result, some usable yew bark went uncollected that year. In fiscal year 1992, both agencies in conjunction with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and its yew bark collectors have worked to ensure more complete utilization of yew bark. If properly implemented, the agencies\u2019 fiscal year 1992 program plans and associated operational procedures should help ensure that more of this limited and valuable resource is recovered.", "Forest Service Timber Sales Program: Questionable Need for Contract Term Extensions and Status of Efforts to Reduce Costs.

GAO/RCED-92-160R. April 1, 1992.", "BACKGROUND: Pursuant to a congressional request, GAO commented on whether two bills regarding below-cost timber sales on national forests addressed three previous GAO recommendations regarding such sales. GAO noted that both of the bills addressed GAO recommendations that the Forest Service: (1) expand the proposed below-cost sales policy beyond forests as a whole to individual sales; and (2) define the minimum rate for timber sales bids as the cost of timber sale preparation and administration and ensure that the sale process recovers those costs. GAO also noted that neither of the bills addressed the recommendation to amend the timber sale process to include an initial below-cost determination during the sale preparation process in order to avoid unnecessary costs.", "Cancer Treatment: Efforts to More Fully Utilize the Pacific Yew\u2019s Bark. GAO/T-RCED-92-36. March 4, 1992.", "ABSTRACT: The bark of the Pacific yew is the only approved source of taxol, an anticancer drug that has been shown effective in treating ovarian cancer. The limited supply of Pacific yew bark coupled with existing and potential demand mean that the bark needs to be as fully utilized as possible. For a variety of reasons, however, not all the bark that could have been collected on federal lands in 1991 was collected. Both responsible federal land-managing agencies and private industry are taking or planning actions to more fully use the bark, and increased utilization should be seen in 1992. These actions appear to be consistent with provisions of the Pacific Yew Act of 1991 intended to achieve full utilization of the bark.", "Forest Service: The Flathead National Forest Cannot Meet Its Timber Goal.

GAO noted that: (1) fiscal year 1990 below-cost timber sales resulted in unrecovered timber-sale preparation and administration expenses of at least $35.6 million; (2) unrecovered costs ranged from $14.9 million for large sales and $20.7 million for small sales when only preparation and administration costs were considered, to $68.4 million for large sales and $43.8 million for small sales when all operating costs plus payments to states were calculated; (3) sale preparation and administration costs at the 122 national forests ranged from $15 per thousand board feet of harvested timber to $348 per thousand board feet; and (4) the Service issued a draft policy to reduce losses from below-cost timber sales. In addition, GAO noted that the Service needed to take such additional actions to reduce below-cost timber sales as: (1) extending consideration of below-cost sales to the individual sales level; (2) considering its costs when setting minimum rates for a timber sale; and (3) evaluating whether the benefits of a below-cost sale justify the unrecovered costs prior to incurring most preparation costs.", "Forest Service Needs to Improve Efforts to Protect the Government\u2019s Financial Interests and Reduce Below-Cost Timber Sales.

GAO noted that: (1) the Service collected about $35 million of the $302 million in damages that it assessed from defaulted contracts and was taking steps to improve its collection processes; (2) the Service\u2019s key contracting measures were similar to other timber sellers\u2019 measures, although the Service and one federal timber seller returned or credited down payments or deposits before contractors substantially completed the contracts; (3) such practices lessened the Service\u2019s security in terms of access to funds in the event of a default; (4) in fiscal year 1990, the Service incurred timber sale preparation and administration expenses of $35.6 million that it could not recover as a result of below-cost timber sales; and (5) preparation and administrative costs varied greatly by forest. GAO also noted that the Service issued a draft policy aimed at reducing losses caused by below-cost timber sales, but the policy left gaps in a comprehensive approach, since the Service: (1) would not subject many below-cost sales to review; (2) did not consider costs when setting minimum prices for advertised timber sales; and (3) did not evaluate on a timely basis whether the benefits of a below-cost sale justified the unrecoverable cost.", "Better Reporting Needed on Reforestation and Timber Stand Improvement.

FINDINGS: GAO found that: (1) the Forest Service made extensive revisions to the two long-term timber sale contracts, generally by adopting and modifying provisions from independent short-term timber sale contracts to meet the act\u2019s requirements; (2) all modifications to the long-term contracts, except purchaser road credits, complied with the act\u2019s requirements; and (3) the modifications did not specify how the Service would perform environmental assessments or how large an area they would cover. GAO believes that: (1) although the contract modifications did not specify exactly how the Service would implement them, the modifications will require extensive additional effort on the part of the Service; and (2) the manner in which the Service implements the modifications will determine its compliance with the act\u2019s requirements.", "Financial Audit: Forest Service\u2019s Financial Statements for Fiscal Year 1988.

In many IHS areas, health care delivery has been hampered by problems in recruiting and retaining health care professionals, particularly doctors. The recruitment and retention of physicians in the Aberdeen Area has been affected by the relatively low pay; inadequate housing for medical personnel on the reservations; remoteness of the reservations; cultural differences between the doctors and their patients; and a general lack of amenities, such as shopping and dining. IHS\u2019 Aberdeen Area has a higher vacancy rate for physicians than all but one other IHS area. The vacancy rate has been particularly high, more than 31 percent, at the Pine Ridge hospital.

GAO noted that: (1) to meet the contract requirements, the utility provided special personnel, made improvements in the system, gathered quantitative data on electrical power consumption, and developed a long-range plan for electrical consumption; (2) the utility took many steps to comply with federal environmental and safety standards; and (3) nine modifications were made to the 1988 contract and one modification was made to the 1991 contract.", "Financial Management: BIA Has Made Limited Progress in Reconciling Trust Accounts and Developing a Strategic Plan. GAO/AFMD-92-38. June 18, 1992. royalty income has been called into question. Although BIA recognizes the seriousness of the situation, little progress has been made in resolving the problems. GAO recommends that BIA develop a comprehensive strategic plan that will address interfaces between other systems and operations affecting trust fund accounting, such as the land records and reporting by the Minerals Management Service. GAO summarized this report in testimony before Congress; see: Financial Management: Problems Affecting BIA Trust Fund Financial Management, by Jeffrey C. Steinhoff, Director of Civil Audits, before the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs. GAO/T-AFMD-92-12, July 2, 1992 (11 pages).", "Bureau of Indian Affairs: Long-Standing Internal Control Weaknesses Warrant Congressional Attention. GAO/RCED-92-118. May 8, 1992.", "ABSTRACT: Through its social services program, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) offers assistance to individual Indians and tribes. GAO found that two of these services, involving payments for welfare and the burial of indigents, are plagued by unjustified, improper, and inconsistent payments and are ripe for fraud and waste. These problems stem from weak internal controls\u2014some as basic as inadequate supervision, failure to separate employee duties, and poor computer security. Similar problems have been repeatedly identified in BIA\u2019s social services program for more than a decade. The long-standing nature of internal control weaknesses and ineffective BIA efforts in the past to correct them indicate that an overall management commitment at all levels will be needed if an effective system of controls is to be established. Recent congressional initiatives to address persistent accounting and internal control weaknesses in BIA\u2019s management of Indian trust funds and the Office of Audit and Evaluation will need management support at all levels if these initiatives are to succeed. To ensure full management support, increased congressional oversight may be warranted.", "Financial Management: BIA Has Made Limited Progress in Reconciling Indian Trust Fund Accounts and Developing a Strategic Plan.

Because many accounts are between 50 and 100 years old, however, the lack of supporting documentation presents a major obstacle. This testimony examines BIA\u2019s progress in reconciling the Indian trust fund accounts and developing a strategic plan for trust fund financial management improvement.", "Welfare To Work: Effectiveness of Tribal JOBS Programs Unknown. GAO/HRD-92-67BR. March 19, 1992.", "ABSTRACT: GAO could not assess the effectiveness of Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) programs run by Indian Tribes and Alaska Native groups or determine outcomes resulting from these programs because evaluation criteria, including well-defined program objectives, were lacking and insufficient, and reliable program data were unavailable. The economic environment in which many Indian tribes and Alaska Native organizations must operate may hinder the success of their Tribal JOBS programs. These programs are assisting participants prepare for and obtain employment at a time when few jobs are available, and unemployment on many reservations is high. In addition to poor economic conditions, tribal organizations mentioned several implementation problems, including a lack of transportation and child care for program participants.", "Indian Programs: BIA and Indian Tribes Are Taking Action to Address Dam Safety Concerns.

An effective record-keeping and reporting system to help monitor the situation at priority dams would help BIA assess progress.", "Land Exchange: Phoenix and Collier Reach Agreement on Indian School Property. GAO/GGD-92-42. February 10, 1992.", "ABSTRACT: Legislation passed in 1988 authorized the Interior Department to swap its former Indian School property in downtown Phoenix for more than 100,000 acres of land near the Florida Everglades owned by the Collier family along with $34.9 million in cash to set up two Indian trust funds. While most of the exchange conditions set by the law have been met, the City of Phoenix placed limitations on the uses of the Indian School land and the Barron Collier Co. had the right to match the highest bid. As a result, no competing bids for the property were received, and Congress\u2019 intent to test the value of the land by exposing the school site to meaningful competitive bidding was not met. For several reasons, GAO cannot conclude that the Florida land, along with the $34.9 million, equals the value of the Colliers\u2019 portion of the Indian School property. For instance, the Florida land, which was possibly overvalued in 1988, has not been reevaluated since then, and its value could have fallen during the recession. GAO does not question the right of the City of Phoenix to decide how privately-owned property should be used. Yet the city\u2019s action in this case raises questions about whether a locality should have the authority to use zoning as a way of acquiring land in federal disposition programs without compensation to the federal government. Conflict arose during the Phoenix exchange because of efforts by the various entities to meet the intent of the exchange. Such natural conflict raises the issue of how future exchanges can be designed to accommodate the demands of several parties and still meet a market demand test.", "Indian Programs: Profile of Land Ownership at 12 Reservations.

January 13, 1992.", "BACKGROUND: Pursuant to a congressional request, GAO reviewed the Bureau of Indian Affairs\u2019 (BIA) efforts to improve its detection and handling of Indian trust fund losses. GAO found that: (1) BIA is liable for investing trust funds above the insured limits of $100,000; (2) the National Credit Union Administration will not cover losses in excess of the $100,000 insurance ceiling; (3) BIA has incurred losses on investments at non-accredited, uninsured credit unions as a result of fraud and criminal activity; (4) the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) will not cover $121,500 in losses at FDIC-insured institutions; (5) BIA will request approximately $4 million in appropriations to cover credit union and bank losses in its next budget submission; and (6) BIA policies regarding notification and reimbursement to Indian account holders for losses due to BIA errors need to be strengthened because the policies do not address the need for loss prevention and detection systems, adequately instruct staff on how to resolve losses, address documentation requirements, and define whether losses should include interest that was earned but not credited to the appropriate account.", "Land Exchange: Phoenix Indian School Development Plan Adversely Affects Property Value.

GAO noted that: (1) numerous audit reports have pointed out serious accounting and financial management problems and weak internal controls throughout BIA; (2) the lack of general ledger control over accounts, inaccurate data, the lack of accounting systems documentation, and inadequate management of the Indian trust funds caused numerous accounting errors; (3) the first phase of the BIA trust fund reconciliation and audit project would identify the correct account balances for over 500 tribal accounts and 17,000 individual Indian money trust accounts; and (4) BIA planned to use the first-phase results to develop plans for moving into a second phase that would cover the remaining 1,500 tribal and 283,000 individual Indian money accounts.
