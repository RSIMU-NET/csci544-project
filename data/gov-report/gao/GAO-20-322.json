In November 2019, OPM\u2019s Inspector General expressed  concern over ongoing efforts to merge these functions with GSA, noting  that the specific details of the full merger continued to evolve, and every  iteration of the proposed reorganization would fundamentally alter how  agency functions and duties are performed.", "In the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2020,  signed into law in December 2019, Congress effectively halted actions to  reorganize OPM pending the completion of reports by the National  Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) and OPM. The law directed  OPM to enter into a contract with NAPA to conduct a study to identify  challenges associated with OPM\u2019s execution of its functions and make  recommendations for addressing them, including a cost-benefit analysis  of proposed changes, and the identification of statutory or regulatory  changes needed to execute recommended actions, among other things.  Approximately 6 months after the NAPA report, OPM must submit a  report providing its views on the NAPA report and its recommendations  for changes to its functions. OPM is also to include a business case  analysis associated with such changes and a proposal for legislative and  regulatory action required to effect the changes. Many of these  requirements reflect the issues we raised in our May 2019 testimony on  the extent to which the proposal to reorganize OPM was consistent with  our key reform practices.", "According to the President\u2019s fiscal year 2021 budget request, the  administration continues to pursue implementation of OPM\u2019s  reorganization.

While OPM officials had some  information on the costs and benefits they planned to achieve by merging  functions with other agencies, they did not have an analysis or underlying  data supporting their conclusions.
