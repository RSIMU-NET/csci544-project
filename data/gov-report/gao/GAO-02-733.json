IRS has also created new offices that focus exclusively on abusive tax schemes that use legal structures like domestic and offshore trusts and partnerships. IRS coordinates with federal agencies to identify, monitor, and prosecute promoters and participants in abusive tax schemes. These activities range from sharing information and detection techniques with agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission to assisting in the prosecution of fraud related cases with the Department of Justice.

An abusive domestic trust scheme usually involves a taxpayer creating a trust that does not meet the Internal Revenue Code requirements that the assets and income of the trust not be subject to the control of the taxpayer. Once such an improper trust is established and the taxpayer has transferred business or personal assets to it, the scheme may involve further abuses, such as offsetting income of the trust by overstating its business expenses or including the taxpayer\u2019s personal expenses\u2014like a home mortgage\u2014as an expense of the trust.

One common technique is simply to use foreign locations to add another level of complexity in obscuring the true ownership of assets or income and thus obfuscating whether taxes are owed and by whom. Use of foreign locations, for instance, can be combined with use of trusts to make unraveling the true ownership of assets and income more difficult for IRS. According to IRS, criminals long have used offshore schemes to disguise the true nature of their enterprise and the resulting income. Promoters of abusive tax schemes have, according to IRS, increasingly devised schemes that in some fashion involve transferring income or title to assets to foreign locations. Often, foreign locations are selected because they are tax havens with little or no taxation on income in their jurisdiction, have privacy rules that help schemers hide what they are doing, or have other characteristics favorable to carrying out the schemes. According to IRS, once such transfers are established, income is often repatriated back to the U.S. owners through loans, credit cards, or debit cards.

According to IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2003-2004 Small Business and Self-Employed (SB/SE) Division Strategic Assessment Report, abusive tax schemes represent a rapidly growing risk to the tax base. IRS estimates the potential revenue loss from these schemes to be in the tens of billions of dollars annually. According to an IRS official, to make accurate estimates in this area of noncompliance is difficult. Despite the difficulties in accurately estimating the significance of abusive tax schemes, IRS provided us with estimates in four major scheme areas\u2014 Frivolous Returns, Frivolous Refunds, Abusive Domestic Trusts, and Offshore Schemes. According to IRS, its estimates were made in February 2002 and were derived from information gathered during tax return processing and examination activities and from the work of IRS\u2019s Criminal Investigation (CI), the law enforcement arm of IRS. According to an IRS official, these estimates were derived from tax-year 2000 information, the last full year for which data were available. IRS\u2019s estimates are as follows:   Frivolous returns: about 62,000 taxpayers with associated tax amounts approximating $1.8 billion.", "Frivolous refunds: about 105,000 taxpayers with associated tax amounts approximating $3.1 billion.", "Abusive domestic trusts: about 65,000 taxpayers with tax losses approximating $2.9 billion.", "Offshore schemes: about 505,000 taxpayers with tax losses ranging from $20 billion to $40 billion.", "IRS\u2019s estimates for the numbers of taxpayers and taxes in connection with frivolous returns and frivolous refunds, although not precise, likely have less uncertainty than its estimates of the numbers of taxpayers and taxes at risk in connection with abusive domestic trusts and offshore schemes. IRS\u2019s estimates for frivolous returns and frivolous refunds are based in large part on returns and refund claims that IRS has identified while processing tax returns and has addressed by pulling the associated returns and notifying the taxpayers that their returns contained a frivolous position that needed to be corrected by submitting a revised return. Thus, in these cases, IRS has a fairly direct basis for counting the number of taxpayers involved and the amount of tax involved. Furthermore, because IRS has pulled these returns from processing, in general, improper refund claims have not been paid out, and IRS is pursuing collection of the proper amount of tax when taxpayers have failed to pay the full amount owed.", "In contrast, although taxpayers using domestic trusts and offshore schemes may file tax returns, those returns alone seldom provide enough information for IRS to determine whether an abusive scheme was used. Therefore, IRS\u2019s estimates of the numbers of taxpayers and the taxes at risk for the domestic trust and offshore scheme categories generally rely on limited numbers of cases that have been examined or investigated, on intelligence obtained in the course of normal tax administration and CI activities, and on IRS officials\u2019 professional judgments.", "Recognizing that offshore transactions are a significant factor in offshore schemes, IRS has been taking steps concerning the use of credit/debit cards issued by offshore banks to U.S. taxpayers. Although having an offshore credit card is not illegal, IRS believes that some U.S. taxpayers are using such cards to evade U.S. taxes. In October 2000, a federal judge authorized IRS to serve \u201cJohn Doe\u201d summonses on American Express and MasterCard to obtain limited information on U.S. taxpayers holding credit cards issued by banks in several tax-haven countries.", "On the basis of information received from MasterCard, IRS identified about 235,000 accounts issued through 28 banks located in 3 countries. IRS\u2019s ongoing analysis of these data leads it to estimate that between 60,000 and 130,000 U.S. customers are associated with these 235,000 accounts. In part because MasterCard is estimated to have about 30 percent of this market, IRS estimates that there could be 1 to 2 million U.S. citizens with credit/debit cards issued by offshore banks. However, this is a very preliminary estimate. IRS officials believe this estimate may be reduced because, among other things, a portion of these accounts may not be associated with abusive tax schemes. By comparison, only about 117,000 individual taxpayers indicated that they had offshore bank accounts in tax-year 1999. On March 25, 2002, IRS petitioned for permission to serve a summons on VISA International, seeking records on transactions using cards issued by banks in over 30 tax-haven countries.", "According to an IRS official, a judge granted the summons on March 27, 2002. In May 2002, IRS is scheduled to meet with Visa International to discuss delivery of the information requested in the summons.", "In addition, on April 24, 2002, the Treasury Department\u2019s FinCEN published an interim final rule to define and provide guidance to operators of credit card systems concerning a provision in the Bank Secrecy Act that requires them to establish anti-money laundering programs. Part of the justification for the rule was the potential for utilizing a credit card system to access in the United States funds located in foreign financial institutions. The successful \u201cJohn Doe\u201d summonses filed against MasterCard and American Express by IRS were cited by FinCEN as support for publishing the interim rule.", "The Treasury Department is concerned that foreign financial institutions located in tax-haven countries are being used to violate and/or evade domestic tax requirements, among other things. Recognizing that, the Secretary of the Treasury submitted a report to Congress on April 26, 2002, proposing several actions to improve compliance regarding foreign bank and financial accounts. These actions are geared to improving reporting, compliance, and enforcement efforts related to U.S. citizens and residents transacting business with foreign financial institutions.", "The estimates of the number of individuals and dollar consequences associated with offshore credit/debit card schemes are very uncertain at this time.

Available information indicates that IRS began increasing its efforts to combat abusive schemes over the past 2 or 3 years, continued to do so in 2001, and plans further future efforts. Limited data also suggest that these enhanced efforts have helped IRS convict more promoters and users of abusive schemes over the past 3 years.

Furthermore, IRS has created an organization that initially will focus on developing leads and cases related to abusive scheme promoters and that will monitor abusive promoter web sites. IRS has also recognized that its resources are stretched to improve compliance and enforcement efforts and these multiple efforts require organizational coordination. IRS identifies many abusive tax schemes during its normal tax return processing and examination activities. For example, when tax returns initially are processed either manually or by computers, processes are in place to detect apparent frivolous returns or returns reflecting improper refunds. In these cases, the returns are pulled from processing to be forwarded to a unit that specializes in addressing these types of returns.

For example, IRS expects to develop units that will include 8 to 10 agents in each of 15 locations. These units will address abusive tax schemes and flow-through entities. In addition, given the growing significance of the offshore credit/debit card schemes, IRS plans to create four special enforcement groups.

IRS can also use these K-1 data in its return examination and tax collection activities to help identify abusive tax schemes.", "Tax-year 1995 marked the last year that Schedule K-1 information was transcribed by IRS. From 1990 through 1995, IRS transcribed approximately 5 percent to 12 percent of the Schedule K-1s received. After 1995, IRS did not transcribe Schedule K-1 information submitted with paper returns nor did it match the income information contained on the schedules with the information presented on individual beneficiaries\u2019 or partners\u2019 tax returns. IRS again started to transcribe tax-year 2000 K-1 information during the spring of 2001 and completed the process in December 2001. IRS officials told us that the matching of the K-1 information against individual tax returns was to begin in March 2002.", "IRS cites several reasons for reinstating its transcription and matching of Schedule K-1s. First, IRS has observed a significant increase in flow- through entities. The number of tax returns filed by trusts, partnerships, and S-corporations has increased by 12 percent, 33 percent, and 35 percent, respectively, over the 6-year period from fiscal years 1995 through 2000. IRS also estimates an overall increase of nearly 2 million such returns by 2009. Second, based on a small study, in January 2002, IRS estimated that between 6 percent and 15 percent of total flow-through income would not be reported on tax-year 2001 returns. IRS estimates that income of about $1 trillion was distributed to taxpayers from flow-through entities for tax-year 2000. Third, IRS expects its Schedule K-1 matching program not only to identify underreporting or nonreporting of income but also to improve taxpayer compliance. Transcription and matching of Schedule K-1 data are expected to increase accurate reporting of trust income on future tax returns just as matching of wage, interest, and other types of income has increased the accuracy of taxpayers\u2019 tax returns. As a result, the Schedule K-1 program places taxpayers who receive flow- through income on a more equal footing with taxpayers who are wage earners.", "Lead Development Center.

Initially, the center will focus on abusive tax scheme promoters, and over time, it will expand to perform similar functions for fraud and anti-money laundering cases. The center will also operate a computer laboratory that, among other things, is expected to monitor possible abusive promoter sites on the Internet. Specifically, the laboratory will support examiners in their case- development needs, including adequately capturing and documenting information from web sites in a manner suitable for introduction into evidence in a court proceeding.

Now, its efforts to ensure accurate reporting of income connected to flow-through entities will fall under a director for reporting compliance. IRS separated the flow-through entity effort from other abusive tax scheme efforts because it judged that the flow-through effort is more related to its traditional information-matching and examination programs than to its abusive scheme efforts.

Questionable Refund Detection Teams (QRDT), located at IRS compliance service centers, conduct preliminary pre-refund reviews of questionable returns identified through manual and computerized screening techniques.

In addition, CI has PIOs located across the country who work with local media to publicize IRS\u2019s efforts and results.", "CI Education and Publicity Activities. CI\u2019s education and publicity activities focus on warning taxpayers about fraudulent tax schemes so that they will not be tempted to use such schemes. CI hopes that increasing media coverage of successful tax scheme prosecutions will deter the public from participating in tax schemes because the perceived risk of detection, prosecution, and resulting penalties and sanctions will be too high. In addition, CI officials believe that publicizing the prosecutions of promoters and users of tax schemes helps assure the public that people are paying their fair share of taxes.", "CI posted its web page (www.ustreas.gov/irs/ci) on the Internet in September 1997. According to CI officials, over the past 2 years, the Internet site has evolved into an important tool for educating and alerting the public about tax schemes and about CI\u2019s efforts to detect and deal with those who promote and use tax schemes. The Internet site provides fraud alerts warning the public of schemes where promoters are targeting unsuspecting taxpayers; information on topics including tax filing responsibilities, nonfilers, and abusive tax return preparers;   summaries of cases and successful prosecutions of promoters and users of fraudulent schemes; and   press releases and other IRS publications to generate a wide public distribution.", "Tax practitioners also are targets of CI\u2019s publicity strategy. According to CI officials, some tax practitioners are using IRS\u2019s materials directly from the Internet site to inform those clients who may believe that a given tax scheme is legal. For example, clients may ask the tax practitioner to set up a fraudulent trust to reduce their taxes, and the tax practitioner can simply print the brochure about \u201cToo Good to be True? \u2013 Trusts\u201d from CI\u2019s Internet site to discourage the taxpayers from using such a trust.", "In conjunction with using the Internet site as an informational tool to educate and warn the public of frivolous schemes, CI has taken steps to increase IRS\u2019s visibility and presence on the Internet. According to CI, it has recently intensified its efforts to improve the ranking of IRS\u2019s web page through the use of \u201cmetatags\u201d or keyword tags. By doing so, IRS seeks to have Internet users who enter various terms in available Internet search engines find IRS\u2019s web page listed near the top of displayed search results. For example, CI is planning to add tags such as \u201cpay no tax,\u201d and \u201cform 1040\u201d so that entering these terms will result in CI\u2019s Internet site being listed in the displayed search results.", "CI is pursuing other possible strategies to ensure that CI\u2019s site rises to the top of Internet search responses. For example, CI staff has occasionally visited known promoter Internet sites to gather information on keywords used by those sites. IRS plans to incorporate those keyword tags into its Internet site. As a result, IRS expects to increase the odds that the CI Internet site would be included alongside Internet sites that promote questionable tax avoidance strategies. In addition, CI is working to create a web content manager position with responsibilities that include designing a strategy to maximize the potential of CI\u2019s Internet site. The manager would be responsible for helping to integrate CI data into the pages in IRS\u2019s Internet site that provide information to specific types of taxpayers.", "CI Public Information Officers. In October 2000, CI established PIOs in each of IRS\u2019s 35 field offices. The PIOs serve as points of contact for all internal and external CI communications initiatives, including the issuing of press releases and the coordination of important law enforcement media events. Although IRS has other media relations specialists located in its field offices, their duties tend to focus on publicizing tax filing season information, including the benefits of electronic filing.

Part of CI\u2019s local strategy involves generating a \u201chook\u201d to get the stories focused more on communities. In addition, CI has employed a strategy of \u201cbundling\u201d news stories.

Once several such cases have been put together, CI will bundle these stories together into a single news story for possible publication in magazines and journals read by people in the restaurant industry.   giving speeches and participating in a wide variety of presentations, panel discussions, and conferences with professional organizations, including the American Bar Association, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the American Medical Association, to create public awareness of CI\u2019s activities and to provide information about fraudulent tax schemes."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "IRS\u2019s Coordination with Other Relevant Federal Agencies", "paragraphs": ["IRS works with various federal agencies in its efforts to identify and deal with fraudulent tax schemes.

Recently, IRS has begun to take a more assertive and coordinated approach to detecting and dealing with an ever-changing array of abusive tax schemes, including those involving the use of domestic and offshore trusts. In the past year, IRS has added more resources to these efforts, created new programs, and improved others, and it is reorganizing its operations. Furthermore, based on the limited data available, IRS appears to be realizing some increased success in convicting those involved in schemes, publicizing these results, and uncovering previously hidden major offshore compliance problems.", "Nevertheless, it is difficult to get a clear picture of all that is underway in IRS\u2014how much is new as opposed to reemphasized or reorganized, and how the pieces combine to form a planned, coordinated effort with specific, defined outcomes. No central office, group, or executive could provide us with an agencywide focus or perspective on IRS\u2019s strategy, goals, objectives, performance measures, or program results. Responsibility for the efforts was spread across various functions and groups within IRS. To some extent, this lack of clarity is not surprising given the fairly rapid and ongoing change in IRS\u2019s efforts, the expanding scope of the problem, and the difficulty in determining the difference between what is legitimate, aggressive tax planning and an abusive tax scheme.", "IRS has recognized that its resources will be stretched to deal with these often complex schemes and that its multiple, enhanced efforts need to be better integrated. In an attempt to bring this integration to fruition, IRS\u2019s SB/SE division is reorganizing to place key efforts to combat abusive schemes under one executive. A centralized focal point should enhance IRS\u2019s ability to manage its efforts to reduce the prevalence and magnitude of abusive tax schemes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["On May 16, 2002, we received written comments on a draft of this report from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (see appendix).
