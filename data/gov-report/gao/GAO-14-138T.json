The Deputy Director for Management at the Office of Management and Budget chairs the Performance Accountability Council that oversees reform efforts to enhance the personnel security process. The security process includes: the determination of whether a position requires a clearance, application submission, investigation, and adjudication. Specifically, agency officials must first determine whether a federal civilian position requires access to classified information. After an individual has been selected for a position that requires a personnel security clearance and the individual submits an application for a clearance, investigators\u2014often contractors\u2014from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) conduct background investigations for most executive branch agencies. Adjudicators from requesting agencies use the information from these investigations and federal adjudicative guidelines to determine whether an applicant is eligible for a clearance. Further, individuals are subject to reinvestigations at intervals based on the level of security clearance.", "Executive branch agencies do not consistently assess quality throughout the personnel security clearance process, in part because they have not fully developed and implemented metrics to measure quality in key aspects of the process. For more than a decade, GAO has emphasized the need to build and monitor quality throughout the clearance process to promote oversight and positive outcomes such as maximizing the likelihood that individuals who are security risks will be scrutinized more closely. GAO reported in 2009 that, with respect to initial top secret clearances adjudicated in July 2008 for the Department of Defense (DOD), documentation was incomplete for most of OPM's investigative reports. GAO independently estimated that 87 percent of about 3,500 investigative reports that DOD adjudicators used to make clearance eligibility decisions were missing some required documentation, such as the verification of all of the applicant's employment, the required number of social references for the applicant, and complete security forms. In May 2009, GAO recommended that OPM measure the frequency with which its investigative reports met federal investigative standards to improve the completeness\u2014that is, quality\u2014of investigation documentation. In January 2014, DNI officials said that metrics to measure quality of investigative reports had not been established.", "GAO reported in 2010 that executive branch agencies do not consistently and comprehensively track the extent to which reciprocity is occurring because no government-wide metrics exist to consistently and comprehensively track when reciprocity is granted.

Federal agencies also use other processes and  procedures to determine if an individual should be granted access to  certain government buildings or facilities or be employed as either a  military or federal civilian employee, or contractor for the federal  government.

Although the Office of Management and Budget agreed with  our recommendation, a 2011 ODNI report found that Intelligence  Community agencies experienced difficulty reporting on reciprocity. The  agencies are required to report on a quarterly basis the number of  security clearance determinations granted based on a prior existing  clearance as well as the number not granted when a clearance existed.  The numbers of reciprocal determinations made and denied are  categorized by the individual\u2019s originating and receiving organizational  type: (1) government to government, (2) government to contractor,    (3)  contractor to government, and (4) contractor to contractor. The ODNI  report stated that data fields necessary to collect the information  described above do not currently reside in any of the data sets available,  and the process was completed in an agency-specific, semimanual  method.", "The Deputy Assistant Director for Special Security of ODNI noted in  testimony in June 2012 that measuring reciprocity is difficult, and despite  an abundance of anecdotes, real data are hard to come by. To address  this problem, in 2013 ODNI planned to develop a web-based form for  individuals to use to submit their experience with reciprocity issues to  ODNI. According to ODNI, this would allow it to collect empirical data,  perform systemic trend analysis, and assist agencies with achieving  workable solutions. However, in January 2014, ODNI officials told us that  required resources and information technology were not available to  support the development and implementation of a web-based form.  Instead, ODNI is conducting a Reciprocity Research Study that will  involve, among other things, agencies identifying their ability to collect  reciprocity metrics. This study would assist ODNI in developing reciprocity  performance measures and a new policy for reciprocity. ODNI would also  use the study to determine if a web-based form would be of value.", "In conclusion, to avoid the risk of damaging, unauthorized disclosures of  classified information, oversight of the reform efforts to measure and  improve the quality of the security clearance process is imperative. The  progress that was made with respect to reducing the amount of time  required for processing clearances would not have been possible without  committed and sustained congressional oversight and the leadership of  the Performance Accountability Council. Further actions are needed now  to fully develop and implement metrics to oversee quality at every step in  the process.", "Further, ensuring the quality of personnel security clearance  investigations and adjudications is important government-wide, not just  for DOD. While reciprocity is required by law and, if implemented  correctly, could enhance efficiency and present cost savings  opportunities, much is unknown about the extent to which previously  granted security clearance investigations and adjudications are honored  government-wide. Therefore, we recommended that metrics are needed  to track reciprocity, which have yet to be fully developed and  implemented. Assurances that all clearances are of a high quality may  further encourage reciprocity of investigation and adjudications. We will  continue to monitor the outcome of the agency actions discussed above  to address our outstanding recommendations.", "Chairman Issa, Ranking Member Cummings and Members of the  Committee, this concludes my statement for the record."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgements", "paragraphs": ["For further information on this testimony, please contact Brenda S.
