In response, Center managers began making changes to create a facility management organization to operate the facility. According to both Center officials and records, the changes continue, particularly in regard to the management systems and reports.", "The John F. Kennedy Center Act Amendments of 1994 (the Amendments) provided that the Board was to plan, design, and construct each repair or improvement project and provide the maintenance, repair, alteration, janitorial, security, and other services and equipment necessary for the operation of the facility. The Amendments also provided for the transfer, to the Board, of NPS employees assigned to duties related to functions transferred to the Board.", "This report, in so far as it discusses management of the capital repair program at the Center, updates information contained in our 1993 report on the Center\u2019s program.

Shortly thereafter, in 1972, the Secretary of the Interior, through NPS, assumed responsibility for building maintenance, security, interpretative, janitorial, and all other services necessary for the nonperforming arts functions of the Center. The Board, however, retained responsibility for all performing arts activities. The relationship was formalized in a July 1973 agreement between NPS and the Board.", "In the early 1990s, the Board petitioned Congress for complete control of all facility operations at the Center. In part, the Board based its request on the difficulty encountered in managing the Center under the dual responsibility established by the July 1973 agreement. In response, Congress, in the 1994 Amendments, transferred responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the facility from NPS to the Board and authorized appropriations to be made to the Board for this purpose. With the implementation of the Amendments the Board assumed responsibility for managing the day-to-day operation and maintenance related to the performing and nonperforming arts functions as well as the long-term care of the facility.", "The development of an overall organizational structure for the Kennedy Center was one item we discussed in a 1972 report. In discussing the direction in which the new Center could proceed, we stated that the Center should establish an organizational structure that clearly defines and specifically assigns responsibility for performance of functions while delegating appropriate authority to perform such functions.", "Subsequently, in a February 1993 report we noted that the Center did not have individuals on staff with certain professional and technical skills, such as a federal contracting officer or architects and engineers that would be associated with managing capital projects. However, our report noted that, on the basis of our discussions with Center officials, there appeared to be no reason that\u2014with sufficient time and funding\u2014the Center could not acquire the necessary management capability.", "In August and September 1995, a Center consultant evaluated the Center\u2019s operational and maintenance functions to identify strategies for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the facility management staff and operations. The consultant\u2019s September 1995 report noted in part that there were no clear lines of responsibility within the existing facility management structure and that job descriptions were not clearly defined. The consultant recommended that mechanisms be developed to (1) establish clear lines of responsibility and authority, (2) consolidate all services related to the maintenance of the facility under one authority, and (3) develop specific and detailed job descriptions for each position. Further, the consultant\u2019s report also noted that \u201cAn organized system should be developed for managing information concerning the facility operations to be used to monitor performance against established standards.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The objectives of our work were to develop information on the status of the Center\u2019s efforts to (1) define and implement facility management positions; (2) develop or procure and implement a facility management system; and (3) develop facility project and financial reports, since the 1994 transfer of facility responsibilities from NPS to the Board. Therefore, we limited our inquiries to identifying the facility management positions that were created by the Center since the 1994 transfer. We also identified the management systems and reports that support the facility management positions. We did not attempt to assess whether the persons filling facility management positions had the expertise or experience necessary for those positions or whether the definitions of the roles or responsibilities of the positions were complete. Further, we did not assess whether the management systems and reports had the capability to or were being used properly to assist facility managers.", "We defined the scope of facility management functions in accordance with guidelines of the International Facility Management Association. The guidelines provide that facility management coordinates the physical workplace with the people and work of the organization. In general, the scope of responsibilities can begin with the parking lot and extend to the grounds; building exterior; building systems; building services; and the layout, furniture, and furnishing of staff work space. The Association notes that 8 groups of similar activities, comprising 41 responsibilities, are commonly involved in managing facilities. The eight groups involve real estate, long-range planning, space management, interior planning, interior installations, maintenance and operations, architecture and engineering services, and budgeting.", "To obtain information on the development of facility management positions and their associated roles and responsibilities, we obtained Center organizational charts, discussed the roles and responsibilities of each managerial position with the current occupant, and obtained the position description. Since our objective was to provide information on the status of the creation of positions, we did not assess the appropriateness of organizational structures.", "To obtain information on the status of changes in the facility management systems and reports, we interviewed Center officials; reviewed documentation prepared by the Center or its vendors and obtained information on implementation schedules. To gain an understanding of the potential assistance the systems and reports could provide managers, we interviewed Center officials; reviewed contracting records and vendor materials; and reviewed documentation provided by finance and project officials, which demonstrated the types of reports that have been designed and implemented. Since our objective was to provide information only on the status of systems and reports, not the accuracy of the output of the systems, we did not test the accuracy or the completeness of the outputs we obtained.", "We did our work between January and December 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

On July 20, 1997, the Director of Security, who had performed the duties of Director of Facilities in an acting capacity, was appointed the Director of Facilities while retaining the responsibilities of Director of Security. Officials to whom we spoke told us that, although one person has been given responsibility for both positions to reflect the close relationship between facilities and security needs in regard to operation of the Center, neither position had been abolished.

On July 20, 1997, the Director of Security was also designated as the Director of Facilities, thus combining the roles and responsibilities of both positions.

Briefly, the management support supplied by contract employees includes the following: Management of construction work.
