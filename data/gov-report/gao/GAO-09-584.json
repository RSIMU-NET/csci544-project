The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) spent $11.7 billion on the school meal programs in that year. The majority of school meals are provided for free or at a reduced price to low-income students. Some states and school districts have chosen to implement programs that eliminate the reduced-price fee (known as ERP programs) and instead provide free meals to students eligible for the reduced fee. GAO was asked to provide information on (1) what is known about the states and districts that have eliminated the reduced-price fee for school meals, (2) the experiences of states and districts that have ERP programs with respect to participation, errors, and costs, and (3) the factors that may help or hinder the establishment or continuation of ERP programs. To obtain this information, GAO interviewed FNS officials, interviewed officials from state- and district-level programs, and conducted a Web-based survey of the 35 districts identified as having ERP programs. However, because the universe of ERP programs is unknown, survey results cannot be generalized to all districts with ERP programs. USDA did not provide formal written comments, but FNS provided technical comments, which were incorporated where appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO identified 5 states and an additional 35 school districts in 19 other states that eliminated the reduced-price fee for school meals, primarily to increase participation or reduce hunger. States and districts eliminated reduced-price fees for either breakfast or lunch or, in some cases, for both meals. Further, some ERP programs included all grades, and some covered only the early school years. One state- and most district-level officials GAO interviewed or surveyed reported that ERP programs have increased the rate of participation among students who are eligible for reduced-price meals. Participation may increase for a number of reasons; however, for those districts that implemented ERP programs in the most recently completed school year (2007-2008) and provided participation data, their average increase in the participation rate among reduced-price-eligible students was greater than the national change in this rate over the same year. ERP programs involve additional costs to states and districts, as they bear the cost of the reduced-price fees that these students otherwise would have paid. For the state and district ERP programs that experienced increased participation, FNS reimbursements, and thus federal costs, also increased. While the increased reimbursements partially offset program costs, state ERP programs covered their remaining costs with state funds and districts used a variety of revenue sources. The majority of district-level officials reported that their districts experienced benefits from the ERP programs, such as a decrease in the burden on staff to collect unpaid meal fees from reduced-price-eligible students who received school meals but who charged these meals and built up a balance of unpaid meal fees. State officials GAO interviewed cited support from legislators and nonprofit organizations in establishing ERP programs in state law. Supportive school boards and superintendents were a major factor in establishing district-level programs. Most state officials indicated that a loss of state funding would threaten program continuation, while some district-level officials indicated they would try to raise additional revenue or reduce expenditures to cover program costs. As of late 2008, officials from all 5 states and most district-level ERP programs planned to continue their programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2008, about 31 million children participated in the National  School Lunch Program (NSLP) and more than 10 million children  participated in the School Breakfast Program (SBP) each school day. The  school meal programs are administered by the U.S. Department of  Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) through state  agencies that, in turn, oversee local school food authorities (SFA). SFAs  that participate in the lunch and breakfast programs receive federal cash  reimbursements through the state agency for each meal they serve. USDA  spent $11.7 billion on these programs in fiscal year 2008. The majority of  school meals served through the NSLP and SBP are provided to low- income students. Depending on their household income and other factors,  students receiving school meals pay either the full meal price or a  reduced-price fee or receive free meals. Over half of the school meals  served in fiscal year 2008 were provided free to students, and an additional  10 percent were provided at a reduced price.", "In 2004, Congress authorized a pilot project to assess the effects of  eliminating the reduced-price fee for school lunch and breakfast and  providing free meals to students who are eligible for reduced-price meals.  At that time, some Members of Congress expressed concern about reports  from school boards across the country that many parents were finding it  increasingly difficult to pay the reduced-price fee for school meals.  Although funds have not been appropriated to support this pilot project,  some states and school districts have chosen to implement their own  initiatives that eliminate the reduced-price fee and provide free meals to  students who are eligible for reduced-price meals (known as ERP  programs).  Specifically, these states and school districts do not collect  reduced-price fees from students who are eligible for reduced-price meals.  Instead, states and school districts with ERP programs bear the cost of the  reduced-price fees\u2014not more than 40 cents for each lunch and 30 cents  for each breakfast served\u2014that otherwise would have been paid by  students. However, these states and districts still collect full-price meal  fees from other students and still receive a cash reimbursement from FNS  for each meal they serve, based on the type of meal served (lunch or  breakfast) and the meal category (free, reduced price, or full price). States  and districts with ERP programs are reimbursed at the reduced-price rate  for the meals that they provide free to reduced-price-eligible students.", "To provide a better understanding of the experiences of states and school  districts with ERP programs, this requested report presents information on  the following questions: (1) What is known about the state and local  jurisdictions that have eliminated the reduced-price fee for the school  lunch or breakfast programs? (2) What have been the experiences of state  and local jurisdictions that have eliminated reduced-price fees with  respect to factors such as participation, errors, and costs? (3) What factors  may help or hinder the establishment or continuation of programs that  eliminate reduced-price fees?", "To answer these questions, we identified states and school districts that  have implemented ERP programs and collected information about their  experiences. In August 2008, FNS provided us with a preliminary list of 4  states with ERP programs and 43 school districts with ERP programs in 16  other states. However, FNS is not necessarily aware of all the states and  districts with ERP programs, because states and districts are not required  to report this information to FNS. We conducted follow-up with child  nutrition officials in Washington, D.C., and the 28 states for which no  information was provided, as well as officials in 10 states for which  information was incomplete or needed clarification. We identified 5 states  with ERP programs: Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Vermont, and  Washington. In each of these states, we conducted semistructured phone  interviews with state child nutrition officials. We also conducted a Web- based survey of SFA officials in 51 school districts that we initially  identified as having ERP programs. We received survey responses from  officials in 44 districts, 35 of whom confirmed that their districts had ERP  programs. Our questionnaire asked these officials to describe the ERP  programs; the reasons they implemented these programs; the effects of the  programs on participation, errors, and costs; and the factors that helped or  hindered program implementation. While we did not validate specific  information that SFA officials reported in our survey, we reviewed their  responses and conducted follow-up as necessary to determine that the  data were complete, reasonable, and sufficiently reliable for the purposes  of this report. In addition, we conducted site visits with two school  districts (Grand Rapids Public Schools, Michigan and Salt Lake City  School District, Utah) and semistructured phone interviews with two  school districts (Great Neck Public Schools, New York, and Hillsborough  County School District, Florida). We selected these school districts based  on the following criteria: (1) variation in the duration of the ERP program,  (2) variation in the percentage of students eligible for free or reduced- price meals, and (3) variation in location and city size. In each of these  districts, we interviewed SFA officials responsible for administering the  school meal programs. In addition to collecting information from states  and school districts with ERP programs, we interviewed officials at FNS  and USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service (ERS), as well as representatives  of child nutrition advocacy organizations and professional associations,  and reviewed relevant studies. We also conducted semistructured phone  interviews with SFA officials in 2 school districts we identified that had  discontinued ERP programs.

At the federal level, these programs are administered by FNS as part of its  strategic goal to improve the nation\u2019s nutrition and health, and the  department has laid out plans to increase access to, and utilization of,  these school meal programs.", "At the state level, the NSLP and SBP are typically administered by state  education agencies, which operate the programs through agreements with  SFAs. SFAs, in turn, administer the school meal programs at individual  schools. SFAs must offer meals that meet federal nutritional requirements,  operate the food service on a nonprofit basis and follow the record- keeping and claims procedures required by USDA. As shown in fig. 1, SFAs  receive cash reimbursements from FNS through the state agency for each  meal they serve, based on the type of meal served (lunch or breakfast) and  the meal category (free, reduced price, or full price). In addition, unless  they are eligible for free meals, students pay a full-price or reduced-price  fee to SFAs for each meal they receive, depending on their household  income. To supplement the federal reimbursement, some state agencies  also use state funds to provide cash reimbursements to SFAs based on the  number of meals they serve.", "In school year 2008-2009, FNS per meal reimbursement rates ranged from  24 cents for a full-price lunch to $2.57 for a free lunch (see table 1)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Free and Reduced-price School Meals for Low- Income Students", "paragraphs": ["The majority of the meals served through the NSLP and SBP are provided  for free or at a reduced price to low-income students.

Similarly, about 71 percent of  the school breakfasts served were provided for free and about 10 percent  were provided at a reduced price (see fig. 2). The laws governing the  school lunch and breakfast programs establish maximum charges for  reduced-price meals, but SFAs set their own fees for full-price meals.", "School districts are required to determine whether students are eligible to  receive free or reduced-price school meals based on federal poverty  guidelines. Students are eligible for free meals if their household income  is less than or equal to 130 percent of the federal poverty level, or if they  are homeless, runaway, or migrant, as defined in the law. Students are  eligible for reduced-price meals if their household income is greater than  130 percent and less than or equal to 185 percent of the federal poverty  level (see table 2). Typically, parents submit school meal applications to  school districts each school year, including self-reported household  income, household size, and information on whether the household  participates in any other federal nutrition assistance programs. Districts  review school meal applications and certify students as being eligible for  free or reduced-price meals, and are required by FNS to annually verify the  accuracy of their eligibility determinations for a sample of free and  reduced-price meal applicants. If students\u2019 household income is above  185 percent of the federal poverty level, they pay the full-price fee for  school meals set by the SFA.", "According to USDA, nearly half of the households that received free or  reduced-price school lunches from mid-November to mid-December 2007  faced food insecurity, in that they had difficulty providing enough food for  all their members because of a lack of resources. Specifically, ERS  analyzed data from an annual food security survey conducted by the U.S.  Census Bureau in December 2007 and found that 47 percent of the  households that received free or reduced-price school lunches in the  month prior to the survey faced food insecurity at some time during 2007.

This study found that  when controlling for other factors, high school students are less likely to  participate in school meals than middle school students, and middle  school students are less likely to participate in school meals than  elementary school students.

However, these schools  and districts do not collect reduced-price fees or full-price fees from  students and therefore need to make up for this lost revenue in other  ways. Because the federal reimbursement is significantly higher for free  and reduced-price meals than for full-price meals, these programs may not  be as costly an alternative for schools with a very high percentage of  students eligible for free or reduced-price meals schools relative to  schools with a lower percentage of these students. Two USDA special  assistance provisions of the NSLP and the SBP allow participating schools  and districts to provide reimbursable, universal free meals to all  participating students regardless of their household income.

State  officials from 4 of the 5 states cited reducing hunger and food insecurity,  through increasing participation of low\u2013income students, as the primary  reason for implementing the ERP programs. For example, an official in 1  of the 5 states said the state had ranked high in the nation for hunger and  food insecurity several years ago, and the official thought the ERP  program would be one way to help address this problem. Similarly, in our  survey, almost all district officials cited reducing hunger and food  insecurity and increasing participation of reduced-price-eligible students  as major or moderate reasons for implementing the ERP programs as well.  (See fig. 6.) SFA officials we interviewed in one district said the district  started its ERP program to help those students who were not eating  breakfast or lunch because their families could not afford either meal,  even at the reduced price, much less both meals.", "Some state- and district-level officials we interviewed or surveyed also  cited the intention to improve academic performance and increase overall  participation as major reasons for implementing these ERP programs. One  state implemented its statewide program primarily in response to the view  that eating breakfast is related to academic success.", "States and districts implemented ERP programs in various ways. For  example, state- and district-level officials said they eliminated reduced- price fees for either breakfast, lunch, or both meals.

Officials from all 5 states we interviewed and  most of the 35 districts we surveyed eliminated the reduced-price fee for at  least one meal in all grades. However, Colorado and Washington provided  free lunch to reduced-price-eligible students in specific grades in addition  to breakfast for all grades; Colorado\u2019s lunch ERP program was limited to  kindergarten through second grade, and in Washington ERP lunch was  limited to kindergarten through third grade. One district ERP program was  limited to eighth grade and below, and some district ERP programs  included preschool, while others did not.", "In addition, some states and districts used ERP programs in combination  with other free meal programs. Four of the 5 states with ERP programs  included schools or districts with universal free meal programs. For  example, while Colorado schools provide ERP for breakfast, Denver  Public Schools, the state\u2019s largest school district, has offered universal free  breakfast for the last few years. Thirteen of the 35 districts with ERP  programs for one meal also had universal programs for the other meal. For  example, the Hillsborough County School District in Florida provides  lunch through its ERP program but has also offered free breakfast to all  students through a universal free meals program since 2002.

Officials in 20 of the 23 districts with ERP lunch programs reported that  these programs have increased the participation of reduced-price-eligible  students in school lunch, while again officials in 2 districts reported no  change in lunch participation and one district official did not know  whether lunch participation had changed. In a separate survey question,  some SFA officials provided data indicating that the rate of participation  among reduced-price-eligible students increased, on average, by 9  percentage points in breakfast and 11 percentage points in lunch, since  their ERP programs were implemented (see table 6).", "The increase in the participation rate among reduced-price-eligible  students in these districts may not be entirely due to the ERP programs, as  participation rates may vary even in districts without ERP programs over  time, but at least some of the increases in participation appear to be a  result of the ERP programs themselves. SFA officials in districts with  ERP programs reported that the average increase in the lunch  participation rate among reduced-price-eligible students (11 percentage  points) was greater than the average increase in this participation rate  among students in the free (5 percentage points) or full-price (5  percentage points) meal categories for their districts. Further, in the four  districts that implemented their ERP programs in school year 2007-2008  and provided participation data\u20142 of these districts had ERP programs  for breakfast and lunch, and 2 districts limited their ERP programs to  breakfast\u2014the increase in the breakfast participation rate (2 to 11  percentage points) and lunch participation rate (7 to 10 percentage points)  among reduced-price-eligible students was greater than the national  change in these participation rates (less than a 1 percentage point change  each for breakfast and lunch).", "Two states and most school districts with ERP programs observed no  effect on school meal program errors related to student eligibility or meal  counting. Implementing an ERP program would generally not be  expected to have an effect on school meal program errors, because school  districts and SFAs are required to follow the same administrative  procedures regardless of whether or not they collect reduced-price fees.  According to FNS officials, districts that eliminated the reduced-price fee  are still required to process school meal applications and certify students  as being eligible for reduced-price meals under federal poverty guidelines,  and SFAs are still required to count the number of reduced-price meals  they serve and report this meal count to FNS. In two of the 5 states with  ERP programs, officials said they believe that these programs had no  effect on school meal program errors. In two other states, officials told us  that they were unable to determine whether the ERP programs had an  effect on errors. In the fifth state, an official said that districts\u2019 meal- counting errors increased temporarily because of the implementation of  the state ERP program, which required districts to change the way they  reported to the state the number of meals served. However, this official  told us that these errors have since returned to their previous levels. In our  survey, SFA officials in 32 of the 35 school districts with ERP programs  reported that these programs had no effect on errors related to student  eligibility, and officials in 31 districts reported that these programs had no  effect on meal-counting errors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States and Most Districts Covered Their ERP Program Costs through Increased Federal Reimbursements and Other Funding Sources", "paragraphs": ["ERP programs involve additional costs to states and school districts, as  well as to the federal government.

Across the 5 states with ERP programs, officials told us  that the costs for them to implement these programs ranged from about  $144,000 to about $3 million per year, and across the 4 school districts  with ERP programs we interviewed, SFA officials said that program costs  ranged from about $12,000 to about $370,000 per year. In addition, both  state- and district-level ERP programs involve an additional cost to the  federal government because these programs generally lead to increased  participation among reduced-price-eligible students, thus increasing the  reimbursement that FNS provides to states. In addition to the FNS  reimbursement, some states also provide a reimbursement to SFAs based  on the number of meals they serve. In these cases, the increased  participation among reduced-price-eligible students associated with ERP  programs involves additional costs to states.", "While increased federal reimbursements partially offset program costs for  the state and district ERP programs that experienced increased  participation, all 5 state ERP programs used state appropriations to cover  their remaining program costs, and districts used a variety of revenue  sources to manage their remaining program costs. Increased FNS  reimbursements can offset program costs when the amount of the per  meal reimbursement exceeds the cost to the SFA of producing the meal. In  our survey, SFA officials in 21 of the 35 districts with ERP programs said  that they received an increased reimbursement amount from FNS as a  result of increased participation. For example, an SFA official from the  Grand Rapids Public Schools told us that the total additional cost to the  district associated with the ERP program is about $92,000 per year, but the  net cost of the program is about $64,000 per year, because the SFA  experienced an increase of about $28,000 per year in its FNS  reimbursement as a result of increased participation. SFA officials in 2 of  these 21 districts told us that increased participation also allowed them to  obtain additional state funding. For example, because the Salt Lake City  School District receives state liquor tax funding based on the number of  lunches served by the SFA, the increased participation associated with the  ERP program also resulted in additional state funding. While SFA officials  in 16 districts told us that the additional revenue from increased  participation covered program costs, officials in 3 districts told us that it  did not cover program costs, and officials in 2 districts said they did not  know whether it covered program costs.  Several SFA officials told us  that their districts covered program costs by supplementing increased  reimbursement revenue from FNS with school district revenue from \u00e0 la  carte sales, catering, or other district funds, and one of these officials also  reported increasing the full-price meal fee to help cover costs. Even so,  officials in the 2 districts we identified that had discontinued ERP  programs told us they did so because they were unable to continue to  cover program costs.", "Some SFA officials identified factors that minimized the additional costs  associated with implementing ERP programs. A few SFA officials noted  that their districts were already bearing the cost of the reduced-price fee  for some students prior to implementing ERP programs because reduced- price-eligible students participating in school meals were often unable to  pay this fee. For example, an SFA official in 1 district said that over 33  percent of reduced-price-eligible students were receiving meals but were  not paying the reduced-price fee. Also, some districts experienced  economies of scale because ERP programs increased participation but did  not increase their labor costs. Specifically, SFA officials in these districts  told us that they were able to serve meals to more students without hiring  additional staff or increasing work hours for existing staff, because the  additional number of meals served at each school was relatively small.

Several officials who  reported that ERP programs decreased this administrative burden  explained that district staff no longer spend time trying to collect unpaid  meal charges from reduced-price-eligible students who receive school  meals but are unable to pay the reduced-price fee. One of these officials  further explained that prior to the implementation of the ERP program,  students who were unable to pay the reduced-price fee would charge these  meals and build up a balance of unpaid meal fees, and staff would then  spend time trying to collect these fees from parents. Several officials noted  that attempts to collect these fees were sometimes unsuccessful, and one  official said he believed that the cost of the administrative time spent  trying to collect these fees was greater than the value of the fees  themselves.", "Most of the SFA officials we surveyed reported that ERP programs have  had a generally positive effect on students\u2019 attitudes about and parents\u2019  level of satisfaction with the school meal programs (see table 8). SFA  officials in several districts also reported other benefits.

A Washington state official told  us that a coalition of several organizations contacted every member of the  state Ways and Means Committees to promote legislation that would  eliminate reduced-price fees. As shown in figure 7, most SFA officials from  the district-level programs we identified reported that supportive school  boards and superintendents were major factors in helping implement their  ERP programs.", "We also asked state- and district-level officials we interviewed and  surveyed about the effect that a number of other factors might have had  on the implementation of ERP programs. Specifically, we asked about a  lack of program funding, limited information on program development,  and requirements to continue annual certification of student eligibility for  reduced-price meals, but in general few states and districts indicated that  these were major factors that hindered implementation. See figure 8 for  district survey responses. For state ERP programs, lack of funding was not  a major factor largely because funds were appropriated by the state  legislature when these programs were established. However, at least one  official indicated that the state\u2019s decision to limit the number of grades  covered by the ERP program for lunch may have been due to funding  restrictions. Regarding program development, while officials in one state  found information on other state ERP programs to have been very helpful,  another state official cited unique circumstances as one reason why the  information was not that helpful in developing her state\u2019s ERP program.  Regarding the district-level ERP programs, these districts were generally  committed to making their programs work, had the support they needed,  and were able to succeed. However, the number of districts that may have  tried to implement ERP programs and been unsuccessful is not known.  Finally, most state- and district-level program officials did not see  continuing to certify reduced-price-eligible students as a major hindrance  because systems to capture this information were already in place."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fiscal Challenges Could Limit Available Funding for ERP Programs but Cuts May Be Manageable for Some District-level Programs", "paragraphs": ["Funding for the state ERP programs may be vulnerable to across-the- board budget cuts, but most district-level SFA officials reported less  dependence on state funding and more options for managing ERP program  costs. Officials from all 5 state programs indicated that dedicated state  appropriations were a primary source of ERP funding, and officials from  four of these states indicated that a loss of state funding would be a threat  to the continuation of their programs. While state or local budget cuts  might also affect district funding, especially in the current fiscal  environment, some district-level ERP programs might be better situated to  withstand such cuts. For example, we asked several of the SFA officials  from district-level ERP programs that we interviewed what would happen  to their programs if their funds were cut. Even under declining fiscal  conditions, when we conducted our interviews during the latter part of  2008 and early 2009, the officials indicated that the SFAs would explore  ways to raise additional revenue or reduce expenditures so that they could  continue to cover ERP program costs. Further, officials from several SFAs  that we interviewed indicated that the net costs of their district-level ERP  programs were less than 1 percent of their annual expenditures.  Specifically, an SFA official from the Grand Rapids Public Schools\u2014with  annual expenditures of about $8.3 million\u2014estimated the annual net cost  of its ERP program at about $64,000 per year. An SFA official from the  Great Neck Public Schools in New York told us that the average number of  students participating in reduced-price lunch was only about 7.6 percent  (221 of 2,921) of the total number of students who participated in school  lunch on a daily basis. In addition, SFA officials told us that they have  flexibility to potentially offset revenue losses. For example, the SFA  official from Great Neck told us that her district\u2019s ERP program had  previously covered costs through revenue generated by \u00e0 la carte sales,  but noted that recent declines in sales may require the district to begin  using reserve funds to cover program costs.", "Despite potential fiscal challenges at the time we conducted our  interviews and survey, all 5 states and 30 of the 35 districts surveyed  reported that they plan to continue their ERP programs in the future. The  other 5 districts had not decided to discontinue their programs, but said  they did not know if the programs would continue. Some state- and  district-level officials believe that there is an even greater need for this  type of program at a time when some families are experiencing increased  economic hardship. However, state and local fiscal conditions have  continued to deteriorate since we began our audit work and the effect of  the changes in the economic climate on ERP programs is unknown."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to USDA for review and comment.

To increase the survey response  rate, we conducted follow-up by both e-mail and phone with all  nonrespondents. The questionnaire asked SFA officials about the number  of students eligible for reduced-price meals; the meals and grades covered  by the ERP programs; the reasons they implemented these programs; the  duration of these programs; the effects of the programs on participation,  errors, and costs; the factors that helped or hindered program  implementation; and whether or not they plan to continue the ERP  programs in the future.

However, the practical difficulties of conducting any  survey may introduce nonsampling errors, such as variations in how  respondents interpret questions.

Specifically, we  pretested the draft questionnaire by phone with SFA officials in 5 school  districts\u20141 district in each of the states of Arizona, Indiana, Tennessee,  Utah, and Virginia\u2014in September through December 2008. In the pretests,  we were generally interested in the clarity of the questions and the logical  flow of the questionnaire. For example, we wanted to ensure that the  definitions used in the questionnaire were clear and understandable, the  categories provided in closed-ended questions were complete, and the  ordering of questions was logical. We made revisions to the questionnaire  in response to each of the pretests. In addition, using a Web-based survey  minimized nonsampling errors because this format eliminated the need for  and the errors associated with a manual data entry process. Specifically,  the Web-based survey allowed respondents to enter their responses  directly into the survey Web site and automatically created a database  record for each respondent.
