In certain circumstances, rather than change the DFARS, DOD can issue a class deviation, which allows its buying organizations to temporarily diverge from the acquisition regulations.

This is because no single DOD source communicates the status of regulatory or other changes in a manner that links the changes to specific NDAA provisions. As a result, interested parties are not always aware of what provisions have been implemented and when. This information is important for congressional oversight and to industry for planning and compliance purposes.

However, prior to publishing  that rule, the NDAA for fiscal year 2018 was enacted and contained  added LPTA requirements. After the 2018 NDAA was enacted, DARS  staff combined all of its related LPTA cases into a new DFARS case  and made adjustments to the proposed rule it had been developing.  The DARS staff responsible for updating the previous proposed rule  requested five extensions from DARS leadership between January  and March 2018 to update documentation to address the fiscal year  2018 provisions and prepare additional analyses. After months of  coordination and reviews, DARS staff published a proposed rule in  December 2018 with a 60-day comment period.

We  verified the validity of provisions and cases that were not in both the  DARS reports that DARS staff manually produced and the Defense  Acquisition Regulations Management Information System data with  DARS officials as of April 19, 2019.", "To identify the implementation status of acquisition-related NDAA  provisions from fiscal years 2010-2018, we further analyzed data from the  Defense Acquisition Regulations Management Information System and  DARS reports. For the actions associated with the 180 provisions, we  analyzed the status history of each case, associated status dates for  cases, and closed status indicators. We also reviewed DARS reports,  such as the internal stats charts with case duration and closure metrics  that DARS officials told us they manually verify. We reviewed a report that  the DARS staff manually produced for us that showed actions and cases  by provision for the NDAAs from fiscal years 2010-2018.", "We independently analyzed the NDAAs from fiscal years 2010-2018 and  determined 36 provisions in Title VIII that expressly directed DOD to  make or consider making an acquisition-related regulatory change, as  well as one provision that directed DOD to issue guidance. We identified  these provisions using a keyword search of individual and combined  terms and criteria, such as \u201cregulation, defense, and acquisition  regulation.\u201d To better understand the Defense Acquisition Regulations  Council\u2019s recommendations and DARS implementation process, we  selected 12 provisions that directed DOD to make or consider an  acquisition-related regulatory change for case studies. The case study  selection criteria included the year of the NDAA from which the provision  originated for a mix of older and newer provisions and time duration for a  mix of shorter and longer cases related to implement the provisions.", "We used DARS reports and our analysis of the Defense Acquisition  Regulations Management Information System data to determine the year  and time duration. Since the DFARS Case Standard Timeline is 52  weeks, we selected provisions with cases that were both more and less  than 52 weeks. We also selected provisions with cases that were open  and closed. We created a data collection instrument for the case studies  that captured information, such as which provisions were associated with  the case, to standardize our data collection process. For the 12  provisions, we reviewed the associated case files that are generally a  record of the implementation process and the Defense Acquisition  Regulations Council\u2019s recommendations, and the decisions made by the  DARS staff. We also reviewed available publication folders associated  with the cases that generally document input and decisions from other  agencies, such as the Office of Management Budget\u2019s Office of  Information and Regulatory Affairs. Finally, we used the information in the  files to verify the information in Defense Acquisition Regulations  Management Information System for those specific cases.", "We found the Defense Acquisition Regulations Management Information  System data and information in the files that we reviewed to be  sufficiently reliable for purposes of reporting on how the DARS staff  implemented NDAA provisions and the time duration to do so.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2018 to July 2019 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Penny Berrier, Assistant Director;  James Kim; Holly Williams; Beth Reed Fritts; Gail-Lynn Michel; Emily  Bond; Lori Fields; Matthew T.
