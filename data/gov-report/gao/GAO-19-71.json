DOD\u2019s Chief Information Officer (CIO) issued a  memorandum in 2012, which instructed DOD components, including the  military services, to issue guidance to, among other things, reduce the  number of print devices to one per office space of 12 or fewer users and  assess the ratio of printers to employees in larger spaces. However, the  services have not demonstrated that they have achieved their goals for  print device reductions. Specifically, we found the following:", "Army: The Secretary of the Army issued guidance in 2013, requiring  all Army commands, organizations, and activities to assess print  device capacity and plan for reductions if necessary based on the  results of those assessments. The guidance noted that those  reductions could save millions of dollars annually. The guidance also  included a requirement for biannual reporting by all Army commands,  organizations, and activities on their print device inventory, number of  printing devices required, and annual costs for printing device  acquisitions. In June 2014, Army commands reported an average of 5  users for each single function printer, compared to an industry  standard of 7 users per device and a DOD goal of one print device per  office space of 12 or fewer users and assessing the ratio of printers to  employees in larger spaces. According to Headquarters, Department  of the Army officials, however, Army commands objected to the  workload associated with this reporting requirement and discontinued  issuing the reports. As a result, the Army did not follow through with  enforcing the reporting, which limited the ability of Army officials to  ensure that Army commands achieved the planned reductions.", "Navy and Marine Corps: The Department of the Navy established  guidance in 2013, directing Department of the Navy officials to work  with DLA Document Services to conduct assessments and develop a  phased execution plan for the number and type of print devices Navy  and Marine Corps organizations require. The guidance also directed  Department of the Navy officials to develop policy requiring that the  acquisition of new devices be exclusively through DLA Document  Services. DLA subsequently conducted these assessments and found  that the Navy and Marine Corps had an average of one device for  every seven users. DLA Document Services recommended further  reductions in the number of print devices across the Navy and Marine  Corps, which it estimated could save over $63 million annually.  However, Department of the Navy officials were unable to provide us  with data on the total number of Navy and Marine Corps print devices  that would indicate whether these device reductions and savings had  occurred.", "Air Force: The Air Force did not issue any guidance based on the  CIO memorandum. In response to our review, the Air Force  developed draft guidance on print device management, which  includes a goal of increasing the ratio of users to devices from 4 users  per device to 12 users per device. The draft guidance also includes  requirements for quarterly reporting by the Air Force Information  Technology Business Analytics Office on the number of devices and  related metrics to monitor progress. According to an Air Force  analysis, doing so would achieve savings of over $67 million as it  replaces or retires devices. As of July 2018, the Air Force had not fully  implemented this guidance.", "Efforts by the military services to demonstrate that they have achieved  print device reduction goals have been limited because they have not  monitored the actions they have taken to reduce the number of print  devices. Military service officials we interviewed said they were unaware  of any efforts by the DOD CIO to ensure that device reductions occurred  and that DOD components achieved their planned savings, such as  providing information to the CIO on the status of their efforts to implement  the guidance in the memorandum or data on reductions in the number of  devices. Standards for internal control state that management should  implement control activities through policies that use quality information to  achieve an entity\u2019s objectives, monitor the internal control system, and  evaluate the results of the system.", "Efforts to implement the memorandum to achieve print device reduction  goals have also been limited because responsibility for implementation  was not clearly assigned. According to a DOD CIO official, the  responsibility for the memorandum is not clearly assigned to a member of  the CIO staff. This official also stated that because of the consolidation of  information technology services in the Pentagon and the national capital  region, the Defense Information Systems Agency\u2019s Joint Service Provider  assumed responsibility for implementing the memorandum. According to  Joint Service Provider officials, however, they were only responsible for  implementing the memorandum for the customers they serve in the  Pentagon and the national capital region, and not for other DOD  components outside those areas, such as military services. Standards for  internal control state that management should ensure that key roles in  operating the internal control system are clearly assigned. In the  absence of these controls, such as reporting procedures to monitor  actions to reduce the number of print devices and establishing clear  responsibility for implementing the CIO memorandum, DOD has been  unable to ensure that it is achieving any estimated savings, which could  represent tens of millions of dollars annually."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consolidating Locations That Provide Mission Specialty Printing", "paragraphs": ["DLA Document Services may be able to realize additional savings from  further consolidating facilities beyond those already identified, but it does  not currently plan to do so, and it does not have the complete data it  would need to make those determinations. As a part of its transformation  plan, DLA Document Services identified 38 of its 112 facilities in the  continental United States that it would retain. DLA Document Services  officials stated that they considered a number of factors in determining  whether to consolidate or retain facilities, including the number of staff  and customers and the facilities\u2019 workloads, but that they generally  consolidated or retained facilities based on whether the facility provided  \u201cmission specialty\u201d services. These mission specialties are services that  DLA Document Services officials believe cannot be easily outsourced,  such as printing and reproduction of classified and sensitive documents  and on-demand printing and distribution of certain technical materials.", "However, our analysis of DLA Document Services data found that some  facilities retained for certain mission specialties were responsible for a  relatively small share of business for those specialties in fiscal year 2016  (the last full year for which data were provided), which suggests that  further consolidations are possible. For example, for each of the four  mission specialties for which DLA Document Services provided us with  revenue data, the bottom quartile (25 percent) of the facilities retained for  each specialty were responsible for less than 5 percent of the total  revenue for that specialty, as shown in figure 6. We also found some  cases in which DLA Document Services retained facilities that reported  less revenue for a given specialty than facilities that it did not retain.  According to officials, DLA Document Services took a number of factors  into consideration in deciding on consolidations, including the complexity  of the work at a facility and whether nearby sites could fulfill the orders.  According to these officials, this allowed them to consolidate some  facilities even if those facilities had greater revenue from a given mission  specialty than other facilities.", "DOD Instruction 5330.03 requires DLA Document Services to provide  effective and efficient document services support to DOD components.  Our key practices for efficiency initiatives also note the importance of  targeting both short-term and long-term efficiency initiatives. DLA  Document Services officials stated that they would consider additional  consolidations of facilities, but they have not conducted any analysis or  planning to gain further efficiencies and do not currently have plans to do  so. These officials stated they are committed to implementing the current  transformation plan as announced. Officials also stated that they want to  have a better sense of the results from the current transformation,  including how workloads may change among facilities as consolidations  occur, before considering additional consolidations.

Standards for internal control state that entities\u2019  management should use quality information to achieve the entities\u2019  objectives. However, DLA Document Services could not provide  revenue data on three specific mission specialties\u2014sensitive, classified,  and Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information\u2014for which it retained 30 of its  facilities, including some that it retained exclusively for those specialties.  According to DLA Document Services officials, they did not collect  revenue data for these mission specialties because the facilities  responsible for processing this type of information were generally  retained, regardless of the revenue they produced, due to the sensitive  nature of this work. As noted above, our analysis of available mission  specialty data found that some facilities that DLA retained for certain  mission specialties did a relatively small share of business for those  specialties, indicating that there may be opportunities for additional facility  consolidations. DLA Document Services officials told us that they had  consulted with managers at the facilities about the amount of sensitive  and classified they conducted. Because of these consultations, DLA  Document Services is closing some facilities that handled sensitive and  classified information. However, DLA Document Services does not  routinely collect these data as it does for other mission specialties.

We reviewed the O&M obligations for printing and  reproduction in fiscal years 2012 through 2016 that were reported to  Congress by the military services. The total obligations ranged from about  $534 million to about $736 million annually for the 5-year period (see fig.  7).", "Our analysis found that DOD\u2019s O&M budget materials for printing and  reproduction are inaccurate in two ways. First, the budget materials  include obligations that are primarily for non-printing activities, such as  the purchase of advertising and radio and television time. DOD and  military service financial management officials prepare budget justification  materials for their O&M funding requests on an annual basis. DOD and  the services report printing and reproduction costs in the Summary of  Price and Program Changes budget exhibit (the \u201cOP-32\u201d). It contains  information by line item, detailing, among other items, printing and  reproduction and related operations performed by the military services,  DLA, or GPO. It also contains elements of expenses for purchases  related to document services that are provided by DLA. The OP-32  exhibits are provided to Congress with the budget justification materials  accompanying the President\u2019s annual budget request.", "Officials from AMRG told us that, in accordance with Army guidance,  printing and reproduction obligations are coupled with other obligations,  including the purchase of advertising space and radio and television time  for recruiting activities. Data provided by these officials show that in fiscal  year 2016, AMRG\u2019s obligations for printing and reproduction accounted  for only about $2 million, or 2 percent, of the Army\u2019s total fiscal year 2016  obligations included in the printing and reproduction line of the OP-32.  Obligations for the publication of notices, advertising, and radio and  television time accounted for about $78 million, or 63 percent, of the  obligations reported for printing and reproduction. According to officials,  the Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps also follow their respective  guidance on reporting printing and reproduction obligations together with  these other obligations.", "Second, the budget justification information does not represent the full  scope of the military services\u2019 document services mission. Specifically,  we found that the military services\u2019 annual budget requests do not provide  distinct information on two areas of their document services mission\u2014 print device procurement and electronic content management. Data we  reviewed indicate that the military services obligate a considerable  amount of resources in these areas. For example, according to DLA  Document Services, sales to DOD and the military services for its print  device services are comparable to sales for its printing and reproduction  services. According to DLA data, in fiscal year 2017, it received in  revenue about $108 million for print device and about $105 million for  printing and reproduction services. Officials from the military services told  us that obligations for these activities are included within the budget  requests for various IT procurement categories. For example, Army  Budget Office officials noted that the budget request for IT procurement  and office supplies would include estimates associated with the purchase  and sustainment of devices, but those line items would include other,  non-printing obligations as well. According to these officials, the Army has  made efforts to standardize the procurement of information technology,  including collecting better data on spending for these types of devices.  They told us that these efforts will result in shifts in how those obligations  are reported in budget justification materials.", "The accuracy and completeness of DOD\u2019s financial information about its  document services can affect the allocation of budgetary resources, and  inaccurate or incomplete information can hamper initiatives to gain further  efficiencies. The Handbook of Federal Accounting Standards states that  its managerial cost accounting concepts and standards are aimed at  agencies providing reliable and timely information on the full costs of their  federal programs that congressional and executive decision makers can  use in making decisions about allocating federal resources and program  managers can use in making decisions to improve operating economy  and efficiency. DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation lays out the  structure of the budget exhibits that the military services develop during  the department\u2019s budget process. According to a DOD Comptroller  official, DOD has historically reported its budget requests following the  format prescribed by the Financial Management Regulation, and it follows  this format in its reporting of printing and reproduction costs that are  coupled with non-printing costs.", "Although the department has followed this format, the House Armed  Services Committee has expressed concern about the military services\u2019  printing budgets, noting that they were excessive and that portions of the  budgets should be realigned to address unfunded readiness priorities.  Further, as we discussed earlier in this report, DOD has outlined specific  steps it intends to take to achieve a recommended goal of 34 percent  reduction in spending on its printing and related activities. Without quality  information on the scope of its document services mission, DOD will lack  the information it needs to assess whether it is achieving this goal. To  assess its progress toward achieving this goal, it will be critical for  decision makers to have accurate financial information. According to a  DOD Comptroller official, the Financial Management Regulation provides  flexibility in how obligations are categorized and reported internally and to  Congress, but DOD has not evaluated options to report more accurate  funding information on its document services. Unless DOD evaluates  options to report more accurate funding information and takes steps to  improve the accuracy of its budgetary and financial information reporting,  DOD and Congress will not have the full visibility over these costs that  they need to make informed decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD is taking important steps to address congressional concerns about  its spending on document service activities.
