According to DOD, water scarcity can impair  testing activities and increase prohibitions on testing and training when  combined with increased temperatures, and contributes to heat-related  illnesses. In its 2018 Fourth National Climate Assessment, the U.S.  Global Change Research Program reported that changes in precipitation  and warming temperatures will continue to cause worsening droughts and  the decline of surface water quality. According to the assessment, these  changes will reduce the availability of water in parts of the United States  and increase the risk of water scarcity.", "Because of the effects these and other changes in the climate could have  on federal programs, we have included Limiting the Federal  Government\u2019s Fiscal Exposure by Better Managing Climate Change  Risks on our High Risk List since 2013.

We  derived the five leading practices from the Department of Energy\u2019s and  the United States Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s compilation of 14  water efficiency best management practices, and principles published in  the University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln\u2019s National Drought Mitigation Center\u2019s  10-Step Drought Planning Process. These leading practices are: (1)  identify current water availability, (2) identify future water availability, (3)  take into account all sources of water, (4) precisely identify locations, and  (5) comprehensively include all locations. According to the 10-Step  Drought Planning Process, data and information derived from these  leading practices contribute to a reliable assessment of water availability.  To obtain information about water scarcity at individual installations, we  selected a nongeneralizable sample of active-duty installations in the  contiguous United States. To develop this sample, we included  installations that were identified by DOD assessments as having water- related vulnerabilities and by military department officials in interviews as  having ongoing pilot studies or issues related to water scarcity. We also  included installations that had historically experienced water scarcity,  those that had recently experienced water scarcity, and those that are  projected to experience water scarcity in the future. From these criteria,  we selected a nongeneralizable sample of 17 installations that were  identified in OSD\u2019s three assessments that reflected diversity in military  service, mission, and water scarcity. We visited five of the installations  in person and sent the remaining 12 installations a list of questions similar  to those used during our site visits. The installation officials provided  information such as how water is being used for mission related activities  and whether water scarcity had affected or was expected to affect the  installation\u2019s mission related activities. To determine the extent to which  DOD has assurance it is using accurate and reliable information about  installations at risk of water scarcity to manage water resources across  the department, we compared the information DOD has from the various  assessments with Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government on using quality information to achieve agency objectives.

For  example, droughts occurring from deficits in precipitation, soil moisture,  and snow runoff will likely occur more frequently. Further, since a warmer  atmosphere holds more water, when rain does fall high-intensity events  can occur more frequently. These sudden downpours will increase the  mobility of pollutants, such as sediments and nutrients, and of algae,  which can reduce the quality and quantity of available drinking water.

In contrast,  the military departments did apply all leading practices in their  assessments on installations at risk of water scarcity; however, OSD  officials were not in agreement as to whether these assessments could  be used at a departmental level. By assessing and documenting whether  OSD should conduct a coordinated, department-wide assessment aligned  with leading practices or should rely on the military department  assessments for identifying and analyzing water availability, OSD would  have greater assurance that it has the information that it needs to  manage water scarcity across the department and that Congress needs  to better understand the threat of water scarcity to DOD\u2019s mission."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Sustainment (1) assesses whether DOD should conduct a  coordinated, department-wide assessment aligned with leading practices  for identifying and analyzing water availability or rely on military  department assessments to determine which DOD installations are at risk  of water scarcity and (2) documents this decision.

We  derived the five leading practices from the Department of Energy\u2019s and  the United States Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s compilation of 14  water efficiency best management practices, and principles published in  the University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln\u2019s National Drought Mitigation Center\u2019s  10-Step Drought Planning Process. These leading practices are: (1)  identify current water availability, (2) identify future water availability, (3)  take into account all sources of water, (4) precisely identify locations, and  (5) comprehensively include all locations. According to the 10-Step  Drought Planning Process, data and information derived from these  leading practices contribute to a reliable assessment of water availability.  We discussed these five leading practices we identified with officials from  the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment and the  military departments and gained their agreement about using these  practices for determining installations at risk of water scarcity. We then  determined whether, in their respective methodologies, OSD\u2019s and the  military departments\u2019 assessments had followed each of these five  leading practices. Specifically, we considered the  \u201cidentify current water availability\u201d leading practice as \u201cfollowed\u201d if  OSD\u2019s and the military departments\u2019 assessment was annually  reporting water use or status of water supply, and the leading practice  as \u201cnot followed\u201d if the assessment was not annually reporting water  use or status of water supply;  \u201cidentify future water availability\u201d leading practice as \u201cfollowed\u201d if  OSD\u2019s and the military departments\u2019 assessment noted whether  climate change was a factor in their assessment or considered future  water availability from non-climate-change-related factors and the  leading practice as \u201cnot followed\u201d if the assessment did not note  whether climate-change was a factor in their assessment or consider  future water availability from non-climate-change-related factors;  \u201ctake into account all sources of water\u201d leading practice as \u201cfollowed\u201d  if OSD\u2019s and the military departments\u2019 assessment noted  consideration of alternate water sources (such as groundwater,  purchase agreements, additional reservoirs, etc.) and the leading  practice as \u201cnot followed\u201d if the assessment did not note consideration  of alternate water sources (such as groundwater, purchase  agreements, additional reservoirs, etc.);  \u201cprecisely identify locations\u201d leading practice as \u201cfollowed\u201d if OSD\u2019s  and the military departments\u2019 assessment noted the specific location  of the installation they were reviewing and provided data specifically  from that installation, and the leading practice as \u201cnot followed\u201d if the  assessment did not note the specific location of the installation they  were reviewing and provide data specifically from that installation; and  \u201ccomprehensively include all locations\u201d leading practice as \u201cfollowed\u201d  if OSD\u2019s and the military departments\u2019 assessment considered all the  locations at potential risk of water scarcity within the scope of their  assessment, and the leading practice as \u201cnot followed\u201d if the  assessment did not consider all the locations at potential risk of water  scarcity within the scope of their assessment. Specifically, for OSD\u2019s  Department of Defense Climate-Related Risk to DOD Infrastructure  Initial Vulnerability Assessment Survey (SLVAS) Report and its  Department of Defense Annual Energy Management and Resilience  Report (AEMRR) Fiscal Year 2017, the scope of the assessments  included all DOD installations; for OSD\u2019s Report on Effects of a  Changing Climate to the Department of Defense, the scope of the  assessment included 79 mission-assurance priority installations; and  for the military department assessments, the scope included all  respective installations within each military department.", "To obtain information about water scarcity at individual installations, we  selected a nongeneralizable sample of active-duty military installations in  the contiguous United States. To develop this sample, we included  installations that were identified by DOD assessments as having water- related vulnerabilities and by military department officials in interviews as  having ongoing pilot studies or issues related to water scarcity. We also  included installations that had (1) historically experienced water scarcity  (prior to 2014); (2) recently experienced water scarcity (from 2014 to  2019); and (3) are projected to experience severe water scarcity (over the  next 20 years or longer). From these criteria, we selected a  nongeneralizable sample of 17 installations that were identified in OSD\u2019s  three assessments that reflected diversity in military service, mission, and  water scarcity (see table 4).", "We visited five of these installations in person and contacted the  remaining 12 installations by email. We selected the five installations to  visit because three installations (Naval Air Facility El Centro, California;  Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona; and Luke Air Force Base,  Arizona) provided diversity among military services and were in close  proximity to each other, which allowed us to visit multiple locations in one  trip; one installation (Vandenberg Air Force Base, California) had been  identified in all three OSD assessments and the applicable military  department assessment as being at risk of water scarcity; and one  installation (Fort Bragg, North Carolina) provided geographic diversity and  inclusion of at least one installation per military service in our sample. For  the remaining 12 installations, we developed and sent by email a list of  similar questions and document requests that we used during our site  visits. We received responses from all 12 installations. Results from our  nongeneralizable sample cannot be used to make inferences about all  DOD installations. However, the information from these installations  provides valuable insights about how water is being used by these  installations for their mission-related activities and whether water scarcity  had affected or was expected to affect their mission-related activities. To  determine the extent to which DOD has assurance it is using accurate  and reliable information about installations at risk of water scarcity to  manage water resources across the department, we compared the  information DOD has from the various assessments with Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government on using quality information to  achieve agency objectives.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2018 to November  2019 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
