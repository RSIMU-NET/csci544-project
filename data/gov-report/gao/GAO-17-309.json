However, these initiatives face barriers, such as limited funding, a risk averse culture, and competing priorities. Literature on private sector innovation identifies key enablers for these types of efforts, such as developing an innovation strategy, aligning investments with innovation goals, and protecting funding for riskier projects. DOD has taken steps that are consistent with a few, but not all, of these enablers. For example, DOD does not have a department-wide strategy that communicates strategic goals and priorities and delineates roles and responsibilities to guide the prototyping initiatives. This could lead to unproductive or poorly coordinated investments later. DOD's initiatives also face competition for funding, particularly with acquisition programs. One strategy to address funding issues called \u201cstrategic buckets\u201d involves allocating resources to different types of projects based on an organization's strategy (see figure).

This report assesses (1) how DOD has used prototyping prior to system  development on major defense acquisition programs, and (2) what steps  DOD has taken to increase innovation through prototyping activities  conducted outside of major defense acquisition programs. A major  defense acquisition program (MDAP) is a program that is designated as  such or is estimated by DOD to require an eventual total expenditure for  research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) of more than $480  million, or for procurement of more than $2.79 billion, in fiscal year 2014  constant dollars, for all increments.", "To determine how DOD has used prototyping in MDAPs, we examined 22  MDAPs that entered system development between December 2009\u2014 which is when DOD implemented new prototyping requirements enacted  by Congress in the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009  (WSARA)\u2014and February 2016.

We reviewed documentation and interviewed officials or obtained written  responses from each of those seven initiatives to identify their goals,  focus areas, scope, approaches, funding characteristics, strategies,  coordination mechanisms, and barriers, if any, they face. To determine  DOD\u2019s overall strategy for these initiatives, we analyzed DOD  memorandums and other relevant documentation, including those related  to the management of its science and technology investments.

Afterwards, the acquisition community typically manages  product development, in which technologies are further advanced and  system development begins. These activities are generally supported by  DOD\u2019s RDT&E budget, which DOD groups into seven budget activity  categories for its budget estimates and the President\u2019s Budget. The  categories follow a mostly sequential path for developing technologies  from basic research to operational system development, as is shown in  figure 1. The first three budget activity categories represent DOD\u2019s  science and technology activities to advance research and technology  development, while the remaining budget activity categories are typically  associated with product development for acquisition programs. See  appendix II for a description of each budget activity.", "Funding for prototyping is mostly found in advanced technology  development and advanced component development, budget activity 6.3  and 6.4 respectively. Appendix III provides a breakdown of budget activity  6.3 and 6.4 funding by organization for fiscal year 2016. Funding in  budget activity 6.3 is not directly tied to acquisition programs whereas  budget activity 6.4 is typically used for that purpose. Funding for  acquisition programs, including budget activity 6.5, was $28 billion in  fiscal year 2016 and has varied over time, whereas science and  technology funding was $13 billion and has remained relatively flat, as is  shown in figure 2.", "There are numerous types and definitions of prototyping. One construct  used by parts of DOD refers to conceptual, developmental, and  operational prototypes, each of which has a different purpose and time  horizon for when they can be expected to be incorporated into or become  their own acquisition program. Figure 3 includes more information about  each of these types of prototypes. Although each type is more mature or  closer to a capability that can be fielded than its predecessor, prototyping  does not have to proceed sequentially. For example, an operational  prototype might not be preceded by a conceptual or developmental  prototype, if it is based on existing mature technologies or concepts.", "Prototyping can involve a variety of different approaches, in terms of what  is being developed and demonstrated, who is building the prototype, and  how it is being acquired or managed. System prototyping is when a  prototype that includes components for an entire system is developed,  such as a prototype of a ground vehicle or missile. Subsystem prototyping  is when a prototype is developed that includes a group of components  that combine to perform a major function for a system, such as a power  supply system for a radar. In a DOD context, prototypes can be  developed by contractors or groups of contractors, government labs, or  both, and efforts can be managed by the science and technology  community, acquisition programs, or other types of research and  development organizations. When two or more contractors or other  entities prototype the same component, subsystem, or system, the effort  is referred to as competitive prototyping.", "Over the years, DOD and Congress have taken steps to encourage  prototyping during the technology development phase of weapon system  acquisition programs. In 2007, the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisitions, Technology, and Logistics issued a  memorandum on prototyping and competition that expressed concern  that DOD decisions on acquisition programs were being based largely on  paper proposals that provided inadequate knowledge of technical risk and  a weak foundation for estimating development and procurement cost. To  help address these concerns, the memorandum required pending and  future acquisition programs to formulate acquisition strategies that call for  conducting competitive prototyping up through the start of system  development. Not long after, in 2009, Congress passed WSARA, which  included a provision on competitive prototyping for MDAPs as well as  many other reforms. WSARA called for competitive prototyping at the  system level or\u2014if not feasible\u2014for critical subsystems, and allowed  competitive prototyping to be waived only if the cost of producing  competitive prototypes would exceed the life-cycle benefits of producing  them or if without a waiver, DOD would be unable to meet critical national  security objectives. If competitive prototyping was waived, WSARA  required that programs produce a prototype before milestone B, if the  expected life-cycle benefits of producing such prototypes exceeded the  cost and its production was consistent with achieving critical national  security objectives. Originally implemented by DOD in December 2009,  Congress repealed WSARA\u2019s competitive prototyping provision in 2015.  However, as of the time of this review, DOD still required program officials  to consider using prototyping and competitive prototyping at the system or  subsystem level as a risk mitigation technique. Congress also included  several new prototyping-related provisions in the fiscal year 2017 NDAA,  which are discussed later in this report.", "DOD prototyping also occurs outside or independent of acquisition  programs. One of the purposes of this type of prototyping can be to  further disruptive innovation. Disruptive innovation attempts to shift the  balance of military power in our favor by providing new capabilities,  potentially unforeseen by the warfighter. The capabilities can be a result  of new technologies, new ways to integrate existing technologies, or  changes to how systems are employed. Disruptive innovation can also  include providing existing capabilities at substantially lower cost, thereby  increasing military advantage. Examples of potentially disruptive  technologies include directed energy, hypersonics, and low cost missile  defense capabilities. Prototyping can be a way to \u201ctest the waters\u201d or  experiment with new and potentially disruptive concepts and technologies  without the level of commitment associated with starting acquisition  programs. Prototyping in this environment may involve more risk,  including less mature technologies.

Prototyping approaches varied within  these categories. Some programs prototyped one or two subsystems  while others used multiple contractors and multiple-phased prototyping  efforts at the system and subsystem level. The five programs that did not  conduct any prototyping used known designs and existing technologies,  which DOD generally considers less risky. Four of the five entered the  acquisition process without a technology development phase and most  obtained waivers from the competitive prototyping requirements in DOD  policy.

System level prototyping led to  improved understanding of: (1) integration challenges and the feasibility  of system designs; (2) significant unknowns, such as costs for ambitious  requirements; (3) uncertainties related to integrating mature technologies  in new ways; and (4) new technologies. Six of these programs first  conducted subsystem prototyping to mature new or existing technologies  used in new ways before using system-level prototyping to investigate  integration challenges.", "The seven programs that developed subsystem prototypes ranged from  an F-22 modernization program that was upgrading the aircraft\u2019s weapon  and communication systems to the Ship to Shore Connector Amphibious  Craft, an air-cushioned landing craft that transports personnel, weapon  systems, and cargo. Subsystem level prototyping efforts focused on  narrower areas of perceived risk, such as maturing critical technologies,  integrating a subsystem with other hardware or software, or testing  specific components that are being considered for use in a system  design. The programs that conducted subsystem prototyping were often  building on or well-positioned to leverage existing weapon systems. Five  of the seven programs in this category used existing platforms, either  hardware or software, for their subsystem prototyping efforts. For  example, the Ship to Shore Connector Amphibious Craft utilized the  Navy\u2019s existing landing craft as a platform to prototype and test new  components.", "Of the 17 programs that prototyped, 12 used competitive prototyping.  They did so for a variety of reasons, including to prove out potential  solutions when more than one solution could be feasible and to gain  knowledge from multiple sources about uncertainties, such as integration  challenges, design feasibility, or cost. We found that most of the  competitive prototyping efforts included system-level designs and almost  all programs that conducted system-level prototyping used competitive  approaches, as is shown in figure 6. Competitive prototyping may  generate more information about proposed solutions because contractors  sometimes propose different design approaches or system concepts to  meet DOD\u2019s capability needs.

We have previously found that establishing a sound business  case is essential to achieving better program outcomes. See appendix  V for an analysis of acquisition outcomes to date for the programs we  examined. Prototyping provided programs with information on technology  maturity, the feasibility of the design concepts, potential costs, and the  achievability of planned performance requirements, which helped inject  realism into their business cases. Appendix VI includes examples of  these benefits, several of which we highlight below:", "Prototyping demonstrated key technologies or proposed design  solutions. For example, Space Fence officials stated that prototyping  helped them determine that a riskier, cutting edge design involving a  15 percent smaller radar was feasible. Without prototyping, the  program would not have had sufficient information to be confident in  the riskier option, nor would the contractor have proposed it without  the opportunity to demonstrate that it worked.", "Prototyping informed programs\u2019 understanding of prices and  helped validate business case cost estimates. During the  prototyping process, contractors select vendors, develop supplier  relationships, purchase materials, and build a version of the system or  parts of the system, all of which provide information on potential costs.  Air and Missile Defense Radar program officials stated that  prototyping increased the cost information available to the program  and led to cost reductions. They explained that competitive  prototyping incentivized the contractors to determine their cost drivers  in order to be more competitive in the next phase.", "Prototyping helped programs better understand requirements  and\u2014in most cases\u2014helped them make performance tradeoffs  to meet cost targets. In the case of Joint Light Tactical Vehicle,  prototyping helped program officials determine that two versions of  the vehicle were too heavy to be transported as planned. The  program then lowered its transportability requirements by eliminating  the need to airlift the vehicles in extreme conditions. This change  allowed the vehicles to be heavier and resulted in $35,000 in savings  per vehicle, according to the Army.", "Prototyping provided a variety of other benefits as well. For example,  prototyping helped programs improve system performance. Small  Diameter Bomb II officials said that data collected during its prototype  testing set the stage for improvements in its target classification software.  It also helped identify potential reliability issues early. The Next  Generation Jammer Increment 1 and Ship to Shore Connector  Amphibious Craft programs changed certain subsystem materials based  on information learned about wear during prototype testing. Further, for  11 programs, the prototypes served as test assets during system  development or were used to continue development efforts.", "Competitive prototyping approaches generated additional benefits, such  as enabling more favorable business terms. According to the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics,  the Air and Missile Defense Radar program\u2019s use of competition resulted  in over $100 million in savings and will reduce operation and support  costs over the life of the program. Air and Missile Defense program  officials explained that having three competitors was helpful because it  reduced the likelihood that contractors would team up in the next phase,  leaving the government with only one proposal. In other cases,  competition improved the quality of the systems being offered to DOD.  For example, Space Fence program officials told us that competition  spurred contractors to introduce cutting edge designs and continue  refining those designs in order to remain competitive in the next phase of  the program. Finally, officials from several programs stated that  contractors supplemented prototyping efforts using their own funds and  believed contractors did this in order to make their subsequent offers  more competitive.", "A common perception is that competitive prototyping might cost more up  front because multiple contracts are awarded, but our analysis showed  that programs using multiple contractors did not have higher relative costs  for technology development. Programs that used a competitive approach  planned to spend a similar percentage or less of their total expected  RDT&E funding prior to the start of system development as those  programs that did not competitively prototype. Using competitive  prototyping approaches did create additional administrative burdens in  the short term because program offices had to manage multiple  contractors and maintain firewalls to ensure fair competitions, but officials  from across the programs we examined stated it was worth the  investment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Practices Helped Programs Get More Out of Their Prototyping Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Officials from all 17 programs that prototyped told us their prototyping  efforts were useful; however, we found some programs got more out of  their prototyping efforts than others. Based on those programs\u2019  experiences and lessons other programs shared, we identified the  following five practices that helped programs maximize the utility of their  prototyping efforts.  1.  Identify risks early and target prototyping efforts to address  them. Officials from seven programs described early activities that  helped identify risks and shape their prototyping efforts. The Air and  Missile Defense Radar program planned a big leap in technology over  the existing radar, which was fielded over 30 years ago. The program  conducted early technology maturity assessments that identified the  large aperture digital beamforming and calibration critical technology  as the program\u2019s key risk area. The program focused its prototyping  efforts on maturing this and other critical technologies and  demonstrating them in a relevant environment. It is on track to  complete system development on time and within its estimated  research and development cost.  2.  Structure prototyping efforts to be completed in time to inform  key decisions\u2014particularly source selection. We found that many  of the programs prototyped before selecting their system development  contractor and about three-quarters of the programs also held  preliminary design review before entering system development.  Prototyping helped inform these decisions and related assessments.  Common Infrared Countermeasure program officials told us they  required contractors\u2019 proposals for the program\u2019s system development  contract to include solutions to address reliability failures identified  during prototyping.  3.  Specify the level of fidelity needed to provide the necessary  information about which risks to address. Officials from 15  programs told us they prototyped designs similar to the actual design  of the system they will develop. This is known as high fidelity  prototyping. Officials from a few programs noted that doing so  enabled them to understand what the system entailed and, if needed,  make trade-offs accordingly. In contrast, Integrated Air and Missile  Defense program officials stated that the results from prototyping  were not as helpful to make programmatic decisions because they  were limited to demonstrating the feasibility of a certain system  concept using a generic government design.  4.  Ensure the appropriate level of insight into the design and cost  information. Officials from each program said they had sufficient  visibility into the prototyping efforts, but some officials described  having more insight into the efforts and their results than others. The  level of insight can be affected by factors, such as the type of  information a program requires a contractor to provide under a  prototyping contract. Space Fence officials noted that in addition to  conducting a live prototype demonstration, they had access to reports  and data from contractors\u2019 efforts. The officials said that the data  obtained through prototyping were helpful for pricing. The program  used the data to mature its cost estimate and was able to use a firm  fixed price contract for system development. Space Fence finalized its  design just over a year after entering system development, has had  no cost growth to date, and anticipates that the contractor will deliver  the system earlier than initially planned.  5.  Keep plans flexible to adapt to information learned during the  effort. Officials from four programs told us they used multi-phased  prototyping approaches and a few described adding or removing  contractors. Officials from at least three programs told us they  changed strategies or modified their approach based on information  learned or in response to a tighter budget environment. For example,  after the Common Infrared Countermeasure program determined its  technologies were less mature than expected, it added two  prototyping phases to continue maturing the technologies, testing the  system with related systems, and demonstrating manufacturing  processes. The program entered system development with its  technologies nearing maturity and completed its system design in just  over a year. It has had about 6 percent cost growth as of October  2016 and is estimating completing system development on time."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Established New Initiatives to Increase Prototyping and Innovation, but Does Not Have a Strategy to Guide Its Investments", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure U.S. military capabilities outpace those of potential  adversaries, DOD has expanded prototyping efforts focused on  innovation, including disruptive innovation, and has started several new  initiatives outside of major acquisition programs to address gaps in its  innovation portfolio. However, these initiatives face barriers, such as  limited funding and competing priorities. Literature on private sector  innovation, including the use of prototyping, identifies key enablers for  these types of efforts, such as developing a strategy for innovation,  identifying relative levels of investments that align with innovation goals,  and protecting funding for technology investments that have higher risk,  but perhaps more reward across the enterprise.

Most of the efforts we  examined aim to mature technologies for future capabilities, but without  the rigidity, commitment, and additional cost associated with starting new  acquisition programs. Other than the experimentation initiatives, all of  them involve demonstrations that seek to improve DOD\u2019s or the military  services\u2019 understanding of the viability, maturity, and potential utility of the  technologies, subsystems, or systems being prototyped. The  demonstrations also inform decisions regarding potential next steps, such  as transition to a military service in the case of mature capabilities that  are ready to be put into use or to an acquisition program for those that  need further development. Table 2 provides an overview of these  initiatives.", "The new initiatives help address gaps in DOD\u2019s science and technology  and weapon system investments and expand efforts to identify and  mature potentially innovative and disruptive technologies. For example,  the Army Technology Maturation Initiative uses budget activity 6.4  funding, which is typically associated with acquisition programs, to  conduct higher-fidelity prototyping and further mature technology outside  of those programs. Other initiatives focus on modifying already fielded  equipment and technologies to use them in new ways, combining  prototyping and rapid acquisition practices to field capabilities faster, and  encouraging experimentation to explore how capabilities being prototyped  could be employed in an operational setting.", "The two most mature prototyping-related initiatives have made some  progress.

Literature on private sector innovation, including the use of prototyping,  suggests that private sector firms face some of these same barriers. Key  barriers we identified include:", "Funding structure: Several studies have suggested that maturing  technologies outside and independent of acquisition programs to  higher technology readiness levels can promote innovation and  facilitate technology transition. However, DOD\u2019s funding structure and  how it is commonly interpreted may limit the amount of higher fidelity  prototyping conducted outside of acquisition programs. DOD\u2019s  science and technology community manages and invests research  and development funding in budget activities 6.1-6.3, but does not  typically use budget activity 6.4 funds. According to DOD regulation,  projects funded with budget activity 6.3 are to mature technologies to  technology readiness levels 4, 5, or 6, while those funded with budget  activity 6.4 are to result in the achievement of technology readiness  level 6 or 7 (see app. VIII). Due in part to this budget activity structure,  the science and technology community typically sees its role as  maturing technologies to no higher than technology readiness level 6.  As a result, until DOD and the military services\u2019 recent prototyping  initiatives, there were not many offices focused on further maturing  technologies outside of acquisition programs.", "Risk averse culture: Although it is appropriate to minimize risks in  acquisition programs, some officials stated that excessive risk  aversion outside of acquisition programs can stifle innovation.  According to the Defense Science Board, over time, DOD has  become increasingly risk averse and experimentation has moved  towards scripted demonstrations, testing, and training. Pressure to  justify budgets, demonstrate utility to the warfighter, and advance  careers all contribute to this risk aversion. Many prototyping and  innovation initiatives we reviewed emphasized high transition rates of  between 80 and 100 percent. Generally speaking, transition means  that a technology has been sufficiently matured and is ready to  transition to a user such as a weapon acquisition program or the  warfighter in the field. On one hand, a high transition rate can be an  indicator that an initiative is generating a good return on investment  and is developing capabilities that meet customers\u2019 needs. But, for  prototyping initiatives with the stated purpose of encouraging  innovation, particularly disruptive innovation, making high transition  rates a goal could be counterproductive and lead to a lower tolerance  for risk or failure. For private sector projects focused on innovation,  companies can aim for transition rates as low as 20 to 50 percent.", "Competing priorities: Officials identified competition with projects the  military services have previously funded and prioritized as a barrier to  innovation efforts\u2014both when requesting funding to prototype and  later when trying to transition. Innovation literature suggests that  companies frequently face this same problem. Resources are often  not available for bolder projects because funds are consumed by pre- existing projects; furthermore, companies are more likely to devote  resources to sustaining innovation, which gradually improves on  existing products, rather than riskier disruptive innovation. The  Secretary of Defense testified to Congress in September 2016 that he  has seen the constant temptation over the years to starve new and  future-oriented defense investments in favor of more established and  therefore well-entrenched programs. He expressed concern that  funding was being taken away from initiatives such as the Strategic  Capabilities Office, to instead pay for existing acquisitions. In fiscal  year 2016, 6.4-funded initiatives that focus on prototyping and  innovation represented less than 4 percent of budget activity 6.4  funds.", "Long budget timelines: Long budget timelines make it difficult to start  prototyping projects that address emerging threats in a timely  manner. For example, as is illustrated in figure 8, a project  conceived in February 2017 might not be authorized and appropriated  funding until October 2018. Projects that are expected to take 3 to 5  years to complete in effect require 5 to7 years from conception to  completion. If there is a continuing resolution, it could take longer.  These long timelines make it difficult to achieve the adaptability and  faster capability development and fielding times that DOD seeks to  keep pace with rapidly evolving threats. DOD can take special steps  to provide funding in other ways, such as through reprogramming; but,  in general, long budget timelines not only make it difficult to succeed  fast, they also make it difficult for initiatives to \u201cfail fast\u201d and for DOD  to move on to potentially more promising projects.", "Synchronization with acquisition programs: Prototyping efforts may  not be complete at the most opportune time for acquisition programs,  as is reflected in figure 9. If the effort is completed too early,  technology can rapidly become obsolete before a relevant acquisition  program is begun. If a prototyping effort is completed after an  acquisition program has begun, the program may not be willing to  adopt it. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency officials noted  that partners must budget 2 years in advance to further mature or  transition technologies, which exacerbates this problem. Congress  included a provision in the Fiscal Year 2017 NDAA that, depending on  how it is implemented by DOD, could help make it easier to transition  new technologies and components to programs that have already  begun system development.

Congress  included a provision in the Fiscal Year 2017 NDAA that provides some  strategic direction for certain prototyping projects. It calls for the military  services to establish or identify oversight boards that will develop triennial  strategic plans to prioritize capability and weapon system component  portfolio areas for prototyping projects, among other things. However, it is  not yet clear whether there will be a mechanism to tie these efforts into a  department-wide strategy.", "DOD\u2019s lack of an innovation strategy means it has to rely on other  mechanisms to coordinate and provide strategic direction for its  prototyping initiatives, although those mechanisms do not cover some of  DOD\u2019s prototyping and innovation activities and do not establish  department-wide priorities. For example, Communities of Interest (COI),  which are organized by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research  and Engineering (ASD(R&E)), help plan, coordinate, and share  knowledge on science and technology activities for budget activities 6.2  and 6.3, but there are no analogous mechanisms for 6.4-funded activities,  including those related to prototyping and innovation.

ASD(R&E) officials  explained that the road mapping process is not directly tied to budget  decisions and does not establish department-wide science and  technology priorities. However, it does help identify investment gaps,  opportunities for collaboration, and areas of potential overlap or  overinvestment. DOD\u2019s Long Range Research and Development  Planning Program suggested using COIs to prioritize the technology  investments it identified, which would expand their focus beyond science  and technology. We have previously found that one way to better manage  potentially fragmented activities is to improve collaboration and  coordination.

One approach identified in  the academic literature that helps ensure innovative projects receive  sufficient funding, in the face of competing priorities and a risk averse  culture, is called a \u201cstrategic buckets\u201d approach. Under this approach,  management makes a strategic decision to allocate set \u201cbuckets\u201d of  resources for different types of projects, including breakthroughs, and  then takes steps to ensure adequate funding for innovation efforts. The  distribution of resources among different buckets is dictated by the  organization\u2019s strategy.

Decisions to change relative levels of investment in  different buckets may be made over time in response to changing world  events. For example, DOD\u2019s concern about losing its eroding warfighting  edge in certain areas could cause it to place a higher priority on  prototyping systems that could lead to disruptive innovations.", "The Navy\u2019s approach to managing its science and technology  investments, including its prototyping and innovation initiatives, has  elements of a \u201cstrategic buckets\u201d approach. It maps out roughly the  percentage of funding that it plans to request for different parts of its  science and technology portfolio, including some of its prototyping and  innovation initiatives, as is reflected in figure 11 below. The Navy uses  this information to help develop its science and technology budgets. The  Navy has not extended the concept to other research and development  budget activities, such as 6.4, which are largely driven by decisions on  individual acquisition programs.", "DOD has also employed aspects of this approach to set and enforce  minimum funding levels for its science and technology investments, but it  lacks certain prerequisites needed to apply it more broadly to prototyping.  ASD(R&E) officials explained that, in recent years, the Office of the  Secretary of Defense has communicated an investment floor for budget  activities 6.1 through 6.3 in the Defense Planning Guidance, which  provides strategic direction for DOD budget formulation. ASD(R&E)  enforces these levels by reviewing military service budget requests and  directing funding increases or other shifts to ensure the floor is met  across the department. Although ASD(R&E) has responsibility for  overseeing research and development activities under budget activities  6.1 through 6.4, ASD(R&E) officials stated that they do not review budget  requests for budget activity 6.4 because they are primarily allocated to  acquisition programs. By not exercising its authority over the full range of  budget activity 6.1 through 6.4 funding, ASD(R&E) is missing an  opportunity to assess prototyping activities collectively from an enterprise  level to determine if and how this funding might best be used to support  DOD\u2019s prototyping and innovation initiatives and its strategic goals.", "DOD also lacks the innovation strategy and baseline understanding of its  prototyping projects and their associated funding, to identify areas of  potential over- and under-investment as well as appropriate investment  targets.

This was the case for both older and  newer initiatives. Demand pull initiatives focus on prototyping  technologies or systems to address validated requirements, which means  they have built in constituencies ready to support them.

Table 9 below includes individual program  outcomes to date.", "Our analysis of cost and schedule performance to date showed that for  the programs we reviewed, most prototyping and non-prototyping  programs\u2019 outcomes were similar (see figures 14 and 15). Nine of 11  prototyping programs had similar levels of research, development, test  and evaluation cost growth as the five non-prototyping programs. Officials  from the two prototyping programs with higher levels of cost growth\u2014 Global Positioning System Next Generation Operational Control System  (GPS OCX) and Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD)\u2014told us that  they could have learned more about their prototyping efforts if they  produced higher fidelity prototypes or better addressed key risk areas. Six  of nine prototyping programs with comparable data experienced similar  schedule growth between the start and completion of system  development as the five non-prototyping programs. The IAMD and GPS  OCX programs were also among the prototyping programs with the  largest schedule growth.", "We also found similar outcomes between prototyping and non-prototyping  programs with respect to the technology and design knowledge they had  at key points in the acquisition process (see tables 10 and 11). Most  programs that prototyped during technology development matured or  nearly matured their critical technologies before entering system  development and released 90 percent of the system\u2019s drawings at critical  design review (see appendix VIII for definitions of technology readiness  levels).

Table 13 below includes newer  prototyping and innovation initiatives and select older initiatives. We  focused on the newer initiatives in the body of the report. Although  broadly speaking, these initiatives are all seeking to achieve the same  goal of innovating to maintain military superiority, we found that they differ  in the types of innovation they are trying to achieve, the scope of their  efforts, and their approaches.", "The initiatives we examined varied in the primary types of innovation they  sought to achieve (see table 14). Initiatives that primarily focus on  incremental or sustaining innovation gradually improve existing products  and capabilities. Initiatives focused on disruptive innovation attempt to  shift the balance of military power by providing new capabilities,  potentially unforeseen by customers or adversaries. The type of  innovation sought should not necessarily be equated with risk. For  example, the Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) considers itself to be  focusing on low technical risk solutions that are intended to have  potentially disruptive results. We excluded experimentation initiatives from  this analysis.", "Most of the prototyping and experimentation initiatives we examined,  including all but one of the newer initiatives, were focused on addressing  military service specific needs (see table 15). Three initiatives address  capabilities that could potentially benefit multiple services or that are seen  as \u201cfalling through the cracks\u201d of military service efforts. Those initiatives  are among the most well-funded, with the SCO requesting $902 million  for budget activities 6.3 and 6.4 and Defense Advanced Research  Projects Agency (DARPA) requesting $1.2 billion for budget activity 6.3  for fiscal year 2017. We excluded experimentation initiatives from this  analysis.", "Most of the initiatives we examined focused on prototyping technologies  or systems that address validated customer or warfighter requirements\u2014 meaning they have more of a \u201cdemand pull\u201d approach to selecting  projects (see table 16). In contrast, \u201csupply push\u201d initiatives take on  projects without a stated customer need and may not align with existing  organizational structures or warfighting concepts. DARPA has historically  focused almost exclusively on \u201csupply push\u201d type projects, as does the  Navy\u2019s Innovative Naval Prototypes initiative.

Budget activity 6.4 funds are viewed as allowing for higher-fidelity  prototyping efforts, which are closer to the intended end item. Some  previous studies have suggested that maturing technologies outside  of acquisition programs to higher readiness levels using budget  activity 6.4 can promote innovation and facilitate technology transition.  Older initiatives primarily rely on budget activity 6.3 funds.", "The Army Rapid Capabilities Office and Navy Rapid Prototyping  Experimentation and Demonstration plan to conduct rapid prototyping  and then oversee a modified acquisition process for the most  promising prototypes. These offices may take responsibility for the  rapid prototyping pathway called for in the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. Older initiatives typically  transition technologies to a different organization or acquisition  program.", "Many of the new prototyping initiatives report to senior department  leaders, which can help maintain support for investments and  streamline decision-making, according to the literature on innovation  in the private sector. The SCO director reports to the Deputy  Secretary of Defense, which provides him flexibility to work throughout  the department.", "Furthermore, several new initiatives have unique characteristics or  functions that the department is trying to invigorate.", "The SCO focuses on retooling fielded equipment and technologies to  employ them in new ways. This reflects a new tactic in DOD\u2019s  innovation efforts because no other initiative has focused on this  approach. The office limits its efforts to specific platform-centric  solutions with the intention of delivering capabilities quickly. According  to SCO\u2019s director, one advantage of this approach is that it can help  \u201cbuy time\u201d for other initiatives to develop and field the next generation  of systems. SCO covers all development costs initially to prove out  the idea and develop a prototype, then turns projects over to the  services for consideration in their budget deliberation processes. DOD  has increased SCO funding since fiscal year 2014 from $140 million  to a planned $902 million in fiscal year 2017.

These offices use virtual or conceptual environments to  explore early ideas for implementing new technologies. They can also  help identify promising concepts, or allow officials to discuss how to  adjust tactics, doctrine, and training prior to development of new  technologies. For example, the Air Force\u2019s Experimentation Initiative  is using experimentation to explore how directed energy could be  used in an operational context and plans to use this information to  inform decisions about pursuing directed energy systems. The Air  Force is also considering conducting hardware prototyping under this  initiative to demonstrate the operational value of proposed concepts.
