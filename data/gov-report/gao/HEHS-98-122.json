OSHA, an agency in the Department of Labor, administers the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. OSHA\u2019s responsibilities include establishing mandatory safety and health standards, rules, and regulations; enforcing employers\u2019 compliance with the act and its standards, rules, and regulations; and reaching out to employers and employees through technical assistance and consultation programs.", "A major part of OSHA\u2019s enforcement program is conducting on-site inspections of employers\u2019 facilities. OSHA targets establishments for inspection using a priority system. First priority is given to unprogrammed, or unscheduled, inspections initiated because of (1) imminent danger situations, (2) fatalities or catastrophes, (3) formal complaints, and (4) referrals. Second priority is given to programmed, or scheduled, inspections of establishments OSHA considers more likely than others to be hazardous.", "To schedule inspections of establishments considered more likely to be hazardous, as well as target other intervention activities, OSHA relies on industrywide occupational injury and illness data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) rather than specific data for individual establishments, for which no nationwide data are available. BLS, another Labor Department agency, is the federal government\u2019s principal agency in the field of labor economics and statistics. It collects, processes, and analyzes statistical data and publishes reports that are used by other federal agencies, the Congress, state and local governments, businesses, unions, and the public.", "BLS conducts an annual survey of occupational injuries and illnesses. For this survey, each year BLS selects a scientific probability sample of all U.S. establishments, regardless of size, in all private industries. Employers selected to participate in the survey are required to report to BLS, among other information, data on occupational injuries and illnesses that occurred at the selected establishments in the previous year and information on the average number of employees and the average number of hours worked during the year at the establishment. On the basis of the survey, BLS tabulates and publishes aggregate statistical data at the national and state levels on occupational injuries and illnesses for all U.S. industries and for each industry sector under the standard industrial classification (SIC) of industries.", "To ensure full participation in its survey, BLS pledges confidentiality of the information provided by respondents. Because of this pledge, BLS provides neither to OSHA nor to any other user the injury and illness and employment data (or any other data) it collects from specific establishments.", "The primary data used by OSHA for targeting establishments for inspection are industrywide injury and illness incidence rates and lost workday injury and illness (LWDII) rates provided by BLS. For its programmed inspections, OSHA uses the LWDII and incidence rates to identify industries with the highest rates. OSHA cannot distinguish, however, between those establishments with injury and illness rates above the industry average and those with rates below the average because an industry\u2019s rates reflect the industrywide average rates of all establishments in the industry. As a result, OSHA schedules inspections of establishments with more than 10 employees randomly selected from among the top 200 industries regardless of the establishment\u2019s record of injuries and illnesses or any previous safety and health violations. In this way, OSHA treats all establishments in a targeted industry alike. Thus, OSHA cannot target for inspection specific establishments most likely to be hazardous; it may target others\u2014less likely to be hazardous\u2014instead.", "We and others have said that OSHA\u2019s enforcement and outreach activities, using industrywide data rather than establishment-specific data, are ineffective in targeting the most hazardous establishments for inspection and result in an inefficient use of OSHA\u2019s resources. Others have recommended, as we did in 1994, that OSHA develop procedures to obtain establishment-specific injury and illness data from employers to better target its programmed inspections and education and training efforts and to use limited resources more efficiently.", "Since 1996, OSHA has been collecting establishment-specific data so that it could identify establishments with the highest injury and illness rates and better target its inspections and other interventions to these establishments. Some employers and business associations, however, have concerns about how OSHA planned and implemented its data collection initiative. Because of these concerns, you asked us to answer the following questions: 1. What industries and establishments did OSHA include in its 1996, 1997, and 1998 data collection efforts and how did it select them? What changes, if any, does OSHA plan to make for subsequent data collection efforts? 2. What data did OSHA collect from establishments in the selected industries? 3. How did OSHA intend to use the data it collected, and how has it actually used the data? 4. What specific assurance, if any, did OSHA give about confidentiality and privacy rights associated with the data collected? What is OSHA\u2019s current policy on access to the data it collected from these establishments?", "To do our work, we reviewed provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and documents on OSHA\u2019s data collection initiative. We conducted interviews with OSHA, BLS, and other Labor officials and business and worker representatives about this initiative. We determined whether OSHA pledged confidentiality of the employer occupational injury and illness data that it collected. In addition, we reviewed the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and discussed with Labor Department officials how Labor, including OSHA, responds to FOIA requests for these data. We conducted our study from September 1997 to April 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 covers more than 100 million working men and women and about 6.5 million employers.Excluded from coverage are the self-employed; state and local government employees in some states; and some transportation workers, miners, and others covered by other federal laws.", "OSHA regulations require most employers covered by the act to keep records at each establishment, including a log and summary of occupational injuries and illnesses (OSHA form 200 or an equivalent form) and a supplementary record of occupational injuries and illnesses (OSHA form 101 or an equivalent form). On the log, employers must briefly describe all occupational injuries and illnesses that occur at the establishment and summarize that information yearly. Employers must make the log accessible to authorized federal and state officials and to employees upon request and post an annual summary of occupational injuries and illnesses for the previous calendar year at each establishment. The supplementary record is to provide information about each injury and illness on the log, such as the affected employee\u2019s name and the circumstances of the injury or illness. Authorized government officials must have access to these records also.", "The records employers must keep provide useful information for (1) employers and employees, raising their awareness of injuries and illnesses and helping them in their efforts to address establishment hazards; (2) OSHA staff for carrying out enforcement and outreach programs; and (3) statistical purposes, by measuring the magnitude of injury and illness problems nationwide. The information also helps OSHA develop safety and health standards and conduct research on the causes and prevention of such injuries and illnesses. In addition, BLS collects injury and illness data from employers for its annual survey of occupational injuries and illnesses. OSHA\u2019s compliance officers review and collect data from the records during on-site inspections.", "In February 1996, as part of its initiative to enhance safety, reduce paperwork, and reinvent the agency, OSHA proposed comprehensively revising the current rule for record-keeping requirements. The overall rule addressed certifying the records\u2019 accuracy and completeness, requiring employers to provide increased access to the records, defining key terms, and updating records to reflect changes in previously recorded data.", "The proposed rule would also create a system for OSHA to collect injury and illness data at the establishment level. Under the proposed data collection system, OSHA would (1) identify industries among the most hazardous based on their injury and illness rates as reported by the BLS annual survey of occupational injuries and illnesses and (2) survey establishments in these industries to collect establishment-specific injury and illness data. Establishment-specific data would help identify individual establishments with high rates of occupational injuries and illnesses.", "OSHA said it would focus its enforcement and outreach efforts on establishments with the highest injury and illness rates. Its inspection priority system would remain unchanged\u2014highest priority would still be given to unscheduled inspections\u2014but its process for scheduling programmed inspections would be based on these establishment-specific data. In addition, OSHA said the data collection system would enhance the agency\u2019s ability to measure its performance in achieving established goals for reducing injuries, illnesses, and fatalities.", "Although the proposed overall rule to revise the record-keeping and reporting requirements had not been completed, in February 1996, OSHA initiated its survey of employers to collect injury and illness data for calendar year 1995. In March 1996, the American Trucking Associations and others filed a lawsuit challenging OSHA\u2019s authority to compel employers to participate in this survey in the absence of a final rule. A federal district court ruled that OSHA did not have the authority to issue citations to employers who did not complete and return the survey. In February 1997, OSHA issued a final rule implementing its authority to survey employers and cite them for failing to respond. Also in February 1997, OSHA and the parties involved in the lawsuit agreed that OSHA would not use the survey data collected in 1996 for enforcement purposes, but it could use the data for other purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OSHA Considered Industrywide Injury and Illness Data and Establishment Size in Designing Its Data Collection Surveys", "paragraphs": ["OSHA used a two-stage process for selecting industries and establishments to include in its data collection surveys.

Second, within the industries selected, OSHA chose individual establishments to survey on the basis of establishment size. OSHA\u2019s objective was to survey all establishments of a specific size in the industries with the highest injury and illness rates. OSHA said a major determinant of the number of establishments it could survey in a year, however, was the amount of funds available for conducting the survey. With about $2.6 million available annually to fund the surveys in 1996, 1997, and 1998, OSHA determined it could survey up to 80,000 establishments each year."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Selection of Industries", "paragraphs": ["To select the industries among the most hazardous, OSHA used data obtained from BLS\u2019 annual surveys together with other factors such as work-related fatalities and the number of establishments most likely to be included in the survey in each industry.

OSHA officials said it included all manufacturing industries because (1) manufacturing industries are required to maintain OSHA injury and illness records, (2) OSHA compliance standards to a large extent focus on manufacturing industries, (3) some manufacturing industries have injury and illness rates that are among the highest in all the SIC codes, and (4) the large number of manufacturing SIC codes (and the large number of establishments in each manufacturing group) made it impractical to separate high-hazard manufacturing industries from low-hazard manufacturing industries for the surveys.", "According to OSHA, the main factor it used to identify nonmanufacturing industries most likely to be hazardous was the industry three-digit SIC code LWDII rate as reported by BLS. OSHA also considered work-related fatalities when selecting industries to survey. Other factors OSHA considered in its selection process for those years included whether the injuries reported by establishments occurred at a fixed facility or at an off-site location and the number of establishments in each industry that would most likely be included in the surveys."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "1996 and 1997 Surveys", "paragraphs": ["For the 1996 and 1997 surveys, OSHA chose all manufacturing industries, six industry groups (three-digit SIC codes), and eight specific industries (four-digit SIC codes) in nonmanufacturing SIC codes.

Four of the specific industries and one industry group that OSHA selected, according to the agency, also had high numbers of fatalities during the previous 10 years. (See fig. 1.)", "As shown in figure 1, all 14 nonmanufacturing industry groups and specific industries OSHA selected in 1996 and 1997 had LWDII rates and injury and illness incidence rates that exceeded the national averages for all industries.

OSHA also asked employers to provide certain employment information for the establishments.", "Although OSHA and BLS collect the same injury and illness and employment data from establishments that participate in their respective programs, BLS collects the data from a small sample (less than 3 percent) of all private- sector industry establishments and uses the information to generate aggregate statistics on occupational injuries and illnesses at the state and national levels. Because BLS pledges confidentiality of the data to employers, it does not share these data with OSHA. OSHA, on the other hand, needs establishment-specific data to identify individual establishments\u2019 LWDII rates and injury and illness incidence rates to more effectively and efficiently carry out its regulatory and enforcement activities. Because it cannot obtain these data from BLS and they are otherwise unavailable, OSHA collects injury and illness data from all establishments of a certain size within selected industries.", "The OSHA data collection survey form is identical to a portion of the BLS annual survey of occupational injuries and illnesses form. The wording of the instructions, examples, and questions on the OSHA survey form is identical to that on the BLS survey form. In addition to the injury and illness and employment data, both data collection forms ask for the name, telephone number, date, and signature of the person to contact if any questions arise about the information provided.

In addition, because some establishments from which OSHA collects data may be included in the BLS sample in a given year, OSHA has coordinated its data collection effort with BLS\u2019.

The intended uses were (1) directing OSHA\u2019s program activities, including the scheduling of establishment inspections under its enforcement program and the targeting of mailings of safety and health information to employers under its nonenforcement programs; (2) monitoring and tracking injury and illness incidents; (3) developing information for promulgating, revising, and evaluating OSHA\u2019s safety and health standards; (4) evaluating the effectiveness of OSHA\u2019s enforcement, training, and voluntary programs; and (5) providing pertinent information to the public. In addition, OSHA stated that the establishment-specific data were necessary for it to meet GPRA requirements, which direct federal agencies to implement a program of strategic planning, develop systematic measures of performance to assess the impact of individual government programs, and produce annual performance reports.", "Although OSHA collected establishment-specific injury and illness data during 1996 and 1997, as of April 1998, it had made only limited use of the data. None of the intended purposes has been fully implemented, and the data have not been used for other purposes. About 70,000 establishments responded to both the 1996 and 1997 surveys\u2014about 88 percent of the establishments surveyed.", "According to OSHA officials, firm plans for using the data involve enforcement activities and meeting performance goals it established under GPRA. The data will be used as part of Labor\u2019s performance measurement system to track the impact of OSHA\u2019s enforcement and compliance assistance interventions. For example, to measure the extent to which OSHA achieves its goal of reducing injuries and illnesses by 15 percent in high-hazard industries, such as food processing and logging, the agency will track survey data from employers in these industries.", "According to OSHA\u2019s directive (CPL 2-0.119), the agency also plans to use survey data to schedule enforcement activities for establishments with the highest LWDII rates. OSHA will use the data to identify the 500 establishments with the highest rates and schedule them for on-site inspections. In addition, OSHA wants to use the establishment-specific injury and illness data to identify employers for participation in its new Cooperative Compliance Program (CCP). Under this program, OSHA would invite employers who report high LWDII rates on the survey to work cooperatively with OSHA to eliminate the hazardous working conditions. These employers would be put on a list of those most likely to be inspected; however, if these employers agree to participate, they must agree to establish an effective safety and health program. They must also agree to (1) find and remove hazards, (2) work toward reducing injuries and illnesses, (3) fully involve employees in their safety and health program, (4) share injury and illness data, and (5) provide OSHA with information from their annual injury and illness records. Under CCP, employers with 100 or fewer employees who choose to participate and agree to seek free assistance from their state OSHA consultation program to establish effective safety and health programs reduce their likelihood of being inspected by OSHA to 10 percent. CCP participants with more than 100 employees and smaller employers not using consultation services face a 30-percent chance of being inspected. If identified employers do not agree to participate in the program, they will remain on OSHA\u2019s list for on-site inspection.", "According to OSHA officials, inspections of CCP participants will most likely be shorter than regular inspections and result in lower penalties than normal because of these employers\u2019 commitment to finding and eliminating hazardous working conditions in their establishments. OSHA believes that those who successfully fulfill the requirements of the program should reduce injuries, illnesses, and fatalities, leading to lower workers\u2019 compensation costs and reduced insurance costs. In addition, workers whose employers join the program will be more involved in establishment safety and health issues and should experience fewer injuries and illnesses and have an improved quality of work life. OSHA will also benefit by extending its resources and expanding the base of employers with safety and health programs, which OSHA believes is a major difference between employers with low injury rates and those with high rates.", "OSHA used the information it collected in 1997 to develop a list of about 12,500 establishments with the highest LWDII rates\u2014that is, LWDII rates of 7.0 or higher. OSHA scheduled the 500 establishments with the highest LWDII rates for inspection and began these inspections in December 1997. In November 1997, OSHA invited about 12,000 of these establishments\u2014less than 20 percent of those that responded\u2014to participate in the CCP. According to OSHA officials, more than 89 percent of the employers invited by OSHA agreed to participate in the program. In response to a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and others claiming that OSHA had not followed proper procedures in implementing the CCP, however, a federal court of appeals ordered OSHA in February 1998 to halt the enforcement program that includes CCP until the court decides whether the program is valid. According to OSHA officials, oral argument is scheduled for December 1998, and a decision is unlikely to be issued until some time in 1999. The order also required OSHA to stop conducting its inspections of the 500 establishments with the highest LWDII rates; 89 of these inspections had been completed when OSHA was told to stop conducting them. OSHA officials stated that this delay in implementing the CCP will adversely affect many of its enforcement and nonenforcement activities.", "In April 1998, OSHA began implementing an interim inspection scheduling plan. Under the plan, OSHA will schedule for inspection establishments in 99 industries with LWDII rates of 6.4 or higher, according to calendar year 1996 BLS data. Establishments in these industries for which OSHA collected data in 1997 with LWDII rates at or above the national average of the industry of which they are a part will be randomly selected for inspection. The interim inspection plan has no CCP component.", "In our 1994 report, we noted that one problem with relying on employer- provided data is the risk that employers may underreport injuries and illnesses if they know OSHA is collecting data about their establishments that could be used to target them for on-site compliance inspections. To reduce the risk of employers underreporting injury and illness data, OSHA needs to have a successful combination of enforcement and education. Therefore, we recommended in that report that OSHA implement procedures for ensuring that employers accurately record occupational injuries and illnesses. Because of its concerns about the quality of the data provided by employers responding to its surveys, OSHA is conducting on-site audits of employers\u2019 injury and illness records to assess these records\u2019 accuracy.
