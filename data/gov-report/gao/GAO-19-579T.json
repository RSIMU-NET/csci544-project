This statement is based on GAO's May 2016 report regarding the FBI's use of face recognition technology (GAO-16-267) and includes agency updates to GAO's recommendations. To conduct its prior work, GAO reviewed federal privacy laws, and DOJ and FBI policies and operating manuals. GAO interviewed officials from the FBI and the departments of Defense and State, which coordinate with the FBI on face recognition. GAO also interviewed two state agencies that partner with the FBI to use multiple face recognition capabilities. For updates, GAO reviewed FBI data, as well as materials provided by DOJ and the FBI on the status of GAO's recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In May 2016, GAO found that the the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) could improve transparency and oversight to better safeguard privacy and had limited information on accuracy of its face recognition technology. GAO made six recommendations to address these issues. As of May 2019, DOJ and the FBI had taken some actions to address three recommendations\u2014one of which the FBI has fully implemented\u2014but has not taken any actions on the other three.", "Privacy . In its May 2016 report, GAO found that DOJ did not complete or publish key privacy documents for FBI's face recognition systems in a timely manner and made two recommendations to DOJ regarding its processes for developing these documents. These included privacy impact assessments (PIA), which analyze how personal information is collected, stored, shared, and managed in federal systems, and system of records notices, which inform the public about, among other things, the existence of the systems and the types of data collected. DOJ has taken actions to expedite the development process of the PIA. However, DOJ has yet to take action with respect to the development process for SORNs. GAO continues to believe both recommendations are valid and, if implemented, would help keep the public informed about how personal information is being collected, used and protected by DOJ components. GAO also recommended the FBI conduct audits to determine if users of FBI's face recognition systems are conducting face image searches in accordance with DOJ policy requirements, which the FBI has done.", "Accuracy . GAO also made three recommendations to help the FBI better ensure the accuracy of its face recognition capabilities. First, GAO found that the FBI conducted limited assessments of the accuracy of face recognition searches prior to accepting and deploying its face recognition system. The face recognition system automatically generates a list of photos containing the requested number of best matched photos. The FBI assessed accuracy when users requested a list of 50 possible matches, but did not test other list sizes. GAO recommended accuracy testing on different list sizes. Second, GAO found that FBI had not assessed the accuracy of face recognition systems operated by external partners, such as state or federal agencies, and recommended it take steps to determine whether external partner systems are sufficiently accurate for FBI's use. The FBI has not taken action to address these recommendations. GAO continues to believe that by verifying the accuracy of both systems\u2014its system, and the systems of external partners\u2014the FBI could help ensure that the systems provide leads that enhance criminal investigations. Third, GAO found that the FBI did not conduct an annual review to determine if the accuracy of face recognition searches was meeting user needs, and recommended it do so. In 2016 and 2017 the FBI submitted a paper to solicit feedback from system users. However, this did not result in formal responses from users and did not constitute a review of the system. GAO continues to believe that conducting such a review would help provide important information about potential factors affecting accuracy of the system."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In its May 2016 report, GAO made three recommendations related to privacy, one of which has been implemented.

Face recognition can also help  law enforcement agencies identify criminals in federal, state, and local  investigations, according to the FBI. For example, the FBI used face  recognition in August 2017 to assist in the identification and arrest of an  FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitive.

However, beginning in 2010, the FBI began  incrementally replacing the Integrated Automated Fingerprint  Identification System (IAFIS) with Next Generation Identification (NGI).  NGI was not only to include fingerprint data from IAFIS and biographic  data, but also to provide new functionality and improve existing  capabilities by incorporating advancements in biometrics, such as face  recognition technology. As part of the fourth of six NGI increments, the  FBI updated the Interstate Photo System (IPS) to provide a face  recognition service that allows law enforcement agencies to search a  database of criminal photos that accompanied fingerprint submissions  using a photo of an unknown person\u2014called a probe photo.  The FBI  began a pilot of NGI-IPS in December 2011, and NGI-IPS became fully  operational in April 2015.", "NGI-IPS users include the FBI and selected state and local law  enforcement agencies, which can submit search requests to help identify  an unknown person using, for example, a photo from a surveillance  camera. When a state or local agency submits such a photo, NGI-IPS  uses an automated process to return a list of candidate photos from the  database.  The number of photos returned ranges from 2 to 50 possible  candidate photos from the database, depending on the user\u2019s  specification. According to the FBI, in fiscal year 2018, NGI-IPS returned  about 50,000 face recognition search results to law enforcement agency  users, a decrease from about 90,000 search results in fiscal year 2017.  Figure 1 describes the process for a search requested by state or local  law enforcement.", "In addition to the NGI-IPS, the FBI has an internal unit called Facial  Analysis, Comparison and Evaluation (FACE) Services that provides face  recognition capabilities, among other things, to support active FBI  investigations. FACE Services has access to NGI-IPS, and can also  search or request to search databases owned by the departments of  State and Defense and 21 states, which use their own face recognition  systems. Figure 2 shows which states partnered with the FBI for FACE  Services requests, as of May 2019, according to the FBI.", "Unlike NGI-IPS, which primarily contains photos obtained from criminal  justice sources, these external systems primarily contain photos from  state and federal government databases, such as driver\u2019s license photos  and visa applicant photos. According to the FBI, the total number of face  photos available in all searchable repositories for FACE Services is over  641 million. Biometric images specialists for FACE Services manually  review any photos received from their external partners before returning a  photo as an investigative lead to the requesting FBI agents. No more than  two photos are returned as a lead after the specialist for FACE Services  completes the review. However, according to FACE Services officials we  met with during our May 2016 review, if biometric images specialists  determine that none of the databases returned a likely match, they do not  return any photos to the agents. According to the FBI, from August 2011  (when searches began) through April 2019, FACE Services received  153,636 photos of unknown persons (often called probe photos) from FBI  headquarters, field offices, and overseas offices, which resulted in  390,186 searches of various databases in attempt to find photo matches  of known individuals in these databases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Privacy Laws and Responsibilities at DOJ", "paragraphs": ["Federal agency collection and use of personal information, including face  images, is governed primarily by two laws: the Privacy Act of 1974 and  the privacy provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002.", "The Privacy Act places limitations on agencies\u2019 collection, disclosure,  and use of personal information maintained in systems of records.  The Privacy Act requires that when agencies establish or make  changes to a system of records, they must notify the public through a  system of records notice (SORN) in the Federal Register. According  to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, the purposes  of the notice are to inform the public of the existence of systems of  records; the kinds of information maintained; the kinds of individuals  on whom information is maintained; the purposes for which they are  used; and how individuals can exercise their rights under the Privacy  Act.", "The E-Government Act of 2002 requires that agencies conduct  Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) before developing or procuring  information technology (or initiating a new collection of information)  that collects, maintains, or disseminates personal information. The  assessment helps agencies examine the risks and effects on  individual privacy and evaluate protections and alternative processes  for handling information to mitigate potential privacy risks. OMB  guidance also requires agencies to perform and update PIAs as  necessary where a system change creates new privacy risks, for  example, when the adoption or alteration of business processes  results in personal information in government databases being  merged, centralized, matched with other databases or otherwise  significantly manipulated.", "Within DOJ, preserving civil liberties and protecting privacy is a  responsibility shared by departments and component agencies. As such,  DOJ and the FBI have established oversight structures to help protect  privacy and oversee compliance with statutory and policy requirements.

In  accordance with this guidance, FBI published a PIA at the beginning of  the development of NGI-IPS in 2008, as required. However, the FBI did  not publish a new PIA or update the 2008 PIA before beginning to pilot  NGI-IPS in December 2011 or as significant changes were made to the  system through September 2015.

Similarly, DOJ/FBI acknowledged that FACE  Services began supporting FBI investigations in 2011, which involved  storing photos in a new work log and also performing automated  searches instead of manual searches. As a new use of information  technology involving the handling of personal information, it too required a  PIA. While DOJ and the FBI updated the internal drafts of these PIAs, the  public remained unaware of the department\u2019s consideration for how the  FBI uses personal information in the face recognition search process.  Given the issues we identified, we recommended that DOJ assess the  PIA development process to determine why PIAs were not published prior  to using or updating face recognition capabilities.", "Although DOJ officials did not concur with this recommendation, they did  agree that all DOJ processes may be reviewed for improvements and  efficiencies. In November 2018, DOJ officials told us that they had  reviewed the PIA development process and determined that one reason  the FBI\u2019s face recognition PIAs were not completed more quickly was  because the FBI and DOJ engaged in an extensive PIA revision process.  As a result, DOJ reported that it implemented a pilot in 2018 to expedite  the PIA approval process, which included developing a PIA approval  template, conducting DOJ\u2019s review earlier in the process, and focusing  the review solely on legal sufficiency instead of a more comprehensive  review that included less significant editorial changes. According to DOJ,  this new process has significantly reduced the time required between the  completion of the PIA process by the FBI and the review by DOJ. Further,  DOJ reported that it has applied the same process to other DOJ  components since December 2018, and that the pilot is evolving into an  operational process.

However, we  found that the tests were limited because they did not include all possible  candidate list sizes and did not specify how often incorrect matches were  returned. According to the National Science and Technology Council  and the National Institute of Standards and Technology at the time, the  detection rate (how often the technology generates a match when the  person is in the database) and the false positive rate (how often the  technology incorrectly generates a match to a person in the database) are  both necessary to assess the accuracy of a face recognition system.  The FBI\u2019s detection rate requirement for face recognition searches at the  time stated that when the person exists in the database, NGI-IPS shall  return a match of this person at least 85 percent of the time. However, we  found that the FBI only tested this requirement with a candidate list of 50  potential matches. In these tests, 86 percent of the time, a match to a  person in the database was correctly returned. The FBI had not assessed  accuracy when users requested a list of 2 to 49 matches.", "According to FBI, a smaller list would likely lower the accuracy of the  searches as the smaller list may not contain the likely match that would  be present in the larger list. Further, FBI officials stated during our May  2016 review that they had not assessed how often NGI-IPS face  recognition searches erroneously match a person to the database (the  false positive rate). If false positives are returned at a higher than  acceptable rate, law enforcement users may waste time and resources  pursuing unnecessary investigative leads. In addition, we concluded that  by conducting this assessment the FBI would help ensure that it is  sufficiently protecting the privacy and civil liberties of U.S. citizens  enrolled in the database. Therefore, we recommended that the FBI  conduct tests of NGI-IPS to verify that the system is sufficiently accurate  for all allowable candidate list sizes and ensure that both the detection  rate and the false positive rate are identified for such tests.", "In comments on our draft report in 2016, and reiterated during  recommendation follow-up in May 2019, DOJ did not concur with this recommendation. DOJ officials stated that the FBI has performed  accuracy testing to validate that the system meets the requirements for  the detection rate, which fully satisfies requirements for the investigative  lead service provided by NGI-IPS. As of May 2019, DOJ has not taken  action to address the recommendation.", "We continue to believe that the recommended action is needed. Such  action would allow the FBI to have more reasonable assurance that NGI- IPS provides leads that help enhance, rather than hinder, criminal  investigations and that helps protect the privacy of citizens. As noted  above, a key focus of our recommendation is the need to ensure that  NGI-IPS is sufficiently accurate for all allowable candidate list sizes. As  we reported, although the FBI tested the detection rate for a candidate list  of 50 photos, they did not do such tests when NGI-IPS users request  smaller candidate lists\u2014specifically between 2 and 50 photos. Further,  according to the FBI Information Technology Life Cycle Management  Directive, testing needs to confirm the system meets all user  requirements. Because the accuracy of NGI-IPS\u2019s face recognition  searches when returning fewer than 50 photos in a candidate list is  unknown, the FBI is limited in understanding whether the results are  accurate enough to meet NGI-IPS users\u2019 needs.", "In comments on our May 2016 report, DOJ officials also stated that  searches of NGI-IPS produce a gallery of likely candidates to be used as  investigative leads, not for positive identification. As a result, according  to DOJ officials, NGI-IPS cannot produce false positives and there is no  false positive rate for the system. We disagree with DOJ. According to the  National Institute of Standards and Technology, the detection rate and the  false positive rate are both necessary to assess the accuracy of a face  recognition system. Generally, face recognition systems can be  configured to allow for a greater or lesser number of matches. A greater  number of matches would generally increase the detection rate, but would  also increase the false positive rate. Similarly, a lesser number of  matches would decrease the false positive rate, but would also decrease  the detection rate.

Even with a manual review process, the FBI could  miss investigative leads if a partner does not have a sufficiently accurate  system. The FBI has entered into agreements with state and federal  partners to conduct face recognition searches using hundreds of millions  of photos. Without assessments of the results from its state and federal  partners, the FBI is making decisions to enter into agreements based on  assumptions that the search results may provide valuable investigative  leads. For example, the FBI\u2019s accuracy requirements for criminal  investigative purposes may be different than a state\u2019s accuracy  requirements for preventing driver\u2019s license fraud.
