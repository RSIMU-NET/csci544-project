GAO analyzed Medicaid data on behavioral health diagnoses and treatment use for expansion enrollees for 2014, the most recent year available. GAO also reviewed documents and interviewed Medicaid officials from all selected states to understand how data were recorded, and how treatment for expansion enrollees compared with what was available prior to expansion.

Mental health conditions were more common than substance use conditions; from 11 to 20 percent of expansion enrollees were diagnosed with a mental health condition, compared with 6 to 8 percent diagnosed with a substance use condition. The most common mental health condition category was mood disorders, such as depression. For substance use, substance-related conditions (e.g., addiction to drugs like opioids) were more prevalent than alcohol-related conditions.", "From 20 to 34 percent of expansion enrollees in the four selected states received behavioral health treatment in 2014, which includes outpatient services such as psychotherapy or prescription drugs. Treatment rates exceeded rates of diagnosed conditions, in part, because prescription drugs are not recorded with diagnosis codes. Thus, enrollees who only used behavioral health prescription drugs\u2014and no outpatient services\u2014were not counted in the diagnosis totals.", "The two most commonly used behavioral health service categories were psychotherapy services (visits with a provider aimed at reducing and managing symptoms) and diagnostic services, such as diagnostic evaluations.", "Antidepressants were the most commonly used behavioral health prescription drug category; over two-thirds of expansion enrollees who used a behavioral health drug took an antidepressant.", "Officials in three of the four selected states said that expansion enrollees likely had greater access to behavioral health treatment after enrolling in Medicaid. Officials from Iowa, Washington, and West Virginia reported that, compared to being uninsured, expansion enrollees could more easily access treatment, such as community-based mental health services and behavioral health prescription drugs. Officials in New York said expansion enrollees experienced less of a change, because most of its enrollees were previously eligible for Medicaid."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Research has shown that low-income individuals disproportionately  experience behavioral health conditions.

In particular, research has shown that individuals  enrolled in Medicaid\u2014a joint federal-state program that finances health  care coverage for certain low-income and medically needy individuals\u2014 experience a higher rate of behavioral health conditions than those with  private insurance. Access to behavioral health treatment\u2014including both  behavioral health services and prescription drugs\u2014is important because  of the consequences of untreated conditions, which may include  worsening health, increased medical costs, and negative effects on  employment and workplace performance.", "As of January 1, 2014, states have the option to expand eligibility for the  Medicaid program\u2014as allowed by the Patient Protection and Affordable  Care Act (PPACA)\u2014to certain adults with incomes up to 138 percent of  the federal poverty level (FPL). PPACA requires states that choose to  expand Medicaid to provide enrollees with benefit plans that include  behavioral health treatment, and therefore Medicaid programs in these  states may have experienced increased demand for behavioral health  treatment. However, little is known about the extent to which expansion  enrollees had diagnosed behavioral health conditions, or what types of  behavioral health services and related prescription drugs enrollees  received during the first year of Medicaid expansion in 2014.", "Given the importance of access to treatment for individuals with  behavioral health conditions, and the likely increased demand on  Medicaid programs in expansion states, you asked us to provide  information about the utilization of behavioral health treatment among  Medicaid expansion enrollees during the first year of expansion in 2014.  This report describes  1.  the population of Medicaid expansion enrollees with behavioral health  diagnoses in selected states in 2014, and  2.  the use of behavioral health treatment among Medicaid expansion  enrollees in selected states in 2014.", "To describe the population of Medicaid expansion enrollees with  behavioral health diagnoses in selected states in 2014, we selected four  states (Iowa, New York, Washington, and West Virginia) that met the  following criteria: (1) were among the 25 states that chose to expand  Medicaid as allowed under PPACA as of January 1, 2014; (2) had  enrollment and utilization data for expansion enrollees in the Medicaid  Statistical Information System (MSIS) for all of calendar year 2014 that  were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of our reporting objectives; and  (3) had available information and documentation on Medicaid behavioral  health benefits, and how enrollment, service utilization, and prescription  drug data were recorded for expansion enrollees in MSIS. Our selected  states were the only four states that met these criteria as of January  2016, and they are not representative of all states and their Medicaid  programs. In addition, a number of state-specific factors\u2014such as  differences in population health status and provider supply\u2014could  contribute to variation across our selected states, but attributing this  variation to such factors was beyond the scope of this study. For each  state, we analyzed enrollment and service utilization data to (1) identify all  expansion enrollees (both newly and not newly eligible), (2) determine the  extent to which they had diagnosed behavioral health conditions, and (3)  describe characteristics of enrollees with these conditions. We considered  an enrollee to have a diagnosed behavioral health condition if that  enrollee received any outpatient services with a recorded diagnosis code  for a behavioral health condition in 2014. Among the substance-related  conditions, we also identified opioid abuse and dependence as a unique  category, and we selected these codes based on prior research on opioid  use in Medicaid. Because we measured behavioral health conditions  based on outpatient service utilization data, our estimates do not include  individuals with conditions who did not use outpatient services during  2014\u2014such as individuals who used no services or who only used  inpatient services\u2014or those who used only behavioral health prescription  drugs. For the group of enrollees with a behavioral health condition, we  used enrollment data to describe their characteristics; specifically, we  examined age, gender, and geographic (i.e., urban vs. rural) location.", "To describe the use of behavioral health treatment among Medicaid  expansion enrollees in selected states in 2014, we used enrollment,  service utilization, and prescription drug data for the same four selected  states. We defined behavioral health treatment as the receipt of  behavioral health services, behavioral health prescription drugs, or both.  We defined behavioral health services as outpatient screening,  assessment, diagnostic, treatment, rehabilitation, and habilitation services  used primarily or exclusively to evaluate and address the needs of  individuals with behavioral health conditions. To identify behavioral health  services, we reviewed the following for each state: (1) Medicaid provider  manuals and other coverage documentation that contained the procedure  codes and descriptions for covered services, and (2) a list of all services  that were provided to expansion enrollees in calendar year 2014 that  were recorded with a primary diagnosis of a behavioral health condition.  We selected codes from these two sources that we determined to be  behavioral-health specific based on their descriptions. Consequently,  lists of services are different for each state based on their coverage and  utilization of services in 2014. We also analyzed behavioral health  service use by category; for this analysis, we divided the top 25 most- used behavioral health services by state into categories, such as  diagnostic services and psychotherapy services, based on their  descriptions. We excluded all inpatient and laboratory services from our  analysis. In addition, because our analysis was limited to Medicaid  service utilization data, our results do not reflect the use of behavioral  health services not paid for by Medicaid, such as state- or grant-funded  services.", "To more fully examine service utilization patterns among expansion  enrollees, we also examined evaluation and management services\u2014 more general medical visits with a physician or other medical provider\u2014 because some individuals may have received behavioral health treatment  during these visits, including services provided by a psychiatrist. We  limited our analysis of evaluation and management services to those  visits recorded with a primary diagnosis of a behavioral health condition.  However, because of the uncertainty of the extent to which behavioral  health treatment was provided as part of evaluation and management  services, we do not count them as behavioral health services, or include  them in our overall definition of behavioral health treatment.", "We also examined outpatient emergency room visits\u2014for any condition,  not just a behavioral health condition\u2014among expansion enrollees with  and without a behavioral health diagnosis. Emergency room visits were of  interest, because prior research has suggested that individuals who have  a behavioral health condition may access emergency care more  frequently than those without such conditions.", "To examine behavioral health prescription drug use, we examined  Medicaid data for prescription drugs provided to expansion enrollees in  2014. We defined behavioral health prescription drugs as Food and Drug  Administration (FDA)-approved drugs used, on- or off-label, to treat adults  with behavioral health conditions in the United States as of 2014. To  identify these drugs, we worked with a contractor, QuintilesIMS, who  developed a list of behavioral health drugs based on information on how  drugs are classified by therapeutic use, survey data on prescribing  patterns, and expert clinical opinion. We categorized the list of drugs into  12 categories, such as antidepressants, based on our prior work and  consultation with QuintilesIMS. See appendix I for the list of behavioral  health prescription drugs we included in our analysis.", "We conducted interviews with officials from our selected states to discuss  behavioral health benefits for Medicaid expansion enrollees; how  enrollment, service utilization, and prescription drug data were recorded  in MSIS; officials\u2019 perspectives on the results of our analysis; and whether  Medicaid expansion affected the availability of behavioral health  treatment for expansion enrollees, relative to what was available for low- income, uninsured adults prior to the first year of expansion in 2014. We  also interviewed a physician group specializing in addiction medicine and  consulted with clinical experts from QuintilesIMS for additional  perspectives on our results.", "We assessed the reliability of MSIS data by interviewing knowledgeable  federal and state officials; reviewing related documentation, such as  studies that assessed the completeness and quality of Medicaid data;  comparing the results of our analysis to published figures from the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees  Medicaid at the federal level; and testing the data for logical errors. Based  on this work, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our reporting objectives. For further details on our scope and  methodology, including our data reliability assessment, see appendix II.", "We conducted our performance audit from November 2015 through June  2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Examples of common mental health  conditions include anxiety disorders, such as phobias and post-traumatic  stress disorder, and mood disorders, such as depression and bipolar  disorder. Examples of common substance use conditions include alcohol  use disorder and opioid use disorder. There is substantial overlap  between individuals with mental health and substance use conditions;  about 8 million adults had both types of conditions, also referred to as co- occurring conditions. Individuals with behavioral health conditions also  experience higher rates of physical health conditions. Low-income  individuals, such as those enrolled in Medicaid, are at greater risk for  developing behavioral health conditions. In 2015, a greater percentage of  individuals covered by Medicaid experienced mental health conditions  and co-occurring conditions than individuals with private insurance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Behavioral Health Treatment", "paragraphs": ["Treatment for behavioral health conditions can help individuals reduce  their symptoms, improve their ability to function, and avoid the potential  consequences of untreated conditions, such as worsening health,  reduced educational attainment, loss of employment, and involvement  with the justice system. Treatment for behavioral health conditions can  include behavioral health services, prescription drugs, or a combination of  both. Behavioral health services include diagnostic services, which  involve the collection and evaluation of information to determine the  nature and extent of behavioral health problems, and psychosocial  therapies, such as psychotherapy. Psychotherapy\u2014also referred to as  counseling or \u201ctalk therapy\u201d\u2014typically involves regular visits with a  provider focused on helping individuals understand, reduce, and manage  their symptoms. Prescription drugs may also be used to treat both mental  health and substance use conditions. SAMHSA estimated that in 2015,  more adults used a mental health medication (12 percent) than received  outpatient mental health treatment (7 percent). A common type of drug  used to treat mental health conditions is antidepressants, which treat  depression as well as other conditions, such as anxiety. For certain  substance use conditions, individuals may receive medication-assisted  treatment (MAT), which involves the use of medications in conjunction  with behavioral health services, such as psychotherapy. According to  SAMHSA, the use of medications like methadone, buprenorphine, and  naltrexone for individuals with opioid use disorders can help them  more fully engage in their recovery.", "One potential barrier to accessing treatment is a shortage of qualified  behavioral health professionals, particularly in rural areas. According to  the Health Resources and Services Administration, there were more than  4,500 mental health professional shortage areas in the United States as  of April 2017, containing about a third of the American population (about  109 million people). Over half of these shortage areas were in rural or  partially rural locations. We previously reported that states were taking a  number of steps to address behavioral health workforce shortages, such  as providing Medicaid reimbursement for telehealth services. Telehealth  services allow a patient in a rural location to interact with a medical  provider through interactive video conferencing.

For example, state Medicaid  programs must cover certain mandatory populations and benefits, but  states may choose to also cover other optional populations and benefits.  Traditionally, Medicaid did not require states to include behavioral health  services in their Medicaid programs; however, all state Medicaid  programs provided some behavioral health services. Likewise, states  were not required to include coverage for prescription drugs in their  Medicaid programs, but all states did. Under PPACA, most expansion  enrollees must be covered under an alternative benefit plan, which must  cover 10 essential health benefits categories. Mental health and  substance use services, including behavioral health treatment, and  prescription drugs are 2 of the 10 essential health benefits categories.

Clinical experts  from QuintilesIMS noted that the prevalence of depression is  significantly higher in women than in men; in men there are more  concerns about agitation and behavior management, which can be  treated with antipsychotics.", "Age: Among the drug categories with the biggest age differences  were ADHD medications, which had greater use among 19 to 29 year  olds compared with enrollees aged 30 and older, and  sedative/hypnotic medications, used by more enrollees aged 30 and  over compared with enrollees aged 19 to 29. QuintilesIMS clinical  experts said that the prevalence of ADHD declines rapidly in the late  teen years, which may explain the lower use of these drugs in the  older age group. The sedative/hypnotic drug category includes drugs  that address insomnia, which is a condition that increases with age;  this may partially explain the higher use of these drugs in the 30 and  over age group.", "Over a quarter of expansion enrollees in the selected states who took a  behavioral health prescription drug in 2014 took drugs from three or more  different drug categories. From 25 to 31 percent of enrollees in selected  states who took a behavioral health drug took drugs from three or more  drug categories, and 4 to 6 percent took drugs from five or more  categories. These enrollees may have used drugs from multiple  categories at the same time to treat their conditions (concomitant use), or  they may have filled prescriptions for these drugs at different points in  time during 2014. QuintilesIMS clinical experts noted that a common  example of concomitant use is taking both an antidepressant and a sleep  medication, which are often prescribed together during initial treatment for  depression. Regarding the use of different categories of drugs over time,  experts said that sometimes when a patient does not improve after taking  a drug, a physician may switch the patient to a drug from a different  category. For example, a patient with bipolar disorder who is initially  treated with an anticonvulsant may be switched to an antipsychotic if  symptoms do not adequately resolve. We also found that more enrollees  aged 30 and over used drugs from three or more categories than  enrollees aged 19 to 29, which our clinical experts said could be partly  because some behavioral health conditions become more difficult to treat  with age, which may result in more drugs being prescribed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS) for review.

According to the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), states are not  required to submit data on the utilization of services or drugs for  enrollees who receive premium assistance; consequently, no data  were available for our utilization analyses.", "Connecticut was not selected because the enrollment data in MSIS  for 2014 were not reliable enough for the purpose of identifying its  population of expansion enrollees. CMS officials told us that  Connecticut had entered enrollment data incorrectly for the expansion  population in 2014.", "New Jersey was not selected due to the lack of available information  on behavioral health benefits and how its data were recorded in MSIS.", "Vermont was not selected because its Medicaid program had  coverage for adults with incomes up to 150 percent of the federal  poverty level (FPL) that pre-dated the enactment of PPACA.", "Iowa and New York were also missing key information in MSIS that we  needed to identify all expansion enrollees, but we conducted our analyses  after receiving the necessary data from the states directly. We limited our  analysis of Iowa\u2019s data to individuals with incomes at or below 100  percent of the FPL, because individuals with higher incomes were served  through premium assistance as of 2014; consequently, there were no  utilization data available for them. Our selected states are not  representative of all expansion states and their Medicaid programs. In  addition, a number of state-specific factors\u2014such as differences in  population health status and provider supply\u2014could contribute to  variation across our selected states, but attributing this variation to such  factors was beyond the scope of this study.", "We assessed the reliability and usability of MSIS data for our purposes by  interviewing knowledgeable federal and state officials; reviewing related  documentation, such as studies that assessed the reliability of Medicaid  data; comparing the results of our analysis of expansion enrollment to  published enrollment figures from CMS; and testing the data for logical  errors and missing information. Based on our assessment, we excluded  data from Iowa for months in which expansion enrollees were served  under comprehensive managed care, because the results of our reliability  testing suggested missing data. This resulted in the exclusion of data  from about 17 percent of expansion enrollees. We excluded data from  Washington for months in which expansion enrollees were served under  fee-for-service arrangements, because of missing diagnosis codes, which  were needed for our analysis.

We  considered an enrollee to have a diagnosed behavioral health condition if  that enrollee received any outpatient services with a recorded diagnosis  code for a behavioral health condition in 2014. The presence of such  diagnosis codes on claims does not necessarily indicate that a clinical  interview was conducted. In addition, because we measured behavioral  health conditions based on outpatient service utilization data, our  estimates do not include individuals with conditions who did not use  outpatient services during 2014\u2014such as individuals who used no  services or who only used inpatient services\u2014or those who used only  behavioral health prescription drugs. Using the Agency for Healthcare  Research and Quality\u2019s Clinical Classifications Software groupings, we  further categorized mental health conditions into 11 categories:  3.  attention-deficit, conduct, and disruptive behavior disorders;  4.  delirium, dementia, and amnestic and other cognitive disorders;  6.  disorders usually diagnosed in infancy, childhood, or adolescence;  7.  impulse control disorders not elsewhere classified;  10. schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders; and  11. miscellaneous mental health disorders.", "We further categorized substance use disorders into substance-related  (i.e., addiction to drugs like cocaine or heroin) and alcohol-related  disorders. Among the substance-related conditions, we also identified  opioid abuse and dependence as a unique category, and we selected  these codes based on prior research on opioid treatment use in  Medicaid. We considered enrollees to have a behavioral health condition  if they had any diagnosis code within our selected range. Substance use  conditions were all diagnosis codes within the Agency for Healthcare  Research and Quality\u2019s substance-related and alcohol-related disorders  categories, including opioid abuse and dependence, but excluding  tobacco use disorder. While we considered tobacco use disorder to be a  behavioral health condition, we did not consider it to be a substance use  condition, which is consistent with how the Substance Abuse and Mental  Health Services Administration collects and reports data on substance  use. For the group of enrollees with a behavioral health condition, we  used enrollment data to describe their characteristics; specifically, we  examined age, gender, and geographic location. We measured enrollees\u2019  age based on date of birth and latest month of enrollment in 2014.  Gender was determined as recorded in the relevant MSIS data field. We  defined geographic location based on enrollees\u2019 zip code of residence  using the most recent available rural-urban commuting area codes from  the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of  Agriculture. The set of rural-urban commuting area codes has 10 tiers  along the spectrum of rurality, each of which is further broken down into  secondary codes. We used the four-tiered data consolidation  recommended for analysis by the Washington State Department of  Health.", "To describe the use of behavioral health services among Medicaid  expansion enrollees in selected states in 2014, we selected a set of  behavioral health services for each state based on each state\u2019s coverage  and utilization of services in 2014. We defined behavioral health services  as outpatient screening, assessment, diagnostic, treatment, rehabilitation,  and habilitation services used primarily or exclusively to evaluate and  address the needs of individuals with behavioral health conditions. To  identify behavioral health services, we reviewed the following for each  state: (1) Medicaid provider manuals and other coverage documentation  that contained the procedure codes and descriptions for covered  services, and (2) a list of all services that were provided to expansion  enrollees in calendar year 2014 that were recorded with a primary  diagnosis of a behavioral health condition. We selected codes from these  two sources that we determined to be behavioral-health-specific based on  their descriptions. We gave each state the opportunity to review and  comment on the list of services selected for analysis, and made revisions  as appropriate based on their input. To further examine behavioral health  service use by category, we reviewed the top 25 most-used services (by  number of enrollees who used the service at least once) for each state.  Based on service descriptions, we divided them into the following service  categories: diagnostic services, psychotherapy services, rehabilitation  and habilitation services, substance-use-specific services, and other  services.", "To more fully examine service utilization patterns among expansion  enrollees, we also examined evaluation and management services\u2014 more general medical visits with a physician or other medical provider\u2014 because some individuals may have received behavioral health treatment  during these visits, including services provided by a psychiatrist. We  limited our analysis of evaluation and management services to those  visits recorded with a primary diagnosis of a behavioral health condition.  However, because of the uncertainty of the extent to which behavioral  health treatment was provided as part of evaluation and management  services, we do not count them as behavioral health services, or include  them in our overall definition of behavioral health treatment.", "We also examined outpatient emergency room visits\u2014for any condition,  not just a behavioral health condition\u2014among expansion enrollees with  and without a behavioral health diagnosis. Emergency room visits were of  interest, because prior research has suggested that individuals who have  a behavioral health condition may access emergency care more  frequently than those without such conditions.", "For both behavioral health and evaluation and management services, we  accounted for the possibility of duplicate claims or encounters by  restricting our analysis to a single claim or encounter for the same service  for the same patient on the same day, and by counting services with add- on codes as a single service. We excluded all inpatient and laboratory  services from our analysis. In addition, because our analysis was limited  to Medicaid claims and encounters, our results do not reflect the use of  services not paid for by Medicaid, such as state- or grant-funded  services.", "To examine behavioral health prescription drug use, we examined both  filled prescriptions and services that included physician administration of  drugs. We defined behavioral health prescription drugs as Food and Drug  Administration (FDA)-approved drugs used, on- or off-label, to treat adults  with behavioral health conditions in the United States as of 2014. We  excluded drugs used to treat the side effects of other behavioral health  prescription drugs, such as drugs for diabetes that may be used to  address the metabolic effects of antipsychotic drugs. To identify  behavioral health prescription drugs, we worked with a contractor\u2014 QuintilesIMS\u2014that developed a list of behavioral health drugs based on  drug reference information (i.e., how drugs are classified), survey data on  prescribing patterns, and expert clinical opinion. From among drugs that  were classified as psychotherapeutic or were identified as being  prescribed to treat a behavioral health condition based on survey data,  QuintilesIMS identified those drugs and drug categories that are primarily  or exclusively used to treat behavioral health conditions. We counted  these drugs as behavioral health prescription drugs whenever an  expansion enrollee filled a prescription for them. QuintilesIMS also  identified drugs that may be used for behavioral health purposes, but are  also used to treat non-behavioral-health conditions. For this group of  drugs, we used information about the characteristics of the drug, such as  dose, form, or route of administration, if applicable, to identify whether  they were likely to have been used for a behavioral health purpose. For  drugs without characteristics that distinguished their use, we counted  them as a behavioral health drug only when an individual had an  outpatient service some time in 2014 that was recorded with a related  behavioral health diagnosis (i.e., a behavioral condition that survey data  identified as one a prescriber intended to treat by prescribing that drug.)  As a result, our analysis does not account for the use of these drugs by  individuals who did not have an outpatient service in 2014 that included a  relevant diagnosis code. See appendix I for the list of behavioral health  drugs we included in our analyses.", "Based on our prior work and consultation with the contractor, we  categorized the 126 behavioral health drugs on our list into 12  categories:  4.  Antidepressant combination medications  7.  Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medications  9.  Sexual function disorder medications  10. Smoking cessation medications  11. Substance use disorder medications  As part of our analysis of individuals with opioid abuse and dependence,  we looked at the use of drugs used for medication-assisted treatment  (MAT). We defined MAT drugs as drugs that are FDA-approved to treat  opioid use disorder: methadone, buprenorphine, buprenorphine/naloxone,  and naltrexone.

In interviews, state officials discussed ongoing efforts to  ensure that enrollees diagnosed with opioid abuse or dependence receive  appropriate treatment. Many of these efforts seek to increase the number  of providers that can prescribe drugs for MAT. For example, Iowa is using  a Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics planning grant from the  Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to train  providers and increase the number of providers that can prescribe  buprenorphine, a drug used for MAT.
