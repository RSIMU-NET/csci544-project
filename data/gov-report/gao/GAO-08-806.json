The Department of Defense (Defense) provides CSF to 27 coalition partners for costs incurred in direct support of U.S. military operations. Pakistan is the largest recipient of CSF, receiving 81 percent of CSF reimbursements as of May 2008. This report focuses on (1) the extent to which Defense has consistently applied its guidance to validate the reimbursements claimed by Pakistan and (2) how the Office of the Defense Representative to Pakistan's (ODRP) role has changed over time. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed CSF oversight procedures, examined CSF documents, and interviewed Defense officials in Washington, D.C., U.S. Central Command in Florida, and Pakistan."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Defense Comptroller issued new guidance in 2003 to enhance CSF oversight. The guidance calls for, among other things, CSF reimbursement claims to contain quantifiable information that indicates the incremental nature of support (i.e., above and beyond normal operations), validation that the support or service was provided, and copies of invoices or documentation supporting how the costs were calculated. While Defense generally conducted macro-level analytical reviews called for in its guidance, such as determining whether the cost is less than that which would be incurred by the United States for the same service, for a large number of reimbursement claims Defense did not obtain detailed documentation to verify that claimed costs were valid, actually incurred, or correctly calculated. GAO found that Defense did not consistently apply its existing CSF oversight guidance. For example, as of May 2008, Defense paid over $2 billion in Pakistani reimbursement claims for military activities covering January 2004 through June 2007 without obtaining sufficient information that would enable a third party to recalculate these costs. Furthermore, Defense may have reimbursed costs that (1) were not incremental, (2) were not based on actual activity, or (3) were potentially duplicative. GAO also found that additional oversight controls were needed. For example, there is no guidance for Defense to verify currency conversion rates used by Pakistan, which if performed would enhance Defense's ability to monitor for potential overbillings. Defense's guidance does not specifically task ODRP with attempting to verify Pakistani military support and expenses, despite recognition by Defense officials that such verification is best performed by U.S. officials in Pakistan, who have access to Pakistani officials and information. As such, ODRP did not try to verify Pakistan CSF claims from January 2004 through August 2006. Beginning in September 2006, without any formal guidance or directive to do so from U.S. Central Command or the Defense Comptroller, ODRP began an effort to validate Pakistani military support and expenses. This increased verification effort on the part of ODRP contributed to an increase in the amount of Pakistani government CSF claims disallowed and deferred. Prior to ODRP's increased verification efforts, the average percentage of Pakistani claims disallowed or deferred for January 2004 through August 2006 was a little over 2 percent. In comparison, the average percentage of Pakistani claims disallowed or deferred for September 2006 through February 2007 was 6 percent and for the most recent claims (March 2007 through June 2007) processed in February 2008, was approximately 22 percent. However, ODRP's continued oversight activity is not assured, as Defense had not developed formal guidance delineating how and to what degree ODRP should attempt to verify Pakistani claims for reimbursement. GAO recognizes that Defense may not be able to fully verify every Pakistani claim without the ability to access Pakistani records or do onsite monitoring. However, such ability would enhance CSF oversight."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States began  reimbursing coalition partners for their logistical and combat support of  U.S. military operations in the global war on terror.

To assess the  application of current CSF guidance, we examined the CSF oversight  documentation noted above from January 2004 through February 2008.

As a result, Defense requested supplemental  funding from Congress to provide payments to Pakistan for logistical and  military support in connection with Operation Enduring Freedom. In  response, Congress passed the Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year  2002, stipulating that the \u201cDefense Emergency Response Fund\u201d could be  used by the Secretary of Defense to reimburse coalition partners for  logistical and military support to U.S. military operations. This funding  became known as Coalition Support Funds.", "To provide Defense with maximum flexibility, Congress passed the  Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002, which granted the  Secretary of Defense the authority to make CSF payments notwithstanding  any other provision of law in such amounts as the Secretary may  determine in his discretion, based on documentation determined by  the Secretary to adequately account for the logistical and military support  provided by partner nations. Any such determination by the Secretary  shall be final and conclusive. The act did, however, require Defense to  provide a 15-day notification of upcoming CSF reimbursements.

Defense officials stated that  without CSF or a similar mechanism to reimburse Pakistan for support in  Operation Enduring Freedom, Pakistan could not afford to deploy military  forces along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border to support U.S. military  operations in Afghanistan. Defense also indicates that 84 percent of all  containerized cargo and approximately 40 percent of all fuel for U.S. and  coalition forces operating in Afghanistan passes through Pakistan.

For example, the claim reported a total cost for army airlift  without providing information on number of sorties flown, the dates,  costs, time frames, purpose, number or types of aircraft flown, or number  of man-hours involved. According to the February 2002 memo, the  government of Pakistan was unprepared or unable to reconstruct these  costs in a verifiable manner in line with standard U.S. government  accounting practices and expectations. Staff at CENTCOM in Tampa,  Florida, and at ODRP in the embassy were unable to fill in such details.", "Despite this concern, the Defense Office of General Counsel concluded,  based on the statutory authority provided to the Secretary of Defense, that  the Secretary of Defense could legally reimburse all of the cost categories  identified by the Comptroller as legally defensible. The United States  eventually reimbursed Pakistan $300 million.", "In 2003, at the request of the Comptroller, the Defense Inspector General  performed an audit of the CSF oversight process for all countries seeking  CSF reimbursements. The report found deficiencies in both Defense\u2019s CSF  guidance, as well as the supporting documentation CSF recipients  provided to support their claims. It recommended improvements in  Defense\u2019s analysis of CSF reimbursement requests and greater  documentation requirements for countries seeking reimbursement. In  response, the Comptroller published guidance in December 2003 to clarify  the roles and responsibilities of CENTCOM and other regional combatant  commanders and of the Comptroller in the CSF oversight process. The  2003 guidance notes that Congress provided the Secretary of Defense with  the authority to determine how much to reimburse partner countries, and  how much documentation was required to adequately account for the  support provided. However, the guidance also stated that CENTCOM and  the Comptroller are to obtain sufficient documentation to validate that  Pakistani military support had been provided and that costs were incurred,  reasonable, and appropriate under the CSF program. Table 1 summarizes  the review criteria in the December 2003 Comptroller guidance. We  address the implementation of these and other criteria in greater detail  later in this report.", "Under the December 2003 guidance and oversight process, Pakistan would  first submit its claim for reimbursement to ODRP at the U.S. Embassy in  Islamabad. According to Comptroller guidance, ODRP would assist the  Pakistani military in formulating the reimbursement claim before sending  the claim to CENTCOM in Tampa, Florida. CENTCOM would then conduct  its own review in an attempt to link claimed expenses to U.S. military  operations before forwarding the claim package to the Comptroller. Under  this process, ODRP and CENTCOM staff can make recommendations to  defer or disallow costs based on their analysis of the Pakistan submission;  however, the Comptroller makes the final recommendation to the  Secretary of Defense on which costs should be paid, deferred, or  disallowed.", "The Department of State, the Office of Management and Budget, and  Congress also have a role in the CSF oversight process after the  Comptroller has finished its review. The Department of State and the  Under Secretary of Defense for Policy must each verify that the CSF  reimbursement is consistent with the U.S. government\u2019s national security  policy and does not adversely affect the balance of power in the region. In  addition, Defense is required to consult with the Director of the Office of  Management and Budget during the CSF process. Defense is also required  to provide a 15-day notification of the upcoming reimbursement, as well as  quarterly reports to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations  and the House and Senate Armed Services Committees on the use of funds  made available for payments to Pakistan and other CSF recipients.

We  reviewed the Pakistani claims for January 2004 through June 2007, as well  as related CENTCOM and Comptroller memos, to determine if DOD had  consistently applied the Comptroller criteria issued in December 2003. The  memos prepared by the Comptroller generally included the four macro- level analytical reviews outlined in the criteria; however, implementation  of these criteria was not sufficient to validate claimed costs. For example,  the Comptroller generally performed a comparison of total claimed costs  to the estimated U.S. cost to provide the same services; however, there  was not enough information in the Pakistani claims to determine that the  claimed amount and the estimated U.S. cost included the same expenses  or that the claimed costs were valid. Defense guidance developed by the  Comptroller calls for obtaining sufficient information to validate Pakistani  claims to determine that costs were incurred, reasonable, and appropriate.  However, Defense did not fully implement this criteria.

For the March through June 2007 claims, ODRP  recommended the Comptroller disallow the costs, reasoning that this was  not an incremental expense, as terrorists in the FATA did not have air  attack capability. However, the Comptroller took the position that  Pakistan likely incurred some increased costs by using the radars to police  the airspace over the Northwest Frontier Province (i.e., to patrol, monitor,  and provide air traffic control) and provide air traffic control for U.S.  military support flights into Afghanistan.

These  officials said that the 2006 presentation was the first time they had seen  any guidance on what could or could not be reimbursed under the CSF  program or what type of information was needed to support Pakistan\u2019s  reimbursement claims.", "As a result, ODRP recommended for the first time that Defense disallow or  defer costs that it found questionable, beginning with Pakistan\u2019s  September through October 2006 claim. For example, ODRP  recommended that the Comptroller disallow payments to Pakistan for  procurement of bulletproof vests, radios, and road construction due to  insufficient information necessary to verify the costs. Defense eventually  disallowed approximately $13 million of the September through October  2006 reimbursement claim.", "ODRP\u2019s increased verification efforts contributed to significantly larger  disallowals and deferrals ($81.2 million) in the most recently processed  (February 2008) Pakistan government reimbursement claims for the  months of March through June 2007. ODRP recommended deferring  payment on $38.1 million in claimed costs until the Pakistani government  provided information necessary to verify its claims. For example, ODRP  recommended deferring payment to Pakistan on its reimbursement  request for $22.3 million in helicopter maintenance costs. ODRP found that  even though the United States had paid Pakistan $55 million in CSF  reimbursements for maintenance of helicopters in the border area, only a  few of these helicopters were fully operational. According to ODRP  officials, the Pakistani army was not maintaining the helicopters, causing  essential systems to malfunction. Given the poor readiness rates, ODRP  recommended that the Comptroller defer payment on Pakistan\u2019s  helicopter maintenance claims until a process could be implemented to  ensure that Pakistan could maintain its helicopter fleet. ODRP also  recommended disallowing payment on an additional $42.3 million to  Pakistan for such things as air defense radars, procurement of tents and  vests, and funding for Pakistan\u2019s joint staff headquarters operations.", "After ODRP submitted its recommendations, CENTCOM and the  Comptroller performed their own reviews of the reimbursement claim (see  fig. 6).", "The Comptroller disagreed with some of ODRP\u2019s recommendations. For  example, ODRP recommended disallowing $26.4 million for the  maintenance of air defense radars since terrorists in the border region  possessed no air force. The Comptroller noted, however, that these radars  could also provide air traffic control for Pakistani military aircraft  operating in the area and for U.S. military flights to Afghanistan. As a  result, the Comptroller modified ODRP\u2019s recommendations to disallow  certain costs and instead deferred payment on these costs until Pakistan  could provide more information to support the reimbursement request.  However, as of May 2008, Defense has not paid any of these deferred CSF  costs because Pakistan has not provided evidence to indicate that these  costs were valid. Figure 7 shows the increased CSF disallowals and  deferrals during ODRP\u2019s increased oversight activity in the September  through October 2006 claims, and particularly in the latest claim period  (March through June 2007), when Defense disallowed or deferred a total  of $81.2 million over these four months.", "The amount disallowed or deferred for March through June 2007  represents a significant increase in CSF oversight by Defense. For  example, from January 2004 through August 2006, Defense disallowed or  deferred an average of a little more than 2 percent of each monthly  Pakistani reimbursement claim, for a total of $59.4 million over a 32-month  period. In comparison, the average percentage of Pakistani claims  disallowed or deferred for September 2006 through February 2007 was 6  percent or $33.3 million over a 6-month period and for the most recent  claims (March 2007 through June 2007) processed in February 2008, was  approximately 22 percent, or $81.2 million in a four month period. This  four month period accounts for approximately 53 percent of the total CSF  funding disallowed or deferred by Defense since January 2004 ($173.92  million).", "Based on our assessment, it appears that ODRP began this increased  oversight effort without any formal guidance or directive to do so. The  Comptroller has provided no formal guidance that stipulates ODRP should  verify that Pakistani military support has actually been performed and that  expenses were actually incurred. Furthermore, officials at ODRP from  2005 to early 2008 said that the Comptroller had provided no guidance or  training on the level of oversight they should provide. Despite this lack of  guidance, in November 2007, officials at the Comptroller and the Office of  the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy stated that ODRP was in fact  responsible for performing this oversight. However, as of May 2008,  Defense had not formalized any new guidance on ODRP\u2019s verification  responsibilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "No Guidance to Ensure Continued Oversight by ODRP", "paragraphs": ["Despite ODRP\u2019s increased oversight activity, continuity of this oversight is  not assured. According to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, clear delegation of authority and responsibility is important  to establishing an effective internal control system. However, as of May  2008, ODRP continued to lack formal guidance or training that explicitly  described either its oversight responsibilities or the procedures for  conducting such oversight. Staff at ODRP stated they had previously  received little to no guidance or training on their specific role in analyzing  Pakistani CSF reimbursement claims. Formal guidance is especially  important in Pakistan, where U.S. officials are generally limited to 1-year  tours due to the status of the U.S. mission in Islamabad as a high-risk post.  Because of the constant turnover of Defense officials in Pakistan, clear  guidance is needed to ensure the continuity of oversight efforts.", "In addition, the Comptroller has never provided guidance on how ODRP  and Defense representatives in other sovereign countries should verify  that the countries actually provided military support and that expenses  were actually incurred. ODRP is largely dependent upon the quality of  information supplied by the Pakistani military. According to Defense  officials, Defense lacks the authority to audit the internal finances of the  Pakistani military.  Because of this, ODRP staff described their analysis as  \u201cmacro-level verification,\u201d whereby the reasonableness of high-level costs  reported in the Pakistani claim is judged through a comparison with other  information. For example, ODRP\u2019s recommendation to defer helicopter  maintenance costs in the March through June 2007 claims stemmed from  their comparison of Pakistan\u2019s reported maintenance costs against ODRP\u2019s  knowledge of the low readiness rates of Pakistan\u2019s helicopters. Although  such analyses can be supplanted by anecdotal information from  discussions with Pakistani military officials or through occasional visits to  the field, according to ODRP, the Pakistani government strictly controls  foreigners\u2019 access to the FATA, making spot-checks difficult. The  Pakistani submissions are, therefore, the chief component of the ODRP  analysis.", "ODRP officials said they doubted that ODRP would ever be able to fully  verify actual costs in Pakistan. First, the Pakistani military reports costs to  ODRP that are already aggregates of many smaller costs. For example,  food cost would include costs for procurement, transport, storage, and  field preparation that ODRP cannot directly monitor. Furthermore,  according to ODRP, although the Pakistani government generally keeps  detailed financial records, these records are usually in paper form and  electronic record keeping is rare. Additionally, the Pakistani military does  not possess automated systems to track logistics and supplies. Because of  these factors, information retrieval from the field and collation at the  Pakistani joint staff level can take a great deal of time and may entail a  certain amount of approximation and averaging. Given Pakistan\u2019s record- keeping systems, it is unclear to what level of precision ODRP should be  expected to verify Pakistani support and incurred costs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Coalition Support Funds are critical components of America\u2019s global war  on terror and the primary support for Pakistani operations to destroy the  terrorist threat and close the terrorist safe haven in Pakistan\u2019s FATA.  Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress quickly authorized  emergency funding to prevent another attack, and given the grave and  immediate threat at the time, Congress recognized that ensuring  accountability for these funds was secondary to protecting the nation from  another attack. However, given the large amounts of funding provided to  Pakistan since October 2001, and indications that Pakistan will continue to  receive such payments in the future, we believe that Defense should  ensure it follows its own guidance and consider what other guidance is  needed.", "Our assessment found that while CSF played a key role in Pakistan\u2019s  support for our war on terror, Defense had not followed its existing  guidance and provided little oversight of the effort at the embassy in  Pakistan. Defense had concerns about the accuracy of Pakistan\u2019s claims  from the very first claim submitted in 2001. Based on the lack of  supporting evidence in the Pakistani claims from January 2004 through  June 2007 (the latest claims reimbursed by Defense), we found that neither  Defense nor we could determine if Pakistan had actually incurred most of  the costs in their claims. Prior to 2004, it appears that there was even less  evidence to support Pakistan\u2019s claims. As a result, we conclude that  Defense cannot accurately determine how much of the $5.56 billion in  costs reimbursed to Pakistan since 2001 were actually incurred.", "As a result of these and other findings, we believe that Defense should  consistently implement its own CSF guidance to fully verify Pakistani  claims and ensure the effective use of CSF in meeting key U.S. national  security goals. While we recognize that CSF is used to support 27  countries in fighting terrorism, the fact that Pakistan receives 81 percent  of these funds indicates that Defense should provide oversight procedures  that reflect the role Pakistan plays as both the major recipient of CSF and  its role in supporting U.S. national security objectives in Pakistan and  Afghanistan. Additionally, we recognize that Defense may not be able to  fully verify all Pakistani claims without having the ability to access the  Pakistani government\u2019s records and make site visits or conduct spot  checks.

These include the Pakistan\u2019s  significant contributions to the global war on terror enabled by CSF; the  fact that the Department has adhered to the law; and that Pakistan is a  sovereign country that may not meet U.S. accounting and administration  standards.

We note that the information provided by Pakistan has improved over  time, particularly when Defense has provided additional guidance to  Pakistan.  For example, following the Comptroller\u2019s visit to Pakistan in  2006, Pakistan\u2019s more detailed submissions allowed ODRP to conduct  greater oversight of Pakistan\u2019s claims, leading to the increases in deferrals  and disallows in late 2006 and 2007. In addition, we did not assume that  Pakistan could provide receipts for all items; we assessed whether  Defense followed its guidelines. According to the Comptroller\u2019s guidelines,  a recipient country\u2019s reimbursement claim must contain quantifiable  information and supporting documentation on how costs were derived so  Defense can validate the claim.
