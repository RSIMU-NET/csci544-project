A more detailed description of examples of our findings  from each case study can be found in figures 3 to 8."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conditions that Can Support Transit-Oriented Development near Selected Projects", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholders from across our case studies identified key conditions that  can support transit-oriented development, including: demand for real  estate, available land for development, supportive local residents, and a  transit line that efficiently connects to established job and activity centers.  Specifically, we found that the following conditions support transit- oriented development:", "Market demand for real estate: Market demand for real estate is  needed to support transit-oriented development. According to the  literature we reviewed and stakeholders we spoke to, demand for real  estate is driven in part by the strength of the local economy so cities  with strong local economies are more likely to support transit-oriented  development. One study has also shown that market demand is the  primary factor developers consider when determining whether to build  a transit-oriented development. For example, a developer that has  built mixed-use development projects in both Washington, DC, and  Baltimore told us that developers consider anticipated price growth  and existing housing supply when determining locations for new  development. This developer told us that consideration of these  factors has led to a pipeline of about 30,000 units in Washington,  while Baltimore only has a few thousand. Further, we observed many  new developments along the light rail in San Francisco, which had the  fastest real economic growth of the 10 largest metropolitan areas in  2012, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. While a strong  economy and demand for real estate are necessary to support transit- oriented development, they may not always be sufficient to lead to  transit-oriented development. For example, Houston had a 23 percent  job growth rate from 2003 through 2013, according to the Bureau of  Labor Statistics. While the United States had a 5 percent job growth  rate during the same period, we observed very little transit-oriented  development in Houston due to factors such as land speculation and  deed restrictions placed on land around transit.", "Large parcels of land available for development: The availability of  large amounts of land such as surface parking lots near transit  stations or underutilized industrial land can also support transit- oriented development. We have previously found that many transit  agencies view converting surface parking lots at transit stations into a  transit-oriented development as an opportunity to accomplish multiple  goals, including promoting transit-supportive land use near stations  and increasing ridership. In addition, as we have previously found,  research has shownincrease with proximity to a transit station. Underutilized industrial  land also presents an opportunity for transit-oriented development due  to the large size of industrial land parcels and the lack of neighbors to  oppose new development. For example, we visited sites in both  Charlotte and San Francisco where developers took advantage of  large parcels of previously industrial land to build transit-oriented  development.  that land and housing values generally tend to", "Resident support for transit and transit-oriented development:  Among our case study cities, San Francisco and Washington, DC,  have the highest transit ridership\u2014among the top five in the nation  according to the 2009 American Community Survey\u2014and both cities  also have historically dense development patterns. As noted above,  we observed many new developments near transit in both cities. In  addition, according to stakeholders, cities with a high concentration of  people 18 to 34 years old tend to be more supportive of transit- oriented development than other age cohorts. For example,  stakeholders from Houston; Washington, DC; San Francisco; and  Charlotte told us younger residents\u2019 desire for neighborhoods close to  amenities and their support for transit are signs that this age cohort is  supportive of transit-oriented development. These comments conform  to a national survey by the Urban Land Institute that found that the  majority of this age cohort prefers a shorter commute over a larger  home; is attracted to living in neighborhoods close to public transit,  with a mix of shops, restaurants, and offices; and shows a preference  for living in a neighborhood with a mix of housing types and a mix of  incomes.", "Efficient access to jobs and centers of activity: Transit that  efficiently connects people to established job and activity centers  provides potential for transit-oriented development. According to  planning and transit officials in Santa Clara County, to attract people  to transit, transit routes need to move from residential areas to job  centers as directly as possible. Specifically, the extent to which transit  connects people to anchor institutions,and existing mixed-use neighborhoods supports transit-oriented  development. Stakeholders cited Washington, DC\u2019s Metrorail system  as an efficient system that has been successful in supporting transit- oriented development because riders can reach a number of job and  activity centers (such as downtown Washington, DC; Rosslyn, VA;  and the Courthouse district in Arlington, VA). In San Francisco, the  first segment of the T-Third Light Rail is close to Caltrain Commuter  rail, which provides access to nearby areas with a high concentration  of technology-industry jobs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges That Can Hinder Transit-Oriented Development near Selected Projects", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholders from our case studies identified several factors that can  hinder transit-oriented development including: (1) the higher construction  cost of transit-oriented developments; (2) lenders\u2019 reluctance to finance  transit-oriented developments in some cities; (3) lengthy or discretionary  local-development approval processes; (4) an unsupportive local  population; and (5) land around transit stations that is unattractive for  development. Specifically, we found that the following challenges can  hinder transit-oriented development:", "Construction costs can be higher: Construction of transit-oriented  developments can be more costly than for traditional, single-use  developments because of the cost of mixed-use buildings and parking  garages. According to literature we reviewed and stakeholders we  spoke with, aspects of transit-oriented developments such as multiple  stories or a mix of uses can make transit-oriented developments more  costly to build than traditional developments. For example, one study  found that \u201cdifferent functions, appearance, access, and security  levels of entrances and exits for different uses can become costly  features in mixed-use projects.\u201d A national stakeholder group also  told us that the higher construction costs associated with mixed-use  buildings can inhibit small construction firms from pursuing mixed-use  projects. Some developers, transit, and planning officials noted that  transit-oriented joint development on surface parking lots at transit  stations could be hindered by the high cost of constructing  replacement parking garages. Typically, when transit agencies enter  into agreements with developers to use existing surface parking lots  for transit-oriented joint development projects, they ask developers to  pay for all or for part of a parking garage to replace the surface  parking spaces used for the development. In some cases, the cost of  constructing a replacement parking garage may hinder the  implementation of projects. For example, according to a 2012 study of  parking-garage costs in the San Francisco Bay Area, a replacement  parking garage may cost about $28,000 per space, or more than $14  million for a 500-space garage. In addition, a developer told us that  transit agencies could have design specifications for parking garages  that double the cost per parking spot compared to what he would  normally construct, cost that exacerbates the challenge of providing  replacement parking.", "Lenders may be reluctant to finance transit-oriented  development: According to the transit-oriented development  literature we reviewed and developers and others we spoke with,  some lenders are reluctant to finance transit-oriented developments  because of a perception that transit-oriented developments are riskier  than more traditional developments due to higher market risk  associated with mixed-use buildings. This reluctance may be  heightened in areas with few or no successful transit-oriented  development projects. Mixed-use developments can face market  challenges because each use must have sufficient market demand to  make the project as a whole profitable. For example, a national  interest group told us that mixing retail use with residential use adds  risk to a project because the market for retail real estate tends to be  more volatile than the market for residential use. In areas with no  successful examples of transit-oriented development, lenders may  view these projects as additionally risky, because lenders do not know  if there is local consumer demand for transit-oriented development.", "Local approval processes may add requirements or delays:  Another challenge that can hinder transit-oriented development is a  lengthy or discretionary local approval process. For example, two  national stakeholders said that developers face higher risk and more  uncertainty in developing projects when transit-oriented developments  are not in line with the zoning code for the area. In these cases, a  zoning variance is typically required from local officials, a requirement  that can make the entitlement process lengthier and more  discretionary. These stakeholders also said that when entitlement  processes are dependent on the discretion of the local officials,  developers might be unable to predict when projects will get approved  or what requirements local officials will attach to projects as conditions  of approval. Three developers in San Francisco and Charlotte told us  that if they are uncertain of the length or outcome of the entitlement  process, they might choose not to pursue projects.", "Local residents may not support transit or dense development:  Stakeholders in every city we visited told us that transit-oriented  development could face challenges when the local population is not in  favor of transit or dense residential development. Transit officials in  Baltimore and Houston reported that negative perceptions of transit  affect transit ridership and consumer demand for transit-oriented  development. Stakeholders in Baltimore told us that a social stigma  associated with public transit results in low ridership on the light rail  system. The Houston transit agency and a local developer told us that  Houston\u2019s \u201ccar culture\u201d\u2014wherein residents generally prefer to  independently travel in their own car rather than on transit\u2014is a factor  that can inhibit the appeal of transit and demand for dense living near  transit stations. Stakeholders in the San Francisco Bay Area reported  that local residents may oppose new development out of concern  about issues such as the height of buildings for dense development or  perceived decreases in quality of life due to increases in population,  traffic, and demand for parking.", "Physical features surrounding a transit station may be  undesirable for development: Stakeholders in all of our case study  areas reported that physical features such as highways, vast areas of  vacant land, blank walls, driveway entrances, or a lack of pedestrian  crossings at streets could hinder transit-oriented development. For  example, local officials in Houston told us that many stations along the  light rail system have challenges with the last 100 feet. Specifically,  there are many areas where sidewalk and ramp improvements are  needed to help better access the station. These improvements could  increase walkability and make transit-oriented development more  attractive.", "Unsupportive land uses: Land uses around transit stations that are  not supportive of high-density, mixed-use development can also  hinder transit-oriented development. For example, as discussed  previously, vacant industrial parcels of land can support transit- oriented development. However, developers, planning officials, and  other stakeholders told us that aspects of this type of land can hinder  transit-oriented development if: there is still operating \u201clegacy\u201d industry nearby that would be  noxious to residential use;  the land requires environmental clean-up;  the land requires significant physical-infrastructure investment  such as adding sidewalks or upgrading sewer capacity; or  the area lacks community infrastructure such as schools and  parks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Local Government Policies Support for Transit- Oriented Development", "paragraphs": ["Local governments can use a variety of policies to encourage transit- oriented development including zoning regulations, station area planning,  targeted infrastructure investments, and tax incentives. Stakeholders told  us that these tools most successfully support transit-oriented  development when they align with the local residents\u2019 preferences and  market demand for development. The following are examples of local  government actions to support transit-oriented development near the  projects we selected:", "Creating zoning and regulations supportive of elements of  transit-oriented development: Local governments can support  transit-oriented development by designing zoning or other regulations  to facilitate more certainty for developers proposing projects near  transit stations. According to two stakeholder organizations we spoke  with, local governments can help improve developer certainty by  developing zoning codes that specifically allow aspects of new  developments that are consistent with transit-oriented development.  According to a report we reviewed, transit-oriented development  zoning districts that allow buildings of greater unit density or fewer  parking spaces can facilitate developer certainty because the  entitlement process will likely be shorter and projects will not be  subject to a discretionary entitlement process. A developer in  Charlotte told us that the transit-oriented development district zone  made him confident that he would get his project entitled and that  absent the zone, he would not have proceeded with the project. In  some cases, policies supportive of transit-oriented development can  make projects more economically feasible. For example, cities can  allow greater height or density and require fewer parking spaces to  allow developers to increase revenue or to help offset the property  value premium that transit can generate. The City of Houston does  not have zoning, which results in a unique regulatory environment in  which the City cannot regulate land use or other building features like  most cities can. The City allows a reduction in required parking and  has implemented an optional transit-corridor ordinance that reduces  the legal setback from the street, but few developers have used either  option to date.", "Developing area plans that provide guidance and resolve  contentious issues: Local governments can also support transit- oriented development through neighborhood-scale land-use planning  activities. Among our case studies, most local governments use some  form of these plans to provide detailed direction on land use,  transportation, housing, parks and economic growth for the  development of city blocks, corridors, or neighborhoods around transit  stations. These plans typically identify gaps in city services and  resources deployed at the neighborhood level and shape capital  investment priorities, among other things. In San Francisco, planning  officials told us they not only use neighborhood plans to guide  neighborhood growth but also to create a blanket Environmental  Impact Review (EIR) that is applicable for the entire neighborhood.  According to these officials, this can reduce the cost of EIRs for each  development and also manages public participation in the EIR  process, which traditionally accounted for much of the entitlement  process delay. They noted that the Area Plan also resolves a number  of topics that can be contentious (such as density, height, parking,  and traffic congestion issues), before developers come in with specific  project plans. Developers told us that, as a result, development has  concentrated in neighborhoods with Area Plans and entitlement  processes for projects in these areas are shorter.", "According to planning and transit officials in Baltimore, Washington, DC  and Charlotte, policies designed to encourage transit-oriented  development are most successful when they are tailored to local  circumstances such as local residents\u2019 preferences and market demand.  The following are examples of such policies in our case studies:", "Responsiveness to local residents\u2019 preferences: Planning and  transit officials in Baltimore, Washington, DC, and Charlotte told us  that aligning local policies such as transit-oriented development  districts and Area Plans with the scale of the existing community may  ensure a higher level of local residents\u2019 support for transit-oriented  development. In addition, incorporating input from local residents on  issues like land use, parking, density and building height may also  help ensure their support. For example, a Baltimore planning official  told us that the City of Baltimore held numerous public meetings while  drafting their new zoning code. Due to public input, the City changed  its plans to have two transit-oriented development districts of different  densities and similar uses and instead developed four different transit- oriented development districts with varying density and use.", "Responsiveness to market demand: Planning and transit officials in  Charlotte also told us that it was important for transit-oriented  development districts and local government policies to conform to  market demand. For example, some local governments would like to  cap parking in transit-oriented zones in order to encourage transit- ridership, but city-mandated parking requirements do not always align  with consumer demand for parking and therefore the requirements  can hinder transit-oriented development. Some local governments  would like to encourage mixed-use developments near transit by  requiring retail, but two developers told us that setting aside a  minimum amount of retail space in residential buildings may not align  with demand for retail in that area because encouraging new retail  areas is very difficult. For example, a developer in San Francisco built  a mixed-use residential and retail development and the retail space  remained empty for fifteen years, until it was converted into a  live/work loft space.", "Beyond planning and zoning, local governments can also play a role in  improving connections to transit and helping mitigate environmental  challenges to transit-oriented development. Actions in these areas may  include the following, among others:", "Targeted investments in infrastructure: Local governments\u2019 efforts  to support transit-oriented development through zoning and planning  are enhanced when local governments make targeted investments in  infrastructure around transit stations. To increase the attractiveness of  transit and transit-oriented development, local governments can  support the integration of multi-modal transportation choices to take  riders to and from the transit stations. Stakeholders in San Francisco  reported that shuttle service, car-sharing, bicycle-sharing programs,  bicycle lanes, and pedestrian amenities can help move people in and  around the transit station area, thus supporting ridership and making  transit more attractive (see fig. 9).", "Tax credits for developers: In order to mitigate some of the  challenges associated with transit-oriented development on vacant  industrial land, some state governments have created programs that  provide tax credits to help developers ameliorate clean-up costs and  reduce legal liability. Stakeholders in both Baltimore and Charlotte  reported that programs in which developers receive tax credits and  reduced legal liability in exchange for providing a certain amount of  environmental clean-up on their parcels has made development on  vacant industrial land more feasible."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FTA\u2019s New Starts Assessment of Certain Factors Is Generally Consistent with Future Transit- Oriented Development", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FTA Assesses Factors That Support Transit- Oriented Development", "paragraphs": ["FTA assesses several factors that can support transit-oriented  development when reviewing transit projects for potential New Starts  funding; however, these factors make up only a small percentage of all  the factors considered.

In  addition to rating the local government\u2019s financial commitment, FTA  evaluates and rates a proposed project according to six statutory project  justification criteria including mobility improvements, environmental  benefits, congestion relief, economic development effects, land use, and  cost-effectiveness. Two of the six project-justification criteria\u2014economic  development effects and land use\u2014require documentation from project  sponsors related to whether current and future land use is supportive of  transit. To assign ratings for these criteria, FTA evaluates many of the  same factors that we found help support transit-oriented development.", "The land use criterion includes evaluation of factors such as the  development, character (including amenities such as short building  setbacks and active facades), pedestrian facilities, parking supply, and  the percentage of affordable housing in the existing corridor and station  areas compared to the percentage in the surrounding counties. Many of  the elements that support high ratings for this criterion are similar to the  elements that stakeholders we spoke with identified as supportive of  transit-oriented development. Specifically, to receive a higher rating,  project sponsors need to show, among other things, that the existing  project corridor serves a significant number of employees and densely  populated areas; has development with infrastructure such as sidewalks,  trees, crosswalks, and other pedestrian amenities; a mix of residential,  retail and professional uses; and minimal parking and thereby costly  parking (more expensive parking tends to support ridership).", "The economic development criterion includes evaluation of several  factors relating to local government policies. FTA evaluates three sub- factors within the criterion: transit-supportive plans and policies,  performance and impacts of policies, and tools to maintain or increase the  share of affordable housing in the project corridor. To assign ratings, FTA  considers many of the same plans and policies that stakeholders told us  can help support transit-oriented development. For example, FTA  considers plans and policies to enhance the transit-friendly character of  station areas, plans to improve pedestrian facilities, parking policies,  zoning ordinances that increase development density and allow for  reduced parking, and outreach and efforts to engage the development  community in station area planning. FTA also considers whether  proposed station areas have land available for development and  demonstrated cases of development affected by transit-supportive  policies and plans, policies, or incentives the local governments have in  place to maintain or increase the share of affordable housing.", "These two criteria account for one-third of the summary-project  justification rating and one-sixth of the project\u2019s overall rating. The  remaining two-thirds of the summary project-justification rating are based  on four other criteria. While these four criteria could be affected by future  transit-oriented development, they do not directly relate to the potential for  a project to support transit-oriented development:", "Mobility Improvements\u2014The total number of \u201clinked trips\u201d using the  proposed project, with a weight of two given to trips that transit- dependent persons would make with the project.", "Environmental Benefits\u2014Based upon the dollar value of the  anticipated direct and indirect benefits to human health, safety,  energy, and the air-quality environment scaled by the annualized  capital and operating cost of the project. FTA computes these benefits  based on the change in vehicle miles travelled that would result from  implementation of the proposed project.", "Cost-Effectiveness\u2014For New Starts projects cost-effectiveness is  measured by the annual capital and operating and maintenance cost  per trip on the project. The number of trips on the project is not an  incremental measure but simply total estimated trips on the project.", "Congestion Relief\u2014A new criterion introduced in MAP-21. Until FTA  undertakes a rulemaking process, FTA plans to assign a medium  rating to this criterion for all projects seeking New Starts funds.", "FTA uses either estimated ridership or the change in vehicle miles  traveled resulting from a transit project as part of the calculation for  mobility improvements, environmental benefits, and cost-effectiveness.  As discussed above, the calculation for the congestion relief criterion is  not yet defined. Transit ridership can be generated in a number of ways.  Riders can approach a transit station by car and park at the station, a  feeder bus system, or by walking from transit-oriented development or  other location near transit. These ridership forecasts may take into  account growth in population and employment in the region. While  transit-oriented development may be part of the reason for this growth,  growth could also come from broader development in the region. Benefits  and high ratings for these criteria could be driven by transit-oriented  development, but could also be driven by more auto-oriented uses.", "While FTA evaluates many of the factors or local policies that we  identified that support or hinder transit-oriented development, there are  inherent limitations in the extent to which some factors can be fully  evaluated. For example, local officials and a developer told us that the  strength of the real estate market is critical for transit-oriented  development. FTA evaluates real estate market conditions as part of the  economic development criterion; however, real estate markets for  residential, retail, and office space are cyclical and the life cycle of a  transit project planning spans many years into the future. Market  conditions could change significantly between FTA\u2019s assessment and the  beginning of transit operations. According to a transit official, FTA  evaluations are based on a snapshot of a specific moment in time that  may not necessarily be predictive of future economic or political cycles.  Similarly, development patterns and acceptance for dense, urban living  may be influenced by cultural factors that influence local resident support  for transit-oriented development. Factors such as Houston\u2019s \u201ccar culture\u201d  and housing preferences of millennials can be challenging to quantify and  evaluate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FTA\u2019s Assessment of Factors Related to Land Use and Economic Development Is Consistent with Future Transit-Oriented Development", "paragraphs": ["Among our case studies that were assessed for New Starts funding, we  found that the amount of transit-oriented development realized\u2014and the  factors that local stakeholders told us supported or hindered transit- oriented development\u2014are generally consistent with FTA\u2019s pre- construction evaluation and rating of factors related to transit-oriented  development.

For the Charlotte South Corridor light  rail project, in support of the medium-high rating, FTA cited local policies  such as the regional centers and corridors\u2019 growth strategy, the transit  overlay district, and the 2025 Integrated Land Use/Transit plan. In  addition, FTA noted that changes to policies and zoning in the South End  neighborhood had led to new buildings\u2019 being built.

Ridership at the station in 2000\u2014the first  full year it was open\u2014averaged about 4,000 riders per day. Since 2000,  many new developments were constructed on the vacant or underutilized  lots near the Columbia Heights station. Over the past 10 years, ridership  has grown about 93% to more than 12,000 riders per day. The  percentage gain in ridership for Columbia Heights has exceeded  percentage gains for the other five Green Line stations that also opened  in 1999 or 2001. Of the four stations in this group located in Prince  George\u2019s county\u2014where local officials told us there has been little or no  development\u2014three have lost ridership in the past 10 years (see fig. 11).", "Similarly, in Charlotte, the projected opening-year average ridership for  the Charlotte Light Rail system was about 9,100 riders per day. In 2008,  the first full year of operations for the system, ridership averaged 11,678  per weekday, exceeding the opening-year ridership target by about 2,500  riders (28%).
