DOE's Loan Guarantee Program (LGP), authorized by Congress in 2005, was designed to encourage certain types of energy projects (e.g., nuclear, solar, and wind generation; solar manufacturing; and energy transmission) by agreeing to reimburse lenders for the guaranteed amount of loans if the borrowers default. DOE's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) loan program, authorized by Congress in 2007, was designed to encourage the automotive industry to invest in technologies to produce more fuel-efficient vehicles and their components. In 2007, 2008, and 2010\u2014which covered the early stages of the LGP\u2014GAO made 15 recommendations to address numerous concerns where DOE had moved forward with that program before key elements were in place. For example, in its February 2007 report, GAO found that DOE's actions had focused on expediting program implementation\u2014such as soliciting preapplications for loan guarantees\u2014rather than ensuring the department had in place the critical policies, procedures, and mechanisms needed to better ensure the program's success. DOE has implemented 11 of the 15 recommendations. In 2011, 2012, and 2014, as Congress expanded the loan programs, GAO made 9 additional recommendations to address concerns about DOE making loans and disbursing funds without having sufficient engineering expertise, sufficient and quantifiable performance measures for assessing program progress, or a fully developed loan monitoring function, among other things. Although DOE generally agreed with most of the 9 recommendations, to date it has implemented only 4 of them.", "In an April 2015 report, GAO found that DOE estimated the credit subsidy costs of the loans and loan guarantees in its portfolio\u2014that is, the total expected net cost to the government over the life of the loans\u2014to be about $2.2 billion as of November 2014, including about $807 million for five loans on which borrowers had defaulted. The estimated $2.2 billion in credit subsidy costs was a decrease from DOE's initial estimates totaling about $4.5 billion. GAO found that changes in credit subsidy cost estimates varied by loan program and the type of technology supported by the loans and loan guarantees, among other factors. Specifically, defaults on loan guarantees for two solar manufacturing projects and one energy storage project were largely responsible for an increase in the credit subsidy cost estimate for the LGP's portfolio from $1.33 billion when the loan guarantees were issued to $1.81 billion as of November 2014. Borrowers also defaulted on two ATVM loans, but the credit subsidy cost estimate for the ATVM loan program's portfolio decreased from $3.16 billion to $404 million as of November 2014, mainly because of a significant improvement in the credit rating of one loan. In DOE's portfolio, 21 of the 30 projects had guaranteed revenue streams provided for under a long-term contract, such as a power purchase agreement, but none of the five defaulted loans supported projects with such a contract. GAO also found that administrative costs of the loan programs totaled about $312 million from fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2014; these costs are not included in credit subsidy costs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Department of Energy\u2019s  (DOE) loan programs. The Loan Guarantee Program (LGP), authorized  by Congress in 2005, was designed to encourage investment in new or  significantly improved technologies in energy projects because funding for  such technologies can be difficult to obtain. Similarly, the Advanced  Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) loan program, which  Congress authorized in 2007, was designed to encourage the  automotive industry to invest in new technologies for more fuel-efficient  passenger vehicles and their components. Congress has authorized DOE  to make tens of billions of dollars in loans and guarantees under these  programs. Congress has also appropriated billions of dollars to cover  associated credit subsidy costs\u2014the net present value of the difference  between projected cash flows to and from the government over the life of  the loans or guarantees.

Other entities,  including Congress and the public, rely on this information to weigh the  benefits of these programs, but the complexity of this information can lead  to confusion if users of this information are not aware of the context. For  example, DOE reported in November 2014 that the loan programs had  earned more than $810 million in interest and that DOE expected to earn  $5 billion in interest payments over the life of the loans and loan  guarantees. However, in part because this report did not include the  interest that DOE pays the government to finance its lending, the  information on expected interest earnings has been misinterpreted in  several media accounts as projecting $5 billion in profits for the DOE loan  programs. We have examined this and other issues related to DOE\u2019s loan  programs in a series of reports and testimonies. (See a list of related  GAO products at the end of this statement.)", "My testimony today draws on this body of work, in which we have  reported on our concerns about DOE\u2019s implementation and oversight of  the programs and recommended actions for improvement.

The work on which this statement is based was conducted in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

The LGP was  originally designed to address a fundamental impediment to innovative  and advanced energy projects: securing funding. Projects that entail  risks\u2014either that new technology will not perform as expected or that the  borrower or project itself will not perform as expected\u2014can face difficulty  securing enough affordable financing to survive the period between  development and commercialization of innovative technologies. Because  the risks that commercial lenders must assume to support new  technologies can put the cost of private financing out of reach, companies  may not be able to commercialize innovative technologies without the  federal government\u2019s financial support.", "To accurately account for the expected and actual costs of federal loan  programs, agencies estimate the costs of a program in accordance with  the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 by calculating credit subsidy costs  for loans and loan guarantees, excluding administrative costs. DOE  estimates the credit subsidy cost for each loan or loan guarantee by,  among other things, projecting disbursements to the borrower as well as  interest and principal repayments from the borrower, and adjusting these  projected cash flows for the risk of default and other factors. Paying the  credit subsidy cost is either the responsibility of the borrower or the  program, depending on whether Congress has provided appropriations to  cover such costs.", "For the LGP, Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct)\u2014 specifically section 1703\u2014authorized DOE to guarantee loans for energy  projects that (1) use new or significantly improved technologies as  compared with commercial technologies already in service in the United  States and (2) avoid, reduce, or sequester emissions of air pollutants or  man-made greenhouse gases. Congress provided DOE $34 billion in loan  guarantee authority for section 1703 loan guarantees. Initially, Congress  provided no appropriation to cover the credit subsidy costs of loan  guarantees under section 1703, requiring all borrowers receiving a loan  guarantee to pay to offset the credit subsidy costs of their own projects. In  February 2009, Congress passed the American Recovery and  Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act), which amended Title XVII by  adding section 1705, under which DOE could guarantee loans for projects  using existing commercial technologies. For section 1705, the Recovery  Act provided $2.5 billion to cover credit subsidy costs, which DOE  estimated would suffice to cover those costs for about $18 billion in loan  guarantees. In April 2011, Congress appropriated $170 million to pay  credit subsidy costs for a subset of projects under section 1703,  specifically, energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. DOE  estimated this appropriation would cover those costs for about $848  million in loan guarantees. As table 1 shows, DOE had about $28.7 billion  remaining in loan guarantee authority under section 1703 as of November  2014. At that time, it also had three open solicitations for loan guarantee  applications that accounted for much of that remaining authority. The  ATVM loan program remains open to applications on a rolling basis and  had about $16 billion remaining in loan authority as of November 2014."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Has Made Efforts to Improve Loan Program Implementation and Oversight by Implementing Some but Not All Related GAO Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["DOE has made efforts to improve its loan program implementation and  oversight and, to date, has taken actions in response to 15 of our 24 prior  recommendations. (See app. I for details on the status of each of the 24  recommendations we have made concerning the DOE loan programs). In  2007, 2008, and 2010\u2014which covered the early stages of the LGP\u2014we  made 15 recommendations to address numerous issues where DOE had  moved forward with the program before key elements were in place.  DOE implemented 11 of our 15 recommendations from this period. For  example:  In our February 2007 report, we found that DOE\u2019s actions had  focused on expediting program implementation\u2014such as soliciting  preapplications for loan guarantees\u2014rather than ensuring the  department had in place the critical policies, procedures, and  mechanisms necessary to better ensure the program\u2019s success.  We made five recommendations addressing these concerns. DOE  agreed with and implemented all 5 of these recommendations by  establishing key policies and procedures and issuing final program  regulations, among other things.", "In contrast, in our July 2010 report, we found that, among other  things, DOE had favored some applicants by, for example,  deviating from its stated review procedures. DOE did not concur  with\u2014and has not taken actions to address\u2014our recommendation  that it take steps to ensure that its implementation of the LGP  treats applicants consistently.", "As Congress expanded the DOE loan programs to include 1705 projects  and ATVM, we issued additional reports in 2011, 2012, and 2014  highlighting our concerns about DOE making loans and disbursing funds  without having sufficient expertise and performance measures, among  other things. Our reports included recommendations to address these  issues from February 2011 through May 2014. To date, DOE has  implemented four of the nine recommendations but has not addressed  the remaining five. For example:  In February 2011, we found that DOE was using ATVM staff with  largely financial, and not technical, expertise to evaluate the  progress of projects to produce more fuel-efficient passenger  vehicles and their components. We recommended that DOE  accelerate efforts to engage sufficient engineering expertise to  verify that borrowers are delivering projects as required by the  loan agreements. DOE implemented our recommendation by  changing its budgeting practices for monitoring ATVM loans to  better ensure that funds would be available to engage  independent engineering expertise; DOE also changed its policy  for engaging technical expertise to align with the Title XVII LGP  policy.  \uf0a7  Also in our February 2011 report, we found that DOE did not  have sufficient performance measures that would enable the  department to fully assess whether the ATVM program had  achieved its program goals, including protecting taxpayers\u2019  financial interests. We recommended that DOE develop sufficient  and quantifiable performance measures for its program goals.  DOE disagreed with this recommendation and took no steps to  implement it. As a result, Congress does not have important  information on whether the funds DOE has spent so far are  furthering the program\u2019s goals and, consequently, whether the  program warrants continued support.", "DOE generally agreed with most of the additional recommendations we  made in our March 2012 and May 2014 reports as the programs  expanded, but it has not fully implemented them. For example, in May  2014 we found that DOE adhered to its monitoring policies inconsistently  or not at all because the Loan Programs Office was still developing its  organizational structure, including its staffing. We recommended that  DOE fully develop its organizational structure by staffing key loan  monitoring positions, among other things. DOE agreed and has taken  steps to identify key staffing positions but, as of February 2016, most of  these positions remain unfilled. Filling these positions would help DOE  carry out activities critical to monitoring these loans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Estimated Net Costs of DOE\u2019s Loan Programs Include about $2.2 Billion in Credit Subsidy Costs, Plus Administrative Expenses", "paragraphs": ["In our April 2015 report, we found that DOE estimated the credit subsidy  costs of the loans and loan guarantees in its portfolio to be about $2.2  billion as of November 2014, including about $807 million for five loans  on which the borrowers had defaulted. At that time, the portfolio consisted  of 34 loans and loan guarantees in support of 30 projects in a diverse  array of technologies. We also found that administrative costs totaled  about $312 million from fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2014.  The estimated $2.2 billion in credit subsidy costs was a decrease from  initial DOE estimates totaling about $4.5 billion, and we found that  changes in credit subsidy cost estimates varied by loan program and the  type of technology supported by the loans and loan guarantees, and by  other factors, such as the availability of a steady stream of revenue for a  project.

None of the projects with loans in default had  revenue streams that were provided for under long-term contracts for the  sale of energy produced by the project pursuant to a power purchase  agreement, offtake agreement, or similar contractual language. Power  purchase agreements and offtake agreements generally guarantee a  stream of revenue to the project owner for 20 or 25 years after the project  begins generating electricity, effectively ensuring a buyer for the produced  power. In DOE\u2019s portfolio, 21 of the 30 projects supported by the program  included power purchase or offtake agreements.", "Regarding administrative costs, our April 2015 report found that such  costs for the programs have totaled about $312 million from fiscal year  2008 through fiscal year 2014, including approximately $251.6 million for  LGP and $60.6 million for the ATVM loan program. We also found that,  for the LGP, the fees DOE has collected have not been sufficient to cover  all of its administrative expenses for the program, in part because the  maintenance fees on the current loan guarantees were too low to cover  ongoing monitoring costs. As a result, some of the administrative  expenses have been paid with taxpayer funds. DOE addressed the low  maintenance fee levels by changing the fee structure in its new  solicitations, announced from December 2013 to December 2014, to  allow increased maintenance fees\u2014up to $500,000 per year. DOE  officials told us that the new fee structure should allow DOE to cover a  greater portion of LGP monitoring costs on new loan guarantees.  However, the actual fee amounts will depend on the individual loan  guarantees and negotiation of the loan guarantee agreements, making  predictions of future fee income a challenge. It is now too early to tell  whether DOE\u2019s actions will result in sufficient funds to offset LGP\u2019s future  administrative costs.", "Chairmen Weber and Loudermilk, Ranking Members Grayson and Beyer,  and Members of the Subcommittees, this completes my prepared  statement.
