On the basis of sentencing reform options identified by experts and actions by the Attorney General, GAO developed a list of policy options that could reduce BOP's population.

Specifically, on the basis of GAO's analysis of BOP's fiscal year 2013 obligations of approximately $6.6 billion, BOP obligated the largest share\u2014about $3.9 billion, or 59 percent\u2014for personnel compensation and benefits. Further, BOP has undertaken a number of initiatives, such as renegotiated contracts, to achieve cost savings of about $61 million over the last 3 years.", "BOP has designed internal processes to identify opportunities for additional cost efficiencies, but could improve the monitoring of corrective actions to achieve them. For example, BOP focuses on cost efficiency and innovation in its strategic plan and has developed mechanisms for staff to share information on best practices and cost savings efforts. BOP also employs an internal control system with processes, such as program reviews, that allows it to identify opportunities for cost efficiencies. However, when program reviews repeatedly cited frequent deficiencies or significant findings that could increase costs\u2014such as insufficient contract monitoring\u2014responsible BOP Central Office divisions did not provide specifics or documentation for how they always monitor the effectiveness of corrective actions to prevent the same deficiency or issue from reoccurring. Establishing a mechanism for relevant Central Office divisions to consistently monitor the progress of bureau-wide corrective actions in the presence of repeated frequent deficiencies or significant findings could help BOP better ensure that it is resolving such deficiencies or issues promptly and, ultimately, operating more efficiently.", "BOP's current authorities to reduce inmate sentence length result in limited cost savings, but potential actions outside of its authority could have a greater impact on costs. GAO has reported previously on BOP authorities to reduce inmate sentences, and thus its costs, in detail, and found that inmate eligibility for certain programs and lack of capacity affect BOP's use of them. For example, greater use of programs such as Compassionate Release for terminally ill inmates could reduce sentences, but cost savings relative to BOP's budget would be small\u2014about $651,000 in 2013. Additional opportunities outside of BOP's authority, including those requiring legislative or executive action, such as options to reduce sentence length, could reduce BOP's population, and thus potentially significantly reduce its costs. For example, an option to reduce sentences of incarcerated drug offenders by an average of 44 percent could save about $4.1 billion. Potential savings could be even higher if the changes sufficiently reduced the inmate population to allow BOP to reduce its staff or close facilities. Expert entities GAO consulted reported that all of the options GAO reviewed also have advantages and disadvantages unrelated to costs that should be taken into consideration, such as potential effects on public safety if released inmates reoffend. GAO is not taking a position on any of these options, but presents information on estimated cost savings and experts' views of advantages and disadvantages for such options to inform policymakers as they weigh whether and how to address rising costs at BOP."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that BOP establish a mechanism to consistently monitor if bureau-wide corrective actions address repeated deficiencies and findings.

For  instance, we found that officials from the Central Office Divisions with  oversight over the repeated frequent deficiencies and significant findings  that we analyzed\u2014the Human Resource Management Division (HRMD),  Health Services Division (HSD), and Reentry Services Division (RSD)\u2014 were aware of them.", "Moreover, one of the divisions, HRMD, formulated a corrective action  plan and has systematically taken steps to address and monitor progress  toward resolving reported deficiencies and findings related to time and  attendance that were identified at multiple institutions across multiple time  periods. For instance, BOP\u2019s program reviews identified control issues  related to time and attendance in 14 of the 20 quarters from 2009 through  2013, such as inaccurate time and attendance records and the lack of  appropriate documentation to support payment. These reported issues  could lead to payment errors, such as incorrectly compensating staff for  overtime. HRMD officials reported that, as a result of these issues, they  implemented policy changes, such as developing mandatory training and  requiring that each human resource office audit a representative sample  of its time and attendance files annually. Further, BOP is currently  transitioning to a web-based time and attendance reporting system, which  includes information technology controls. Such information technology  controls establish segregation of duties (e.g., the staff approving reported  work hours is supervisory and different from the staff reporting the hours  worked) and the retention of electronic records in compliance with rules  and regulations, which officials report could help address the deficiencies.  To consistently monitor progress toward resolving these issues bureau- wide, BOP\u2019s Central Office has conducted a number of audits of time and  attendance records and reports that error rates in record accuracy have  declined from about 5 percent in 2010 to less than 2 percent in 2014.", "The other two Central Office divisions with oversight over the repeated  frequent deficiencies and significant findings that we analyzed\u2014HSD and  RSD\u2014have taken actions at the national level to attempt to address  some of the deficiencies. However, they did not provide specifics or  documentation for how the divisions would monitor progress toward  correcting them. With respect to HSD, BOP\u2019s internal reviews identified  findings related to the administration and management of resources in its  Food Services Program (constituting $408 million, or 6 percent, of BOP\u2019s  obligations in fiscal year 2013) in 8 of the 20 quarters from 2009 through  2013, such as incomplete inventories; not properly reporting lost,  damaged, or stolen property; or failures to adjust inventory records  referenced when formulating and submitting an institution\u2019s budget. At the  national level, BOP is providing training on the use of the Food Services  Program\u2019s information system that includes a quarterly inventory control  function, and has formed support teams to provide assistance to  institutions identified as having deficient programs. For the staff  performing inventory control at the local level (e.g., warehouse staff), the  division is requesting that they attend national training or a similar training  program. However, HSD did not provide specifics or documentation for  establishing a mechanism that would allow it to monitor whether the  actions taken have produced needed improvements within Food Services  comprehensively across institutions.", "With respect to RSD, BOP\u2019s internal review identified findings related to  RRC contract oversight and monitoring (RRC contracts constituting $296  million, or 4 percent, of BOP\u2019s obligations in fiscal year 2013) in 6 of 20  quarters from 2009 through 2013, such as monitoring reports not being  completed on a timely basis and inaccurate payments being made to  contractors. These reported issues could result in failing to address  contractor performance or overpayments. In July 2013, Residential  Reentry Management (RRM) offices nationwide were consolidated under  the direct management of the Residential Reentry Management Branch  (RRMB). Previously, the RRM field offices were under the operational  control of the six BOP regional offices. According to BOP, this  reorganization has allowed BOP to implement and monitor consistent  practices throughout the Residential Reentry offices. BOP also reported  that, as a result of these findings, management teams within the  Residential Reentry Management Branch provide guidance to individual  field offices that require corrective actions. Additionally, they have  scheduled a national-level training session in September 2014 to address  repeated frequent deficiencies, share best practices in contract  monitoring, and promote consistency and effective oversight of RRCs.  Similar to Food Services, however, RSD did not provide specifics or  documentation for establishing a mechanism that would allow it to monitor  whether the actions taken have produced needed improvements with the  Residential Reentry Program comprehensively across RRC contracts.", "Internal control standards state that monitoring of internal controls should  include policies and procedures for ensuring that the findings of audits  and other reviews are promptly resolved. In particular, managers are to  promptly evaluate findings from audits and other reviews, including those  showing deficiencies and recommendations reported by auditors who  evaluate agencies\u2019 operations; determine proper actions in response to  findings and recommendations from audits and reviews; and complete,  within established time frames, all actions that correct or otherwise  resolve the matters brought to management\u2019s attention. According to the  standards, the resolution is completed only after action that corrects  identified deficiencies, produces improvements, or demonstrates the  findings and recommendations do not warrant management action.", "For deficiencies and other findings associated with a particular institution,  BOP has a mechanism to monitor corrective actions at the individual  institution to help ensure that the deficiencies and findings do not reoccur  at that specific location. Specifically, according to BOP, the responsible  official of the entity reviewed (most often the warden of the institution) is  responsible for developing and implementing the corrective action, and  PRD monitors that specific institution\u2019s progress in implementing the  corrective action. However, with respect to frequent deficiencies and  significant findings across a number of institutions repeatedly reported  over time, BOP did not provide specifics or documentation for  establishing a mechanism to consistently monitor bureau-wide corrective  actions to determine whether they are achieving desired results and  helping to prevent similar deficiencies from occurring at different  institutions over time. We found that in at least one instance in which  deficiencies were repeatedly found across a number of institutions\u2014 HRMD\u2019s process for resolving deficiencies associated with time and  attendance\u2014a Central Office division did successfully take steps to  consistently monitor the deficiencies bureau-wide. Specifically, for the  repeated frequent deficiencies and significant findings associated with  time and attendance, we found that HRMD\u2019s process for implementing  and monitoring its corrective actions has resulted in fewer errors and  stronger internal controls related to record retention and segregation of  duties, which could reduce the risk of erroneous payments, thereby  providing BOP with greater assurance that it is operating more efficiently  with regard to its staff costs across its many institutions.", "However, despite the repeated nature and recency of findings within the  Food Services and Residential Reentry Programs, the relevant Central  Office divisions did not provide specifics or documentation for how they  have monitored their corrective actions to assess their progress toward  addressing these findings across BOP institutions. As a result, BOP does  not have reasonable assurance that actions taken are preventing certain  frequent and significant findings from reoccurring at other institutions,  thus hindering BOP\u2019s ability to achieve cost efficiencies in these two high- cost areas\u2014accounting for spending of $408 million and $296.1 million in  fiscal year 2013, respectively. By establishing a mechanism for relevant  Central Office divisions to consistently monitor bureau-wide corrective  actions and assess their progress in the presence of repeated frequent  deficiencies or significant findings reported across multiple institutions,  BOP could be better assured that it is resolving such deficiencies  promptly and, ultimately, operating more efficiently. Further, although  repeated frequent deficiencies and significant findings related to  operational effectiveness and compliance-related issues were outside the  scope of our review, such a mechanism would also better position BOP to  resolve repeated deficiencies and significant findings in these areas."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Authorities within BOP\u2019s Control to Reduce Costs Are Limited; Options outside of BOP\u2019s Authority Could Have a Larger Impact on Costs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "BOP\u2019s Current Authority to Reduce Inmate Sentences Results in Limited Cost Savings Relative to Its Overall Budget", "paragraphs": ["See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4102. reduce the length of the inmate\u2019s sentence, based on inmate \u201cgood  conduct time (GCT);\u201d determine the eligibility of an offender for participation in a substance  abuse program (which may result in a sentence reduction of up to 1  year); and  transfer an inmate out of prison to serve the remainder of his or her  sentence in a residential reentry center or in home detention.", "Table 3 describes key statutory provisions in which BOP has a role in  reducing a federal prisoner\u2019s period of incarceration in a BOP institution.", "Of these authorities, two\u2014IPTP and Compassionate Release\u2014are  programs that can result in a direct reduction of BOP\u2019s population and  thus cost savings. The number of inmates released through these two  programs annually is small, however, as are the estimated savings. For  example, the estimated 2013 cost savings from these programs were  about $2.6 million and $651,000, respectively, or about 0.04 and about  0.01 percent of BOP\u2019s total fiscal year 2013 appropriations of $6.44  billion.", "IPTP. As of June 28, 2014, BOP had about 54,000 foreign nationals in  its custody. However, eligibility criteria constrain the number who can  be transferred. Specifically, inmates must voluntarily request a  transfer to their home countries to serve out the remainder of their  sentences, the United States must have a treaty with the home  country permitting repatriation, eligibility for transfer must be  confirmed by BOP, the transfer request must be approved by DOJ\u2019s  Office of Enforcement Operations, and the home country must agree  to receive the prisoner. Further, while the United States has treaties  with 94 foreign countries to permit IPTP transfers, the DOJ Inspector  General (IG) reported that, as of 2010, about 22 percent of the foreign  nationals in BOP come from countries with which there is no transfer  agreement. In addition, as of late June 2014, almost 37,400 (17.3  percent) of all BOP inmates were Mexican nationals (or about 70  percent of all BOP foreign nationals). However, since 2001, Mexico  has restricted eligibility for transfer from the United States, according  to a 2011 DOJ IG report.", "In fiscal year 2013, DOJ approved 245 transfers out of BOP custody,  representing less than 0.5 percent of BOP\u2019s foreign national population.  Through these transfers, BOP estimates that it avoided costs of  approximately $2.6 million in fiscal year 2013, or about 0.04 percent of  BOP\u2019s fiscal year 2013 $6.44 billion appropriation.", "Compassionate Release. We have previously reported on BOP\u2019s  discretionary authority to request compassionate release for certain  offenders\u2014termed \u201creduction in sentence\u201d by BOP\u2014and found that  BOP used this authority infrequently because of, among other things,  BOP\u2019s eligibility criteria. Specifically, compassionate release of an  inmate historically has been limited by BOP to terminally ill patients  with an incurable disease and short life expectancy or to those who  are elderly with a profoundly debilitating medical condition. In April  2013, the DOJ IG reported that the existing BOP compassionate  release program had been poorly managed and implemented  inconsistently, likely resulting in eligible inmates not being considered  for release and in terminally ill inmates dying before their requests  were decided. No cost savings estimate could be provided for earlier  releases because, according to the IG report, BOP did not maintain  cost data associated with the custody of inmates eligible for  consideration under the program, and BOP had not conducted any  analysis of cost savings achieved by releasing such inmates.", "DOJ issued a revised program statement with less restrictive criteria for  compassionate release in August 2013. The revisions included making  terminally ill inmates with a life expectancy of up to 18 months eligible for  consideration instead of maintaining the previous 12-month limit.", "According to BOP data, total releases under compassionate release  increased from 29 inmates in calendar year 2011 to 39 in calendar year  2012, and to 61 in calendar year 2013 (including 11 released under the  expanded criteria). An additional 2 had been released as of July 2014  under expanded nonmedical criteria. However, as a percentage of BOP\u2019s  population and costs, the number of affected inmates and savings  remains small given the numerous factors involved in determining  eligibility. Inmates released under compassionate release in calendar  year 2013 represented about 0.03 percent of the total BOP inmate  population, and estimated savings from the releases amounted to about  $651,000, or about 0.01 percent of BOP\u2019s fiscal year 2013 $6.44 billion  appropriation.", "Funding and eligibility constraints also limit BOP\u2019s use of RDAP and  RRCs to affect costs related to the number of inmates in BOP custody.  Some cost savings can result from inmates being able to reduce their  sentences as a result of successfully completing the RDAP program;  however, both RDAP and RRCs are types of rehabilitation programs  intended to reduce recidivism rather than serving as cost-saving  mechanisms. professional staff and resources, increasing the number of offender  participants in either would require additional funding that could offset  potential cost savings.", "RDAP participation is limited to prisoners with a verifiable substance use disorder within  the 12 months prior to their arrest. They must also voluntarily apply for participation and  be approved by BOP for the program. RRCs are run by private contractors and cost more  than minimum security institutions, and about the same as low- or medium-security BOP  prisons on an annual basis per offender. We reported daily costs per prisoner previously  in GAO-12-320 as follows: $70.79 for RRCs, $57.55 for minimum security, $69.53 for low  security, and $71.91 for medium security. average participant reduced his or her sentence by about 10 months  in fiscal year 2013.", "As we have also previously concluded, increasing RDAP participation  would cost more than the potential savings from reducing sentences by  relatively small amounts. For example, if every eligible RDAP participant  who completed the program in fiscal year 2011 had received his or her  maximum sentence reduction, BOP would have been responsible for  15,729 fewer months of inmate incarceration, yielding an estimated cost  savings of about $13.2 million. However, the fiscal year 2012 request for  an additional $15 million to permit more offenders to enter RDAP \u201con  time\u201d and thereby to increase their allowable sentence reductions would  not have been enough to achieve the full 12-month potential reduction,  meaning that expanding RDAP would have cost at least $1.8 million more  than it would have saved. Similarly, according to DOJ, BOP received an  increase of $15 million in RDAP funding in fiscal year 2014 and this  funding will, by fiscal year 2016, increase the average sentence reduction  for RDAP participants from 10 months in fiscal year 2013 to an estimated  11.5 months. BOP reported that reaching the full potential 12-month  sentence reduction for all participants in fiscal year 2013 would have  resulted in about $11 million in cost avoidance savings, but it did not  provide a calculation of the cost of providing additional spaces and staff to  permit the full sentence reduction for all participants.", "These cost savings estimates do not take into account potential long-term  savings to society from reducing substance abuse and recidivism among  released inmates. While RDAP may contribute to achieving such savings,  expanding it above current levels requires an up-front cost that exceeds  its potential cost savings for BOP in the short term.", "RRCs. According to BOP, RRCs, or halfway houses, provide  programs that are intended to help inmates rebuild their ties to the  community and to thereby reduce the likelihood that they will  recidivate. Run by private contractors, RRCs provide programs that  help offenders find employment, and coordinate the provision of  services to address substance abuse, medical, and mental health  care with appropriate community providers. We have previously found  that the use of RRCs is constrained by both eligibility criteria and  funding. For example, inmates with detainers (other crimes for which  they were charged but were not yet sentenced), with sentences of 6  months or less, or who are in civil commitment status are all ineligible  for RRC placement. In addition, BOP officials stated that objections  from local communities to halfway houses in residential  neighborhoods have hindered expanding the RRC program, even  when funds were available.", "We have previously found that not all inmates are eligible to be sent to an  RRC prior to their release from prison, and that for those who are eligible,  some spend only a portion of the full 12 months\u2019 allowable time in an  RRC because of a lack of bed space and because of eligibility criteria. According to BOP, an increase in the number of offenders getting the full  12 months\u2019 allowable time would necessitate additional bed space, which  would require both additional funding and additional RRC contracts. For  example, in fiscal year 2013, BOP reported that it had 9,455 RRC beds  available nationwide, but would have required about 30,000 beds to  provide the maximum allowable 12 months in RRCs to all participants, or  an addition of more than 20,500 beds above its current capacity. As noted  above, and as we have previously reported, BOP officials explained that  such an expansion could be challenged by local zoning restrictions and  the unwillingness of many communities to accept nearby RRCs.  Moreover, if such an expansion were to take place, BOP would need  additional funding to pay for the new RRC bed space. For fiscal year  2013, BOP reports that the average daily cost per offender in an RRC  was about $73, or $26,645 per year. This means that an increase of the  more than 20,500 beds that would be required to achieve the allowable  12 months for all participants (at current program levels) would cost about  $546 million annually.but would require a substantial funding increase, equal to almost 8  percent of BOP\u2019s entire $6.9 billion fiscal year 2015 budget request."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Actions outside of BOP\u2019s Authority Could Reduce Prison Populations and Costs, and Experts Say There Are Advantages and Disadvantages to These Options", "paragraphs": ["We examined cost-saving options that are outside BOP\u2019s authority and  that are widely discussed among criminal justice policy experts, the  USSC, and DOJ, such as instructing federal prosecutors to decline to  charge certain defendants in certain drug cases in such a manner as to  trigger mandatory minimum prison sentences, reducing the lengths of  sentences specified by federal guidelines for drug offenders, or applying  the provisions of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 retroactively in order to  provide sentences for cocaine base (\u201ccrack\u201d) offenders that are less   Toward  disparate from those applied for possession of powder cocaine.this end, we reviewed selected reports and analyses from entities chosen  for their expertise in criminal justice issues, and had discussions with  officials from DOJ, BOP, and the USSC. See appendix VI for more  information on the entities we selected. Through this review, we identified  eight options outside BOP\u2019s authority that could reduce the size of the  inmate population. These involve potential legislative actions by  Congress, executive orders by the President, policy changes  implemented by the Attorney General, or changes in sentencing  guidelines that could be promulgated by the USSC. For each of these  options, we asked the USSC to calculate the estimated impact on the size  of BOP\u2019s population and the potential savings that could result from  implementation of each.  See appendix VII for the USSC analyses of  these options. For the purposes of our analysis, we determined that the  USSC is an authoritative source for conducting such analysis; it has  conducted similar analyses in recent years and published one on its   For each option, the time frame (number of  website on July 25, 2014.years) over which the option would take effect may vary, as well as the  number and type of offenders who would be eligible for a changed  sentence under the option. In general, the majority of the impact of most  options was estimated by the USSC to occur within 5 or 6 years of  implementation. However, the options are not all directly comparable;  some would have a greater impact more quickly than would others,  depending on the option and the number of potentially eligible offenders.  For options that apply only prospectively (that is, only to future  offenders)\u2014such as the Attorney General\u2019s August 2013 memorandum to  U.S. Attorneys\u2014the potential impact is typically less than for options that  would apply to larger numbers of currently incarcerated offenders.", "On the basis of analyses the USSC conducted of the potential results  from implementing each of the eight options, which provided estimates of  bed year savings, we then calculated the potential cost savings.  Implementation of the options could range from about $8.7 million to  almost $4.1 billion, with the potential savings varying based on the option  implemented and the duration of the option. Cost savings or cost  avoidance savings were calculated using BOP\u2019s fiscal year 2014  estimated average annual marginal cost of approximately $11,000.  Marginal costs covers such things as security, food, medical care,  clothing, unit management, education, records, and maintenance  associated with additional inmates entering existing BOP facilities. BOP  officials stated that calculating cost savings using marginal cost was more  appropriate than using per capita costs because BOP is about 36 percent  overcrowded system-wide, and therefore BOP would have to reduce its  existing population by that percentage (equal to about 78,000 offenders in  July 2014) to eliminate overcrowding system-wide. Until that number is  reached, BOP officials stated, they would not be closing existing prisons  and therefore would expect savings only in marginal costs versus  average per capita costs to be realized. However, the use of marginal  cost in calculating savings does not take into account the possibility that  reductions in BOP population could permit BOP to reduce the numbers of  offenders sufficiently to reduce staff, close some existing facilities, or  avoid opening additional ones that would otherwise have been required. If  the options achieved population reductions resulting in reductions in fixed  costs, such as reducing staff or closing existing prisons, calculating cost  savings using average annual per capita costs\u2014$29,291 in fiscal year  2013, according to BOP\u2014would be appropriate. Three of the options  could result in an estimated 78,000 or more offenders being eligible for  release or eligible for sentence reductions over five years, which could  greatly reduce or eliminate current overcrowding based on BOP\u2019s  estimate within the same 5 years. Given the size of these potential  reductions in sentence lengths and the number of eligible offenders, we  calculated per capita cost savings for three of these options, based on the  USSC estimates for saved bed years. We did not calculate per capita  savings for a fourth option\u2014changing the way that BOP calculates the  amount of \u201cgood conduct\u201d time that offenders earn for each year served\u2014 because although the number of eligible inmates would be almost  180,000, the reduction in sentence for each inmate would be small in  contrast to the other three options and would occur over 30 or more  years. Therefore, this option may be less likely to allow BOP to reduce  staffing levels or close facilities.", "It is important to emphasize cost savings is one of many considerations.  In particular, these options may have additional effects, such as on public  safety. The expert entities we contacted identified potential advantages  and disadvantages they believe could result from the implementation of  each option, such as making sentences more commensurate with the  crime or releasing inmates who may reoffend.", "We are not taking a position on any of these options. We present the  information we obtained from the USSC and the expert entities to inform  policymakers as they weigh whether and how to address costs at BOP.  Specifically, in table 4, we summarize each option we presented to the  USSC, expert entities, and the four states selected because of their  experience with criminal justice sentencing initiatives. For each option, we  show the USSC estimate of the number of BOP offenders who would  likely be eligible for release or for a reduced sentence (leading to release)  as a result of implementation. The table also shows the USSC estimates,  if available, of the bed year savings that would result from implementation  of each option, and our calculation of the cost savings that would result.In addition, we summarize the comments from the responding states and  the expert entities with regard to potential advantages and disadvantages  that could result from implementing these options.", "As the Attorney General has noted, without action to reduce the current  size of BOP\u2019s population, and projected future growth, BOP will continue  to require an ever greater share of DOJ\u2019s budget, having increased from  about 14 percent of that budget in 1980 to nearly 25 percent in the fiscal  year 2015 request. As table 4 shows, a number of options outside of  BOP\u2019s current authority exist by which the sentence lengths of  prospective and incarcerated offenders could be reduced (producing bed  year savings), as well as the number of offenders to be incarcerated,  such as under the Attorney General\u2019s August 2013 Smart on Crime  direction (option 3). Hence, BOP\u2019s costs could be reduced, but the range  of potential savings from these options is great. As illustrated in table 4,  actual savings are greater for options that apply to current offenders  compared with those that apply only prospectively. For example,  retroactively reducing drug sentences by about 44 percent (option 1)  would have the greatest estimated cost savings: $4.1 billion using  marginal cost savings, or $11.626 billion if per capita savings were to  occur. Other options would have a lesser impact, such as avoiding  charging future low-level, nonviolent drug offenders with charges that  result in mandatory minimum sentences, which could be a savings of $8.7  million in marginal costs over 5 years (option 3). However, as discussed  earlier, cost savings is one of many considerations in weighing which, if  any, option could be adopted. Equally important is consideration of the  advantages and disadvantages associated with each option."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["According to BOP officials, BOP\u2019s biggest challenges are managing the  continually increasing federal inmate population while providing for  inmates\u2019 care and safety, as well as the safety of BOP staff and  surrounding communities, within budgeted levels.

Toward  that end, BOP has implemented mechanisms that allow it to identify  opportunities for cost savings, such as an internal website through which  BOP staff can view cost efficiency efforts being implemented across BOP,  and undertaken cost-savings efforts, such as in energy conservation.  However, establishing a mechanism for relevant Central Office divisions  to consistently monitor bureau-wide corrective actions and assess their  progress in the presence of repeated frequent or significant findings could  help BOP better ensure that it is resolving such deficiencies promptly and,  ultimately, operating more efficiently.", "BOP\u2019s inmate population is its primary cost driver; however, BOP\u2019s ability  to reduce its population, and thus its costs, are limited. Potential changes  outside of BOP\u2019s authority could substantially reduce both BOP\u2019s  population and its costs. Expert entities and states from which we  obtained views reported that there are potential trade-offs to  implementing these options. Some expert entities observed that release  of offenders poses the risk of recidivism and that reductions in sentence  length could reduce prosecutors\u2019 leverage in extracting information from  low-level criminals that is used to prosecute higher-level ones. At the  same time, other expert entities reported potential advantages to these  options, such as making sentence lengths more commensurate with the  crime committed.

With respect to identifying additional opportunities  to realize cost efficiencies or reduce costs, using our financial analysis as  context, we analyzed elements of BOP\u2019s internal control system related to  the control objective of achieving operational efficiencies and interviewed  relevant officials to assess whether BOP has a management structure  and processes to routinely assess its administrative and operational  activities for possible corrective action. Specifically, we reviewed BOP\u2019s  mechanisms and processes leading to its internal review of operational  and administrative functions, including its process for taking corrective  action, related to high-cost areas and compared these characteristics with  those called for in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government.", "To address the third question, on potential policy changes both within and  outside BOP\u2019s authority that could lead to BOP cost savings, we collected  analysis and documentation from the Department of Justice (DOJ), BOP,  the U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC), and entities selected for their  expertise in criminal justice issues, and, in particular, potential changes to  federal sentencing policies.several means, including (1) asking officials at both the USSC and the  Urban Institute who have previously worked on analyses and reports  relevant to prison population data and criminal justice to identify entities  they considered as expert in the field of sentencing reform and criminal  justice, (2) conducting a literature search to identify publications issued by  some of the entities on sentencing reform or corrections, and (3)  identifying entities with known expertise and authoritativeness (e.g., the  ABA) in the criminal justice field through literature searches. These  entities may not be representative of the universe of expert entities in the  criminal justice field and therefore may not represent all views on this  topic; however, their views provide insights. We obtained data from   We identified these expert entities through  calendar year 2011 through July 2014 from BOP on the impact on BOP\u2019s  population and costs resulting from changes implemented by BOP to  broaden the criteria for compassionate release of offenders, as well as  analyses from the USSC on the estimated impact of the memorandum  accompanying the Attorney General\u2019s August 2013 DOJ Smart on Crime  initiative that instructed prosecutors to decline to charge certain  defendants in certain types of drug cases in such a manner as to trigger  mandatory minimum sentences. For data on efforts taken under BOP\u2019s  authority, we assessed the reliability by reviewing documentation and  interviewing knowledgeable officials; we determined the data to be  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. For data on the impact  of policy changes outside BOP\u2019s authority, we obtained analyses from the  USSC. According to our audit objectives, we determined based on its  expertise that the evidence obtained from the USSC provides a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions.", "We reviewed sentencing reform options identified by the expert entities,  as well as analyses of these options from these entities. We identified  these entities on the basis of their demonstrated expertise as well as to  ensure that a wide range of views on the advantages or disadvantages of  potential changes to existing sentencing guidelines was covered. GAO is  not taking a position on any of these options, but presents information on  estimated cost savings and experts\u2019 views of advantages and  disadvantages for such options to inform policymakers as they weigh  whether and how to address rising costs at BOP.", "On the basis of the options we identified, we compiled a list of seven  sentencing guideline and related changes that were being widely  considered and discussed among expert entities at the time we began our  review and during the course of the review. We also included one change  resulting from a memorandum issued by the Attorney General in August  2013 to U.S. Attorneys instructing them to decline to charge certain  defendants in certain types of drug cases in such a manner as to trigger  mandatory minimum sentences. These selected options were based on  our assessment of proposals put forward by several sources, including  the Attorney General, expert entities, states with experience with criminal  justice reform, and advocacy entities with a range of views on criminal  justice reform. See appendix II for the letter sent to expert entities asking  for their assessment of options, which provides a list of the proposals that  were used to develop the selected options. During the course of our  review, two of these options were approved by the USSC, with the  amendment to the sentencing guidelines forwarded to Congress. This  amendment will become effective on November 1, 2014, unless Congress  acts to modify or disapprove the amendment. The two options approved  are closely related\u2014the first, approved by the USSC on April 10, 2014,  reduces the sentences for future (federal) drug offenders, such that there  would be an approximately 18 percent reduction in the average length of  such sentences compared with sentences under current guidelines. The  second was approved on July 18, 2014, by USSC, and applies the  reduction retroactively\u2014that is, to currently incarcerated drug offenders.  After the USSC July 18 vote to make the drug sentence reductions  retroactive (if eligibility criteria are met), the Attorney General issued a  statement that, at his direction, BOP will begin notifying federal inmates of  the opportunity to apply for a reduction in sentence immediately. Unless  Congress modifies or disapproves the amendment to the sentencing  guidelines submitted by the USSC, beginning November 1, 2014, eligible  offenders can ask courts to reduce their sentences. Offenders whose  requests are granted by the courts can be released no earlier than  November 1, 2015, under the USSC provision. For the purposes of this  report, we refer to these two changes by the USSC, and the Attorney  General\u2019s August 2013 directive to U.S. Attorneys, and to the other  options collectively as eight options.", "For each of these eight options, we asked the USSC to estimate the  impact on the size of the BOP inmate population. The USSC calculates  such impact in bed years; 1 bed year is defined by the USSC as 12  months of prison time (e.g., one offender in prison for 1 year, or three  offenders in prison for 4 months each, and so forth). Using the USSC bed  years\u2019 savings estimates, we then calculated cost savings or cost  avoidance that could result from implementing a given option. analyses of these eight options are reproduced in appendix VII.", "We calculated savings that would result from reductions in BOP population or cost  avoidance savings resulting from increases below what would otherwise occur if an option  was not implemented, by multiplying bed years saved by the annual marginal cost for a  prisoner. BOP defines marginal costs as the cost of adding one offender for 1 year; these  cover food, medical, clothing, and utilities. For fiscal year 2014, the average annual  marginal cost per offender is about $11,000. For some options that could result in reduced  sentences and earlier releases of about 78,000 or more offenders, we also calculated per  capita savings, as such population reductions that could allow BOP to reduce its staff or  close facilities.", "In addition, we asked the 14 expert entities to comment on the options  with regard to their view of the advantages or disadvantages of  implementation of the eight options. We also identified 4 states (Texas,  Louisiana, Ohio, and North Carolina) that have had at least 1 year\u2019s  experience in implementing state-level sentencing and criminal justice  changes similar to the ones being discussed for federal offenders, and  asked them to comment on the potential options for change. We  selected Louisiana, Ohio, and North Carolina also because they are  participants in the joint DOJ-Pew Charitable Trust Justice Reinvestment  Initiative (JRI), which funds implementation of changes to state  sentencing and criminal justice policies intended to reduce prison  populations and recidivism, and these states were also the largest in  terms of annual spending on corrections among the JRI states with at  least 1 year\u2019s experience in implementing JRI-related initiatives. We  selected Texas because, as of 2012, it had both the largest state prison  population in the United States and was cited by the Urban Institute as an  early leader in criminal justice reform initiatives that DOJ used as a model  for the Justice Reinvestment Initiative program. We received responses  from 17 of the 18 entities (the 14 expert entities and 4 states) to which we  sent the letter.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2013 to September 2014  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

We also assumed that the  Commission would make no further changes to the Guidelines Manual in light of the  Policy Option, so that the provisions of the 2013  Guidelines Manual would apply in these  cases.  Finally, we assumed that the effective date of any such Policy Option would be  October 1,2014.  Therefore, only offenders incarcerated as of that date would be eligible  to seek a reduction in sentence pursuant to the Policy Option discussed in the  memorandum.  2.", "The policy we analyzed would have the effect of lowering the current statutory  mandatory minimum penalties in drug cases from 5,  10, and 20 years to 2,5, and 10  years  respectively.  In fiscal year 2010, approximately 66 percent of all drug offenders  were convicted of an  offense carrying a mandatory minimum penalty.s  Of those,  approximately 46 percent remain subject to the penalty at the time of sentencing. Some  offenders receive relief from the effect of any such penalty by providing substantial  assistance to the government in the investigation or prosecution of another offender. Others receive relief from such a penalty through the statutory \"safety valve\" provision  which authorizes courts to sentence drug offenders without regard to any mandatory  minimum penalty provided the offender meets several criteria desirned to  identify low level, non-violent offenders with little or no prior criminal history.  Some offenders are  eligible for both provisions.", "In our analysis, we provide a full reduction for all offenders who remained subject  to a mandatory minimum penalty at the time of sentencing.  That is, we reduce sentences  by 60 percent for all offenders convicted of a 5-year mandatory minimum who remained  subject to that mandatory minimum at sentencing.  Similarly, we reduce sentences by 50  percent for all offenders convicted of a 1 O-year or a 20-year mandatory minimum penalty  and who remained subject to that penalty at sentencing.", "See U.S. SENTENCING COMMISSION, MANDATORY MINIMUM PENALTIES  IN THE FEDERAL CRIMINAL  JUSTICE SYSTEM  154 (2011).", "See  18 U.S.c. \u00a7 3553(f); USSG  \u00a75K3.1.", "Drug offenders who receive relief from a mandatory minimum penalty by  providing substantial assistance to the government have sentences that are, in general, 46  percent below the arplicable guideline minimum sentence,9 which often is the mandatory  minimum penalty. Drug offenders who receive relief from a mandatory minimum  penalty through the statutory safety valve provision have sentences that are, in general,  39 percent below the applicable guideline minimum sentence. The extent of these  reductions fluctuates somewhat each year.  Because these offenders benefitted from  substantial reductions in their sentence at the time of the original sentence, we have  assumed that any benefit to them from the Policy Option would not be as great as it  would be for those offenders who remained subject to a mandatory minimum penalty at  sentencing.  Therefore, for this analysis, we made additional assumptions for these  offenders, as follows:  -- offenders who were convicted of a drug offense carrying a 5-year mandatory  minimum penalty, but who were not subject to any mandatory penalty at sentencing due  to relief through substantial assistance or the safety valve would receive a further  reduction of 30 percent under the Policy Option (i.e., 50% of the 60% reduction that  offenders received if they remained subject to that mandatory minimum penalty at  sentencing);  -- offenders who were convicted of a drug offense carrying a 10-year or 20-year  mandatory minimum penalty, but who were not subject to any mandatory penalty at  sentencing due to relief through substantial assistance or the safety valve would receive a  further reduction of25 percent under the Policy Option (i.e., 50% of the 50% reduction  that offenders received if they remained subject to either ofthose mandatory minimum  penalties at sentencing).", "This analysis does not assume any change in sentence for offenders who were not  convicted of a drug offense carrying a mandatory minimum penalty.  It is possible, of  course, that Congress (of the President) might authorize a reduction in sentence for drug  offenders currently incarcerated but who were not convicted of an offense carrying a  mandatory minimum penalty.  Any such reduction would likely be tied to a change in the  Guidelines Manual that incorporated the Policy Option.  We are unable to model any  change to the sentencing guidelines from a statutory enactment of the Policy Option, and  so have excluded from this analysis any consideration of a change in sentence for drug  offenders who were not convicted of an offense carrying a mandatory minimum penalty.", "See 2013  Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing Statistics, Table 30 (2014).", "See USSG \u00a75G 1.1  (which provides that the minimum guideline sentence may not be lower than any  mandatory minimum penalty).", "II See 2013  Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing Statistics, Table 30A (2014). the Bureau of Prisons, and offenders would serve the lesser of the newly calculated  sentence or their life expectancies.", "If you have any questions about our analysis, please do not hesitate to contact the  Commission.

As a consequence, first-time trafficking  offenses involving less than 28 grams of crack cocaine are subject to a statutory penalty  range of zero to 20 years of imprisonment.  First-time trafficking offenses involving  between 28  and 280 grams of crack cocaine are subject to a statutory penalty range of  five to 40 years of imprisonment.A first-time trafficking offense involving 280 or more  grams of crack cocaine is subject to a statutory penalty range of 10 years to life  imprisonment. The FSA did not make any of the statutory changes retroactive.  Therefore, offenders sentenced before the effecti ve date of the FSA continue to be  subject to the mandatory minimum penalties in effect on the date of sentencing.", "B.", "Temporary and Permanent Amendments to the Guidelines Manual in  Response to the FSA  On October 15,2010, the Commission promulgated a temporary, emergency  amendment to the guidelines that implemented the emergency directive in section 8 of  the FSA.(In this memorandum, the several modifications to the drug guidelines promulgated in  response to the FSA are referred to collectively as the \"FSA Guideline Amendment.\")", "USSG, 2011  Supp. to App.  C,  Amendment 748 (effective Nov.  1,2010).", "FSA Guideline Amendment added both new mitigating and aggravating provisions to  USSG \u00a72D 1.1 for offenses involving drugs, regardless of drug type.  Part C of the FSA  Guideline Amendment eliminated a provision in the guidelines under which an offender  who possessed more than 5 grams of crack cocaine was sentenced under the drug  trafficking guideline.", "C.", "Retroactive Application of the FSA Guideline Amendment  The Commission voted to authorize courts to retroactively arply Parts A and C of  the FSA Guideline Amendment to offenders currently incarcerated.  Pursuant to  18  U.S.C.  \u00a7 3582(c)(2), courts were then authorized to reduce the sentences of those  offenders consistent with the amended sentencing guidelines.  To date, the courts have  reduced the sentences of more than 7,500 offenders pursuant to retroactive application of  the FSA Guideline Amendment. In more than 5,000 other cases, the courts have denied  relief to offenders seeking a reduction in sentence under the FSA Guideline Amendment.  The courts found that the offender was not eligible for any sentence reduction in more  than 3,700 of those cases.  For example, in 1,458 cases, the court found that the offender  was ineligible because the applicable mandatory minimum penalty controlled the  sentence and prevented the court from reducing the sentence.", "In more than 1,045 other cases, the offender was found ineligible because the  Career Offender guideline (USSG \u00a74B1.1), and not the drug trafficking guideline (USSG  \u00a72D 1.1), determined the guideline range at sentencing.  As discussed above, the  mandatory minimum penalties applicable to offenders sentenced prior to the FSA were  unchanged by the act.  The Career Offender guideline is linked to statutory maximum  penalties which, in drug cases, are also linked to statutory mandatory minimum penalties.  Because neither the FSA nor the FSA Guideline Amendments had the effect of lowering  the Career Offender guideline, the provisions of 18 U.S.C.  \u00a7 3582(c)(2) allowing courts  to reduce the sentences of incarcerated offenders when their sentencing guideline is  lowered do not apply to offenders whose guideline range is determined under that  proVISIOn.", "Finally, in some additional cases, the offender received only a partial reduction in  sentence under the FSA Guideline Amendment.

(5) the \"mitigating role cap\" on the base offense level of the guidelines would be  applied, if appropriate, based upon the new base offense level;  (6) offenders originally receiving relief from a mandatory minimum penalty by  operation of the safety valve provision would continue to receive relief but, if the  applicable statutory minimum is at least five years, the offense level determined after  applying Chapters Two (Offense Conduct) and Three (Adjustments) of the guidelines  would not be less than level  17 (pursuant to USSG \u00a75CI.2(b\u00bb;  (7) for offenders with an original combined offense level (after application of  Chapters Two and Three) of level  16 or greater but having a new combined offense level  below level  16, the applicable reduction for Acceptance of Responsibility would be  reduced from three levels to two levels in accordance with that guideline provision;  (8) the sentence for each offender would be reduced based on the maximum good  conduct credit allowed by the Bureau of Prisons; and  (9) offenders would serve the lesser ofthe newly calculated sentence or their life  expectancies.", "C.", "Limitation as to Application of New Mitigating Provisions of the FSA  As discussed above, Part B of the FSA Guideline Amendment added both new  mitigating and aggravating provisions to USSG \u00a72DI.I for offenses involving drugs,  regardless of drug type.

These offenders were excluded from the analysis.  The majority of the  offenders (n = 9,741) were excluded because they would not experience the proposed  statutory change - either because no statutory mandatory minimum penalty applied in  their cases or the offender already was sentenced below the FSA mandatory minimum  thresholds. IS  Another 362 offenders were sentenced under the Career Offender provision  and, despite a change to their drug statutory minimum penalty, their guideline range  under the Career Offender provision did not change.  In another 191  cases, the current  sentence is greater than both the guideline minimum and the FSA statutory minimum,  therefore no change in their sentence would result.  A small number of offenders (n=30)  were excluded because their guideline range was detennined under the Armed Career  Criminal provision, which would be unaffected by the retroactive application of the FSA.  Lastly, one offender had a base offense level of38, the top of the Drug Quantity Table,  and the quantity of drugs involved in that case continued to place the offender at that  level, so therefore no change in his or her guideline range would occur.", "After these offenders were excluded, there remained 8,829 offenders who were  projected to be incarcerated on January 1,2014 and who appeared eligible to seek a  reduced sentence if the provisions of the FSA were to be made retroactive as described  above.", "If you have any questions about our analysis please do not hesitate to contact the  Commission.
