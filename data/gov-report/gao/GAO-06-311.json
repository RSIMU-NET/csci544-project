Through the end of fiscal year 2005, these agencies had spent about $178 million on this assistance through seven different programs. Primary among these programs is DOE's Second Line of Defense \"Core\" program, which has installed equipment mostly in Russia since 1998. U.S. efforts to install and effectively operate radiation detection equipment in other countries face a number of challenges including: corruption of some foreign border security officials, technical limitations of some radiation detection equipment, inadequate maintenance of some equipment, and the lack of supporting infrastructure at some border sites. DOE, DOD, and State officials told us they are concerned that corrupt foreign border security personnel could compromise the effectiveness of U.S.-funded radiation detection equipment by either turning off equipment or ignoring alarms. In addition, State and other agencies have installed equipment at some sites that is less effective than equipment installed by DOE. Since 2002, DOE has maintained the equipment but has only upgraded one site. As a result, these border sites are more vulnerable to nuclear smuggling than sites with more sophisticated equipment. Further, while DOE assumed responsibility for maintaining most U.S.-funded equipment, some handheld equipment provided by State and DOD has not been maintained. Lastly, many border sites are located in remote areas that often lack infrastructure essential to operate radiation detection equipment. As the lead interagency coordinator of all U.S. radiation detection equipment assistance overseas, State has taken some steps to coordinate U.S. efforts. However, its ability to carry out its role as lead coordinator is limited by shortcomings in the strategic plan for interagency coordination. Additionally, State has not maintained an interagency master list of all U.S.-funded radiation detection equipment overseas. Without such a list, program managers at DOE, DOD, and State cannot accurately assess if equipment is operational and being used as intended; determine the equipment needs of countries where they plan to provide assistance; or detect if an agency has unknowingly supplied duplicative equipment."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, between 1993 and  2004, there were 662 confirmed cases of illicit trafficking in nuclear and  radiological materials, and the number of reported cases has risen  dramatically since 2002. Many of these cases involved material that could  be used to produce either a nuclear weapon or a device that uses  conventional explosives with radioactive material (known as a \u201cdirty  bomb,\u201d or radiological dispersal device). Especially in the aftermath of the  attacks on September 11, 2001, there is heightened concern that terrorists  may try to smuggle nuclear materials or a nuclear weapon into the United  States. If terrorists were to accomplish this, the consequences could be  devastating to our national and economic interests. In April 2004, the  United Nations Security Council passed a resolution calling for every  member state to put in place appropriate effective border controls and law  enforcement to detect, deter, prevent, and combat the illicit trafficking and  brokering in nuclear materials and other items related to weapons of mass  destruction.", "In response to the growing concern about nuclear smuggling, three U.S.  agencies, the Departments of Energy (DOE), Defense (DOD), and State  (State), have programs that provide radiation detection equipment and  related training to border security personnel and customs officials in other  countries. Initial concerns about the threat posed by nuclear smuggling  were focused on nuclear materials originating in the former Soviet Union.  As a result, the first major initiatives to combat nuclear smuggling  concentrated on deploying radiation detection equipment at borders in  countries of the former Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe. Beginning in  the mid-1990s, DOD and State provided fixed radiation detection  equipment, known as radiation portal monitors, and handheld radiation  detection equipment to a number of countries in this region. In 1998, DOE  established the Second Line of Defense \u201cCore\u201d (SLD-Core) program, which  has primarily worked to help Russia detect illicit nuclear materials  trafficking by providing radiation detection equipment to the Federal  Customs Service of Russia. In coordination with State, DOE, through its  National Nuclear Security Administration, has recently expanded its  efforts in the SLD-Core program to include countries other than Russia,  including installing radiation detection equipment at border sites in Greece  as part of the overall U.S. effort to provide security assistance prior to the  2004 Olympic Games. In addition to DOE\u2019s efforts through the SLD-Core  program, six other programs\u2014one at DOE, two at DOD, and three at  State\u2014have provided radiation detection equipment to assist foreign  governments in combating nuclear smuggling. Further, State is the lead  interagency coordinator of U.S. nuclear detection assistance overseas.", "As agreed with your offices, this report addresses U.S. efforts to combat  nuclear smuggling by examining (1) the progress U.S. programs have made  in providing radiation detection equipment to foreign governments,  including the current and expected costs of these programs; (2) the  challenges U.S. programs face in deploying or operating radiation detection  equipment in foreign countries; and (3) the steps being taken to coordinate  U.S. efforts to combat nuclear smuggling in other countries. To address  these objectives, we analyzed documentation on U.S. efforts to combat  nuclear smuggling from DOE and its contractors, both at DOE\u2019s national  laboratories and in the private sector; DOD and its contractors; State; and  DHS and conducted interviews with key program officials at each of these  agencies. We also visited six countries (Georgia, Greece, Macedonia,  Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan), where U.S. agencies have provided  radiation detection equipment, to observe U.S.-funded radiation detection  equipment in operation and to discuss the implementation of U.S. programs  with foreign officials. In addition, we analyzed cost and budgetary  information from DOE, DOD, State, and DHS; performed a data reliability  assessment of this data; and interviewed knowledgeable agency officials on  the reliability of the data. We determined these data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report. More details on our scope and  methodology can be found in appendix I. We conducted our review from  April 2005 to February 2006 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Since our May 2002 report on nuclear smuggling, the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) has reported 481 additional confirmed cases of the  smuggling of nuclear and/or radiological materials. One of these cases  involved nuclear material suitable for use in a nuclear weapon. The  majority of new cases IAEA reported involved radiological sources, which  could be combined with conventional explosives to create a \u201cdirty bomb.\u201d  According to IAEA, the majority of all reported incidents with radiological  sources involved criminal activity, most frequently theft. Radiological  sources and devices in which they are used can be attractive for thieves  because of their perceived high resale value or the value of their ability to  shield or encapsulate illegally shipped materials within legal shipments of  radioactive materials. Some of the reported cases indicate a perceived  demand for radioactive materials on the black market, according to IAEA.  From 2003 to 2004, the number of incidents reported by IAEA substantially  increased. IAEA indicated that improved reporting may, in part, account for  this increase. As of December 2004, 82 of IAEA\u2019s Member States were  participating in contributing to the database.", "Detecting actual cases of illicit trafficking in nuclear material is  complicated because one of the materials of greatest concern\u2014highly  enriched uranium\u2014is among the most difficult materials to detect because  of its relatively low level of radioactivity. Uranium emits only gamma  radiation so detection equipment, which generally contains both gamma  and neutron detection capabilities, only detects uranium from the gamma  detector. However, gamma radiation emissions can be shielded by encasing  nuclear material within another high density material, such as lead.  Another nuclear material of great concern is plutonium, which emits both  gamma and neutron radiation. However, shielding nuclear material  generally does not prevent the detection of neutron radiation and, as a  result, plutonium can be detected by neutron detectors regardless of the  amount of shielding from high density material. According to DOE officials,  neutron radiation alarms are only caused by man-made materials, such as  plutonium, while gamma radiation alarms are caused by a variety of  naturally occurring sources including commercial goods such as bananas,  ceramic tiles, and fertilizer, in addition to dangerous nuclear materials,  such as uranium and plutonium.", "The most common types of radiation detection equipment are radiation  portal monitors; handheld equipment, including both survey meters and  radioactive isotope identification devices; and radiation pagers. The  radiation detection equipment that U.S. programs provide to foreign  countries is commercially available, off-the-shelf technology. Radiation  portal monitors are stationary pieces of equipment designed to detect  radioactive materials being carried by vehicles, pedestrians, or railcars.  Radiation portal monitors currently being provided by U.S. agencies have  the ability to detect both gamma and neutron radiation, which is important  for detecting highly enriched uranium and plutonium, respectively.  According to DOE, radiation portal monitors with both gamma and neutron  detectors cost between about $28,000 and $55,000, plus the additional costs  associated with installing the equipment and communication systems  necessary to operate it. Figure 1 shows a picture of radiation portal  monitors with both gamma and neutron detectors.", "In 2002, we reported that some U.S. agencies, primarily State, provided  radiation portal monitors that did not have the ability to detect neutron  radiation to foreign governments. Because this equipment is capable of  detecting only gamma radiation, it is less effective in detecting certain  nuclear material, such as plutonium that has been shielded with high  density material. Replacement cost for similar equipment (capable of  detecting only gamma radiation), is about $5,000, not including installation  costs, according to DOE officials. Figure 2 shows an example of such a  radiation portal monitor.", "Handheld radiation detection equipment, such as survey meters and  radioactive isotope identification devices, are used by customs officials  and border guards to conduct secondary inspections, the aim of which is  to localize the source of an alarm and determine the nature of the material  present. Survey meters can be used to detect the level of radiation by  providing a count of the radiation level in the area. Radioactive isotope  identification devices, commonly known as RIIDs, identify the specific  isotope of the radioactive source detected. In addition, U.S. programs often  provide radiation pagers, which are small radiation detection devices worn  on belts by border security personnel to continuously monitor levels of  radiation in the area. Pagers are considered personal safety devices and,  therefore, should not be relied upon to implement secondary inspections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Three U.S. Agencies Have Spent About $178 Million to Provide Radiation Detection Equipment to 36 Countries, but Future Spending Requirements for Some Programs Are Uncertain", "paragraphs": ["Since fiscal year 1994, DOE, DOD, and State have spent about $178 million  to provide radiation detection equipment to 36 countries as part of the  overall U.S. effort to combat nuclear smuggling.

For example, although DOE is the  primary U.S. agency responsible for installing radiation portal monitors in  foreign countries, State selectively funds projects to provide radiation  portal monitors to foreign countries through its EXBS program. State  officials told us that State coordinates its work in this area with DOE to  avoid duplication, and it conducts these projects on an as needed basis to  provide a quick response to emerging nuclear smuggling threats. For  example, in December 2005, State installed portal monitors and provided  handheld radiation detection equipment to one site in Armenia at a cost of  about $0.5 million, in part because it believed that the threat of nuclear  smuggling warranted immediate installation of this equipment. State  officials we spoke with told us that they coordinated with DOE to ensure  State\u2019s work in Armenia is consistent with overall U.S. goals and that the  specific equipment installed met minimum detection standards.  Furthermore, State officials also told us that the newly installed radiation  portal monitors at this site in Armenia provide a redundant layer of security  with DOE\u2019s planned work to install equipment on the opposite side of the  border in the Republic of Georgia.", "Because State selectively funds portal monitor projects through its EXBS  program to provide a quick U.S. government response to emerging security  threats of nuclear smuggling, it is uncertain how many other projects State  will fund in this area, in what countries these projects will be conducted, or  how much they will cost. Additionally, State officials also told us that they  have yet to determine whether or not they will fund any future projects to  provide radiation detection equipment assistance to foreign countries  through the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund or the Georgia  Border Security and Law Enforcement program. As a result, it is uncertain  how many other projects State will fund through either of these two  programs or how much they will cost.", "DOE currently plans to install equipment at a total of about 350 sites in 31  countries by 2012 at an estimated cost of $570 million based on a strategy  that analyzes and prioritizes countries for receiving installations. However,  it cannot be certain which countries will be included in the SLD-Core  program until it signs the necessary agreements with these countries\u2019  governments. For example, DOE planned to complete installations in  Georgia, Kazakhstan, Slovenia, and Ukraine in fiscal year 2005. However,  installations in Georgia, Slovenia, and Ukraine will not be completed until  at least fiscal year 2006 because of delays in signing implementing  agreements with these countries. Additionally, DOE is still in the process of  trying to reach agreement with Kazakhstan. In fiscal year 2004, DOE  reallocated a portion of its funding to directly fund its planned work at  certain border sites in Kazakhstan. However, difficulty in reaching  agreement with Kazakhstan continues to delay this work. If DOE continues  to experience delays in signing agreements with foreign countries, or  cannot reach agreements with all of the countries where it currently plans  to install equipment, it may need to alter its planned scope of work and  overall cost estimates for the program. Furthermore, once DOE reaches  agreement with a certain country, it still needs to conduct individual site  assessments to determine at which sites providing radiation detection  equipment will be cost-effective, as well as the amount of equipment each  site will require. Therefore, DOE is limited in its ability to determine the  total cost of the SLD-Core program until it signs implementing agreements  with the governments of countries where it plans to work and conducts  assessments to determine which specific sites within those countries  require radiation detection equipment and in what amounts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Threat of Corruption, Technological Limitations, Maintenance Problems, and Site Infrastructure Issues Challenge U.S. Programs to Combat Nuclear Smuggling", "paragraphs": ["U.S. programs that provide radiation detection equipment to foreign  governments face a number of challenges that affect the installation and  effective operation of radiation detection equipment, including: the threat  of corruption of border security officials in some foreign countries,  technical limitations of radiation detection equipment previously deployed  by State and other agencies, inadequate maintenance of some handheld  equipment, and the lack of infrastructure necessary to operate radiation  detection equipment and harsh environmental conditions at some border  sites. DOE, DOD, and State have taken some steps to address these  challenges, such as providing multitiered communications systems to  mitigate corruption so that alarm data can be simultaneously viewed at  several levels of authority and supplying protective casings for radiation  portal monitors to prevent damage from vandals or extreme heat."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Possible Corruption of Border Guards Poses a Threat to the Effective Operation of U.S.-Funded Radiation Detection Equipment", "paragraphs": ["According to U.S. and foreign government officials, corruption is a  pervasive problem within the ranks of border security organizations.  Specifically, because foreign border guards are often poorly paid and  geographically isolated, there are concerns that foreign officials could be  bribed and turn off the radiation detection equipment and allow nuclear  smuggling to occur. For example, an official might turn off the equipment  to allow a nuclear smuggler to pass through a border crossing. According  to a Russian press report, in October 2004, a Russian customs agent at a  site in western Russia was fired because he was aiding a smuggling ring.  Additionally, in July 2005, after the newly elected President of Ukraine took  office, he reorganized many agencies within the government, including the  Customs Service, because of concerns about corruption.", "DOE, DOD, and State officials told us they are concerned that corrupt  foreign border security personnel could compromise the effectiveness of  U.S.-funded radiation detection equipment by either turning off equipment  or ignoring alarms. As a result, U.S. programs that provide fixed radiation  portal monitors are taking some steps to evaluate the degree to which  corruption is present in the countries and regions where they are working  or plan to work. For example, DOE\u2019s SLD-Core program commissioned  three studies to better understand corruption and the challenges that it  could bring to the program. Additionally, DOE includes countrywide  corruption assessments as part of its efforts to help program officials  prioritize countries to include in the SLD-Core program. In addition, DOD  and State also include anticorruption courses as part of the radiation  detection training they provide to foreign border security personnel.", "Some U.S. programs also have taken or plan to take other specific steps to  mitigate the threat of corruption, such as (1) providing multitiered  communications systems so that alarm data can be simultaneously viewed  at several levels of authority, (2) implementing programs to combat some  of the underlying issues that can lead to corruption through periodic  screening of border security personnel, and (3) installing radiation portal  monitors on both sides of a particular border if there are concerns about  corruption of personnel in these countries. For example, DOE and DOD are  deploying communication systems that link the activities at individual  border sites with regional and national command centers. By doing so,  alarm data can be simultaneously evaluated by officials both at the site and  up the chain of command, thus establishing redundant layers of  accountability for responding to alarms. As a result, if a local official turns  off the radiation detection equipment at a site, higher level officials can  quickly be made aware of the incident and investigate the reasons for the  alarm. Additionally, DOD plans to implement an Employee Dependability  Program in Uzbekistan that includes background checks, personal  interviews of applicants, monitoring of performance and behavior, and  annual refresher training to combat some of the underlying issues that can  lead to corruption among border security personnel. DOE officials told us  that they are considering implementing such a screening program in some  countries where the SLD-Core program works. Lastly, U.S. programs are  installing radiation portal monitors on both sides of some borders to create  redundant coverage to increase the likelihood of detection and  interdiction. In fiscal year 2006, DOE plans to install radiation portal  monitors at a number of sites in Georgia. At one site in Armenia, across the  border from a planned DOE installation, State installed radiation portal  monitors in December 2005, in part, because of concerns about corruption  on both sides of the border at this location. DOE is also considering  employing this type of redundant coverage at other locations throughout  Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.", "While DOE has taken steps to determine the level of corruption in some  countries and regions where it works and includes countrywide corruption  assessments as part of its prioritization model, DOE is still in the process of  determining in what countries it will provide specific anticorruption  measures and how much it will cost to do so based on its analysis of the  corruption threat. For example, DOE estimates that it will spend about $1  million to provide radiation detection equipment and related  communications systems at a typical foreign border crossing. DOE officials  noted that the standard communication systems the SLD-Core program  provides with radiation portal monitors have some anticorruption value  because radiation alarms require more than one official to review and close  out before the system can be reset. However, DOE has not included the  costs associated with other specific anticorruption measures in the long- term cost estimates for its SLD-Core program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Border Crossings Remain More Vulnerable to Nuclear Smuggling Because DOE Has Not Upgraded Less Sophisticated Equipment Installed by Other U.S. Agencies", "paragraphs": ["In 2002, DOE assumed responsibility for maintaining some radiation  detection equipment previously installed by State and other U.S. agencies  in 23 countries in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.

Through an interagency agreement,  DOE assumed responsibility for ensuring the long-term sustainability and  continued operation of radiation portal monitors and X-ray vans equipped  with radiation detectors that State and other U.S. agencies provided to  these countries. Through this agreement, DOE provides spare parts,  preventative maintenance, and repairs for the equipment through regularly  scheduled maintenance visits. Through the end of fiscal year 2005, DOE  had conducted maintenance and sustainability activities for equipment in  21 of the 23 countries where equipment had been provided. DOE officials  told us that, although Belarus received a significant amount of radiation  detection equipment from DOD, DOE is currently prohibited from  maintaining this equipment by restrictions placed on U.S. assistance to  Belarus. As a result, the maintenance status of the 38 portal monitors and  almost 200 pieces of handheld radiation detection equipment DOD  provided to Belarus is unknown. Additionally, at the request of the Turkish  government, DOE no longer maintains 41 portal monitors and over 150  pieces of handheld radiation detection equipment State previously  provided to Turkey.", "As we originally reported in 2002, at some sites in foreign countries, State  and other U.S. agencies installed portal monitors that contained only  gamma radiation detectors, which are less effective in detecting certain  nuclear material, such as plutonium, than detectors with both gamma and  neutron detection capability. Although State\u2019s current policy is to install  radiation detection equipment with both gamma and neutron detection  capability, according to DOE officials, because of their configuration and  sensitivity, these older portal monitors are less likely to detect small  quantities of highly enriched uranium or nuclear material that is shielded,  for example, by a lead container or certain parts of a vehicle. When it  assumed responsibility for maintaining this equipment, DOE conducted an  initial assessment of these portal monitors to determine whether they were  functional and what maintenance was required. During the course of this  analysis, DOE found that much of the equipment was damaged and  required total replacement or major repairs. In such cases, DOE installed  similar equipment with gamma radiation detectors but chose not to  upgrade the equipment with newer portal monitors that would be capable  of detecting both gamma and neutron radiation. DOE\u2019s policy was to  replace this equipment in-kind and wait to upgrade the equipment as part of  a countrywide deployment through the SLD-Core program. However,  according to SLD-Core program officials, DOE did not have funds  earmarked for upgrading the equipment in the absence of a countrywide  deployment through the SLD-Core program.", "Additionally, SLD-Core program officials stated that DOE would need to  sign new agreements with the appropriate ministries or agencies within the  governments of the countries where State and other agencies had  previously installed equipment before DOE could invest \u201csubstantial  resources\u201d to upgrade the equipment. DOE officials noted that replacing  the less sophisticated portal monitors with similar equipment usually costs  less than $5,000, plus installation costs, while deploying a comprehensive  system comprised of portal monitors that can detect both gamma and  neutron radiation, associated communication systems, and related training  can cost up to $1 million per site. The agreements are important because  they exempt DOE from payment of host government taxes, customs duties,  or other charges per congressional guidance. In addition, these agreements  require the host government to provide DOE with data on detections of  illicit trafficking in nuclear materials gathered as a result of assistance DOE  provided through the SLD-Core program. Though the SLD-Core program  has signed agreements with some countries where the less sophisticated  equipment was installed, such as Ukraine, DOE has yet to upgrade any of  the equipment in these countries, with the exception of one site in  Azerbaijan, primarily because the details of the countrywide installations  are still being determined. According to DOE officials, as countries with  older equipment sign agreements with DOE to implement the full SLD-Core  program, sites in these countries with less sophisticated equipment will be  upgraded.", "In November 2005, DOE completed an assessment of the maintenance  activities it performs on equipment provided by other U.S. agencies. DOE  found that equipment failures at many of these sites go unattended, often  for months. DOE determined that its maintenance of X-ray vans previously  provided by State was not critical to the mission of the SLD-Core program.  As a result, DOE is planning to phase out its maintenance of X-ray vans  after fiscal year 2007. According to DOE officials, the budget of the SLD- Core program cannot sustain what DOE considers \u201cnon-mission critical  work.\u201d In fiscal year 2005, DOE bore the full financial responsibility for all  maintenance activities because State provided no funding to DOE for this  work. In addition to the X-ray vans, DOE evaluated the sites where portal  monitors were previously installed by State and other agencies and  identified those monitors that should no longer be supported by the SLD- Core program.

For example, many border sites are located in remote  areas, which often do not have access to reliable supplies of electricity,  fiber optic lines, and other infrastructure needed to operate radiation  portal monitors and associated communication systems. Prior to providing  radiation portal monitors, U.S. programs typically perform site  assessments to determine the details surrounding how radiation detection  equipment will be installed at a given site. The assessment includes the  operational needs of the equipment depending on the infrastructure  available at the site. To address the needs identified, DOE, DOD, and State  provide generators at some sites to supply electricity to the radiation  detection equipment because the electric power supply shuts down  periodically or may be very low at these remote sites. Additionally, the  communication systems that are provided to report activities from the  radiation detectors require fiber optic cabling for their operation. If no  cabling exists, underground cabling or radio wave operated  communication systems must be installed to perform this function. Finally,  at some border sites, the radiation portal monitors are located significant  distances from the control and communication system center. U.S.  program officials we spoke with expressed concern that theft could occur  because of the remote location of this equipment. To prevent such  interference with the equipment, antitampering measures such as  protective cages are used to protect the integrity of the portal monitors  (see fig. 4).", "Additionally, environmental conditions at some sites, such as extreme heat,  can compromise the effectiveness of radiation detection equipment.  Extreme heat can accelerate the degradation of components within radiation detection equipment and, as a result, can affect the performance  and long-term sustainability of the equipment.

According to some advisors, however, host  governments may not always provide accurate information on what  equipment has been provided in the past, where it is currently located, and  its current operational status.", "According to State officials, there is no comprehensive interagency list of  radiation detection equipment that has been previously provided to foreign  governments by U.S. programs. In 2002, we recommended that State, as the  lead interagency coordinator, work with DOE and DOD to develop such a  list.

Because much of this equipment was provided  to the same countries by multiple agencies and programs, it is difficult to  determine the degree to which duplication of effort has occurred. For  example, since fiscal year 1994, a total of 17 different countries have  received handheld radiation detection equipment from more than one U.S.  agency. However, although DOE, DOD, and State programs each maintain  their own lists of radiation detection equipment provided to foreign  countries, officials at these agencies told us that they do not regularly share  such information with each other. Without the development of a  comprehensive interagency list of U.S.-funded radiation detection  equipment, program managers at DOE, DOD, and State cannot accurately  assess the equipment needs of countries where they plan to provide  assistance, may unknowingly provide duplicative sets of equipment, and  cannot determine if the equipment is being used for its intended purpose or  is in need of maintenance and repair."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Since the mid-1990s, DOE, DOD, and State have spent about $178 million to  provide a variety of radiation detection equipment to countries around the  world, and it is important that this equipment be properly maintained so  that it can be effectively used to combat nuclear smuggling overseas. Since  taking over responsibility for maintaining portal monitors deployed by  other agencies in 2002, DOE has worked to ensure that this equipment is  functioning and being used as intended. However, because DOE\u2019s  interagency maintenance agreement with State did not include maintaining  handheld radiation detection equipment previously provided by State and  other agencies, much of this equipment may not be properly functioning.  Handheld radiation detection equipment is vital for border officials to  conduct secondary inspections of vehicles or pedestrians. Without taking  steps to ensure that all previously provided radiation detection equipment,  specifically handheld equipment, is adequately maintained and remains  operational, State cannot ensure the continued effectiveness or long-term  sustainability of this equipment.", "Because corrupt officials could undermine the effectiveness of U.S.  radiation detection assistance programs overseas by turning off radiation  detection equipment or not properly responding to alarms, it is important  for U.S. programs to employ anticorruption efforts, such as multitiered  communication systems for radiation alarms, training, employee  dependability programs, and redundant installations of equipment when  providing such assistance. While we are encouraged that DOE, DOD, and  State employ some corruption mitigation measures in their programs, DOE  is still in the process of determining in which countries it will provide these  specific anticorruption measures and how much such assistance would  cost to implement.", "In addition, though DOE has maintained less sophisticated radiation portal  monitors previously deployed by other agencies since 2002, it has not  upgraded the equipment at any of these sites. As a result, border sites with  less sophisticated radiation portal monitors are more vulnerable to nuclear  smuggling than sites with equipment that can detect both gamma and  neutron radiation. We originally reported on this problem in our May 2002  report. In its official comments on that report, DOE stated that these less  sophisticated monitors \u201care not as reliable [as monitors with both gamma  and neutron radiation detection capabilities], and have limited or no ability  to detect shielded plutonium.\u201d Although it is encouraging that DOE has  recently undertaken an assessment of the equipment it maintains that was  installed by other U.S. agencies, DOE has not yet improved the neutron  detection capabilities of any of these less sophisticated monitors, with the  exception of one site in Azerbaijan. As a result, these sites remain just as  vulnerable to certain types of nuclear smuggling as they were when we first  reported this deficiency in May 2002.", "Finally, we believe that, unless key components such as overall program  cost estimates, projected time frames for completion, and specific  performance measures are incorporated into the interagency strategic  plan, State will be limited in its ability to determine the amount of  resources and time needed to achieve the broader interagency goals  discussed in its plan or to effectively measure U.S. programs\u2019 progress  toward achieving these goals. Furthermore, without accurate information  on the current status and location of radiation detection equipment  previously provided by U.S. programs, State cannot effectively fulfill its  role as interagency coordinator of U.S. assistance.

Once we determined which specific advisors to  interview, we created a list, which we then randomly ordered to provide an  unbiased approach to conducting our interviews. Our goal was to talk with  all the advisors on the list, but we knew that circumstances might prevent  that so we used a randomized list to provide the order of contacting the  advisors. We initiated contact with each advisor from this list, but if we  could not establish contact with that advisor, we attempted to establish  contact with the next advisor on our list. In some instances, we slightly  modified our list due to unforeseen developments. For example, during our  visit to the Republic of Georgia, we became aware of a Department of State  project to install radiation detection equipment in Armenia opposite the  Georgian border. Since this met our criteria for including a country in our  pool of interviewees, we agreed it was appropriate, for the purposes of this  review, to add Armenia. We then contacted the in-country advisor stationed  in Armenia to learn more about this project. In addition, we removed the  responses from the advisor in Russia from our total list of advisors because  he failed to respond to more than half of our questions and stated that his  role in coordinating this type of assistance in Russia is nonexistent because  DOE, through its SLD-Core program, conducts and coordinates radiation  detection assistance provided to Russia. Lastly, we interviewed the advisor  responsible for overseeing implementation of U.S. assistance to the  Republic of Georgia because Georgia has received radiation detection  equipment in the past from multiple U.S. programs.
