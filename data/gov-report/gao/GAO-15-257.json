After nearly 7 years, the CBDP Enterprise has not fully achieved its goal to identify required infrastructure capabilities. The Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense Program Analysis and Integration Office (PAIO), CBDP's analytical arm, recommended in 2008 that the CBDP Enterprise identify required infrastructure capabilities, such as laboratories to research chemical and biological agents, to ensure alignment of the infrastructure to its mission. CBDP Enterprise officials recognize the importance, validity, and necessity of addressing the 2008 recommendation. The CBDP Enterprise has made limited progress in achieving this infrastructure goal because CBDP Enterprise officials told GAO that they were focused on higher priorities and had no CBDP Enterprise-wide impetus to address the infrastructure recommendations. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs previously identified the need for an entity that has the responsibility and authority needed to ensure achievement of this goal, but DOD has not designated such an entity. By identifying and designating an entity with the responsibility and authority to lead infrastructure transformation, the CBDP Enterprise would be better positioned to achieve this goal.", "The CBDP Enterprise has taken some actions at its laboratories to identify duplication in its chemical and biological defense infrastructure. DOD directives outline goals, such as to avoid duplication by using existing DOD and other federal agencies' facilities. As part of an ongoing study to identify required infrastructure, in July 2015 PAIO plans to inventory and analyze CBDP Enterprise infrastructure for potential duplication. However, study officials stated that they do not plan to identify, request, or consider information about infrastructure capabilities from existing studies of other federal agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security, because their office does not have the authority or resources to require such information. By considering existing information, which would not necessarily require new authority, PAIO will have more information about existing infrastructure inventory across the federal government, such as its capability and potential availability for use.", "The CBDP Enterprise used threat data and plans to use threat data and the results from risk assessments piloted in 2014 to support its future portfolio planning process to prioritize research and development investment. However, the CBDP Enterprise has not updated its guidance and planning process to fully institutionalize the use of risk assessments. Federal standards for internal control state that agencies should have written procedures to better ensure leadership directives are implemented. According to CBDP Enterprise officials, while updating the guidance would be beneficial, they had not committed to updating such guidance or established a time frame for doing so.

By having one entity (the  Joint Science and Technology Office) make decisions regarding the  selection of research and development projects to meet its mission, the  CBDP Enterprise is able to help reduce the potential for fragmentation  and overlap of its infrastructure and duplication of efforts within the  research and development component of the CBDP Enterprise.", "In addition, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is  piloting a Competency Management Initiative, among other things, to  identify any potential duplication and gaps across the knowledge and  skills of command personnel. The initiative, which includes the U.S. Army  Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) and the  U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense  (USAMRICD), examines intellectual capabilities and competencies  needed to meet the mission based on chemical and biological threats.  U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command officials expect  results from this initiative in 2015.", "Furthermore, the potential for duplication is reduced because the  missions of the CBDP Enterprise\u2019s four primary research and  development and test and evaluation facilities are different. For example,  USAMRICD focuses on medical chemical defense, USAMRIID focuses  on medical biological defense, Edgewood focuses on nonmedical  materiel solutions to chemical and biological threats, and West Desert  conducts developmental and operational testing and evaluation. The  difference in missions reduces the potential for fragmentation, overlap,  and duplication within the CBDP Enterprise. In addition, in responding to  our questionnaire, officials at CBDP\u2019s four primary facilities told us they  consider potential infrastructure fragmentation, overlap, and duplication  when determining whether additional infrastructure capabilities are  needed to support their work. For example, officials found the potential for  duplication during the planning phase for a new facility, which would  house animals for future research for USAMRIID on the National  Interagency Biodefense Campus at Fort Detrick, Maryland. A set of  studies on medical countermeasure test and evaluation facility  requirements, conducted for the U.S. Army Assistant Chief of Staff for  Facilities, Planning and Programming Division, determined, among other  things, that there was sufficient capacity for holding animals in existing  facilities that conduct research with animals. The study resulted in the  cancellation of USAMRIID\u2019s plans to construct a new medical  countermeasure test and evaluation facility, including a holding facility for  animals (vivarium), with an overall estimated cost savings of about $600  million, according to USAMRIID officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PAIO Began a Study of CBDP Enterprise Infrastructure to Identify Potential Duplication and Unnecessary Redundancy", "paragraphs": ["During the course of our review, PAIO began a study in January 2015 of  the CBDP Enterprise\u2019s infrastructure, among other things, to inventory  CBDP Enterprise infrastructure to support identification of (1) required  infrastructure capabilities and (2) any potential duplication and  unnecessary redundancy across the CBDP Enterprise\u2019s primary research  and development and test and evaluation facilities\u2019 physical infrastructure.  This study by PAIO will be the first CBDP Enterprise-wide review of  infrastructure since its 2008 review of nonmedical physical infrastructure  investments.", "PAIO developed an infrastructure implementation plan in July 2014 to  guide its study, among other things, to determine whether there are any  potentially duplicative or unnecessary redundant infrastructure  capabilities. PAIO plans to inventory CBDP Enterprise infrastructure from  July 2015 to October 2015. In addition, PAIO plans to analyze the  infrastructure information for potential duplication from October 2015 to  February 2016. Its infrastructure implementation plan states that there  can be value in some redundancy of infrastructure across the facilities  and that the definition of duplication and unnecessary redundancy, which  will be established during the study, will take this into account. For  example, West Desert at Dugway Proving Ground and Aberdeen Test  Center each has aircraft decontamination pads to support their testing  and evaluation mission. However, if an aircraft became contaminated with  a chemical or biological agent, the facilities have the infrastructure  capability to decontaminate a civilian or military aircraft during a  contingency or national emergency. According to West Desert officials,  having the infrastructure at both facilities allows aircraft coming from the  Pacific or Europe to be handled and decontaminated without the  additional risk of continental travel and refueling.", "However, during the course of our review, we found potential duplication  or redundant swatch testing infrastructure capabilities that may not add  value to CBDP\u2019s test and evaluation infrastructure capabilities.  Specifically, West Desert and Edgewood both have the infrastructure to  conduct testing of swatch material for chemical agents. In addition, the  Quality Evaluation Facility at Pine Bluff Arsenal, Arkansas, a non-CBDP  Enterprise DOD facility, also has swatch testing infrastructure capabilities.  For example, officials from the Joint Program Executive Office for  Chemical and Biological Defense, one of the swatch testing customers for  all three facilities, told us that its current workload would not completely fill  the capacity of either of the CBDP facilities, which could indicate potential  duplication if other DOD or private sector customers did not require  services to ensure each facility is at full capacity. According to Edgewood  and West Desert officials, having swatch testing infrastructure capabilities  in both locations enables efficient transition of technology and continuity  of data from early research and development at Edgewood to advanced  development and operational testing by West Desert. Officials from PAIO  stated that their study will review similar infrastructure examples, but  within the CBDP Enterprise only, to determine what infrastructure, if any,  is duplicative or redundant and what infrastructure, if any, is necessary  redundancy.", "As part of the study methodology, PAIO plans to obtain input from the  Joint Science and Technology Office, the Joint Program Executive Office  for Chemical and Biological Defense, and the Deputy Under Secretary of  the Army for Test and Evaluation and provide the results of its  infrastructure inventory and any potential duplication found to the primary  research and development and test and evaluation facilities. Once the  results are known later in 2015, facility leadership is then expected to  provide a rationale for sustaining any potentially duplicative or redundant  infrastructure capabilities. Finally, in October 2015, the study\u2019s  methodology provides that PAIO will analyze any additional information  from facility leadership to determine which infrastructure capabilities   are potentially duplicative or redundant. According to PAIO and   ODASD (CBD) officials, the study will provide information to CBDP  Enterprise leadership\u2014the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense  for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs and the  Executive Agent\u2014to support their decisions on any potential  infrastructure efficiencies and to support oversight of investment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PAIO Does Not Plan to Identify, Request, or Consider Information from Existing Infrastructure Studies from Other Federal Agencies as Part of Its Duplication Study", "paragraphs": ["PAIO plans to identify potential duplication within the CBDP Enterprise;  however, PAIO does not plan to identify, request, or consider information  from existing studies about infrastructure capabilities of other federal  agencies with research and development or test and evaluation  infrastructure to study chemical and biological threats.

Information about existing infrastructure inventory, such  as their capability to conduct specialized research of biological agents  with a known potential for aerosol transmission or that may cause serious  and potentially lethal infections, and whether that infrastructure is  available for use to help avoid duplication within the CBDP Enterprise,  would help bolster PAIO\u2019s study.", "In addition, examples of our prior work on fragmentation, overlap, and  duplication found that multiple agencies were involved in federal efforts to  combat chemical or biological threats. We also found that it may be  appropriate for multiple agencies or programs to be involved in the same  area of work due to the nature or magnitude of the federal effort;  however, multiple programs and capabilities may also create  inefficiencies, such as the examples found in our prior reports. For  example, in 1999, prior to the anthrax attacks in the United States, we  found ineffective coordination among DOD and other federal agencies  with chemical and biological programs that could result in potential gaps  or overlap in research and development programs. Further, we found in  September 2009 that there was no federal entity responsible for oversight  of the expansion of high-containment laboratories\u2014those designed for  handling dangerous pathogens and emerging infectious diseases\u2014 across the federal government. We also found in June 2010 that the  mission responsibilities and resources needed to develop a  biosurveillance capability\u2014the ability to provide early detection and  situational awareness of potentially catastrophic biological events\u2014were  dispersed across a number of federal agencies, creating potential  inefficiencies and overlap and duplication of effort. Finally, in May 2014,  we found that the Department of Health and Human Services coordinates  and leads federal efforts to determine CBRN medical countermeasure  priorities and the development and acquisition of CBRN medical  countermeasures for the civilian sector, primarily through the Public  Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise\u2014an interagency  body that includes other federal agencies with related responsibilities.

However, according to PAIO and  ODASD (CBD) officials, PAIO does not have the authority and resources  to require other federal agencies to provide information about their  infrastructure capabilities. DOD Directives 5134.08 and 3200.11 outline  policy goals, among other things, for avoiding duplication, such as using  existing DOD and other federal agency facilities and conducting certain  oversight activities aimed at avoiding unnecessary duplication within the  CBDP Enterprise. According to CBDP Enterprise officials, these types  of deliberate data sharing arrangements can be enhanced by interagency  agreements that are directed and supported at more senior levels within  each department. Identifying, requesting, and considering information  from existing infrastructure studies from other federal agencies about their  chemical and biological infrastructure capabilities would not necessarily  require new authority.

While the CBDP Enterprise should continue to address its priorities, it  remains important that it also ensures that its infrastructure is aligned to  meet its mission given ever-changing threats. Additional actions would  help the CBDP Enterprise to more effectively and efficiently identify, align,  and manage DOD\u2019s chemical and biological defense infrastructure. By  identifying and designating an entity with the responsibility and authority  to lead the effort for ensuring the timely achievement of the CBDP  Enterprise\u2019s infrastructure goals to identify required infrastructure  capabilities and by establishing timelines and milestones to implement the  2008 PAIO recommendations and the goal established in the 2012 CBDP  Business Plan, the CBDP Enterprise would be better positioned to align  its infrastructure to meet its mission to address threats. Thus, the CBDP  Enterprise would be able to determine whether its infrastructure is  properly aligned to meet its mission to address current and emerging  chemical and biological threats. Implementing the 2008 PAIO  recommendation that the CBDP Enterprise identify its required  infrastructure capabilities is an important first step in identifying potential  infrastructure duplication that may exist across the CBDP Enterprise. By  identifying, requesting, and considering information from existing  infrastructure studies of other federal agencies about their chemical and  biological infrastructure capabilities, PAIO may be better positioned to  enhance its study by providing additional information, for example, about  infrastructure capability and the availability of facilities, to help the CBDP  Enterprise avoid potential infrastructure duplication and gain potential  efficiencies by using those agencies\u2019 existing infrastructure.

We made  several recommendations to address these issues, including identifying a  single entity charged with periodic government-wide strategic evaluation  of high-containment laboratories, developing a mechanism for sharing  lessons learned from reported laboratory accidents, and implementing a  personnel reliability program for high-containment laboratories, among  other recommendations. In our February 2013 report on high-containment  laboratories, we made two recommendations\u2014first, that periodic  assessment of national biodefense research and development needs be  conducted and, second, that the Executive Office of the President, Office  of Science and Technology Policy, examine the need to establish national  standards for high-containment laboratories. The Executive Office of the  President, Office of Science and Technology Policy, concurred with our  two recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Biosurveillance Focal Point", "paragraphs": ["Regarding biosurveillance, in June 2010, we found that the federal  government could benefit from a focal point that provides leadership to  the interagency community developing this capability. Biosurveillance is  the ability to provide early detection and situational awareness of  potentially catastrophic biological events. Specifically, we found that the  mission responsibilities and resources needed to develop a  biosurveillance capability were dispersed across a number of federal  agencies, creating the potential for overlap and duplication of effort. In  addition, we found that there was no broad, integrated national strategy  that encompassed all stakeholders with biodefense responsibilities to  guide the prioritization and allocation of investment across the entire  biodefense enterprise, among other responsibilities. We made two  recommendations to the Homeland Security Council within the Executive  Office of the President to (1) identify a focal point, which was  implemented when an Interagency Policy Group was convened to  complete a National Biosurveillance Strategy in 2012 and (2) develop a  national biosurveillance strategy, which remains open until a mechanism  to identify resource and investment needs, including investment priorities,  is included in an implementation plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coordination on Biological Countermeasures", "paragraphs": ["See GAO, Public Health Preparedness: Developing and Acquiring Medical  Countermeasures Against Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Agents,  GAO-11-567T (Washington, D.C.: Apr. 13, 2011).", "Security.
