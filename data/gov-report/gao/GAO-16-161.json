For example, the Defense Logistics Agency-Strategic Materials office methodically analyzes risks for all materials, but its focus is a four-year timeframe with stockpiling as its mitigation tool. The Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy office relies on other DOD organizations to identify and elevate risks, relies primarily on the market to resolve supply disruptions, and has not put in place measures to evaluate the success of its mitigating actions.

U.S. industry previously performed  all steps in the rare earths supply chain and produced the majority of the  global supply but no longer has the capability. DOD reported in 2014 that  there have been no availability issues and expects none in the near term.  DOD has been generally directed by law since at least 2011 to take  actions concerning supply chain vulnerabilities for materials, such as rare  earths.

Rare earth elements are  often classified as either heavy or light based, in part, on their chemical  properties. According to the United States Geological Survey, heavy rare  earth elements are generally less abundant and more expensive due to  their scarcity, more unique characteristics, and strong demand relative to  the light rare earth elements. DOD has a particular interest in two heavy  rare earth elements, yttrium and dysprosium.", "Rare earth elements are generally found in mined ore, separated and  converted into intermediary forms, such as oxides, and further processing  depends on the application. For example, the intermediary form can be  turned into a metal, and added to other materials to form an alloy for use  in semi-finished metal components that are incorporated into end  products. The United States was the leader in global production of rare  earth oxides, metals, and alloys from the 1960s through the 1980s but  currently has limited capability. According to a 2013 Congressional  Research Service report, global production is prevalent outside the United  States due, in part, to lower labor costs and more lenient environmental  standards. At present, the United States generally relies on imports from  global manufacturers of rare earths, such as metals, alloys, and magnets.  See figure 2 for a representative rare earth metals supply chain that is  generally outside the United States.", "The United States is a major consumer of defense and commercial end  products containing rare earths, however, its demand for rare earths is  approximately nine percent of the global demand, according to DOD  estimates. Also, DOD demand is approximately only one percent of the  United States demand. Recent studies have shown that rare earths are  essential to the production, sustainment, and operation of U.S. military  equipment. Reliable access to the necessary material, regardless of the  overall level of defense demand, is a bedrock requirement for DOD.  Some defense applications with rare earths are coatings for jet engines,  missile guidance systems, antimissile defense systems, satellites, and  communication systems. Examples of commercial products with rare  earths are automotive catalytic converters, petroleum refining chemicals,  flat panel displays, permanent magnets, and rechargeable batteries for  hybrid vehicles.", "Since 2010, DOD has conducted studies and published reports on  various rare earths issues in response to congressional mandates (see  table 1 below).", "DOD also periodically issues two reports on the defense industrial base  and on \u201ccritical\u201d and \u201cstrategic and critical\u201d materials.

The DOD Inspector  General found that DLA-Strategic Materials lacked procedures to validate  supply and demand data for its stockpiling model. Further, the Inspector  General identified internal control weaknesses related to the assessment  of rare earth element supply and demand for defense applications.  Specifically, the Inspector General found that DOD lacked a  comprehensive and reliable approach to assess rare earth element  supply and demand.

Based on GAO\u2019s prior work, the Office of  the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Industrial Policy, the  predecessor of MIBP, stated that it was collaborating with the Defense  Logistics Agency\u2019s National Defense Stockpile Center to create  department-wide criteria for the terms \u201ccritical\u201d and \u201cstrategic,\u201d and  expected to report the results of this effort at the end of calendar year  2008. As of November 2015, there were no department-wide criteria for  these terms, but DOD officials said that they were considering discussing  the definitions and possibly proposing a group of materials that meet the  SMPB\u2019s definition of critical to national security.

Overall, 15 of the 17 rare earths were identified as critical  at some point in the last 5 years. None of the organizations identified  cerium or promethium as having met the definitions during that time  period. See table 4 for the rare earths that each DOD organization  separately identified as critical in defense applications, critical to national  security, or as strategic and critical in different reports.", "DOD\u2019s identification of which rare earths, if any, are critical to national  security is fragmented. Three DOD organizations separately identified  five different lists of rare earths during this time frame using their  respective definitions of critical to national security. According to GAO\u2019s  risk management framework, comprehensive management of risk is a  necessary step for agencies, like DOD, to manage and assess risk to  help make informed decisions and prioritize resource investments. The  SMPB, with the duty of designating specific materials as critical to  national security, has reported to Congress in 2007, 2008, and 2011 that  its focus is to assess the criticality of materials and to identify which  materials are critical to national security, but has not done so. The  SMPB acknowledged that identifying the materials critical to national  security is necessary to ensure consistency among the DOD offices.  However, in a February 2014 letter from MIBP to DLA-Strategic Materials,  the respective offices of the chair and vice-chair of the SMPB, that  discusses cooperation concerning the SMPB, the designation of materials  critical to national security was not one of the areas outlined for proposed  coordination. DOD officials told us that they are generally working toward  coordinating MIBP\u2019s sector analyses of the defense industrial base\u2014such  as aircraft and ground vehicles\u2014with DLA-Strategic Materials\u2019 analyses  that support recommendations for materials to stockpile in order to have a  more comprehensive understanding of supply chains.", "DLA-Strategic Materials\u2019 responsibility for determining materials to  stockpile under certain scenarios has been considered by some within  DOD as a means to ensure materials critical to national security are  available. For example, MIBP officials told us that they rely on DLA- Strategic Materials\u2019 analyses and expertise for other responsibilities such  as MIBP\u2019s Title 10 responsibilities of ensuring reliable sources of  materials critical to national security. However, DLA-Strategic Materials  officials caveat their analyses as being valid for a single point in time and  for decisions related to their title 50 responsibilities for the National  Defense Stockpile, and not for other statutory responsibilities such as  identification of materials critical to national security in the Title 10  definitions. To demonstrate that its analyses are valid for a specific point  in time, DLA-Strategic Materials officials indicated that the identification of  rare earths that meet the definition for strategic and critical may differ over  time, unlike OUSD(AT&L)\u2019s and MIBP\u2019s lists, which have not changed. In  addition, the DOD-created emergency scenarios may change for each  biennial analysis, which affects DLA-Strategic Materials identification of  which materials meet the definition for strategic and critical. Moreover,  DLA-Strategic Materials officials told us that they are not responsible for  designating if a material is strategic and critical but are tasked with  determining if a material is estimated to have a shortfall in a given year  based upon DOD emergency scenarios.", "In addition to DOD\u2019s differing lists of critical rare earths, weapon system  officials at the military departments that we spoke with also have  identified what they consider as critical rare earths in their systems, but  this information is not reported consistently or department-wide. These  officials do not have a definition for critical materials nor do they have an  agreed upon department-wide list of critical rare earths, but they know  which rare earths provide enabling functionality in the weapon systems.  For example, a subject matter expert on lasers at Naval Surface Warfare\u2013 Crane told us that the rare earth component in certain defense lasers is  what creates and focuses the light beam. In another example, officials at  the Army Program Executive Office for Ammunition told us that rare earth  magnets enable guided artillery ammunition to move in flight to the target.  Further, Army Research Laboratory officials told us that they could better  focus their work on specific rare earths if there was a department-wide list  of rare earths critical to national security.", "Implementation of controls consistent with federal internal control  standards provides management with some added confidence regarding  the achievement of objectives, provides feedback on how effectively an  entity is operating, and helps reduce risks affecting the achievement of  the entity\u2019s objectives. In particular, these standards state that  management is to use data to create quality information that is  appropriate, current, complete, accurate, accessible, and provided on a  timely basis; and internally communicate the necessary quality  information. Information and communication are necessary to create an  effective internal control system that informs the allocation of resources in  relation to the areas of greatest risk relevant to achieving the entity\u2019s  objectives, such as efficient operations.", "From an industry perspective, we spoke with five defense and petroleum  corporations that took steps to assess risk to help make informed  decisions and prioritize resource investments. Company officials we  spoke with generally said that they determine what materials are critical  by obtaining data and communicating across product lines. Officials from  three corporations stated that they have a process to gather data  throughout the company and decide what materials may be critical to the  company as a whole. For example, an official from one company stated  that it regularly collects data from manufacturing divisions across the  company and differentiates critical materials by their ability to create a  production line stoppage. For potential material shortages that can stop  production, for example, company officials may have regular meetings  with the suppliers, forecast supplies 6 months into the future, adjust  contracting arrangements, and have mitigation actions in place.", "Given the differing interpretations of what rare earths are critical  according to the individual responsibilities of each organization, DOD has  not taken the next step to identify an appropriate, complete, timely list of  department-wide rare earths critical to national security.

MIBP\u2019s strategy is reactive, that is waiting for  a supply disruption to occur and relying on the market to respond.  Moreover, it may not be realistic.

Second, Army officials,  weapon systems subject matter experts, and industry representatives  said that substitutes for some rare earths are not preferred or do not exist  at this time.

We further found that as there  was no requirement for when to report such gaps to higher-level offices,  knowledge of defense supplier-base gaps across DOD could be limited.  Currently, MIBP partly relies on the Joint Industrial Base Working Group,  which consists of department-wide representatives, to identify industrial  base issues, such as rare earths unavailability or supply risk.

Further, although DLA-Strategic Materials\u2019 stockpiling efforts are  proactive, according to DOD officials, the department has never used the  rare earths from the National Defense Stockpile and does not know the  time and cost to establish the capability to process the stockpiled material  into a usable form, a necessary step to implement mitigating actions.  Currently, there is a limited commercial capability in the United States for  processing certain types of rare earths used in defense applications,  according to government and industry officials. We previously reported in  April 2010 that rebuilding a domestic rare earths supply chain may take  significant time and money. Industry representatives we spoke with  during this review agreed that while there is domestic expertise, with  limited domestic capability, turning certain stockpiled rare earths into a  useable form would most likely have to be conducted outside the United  States, which may also introduce risks of a supply disruption.

According to Industrial Analysis Center officials, only 10  percent of surveys sent to prime contractors for 79 acquisition category I  programs in July 2014 were returned with meaningful information.

We found DOD officials who  understood the vulnerability and effect of unavailability of rare earths  based on their knowledge of the supply chain for select weapon systems.  For example, a DOD-wide subject matter expert in radars at Naval  Surface Warfare Center\u2013Crane told us that rare earth magnets enable  microwave tubes to effectively focus the radar\u2019s energy. Without the  magnets, the radars cannot function and provide the needed capability to  the warfighter. Further, he said that there are no substitutes for the rare  earths in these magnets. His assessment was based, in part, on his  knowledge of and relationships with sub-tier contractors and weapon  system program officials. See figure 5 for a graphic example of how rare  earths enter the defense supply chain for radars based on information  from a defense industrial base report on radars, a subject matter expert  and other DOD officials, and company representatives. He added that  after the potential unavailability of rare earths in 2010, the Navy made a  deliberate effort to understand the materials, vendors, and supply chains  for DOD radars in order to determine the impact if rare earths were  unavailable. We found the Navy\u2019s efforts are similar to some of the  company approaches, discussed earlier, for managing risk. DLA-Strategic  Materials officials later said that it is not always necessary to track a  material through the supply chain to the weapon system to make a  stockpiling recommendation but did so when beneficial. For example, for  scandium used in ships, DLA-Strategic Materials did conduct a study that  went from mine to platform and included program offices and prime  contractors in their research due to specific manufacturing issues.", "Federal internal control standards state that management should define  objectives clearly to enable the identification of risks and define risk  tolerances in specific and measurable terms, including defining what is to  be achieved, who is to achieve it, how it will be achieved, and time frames  for achievement. Ultimately, SMPB has a goal of ensuring availability of  rare earths that are critical to national security. DOD has taken actions  without knowing the extent of the underlying risks the unavailability of rare  earths have on its weapon systems specifically and national defense  generally. By taking a comprehensive approach to meet this goal, such as  addressing processing of stockpiled materials from identified shortfalls  and defining metrics to measure risk and mitigating actions, the SMPB  may be better positioned to guide other DOD offices when to report rare  earths availability issues and to analyze the impact of the unavailability of  the materials."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Reliable access to the material it needs, such as rare earths, is a bedrock  requirement for DOD.

However, DOD  has no comprehensive, department-wide approach to determine which  rare earths are critical to national security, and how to deal with potential  supply disruptions to ensure continued, reliable access. It is important  that such an approach includes, for example, leveraging the dispersed  expertise in the department to identify which rare earths are critical,  analyzing risks to their supply and the effects of a potential disruption,  and taking actions to mitigate the specific risks. Developing a  comprehensive approach for ensuring a sufficient supply of rare earths for  national security needs\u2014one that can establish criticality, assess supply  risks, and identify mitigating actions\u2014would better position DOD to help  ensure continued functionality in weapon system components should a  disruption occur, even though supply disruptions in rare earths have not  occurred over the last several years. SMPB, with its statutory  responsibility and leadership from MIBP and DLA-Strategic Materials, is  well-positioned to take the lead on such an approach.", "There is not yet agreement on what constitutes \u201ccritical\u201d rare earths.  While various organizations\u2019 definitions of critical may be similar, DOD  has identified 15 of the 17 rare earths as critical over the last 5 years.  This makes establishing priorities to analyze supply risk difficult. DLA- Strategic Materials does a methodical job of analyzing risks for all  materials, but its focus is a four-year timeframe with stockpiling as its  mitigation tool. MIBP relies on other DOD organizations to identify and  elevate risks, relies primarily on the market to resolve supply disruptions,  and has not put in place measures to evaluate the success of its  mitigating actions. The efforts by the military departments, such as the  Navy, to identify and mitigate risks by monitoring the defense supplier  base have been limited in scope or lacked department-wide involvement.  Without clear definitions and metrics to identify associated risk tolerances,  it will be difficult for MIBP to monitor and adjust its mitigating actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To fully identify and mitigate risks associated with the availability of rare  earths, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the following  three actions:", "Direct the SMPB to designate which, if any, rare earths are critical to  national security in order to provide a common DOD understanding of  those materials and focus resources.", "Direct the SMPB to analyze the effect of unavailability of rare earths  designated as critical to national security and develop a strategy to  help ensure a secure supply for those designated critical to national  security.", "Direct MIBP to define reliable sources and secure supply for rare  earths in measurable terms and to provide metrics to determine the  effectiveness of its actions to better ensure continued availability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment.

In DOD\u2019s written response it  identified that the SMPB will convene a meeting with the purpose of  accomplishing both these tasks before the end of fiscal year 2016.", "DOD also concurred with our recommendation to the Secretary of  Defense to direct MIBP to define reliable sources and secure supply for  rare earths and provide metrics to determine the effectiveness of its  actions. In response DOD wrote that MIBP addresses this  recommendation by carrying out its responsibilities under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7  139c by providing its input to the Secretary of Defense\u2019s Biennial Report  on Stockpile Requirements and that the metrics and analyses used in  Biennial Report on Stockpile Requirements do evaluate the effectiveness  of the department\u2019s actions. However, we are concerned whether the  Biennial Report on Stockpile Requirements addresses the department\u2019s  responsibilities under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 139c. As stated earlier in the report, in  carrying out responsibilities under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 98 et seq., DLA-Strategic  Materials officials caveat their analyses as being valid for a single point in  time and for decisions related to the National Defense Stockpile and not  for other statutory responsibilities such as MIBP\u2019s identification of  materials critical to national security in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 139c. Further, MIBP,  in its response, has not explained how its input for the Biennial Report on  Stockpile Requirements will define reliable sources and secure supply,  and what metrics that the report will provide to determine the  effectiveness of the department\u2019s mitigation efforts.", "In addition, DOD, in its technical comments, disagreed with our  characterization that DOD has no department-wide approach for critical  materials. We agree that DLA-Strategic Materials\u2019 process may be  ongoing, methodical, and incorporate information from DOD, government,  and industry sources, however, as stated in the report, the assessments  are limited to a four-year time frame related to DOD defined national  emergencies. Further, during our review, DLA-Strategic Materials officials  told us that they caveat their analyses as being valid for a single point in  time and for decisions specifically related to the National Defense  Stockpile, and thereby not necessarily for determining criticality for  national security purposes. We continue to believe our findings  demonstrate the need for a comprehensive approach for ensuring a  sufficient supply of rare earths for national security needs\u2014one that can  establish criticality, assess supply risks, and identify mitigating actions\u2014 beyond planning scenarios used for purposes of the National Defense  Stockpile.
