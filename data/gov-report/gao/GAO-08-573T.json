A number of provisions are designed to benefit our employees and to provide a means to continue to attract, retain, and reward a top-flight workforce, while other provisions are aimed at helping us improve our operations and increase administrative efficiencies. We ask for Congressional support of these measures and have outlined each of them below. On September 19, 2007, our Band I and Band II Analysts, Auditors, Specialists, and Investigators voted to be represented by the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE) for the purpose of bargaining with GAO management on various terms and conditions of employment. GAO management is committed to working constructively with employee union representatives to forge a positive labor-management relationship. Since September, GAO management has taken a variety of steps to ensure it is following applicable labor relations laws and has the resources in place to work effectively and productively in this new union environment. Our efforts have involved: (1) postponing work on several initiatives regarding our current performance and pay programs; (2) delivering specialized labor-management relations training to our Band III, Band III-equivalent, SES, and Senior Level staff; (3) establishing a new Workforce Relations Center within our Human Capital Office that is responsible for providing employee relations and labor relations advice and services to GAO management and leadership; (4) hiring a Workforce Relations Center director, who also serves as our chief negotiator in collective bargaining deliberations. In addition, we routinely notify union representatives of meetings that may qualify as formal discussions, so that a representative of the GAO Employees Organization, IFPTE, can attend the meeting. We also regularly provide the GAO Employees Organization, IFPTE, with information about projects involving changes to terms and conditions of employment over which the union has the right to bargain. We are pleased that GAO and the GAO Employees Organization, IFPTE, reached a prompt agreement on 2008 pay adjustments. The agreement was overwhelmingly ratified by bargaining unit members on February 14, 2008, and we have applied the agreed-upon approach to the 2008 adjustments to all GAO staff, with the exception of the SES and Senior-Level staff, regardless of whether they are represented by the union. Recruiting, rewarding, and retaining a high-performing diverse workforce is critical if GAO is to successfully carry out its mission in support of the Congress. An effective GAO requires a first-rate workforce that is representative of our society and steeped in a wide variety of disciplines that can gather the facts and develop innovative solutions to both old and new problems challenging the federal government. This overall positive work environment is one of many reasons GAO's dedicated and talented workforce is able to effectively serve the Congress and produce solid results for the American people. Last fiscal year, our work contributed to hundreds of improvements in government operations and benefits, as well as $45.9 billion in financial benefits or a $94 return for every dollar the Congress invested in us. We also contributed to over 270 congressional hearings and provided hundreds of valuable products to assist the Congress on topics as wide ranging as food safety, border patrol, and tax compliance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss several  important topics: provisions of H.R. 3268, the GAO Act, that would bolster our ability to  attract and retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce needed to serve  the Congress and provide for operational improvements and  administrative efficiencies;    steps we are taking to establish and maintain a constructive working  relationship with the GAO Employees Organization, International  Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE); and    my commitment to ensure fair and equitable treatment for all segments of  our diverse workforce, as reinforced by our commissioning of a study of  various performance assessment issues related to African-American  Analysts at GAO."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Importance of GAO Act Provisions", "paragraphs": ["The GAO Act contains several distinct and critical components.

We ask for your support of these  measures and have outlined each of them below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Human Capital and Compensation Provisions", "paragraphs": ["Permit the GS-15 statutory cap to rise to the Executive Level III  Our pay surveys indicated that certain higher-level economists, attorneys,  management positions, and specialists would warrant salaries above GS- 15, step 10. This authority would enable GAO to compensate these skilled  professionals and managers up to Executive Level III when justified, thus  aiding GAO in its recruitment and retention efforts. This authority is  similar to flexibilities exercised by other agencies. For example, the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and other agencies concerned with  financial matters are not subject to the GS-15 cap. The Departments of  Defense and Homeland Security likewise have the ability to pay their staff  more than this limit. If this authority is granted, GAO would use its  increased pay flexibility only when justified by pay surveys or other  compensation data.", "Allow GAO to incur recruiting expenses for meals and related expenses  GAO\u2019s work requires skilled professionals for whom GAO must compete  with leading private sector and public organizations. GAO would like the  ability to incur recruiting expenditures for meals and related expenses.  This small, but important, step would enhance GAO\u2019s effort to attract top  talent. At this time, both the Department of Defense for recruiting military  members (10 U.S.C \u00a7520c) and the Coast Guard (14 U.S.C. \u00a7468) have  similar provisions. We would use this authority frugally.", "Achieve equal footing regarding voluntary separation incentive  payments (VSIP)", "The law authorizing GAO to provide VSIPs requires GAO to make a  substantial payment to the retirement fund\u2014no less than 45 percent of an  employee\u2019s final basic pay\u2014which renders the flexibility virtually  unusable. This contrasts with the flexibility given to the executive branch  for VSIPs. While the Department of Defense has agency-specific VSIP  authority, and executive branch agencies\u2014with Office of Personnel  Management (OPM) approval\u2014have general VSIP authority, in both  instances the statutory authority for these programs does not require any  payments to the retirement fund for the granting of a VSIP. Removing this  requirement would put GAO on an equal footing with other agencies, make  VSIPs more practical, and provide an important flexibility to help GAO  reshape its workforce should such authority become necessary.", "Include performance-based bonuses in calculating non-Senior Executive  Service and non-Senior Level employees\u2019 \u201chigh-three\u201d average salary for  retirement purposes  GAO\u2019s performance-based compensation system provides a nonpermanent  bonus component for some of our employees. As our employees have  pointed out, under current law, they do not get credit for these bonuses  when OPM calculates their \u201chigh-three\u201d average salary for retirement  purposes. The GAO Act would remedy the situation by directing that  bonuses be included in the \u201chigh-three\u201d calculation. This provision does  not apply to Senior Executive Service (SES) and Senior Level employees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Related Compensation Proposals", "paragraphs": ["Before turning to provisions in the GAO Act related to operational  improvements and administrative efficiencies, let me address two  important proposals related to employee compensation that\u2014while not  included in H.R. 3268\u2014have been under discussion as well.", "Adopting a \u201cfloor guarantee\u201d for future annual pay adjustments  We support the adoption of a \u201cfloor guarantee\u201d provision for future annual  pay adjustments. We first raised a similar concept with Members of the  Subcommittee last May. Just last month, our negotiating team introduced  the idea to the GAO Employees Organization, IFPTE, which agreed to  adopt a floor guarantee as part of the agreement governing 2008 pay  adjustments. We were pleased to reach a prompt agreement and believe  the floor guarantee reasonably balances our commitment to performance- based pay with an appropriate degree of predictability and equity for all  GAO employees.", "A statutorily based floor guarantee would provide GAO employees with  greater certainty about future salary increases and ensure at least pay  parity with the executive branch. We support the floor guarantee approach  because we believe it will preserve the incentives and rewards of GAO\u2019s  performance-based compensation system, while ensuring\u2014subject to the  conditions explained below\u2014that GAO employees receive an annual  increase in their permanent pay that is at least equal to GS across-the- board increase for each locality area.", "The floor guarantee would ensure that all employees performing at the  \u201cmeets expectations\u201d level or better would receive an annual adjustment  to their basic rate that is at least equal to the total annual increase under  the General Schedule (GS) system for the employees\u2019 geographic area.  The only exceptions would be employees (1) receiving ratings below the  \u201cmeets expectations\u201d level, (2) participating in development programs  under which they receive performance reviews and permanent merit pay  increases more than once a year, (3) occupying positions covered by the  Federal Wage System, or (4) occupying SES or Senior Level positions.", "The floor guarantee would be implemented in the following manner. We  would continue to apply the system we implemented in 2006, as  authorized by GAO\u2019s 2004 legislation. Thus, we first would determine for  each employee the amount of GAO\u2019s annual adjustment and performance- based compensation, which includes both permanent merit pay  adjustments and any nonpermanent bonuses. Then, if the sum of the  employee\u2019s annual adjustment and permanent merit pay is less than the  increase the employee would have received under the annual adjustment  to the GS in the employee\u2019s geographic area, we would increase the  employee\u2019s permanent pay to equal the increase that would have been  received under the annual adjustment to the GS system that year. If an  employee receives an additional adjustment as a result of the floor  guarantee, the additional amount would be deducted from any bonus an  employee would have received.", "We understand that consideration has been given to including a legislative  provision that would compensate GAO employees who did not receive the  full base pay increases of 2.6 percent in 2006 and 2.4 percent in 2007. At  the invitation of subcommittee staff, we have engaged in fruitful  discussions about a reasonable and practical approach should the  Congress decide to accomplish this objective legislatively. We appreciate  the subcommittee\u2019s willingness to consider providing GAO with the  necessary legal and funding authorities to address this issue. Resolution of  this matter would be helpful and would permit us to move forward on  other important human capital initiatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Operational Improvements and Administrative Efficiencies", "paragraphs": ["The GAO Act also contains a number of provisions to promote operational  improvements and efficiencies. These include establishing a statutory  Inspector General at GAO, providing the Congress with more information  on the level of executive branch cooperation received by GAO in the  conduct of our work, authorizing reimbursement for certain financial  audits, allowing GAO more flexibility in administering oaths, receiving  gifts that do not impair our independence, and clarifying financial  disclosure requirements.", "Establish a statutory inspector general  The GAO Act would replace our current inspector general (IG) position  with a statutory position. GAO supports the IG concept and  administratively has created an IG who performs many of the roles of the  statutory IGs. GAO\u2019s statutory IG would be similar to the statutory IGs in  the other legislative branch agencies. Although appointed by the heads of  their respective agencies (or by the Capitol Police Board, in the case of the  Capitol Police IG), these statutory IGs are provided with independence  and autonomy from the heads of their agencies. They conduct and  supervise audits and investigations, and they endeavor to prevent and  detect fraud and abuse in their agencies\u2019 programs and operations. This is  the model followed in H.R. 3268 for GAO\u2019s statutory IG.", "Report on executive branch cooperation  Although the Comptroller General has certain statutory mechanisms  available to aid in conducting GAO audits and investigations, voluntary  cooperation of agency officers and employees of audited agencies is  essential to the efficiency of GAO\u2019s work. The GAO Act includes two new  reporting requirements to provide more transparency related to the level  of cooperation GAO is receiving from audited agencies. The first would  require an annual report card on the overall cooperation of federal  agencies in all aspects of GAO\u2019s work, including any unreasonable delays  in making personnel available for interviews, providing written answers to  questions, granting access to records, providing timely comments on draft  reports, and responding appropriately to report recommendations. The  second reporting requirement would require that the Comptroller General  inform the Congress as soon as practicable regarding specific  impediments, such as when an agency or other entity does not make  personnel available for interviews or does not provide written answers to  questions.", "Obtain reimbursement of certain financial audit costs  The GAO Act also includes a provision to enable GAO to be reimbursed for  the financial audits it performs that, in the first instance, are the specific  responsibility of an executive branch agency. Since 1997, the Comptroller  General has elected to exercise his statutory discretion to audit the  financial statements of the Internal Revenue Service and the Schedule of  Federal Debt, issued by the Bureau of the Public Debt, in lieu of the  Treasury IG or an independent Certified Public Accountant hired by the  IG. As a result, the Department of the Treasury has received these audit  services at no cost and without reimbursing GAO. This legislation would  require, beginning in fiscal year 2009, any executive branch agency  covered by the Chief Financial Officers Act (CFO Act) and Accountability  for Tax Dollars Act for which GAO elects to audit financial statements or  related schedules to reimburse the Comptroller General for the cost of  performing such audits. Such payment would be consistent with the  principle that agencies should pay for financial statement audit services,  as they otherwise must when the audit is conducted by their IGs or  independent contracted auditors. This principle already has been applied  to reimbursements made to GAO by the Securities and Exchange  Commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as well as  other government corporations for financial statement audits conducted  by GAO under separate legal authorities.", "Provide GAO with greater flexibilities in administering oaths  Currently, the Comptroller General is authorized to administer oaths to  witnesses when auditing and settling accounts. Although in 1921, when the  Congress established GAO, auditing and settling accounts represented the  bulk of our work, that is not the case today. The Comptroller General has  been called upon to perform many other audit, investigative, and  adjudicative roles for the Congress. These roles periodically raise  situations involving, for example, potential criminal or ethical violations,  or conflicting testimony or assertions of material and sensitive subjects. In  such situations, the ability to administer oaths would be a useful and  important tool for the Comptroller General to accomplish his work for the  Congress. The new authority is not expected to be widely used or to have  broad impact.", "Give GAO the same gift authority as other agencies  Under the GAO Act, the Comptroller General would receive the same  authority presently available to many agency heads to aid them in  accomplishing their mission. Specifically, the Comptroller General would  be authorized to accept and dispose of gifts given for the purpose of aiding  and facilitating the work of the office. To implement this authority, we  would promulgate regulations to ensure that no conflict or appearance of  a conflict would arise when accepting any gifts.", "GAO is seeking a revision to the law regarding the financial disclosure  requirements of its employees to address an unintended result of GAO\u2019s  revised pay system that vastly increased the number of employees who  must file a public financial disclosure report. Under GAO\u2019s new pay  system, GAO employees no longer receive severable locality pay  adjustments, as compensation differences in local markets are already  taken into account in setting the pay ranges for GAO\u2019s various locations.", "The inability to exclude amounts formerly attributable to locality pay has  roughly doubled the number of GAO employees who must file a public  disclosure report. This amendment would remedy this situation by  deducting these amounts from employees\u2019 annual rate of pay for purposes  of determining who must file a public financial disclosure report. This  would substantially reduce administrative burden while assuring that  GAO\u2019s senior employees remain required to file a public financial  disclosure report. The employees who no longer would be required to file  a public report would still be required to file a confidential financial  disclosure report for review within GAO under GAO\u2019s ethics rules."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Remaining Provisions", "paragraphs": ["In the draft bill that we transmitted to the committee last July, there were  a number of provisions related to the Office of the Comptroller General  and the positions of Comptroller General and Deputy Comptroller  General.

For example, we  enhanced our professional development programs for entry level staff;  initiated a formal agencywide mentoring program; and continue our strong  support for flexible work schedules and teleworking to help GAO  employees balance the demands of work and home. GAO\u2019s two most  recent testimonies before this subcommittee outlined many other support  measures and safeguards in place to help ensure fair and equitable  treatment of all employees.", "As circumstances warrant, we also are committed to studying areas in  depth where we have reason to believe that actions and improvements are  needed. One such example is GAO\u2019s decision in August 2007 to contract  with the Ivy Planning Group (Ivy) for an independent assessment of  differences in the averages of African-American Analysts\u2019 performance  compared with white Analysts and to provide the Ivy team with complete  access to relevant data and staff. Shortly after the contract award, we  provided Ivy with all requested data on appraisals; employee  demographics; employee education and skills; and information on GAO\u2019s  performance management, pay, development, and recruitment programs.   Further, in response to additional Ivy requests after they conducted  employee and management interviews and focus groups, we provided  information related to hires and separations, employee feedback scores,  and exit survey results.", "We tasked Ivy with reviewing African-American and white Analysts\u2019  performance appraisal data from 2002 through 2006\u2014which was the data  available at the time Ivy\u2019s study began. In addition, we charged Ivy with  assessing and comparing the skills, assignments, engagement roles,  training, educational attainment, and recruiting practices at GAO for  African-American and white Analysts, as well as with identifying best  practices internally and externally that might enhance GAO\u2019s performance  management systems and assist us in reducing any gaps. Ivy has been  asked to recommend further steps that GAO can take to ensure fair,  consistent, and nondiscriminatory application of GAO\u2019s performance  management system.", "Ivy has not yet finished its analysis and is not scheduled to issue a final  report until April 2008. We are looking forward to receiving the final report  and its recommendations.

For example, while we missed a few of the targets we established, our  employee feedback survey scores, as shown in appendix I, for our  \u201cpeople\u201d measures on staff development, staff utilization, leadership, and  organizational climate have remained relatively stable even in a period of  significant change. Further, we are proud that GAO was named second  among large agencies across the federal government in the 2007 ranking of  best places to work, which was issued by the Partnership for Public  Service and the Institute for the Study of Public Policy Implementation at  American University. In addition, when results were analyzed by  demographic groups, GAO ranked second among female, African- American, and Hispanic employees.", "This overall positive work environment is one of many reasons GAO\u2019s  dedicated and talented workforce is able to effectively serve the Congress  and produce solid results for the American people.
