IRS has found that taxpayers\u2019 total compliance in paying taxes owed, including that directly induced by enforcement, has been roughly stagnant over the past 20 years at about 87 percent. IRS estimates that annual tax losses from the noncompliance have been well over $100 billion. IRS has set a goal to increase total compliance to 90 percent by 2001 and believes that its new compliance research approach will uncover ways to help meet this goal.", "This report discusses IRS\u2019 new compliance research approach.

It presumes that taxpayers understand the laws and are willing and able to follow them. If not, IRS must determine the reason and then act to restore compliance and maintain the flow of tax revenue. IRS traditionally has responded to noncompliance by using enforcement efforts such as auditing tax returns and computer matching data from third parties (e.g., banks and employers).", "Over time, IRS concluded that enforcement was essential to pursue intentional noncompliance but not to correct unintentional noncompliance. Because of this enforcement limitation and concerns about the level of noncompliance, IRS formulated a different compliance philosophy. Known as Compliance 2000, the philosophy envisioned using nonenforcement efforts to correct unintentional noncompliance and reserving enforcement efforts for intentional noncompliance. IRS first espoused this philosophy in 1988 and by the early 1990s had initiated many research projects across IRS\u2019 63 district offices to identify noncompliant market segments, root causes for the noncompliance, and innovative ways to improve compliance.", "Even so, noncompliance continued to result in major losses in tax revenue. IRS\u2019 most recent estimate put the gross income tax gap\u2014the difference between income taxes owed and voluntarily paid\u2014at $127 billion for 1992 alone. IRS estimated total tax compliance to be about 87 percent\u201483 percent in taxes paid voluntarily and 4 percent in taxes paid after IRS enforcement. IRS data have shown such total compliance to be stagnant since the early 1970s.", "Concerns about these trends prompted IRS to create the Compliance Research and Planning approach in 1993. This new approach attempts to merge the Compliance 2000 philosophy with a rigorous compliance research system. By combining IRS\u2019 National Office knowledge about research with its district knowledge about compliance and enforcement, IRS hoped to identify nonenforcement and enforcement efforts to help improve total compliance to 90 percent by 2001. This approach has required the establishment of new research methods, organizations, and tools.", "The research methods include a compliance research cycle that starts with identifying a noncompliant market segment and ends with using research results in ongoing compliance programs. The organizations include the National Office of Research and Analysis (NORA) in the Research Division and 31 District Offices of Research and Analysis (DORA). NORA has responsibility for developing and implementing the new approach. DORAs are responsible for researching national and district compliance levels and finding cost-effective wholesale solutions to noncompliance, with the support of three IRS functions\u2014Examination, Collection, and Taxpayer Service. Appendix II discusses the research cycle and organizations. As planned, the major research tool will be the Compliance Research Information System (CRIS).

To determine when it was best to use each approach, IRS sought to uncover root causes for noncompliance and distinguish between compliant and noncompliant taxpayers across market segments.", "Compliance 2000 did not work for various reasons. In 1992 testimony, we reported that IRS lacked the necessary compliance data and infrastructure to do research by market segments. We found that IRS had not tracked whether its districts started research projects on the basis of objective compliance data or researched the most noncompliant market segments. We concluded that Compliance 2000 was a worthy idea that needed careful implementation. We stated that IRS needed to use objective data to select research projects and develop an infrastructure for planning, managing, and monitoring the projects.", "An IRS Internal Audit report in December 1993 had similar findings. The report disclosed that 38 of 50 Compliance 2000 projects were traditional enforcement projects that the districts had renamed as Compliance 2000 projects. And IRS had no database to capture results or provide an inventory of the compliance issues covered. The report concluded that the projects did not represent rigorous research, the managerial controls were weak, and a management structure was needed to provide effective oversight.", "NORA officials acknowledged such problems and indicated that very few Compliance 2000 projects could be viewed as viable research. Even in the few projects that NORA officials viewed as viable, IRS had not created a database to show whether compliance increased and, if so, what actions prompted those increases.", "We sought to further confirm these problems by collecting data on Compliance 2000 projects as we visited the 31 DORAs. We confirmed that IRS did not track the methods and results of the projects. As shown in appendix I, we found that many projects were duplicated. Available records were insufficient for us to compare costs and benefits across the projects.", "We found that IRS learned many lessons about research from Compliance 2000. According to NORA officials, the major lesson was that IRS needed a totally new organization and approach because the decentralized approach under Compliance 2000 did not produce viable research. Our interviews at NORA and the 31 DORAs indicated that such lessons governed the design of the new approach, particularly those that IRS officials pointed to as factors critical to the success of this approach. These factors include the need for (1) support for the research across IRS, (2) objective compliance data that are readily accessible, (3) skilled staff, (4) a sound infrastructure to organize and manage the research, and (5) measures to evaluate how well the new approach is working.

NORA officials viewed the NORA/DORA framework as a way to correct these problems.", "Furthermore, IRS districts are forming Compliance Planning Councils (CPC) at the DORA level to build district support for compliance research, oversee district compliance programs, and provide a conduit to the three district functions. In summary, CPCs are to provide a multifunctional perspective in reviewing district compliance workload. At a minimum, each CPC is to consist of the DORA Chief and chiefs of the three functions.

However, only 38 percent of those we interviewed believed that the approach will significantly contribute to meeting IRS\u2019 90-percent compliance goal by 2001. When asked why, most of these officials viewed this goal as too challenging and the time period as too short.", "Proponents of the new approach favored its systemic and objective nature. They viewed national research on market segments, by reaching more noncompliant taxpayers, as the way to significantly improve compliance. Opponents, believing that major compliance problems are well known, favored shifting the research resources into efforts involving tax simplification and legislative changes, such as tax withholdings and income reporting. NORA officials noted that compliance research offers the best way to identify and justify such efforts.", "The first tension dealt with changing the IRS culture. IRS has focused on maximizing revenue yield through enforcement instead of voluntary compliance through enforcement and nonenforcement efforts. Our DORA work showed that the three functions largely expected the research to aim at this traditional focus. Given concerns that it will not, only 34 percent of the Chiefs of Examination, Collection, and Taxpayer Service we interviewed at the 31 DORAs considered DORA to be a good investment of resources. NORA officials believed that these responses did not reflect the broad, multifunctional view needed to increase compliance. These differing views reflect, at a minimum, the tension over the new approach.", "A second tension involved pressures to quickly produce high-profile results. We heard this concern during interviews at all 31 DORAs. Interviewees doubted whether IRS would give the approach time to prove itself. They said IRS often expects results right away, but compliance research is unlikely to produce immediate benefits.", "The third tension dealt with directing 85 percent of the DORA work to national compliance issues, leaving the remainder to the discretion of the district. District officials, who believed that many compliance issues have a local flavor, generally wanted more control. NORA officials, as well as DORA Chiefs, saw a national focus as the way to help improve compliance and reduce the tax gap.", "NORA officials recognize the seriousness of these and other tensions that undercut support for the new approach.

DORA staff complained that the data were outdated, inaccurate, and lacked compliance measures.", "After our visits, DORA staff began using data from Interim CRIS. The DORA Chiefs we interviewed during our follow-up work viewed the Interim CRIS as a far better system. However, only 39 percent of them thought the data were sufficient to do the work required at DORA. Among other things, they noted that Interim CRIS lacked historical data, compliance indicators, and enforcement actions against filed tax returns as well as on nonfilers.", "NORA officials acknowledged these problems but had viewed these earlier phases as training for DORA staff. They believed that the staff had sufficient data for such training and the assigned work. The officials said that Final CRIS and the data validation standards will address these problems and add discipline so that the staff only does the work made possible by the data.", "Even so, Final CRIS is developing more slowly than expected. NORA officials remain optimistic that its first database, involving individual filers, will be operational by fiscal year 1997. As for the other nine databases, such as for partnerships and corporations, IRS was not sure when they would be fully operational and how many can produce research results by 2001 on improving compliance.", "Furthermore, the postponement of TCMP heightens the need for finding other ways to measure reporting accuracy on filed returns. NORA officials told us that they viewed TCMP as a crucial part of CRIS because TCMP had been a proven way to measure reporting accuracy. Over three-fourths of the $94 billion tax gap for individuals in 1992 arose from noncompliance in reporting rather than in filing or in paying.", "IRS officials said that, without the randomness and comprehensiveness of TCMP, they doubted whether IRS will have a precise way to measure reporting compliance nationally or at the DORA level, or whether IRS will have a basis for identifying emerging noncompliance among market segments or tax issues.

The mixed support we found for the new research approach has caused tensions within IRS that could have an adverse impact on potential success. The fact that IRS might not have objective data available when needed for the research effort may make it difficult to produce useful research results in a timely manner.
