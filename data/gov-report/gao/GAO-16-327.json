The Army's force planning process seeks to link strategy to force structure given available resources through quantitative and qualitative analyses. The Army completed analyses showing that it could reduce its BCTs from 73 in fiscal year 2011 to a minimum of 52 in fiscal year 2017; however, the Army plans to retain 56 BCTs. Moreover, by redesigning its combat units, the Army plans to retain 170 combat battalions (units that fight the enemy)\u20143 fewer battalions than in fiscal year 2011. Given the focus on retaining combat units, and senior Army leaders' assessment that shortfalls in combat units are more challenging to resolve than shortfalls in enabler units, the Army plans to reduce proportionately more positions from its enabler units than from its combat units.", "GAO found that the Army performed considerable analysis of its force structure requirements, but did not assess mission risk for its enabler units.", "Combat Forces: The Army's analysis of BCT requirements entailed an assessment of mission risk\u2014risk resulting from units being unable to meet the missions specified in Department of Defense (DOD) planning guidance. The mission risk assessment used current Army deployment practices and assumed that sufficient enabler forces would be available to sustain combat units over a multi-year scenario. The result of this analysis, and a similar analysis of the Army's aviation brigades, showed that the Army's proposed combat force structure would be sufficient to meet most mission demands.", "Enabler Forces: The Army's analysis of its enabler units entailed an assessment of risk to the force\u2014how frequently and for how long units need to deploy to meet as many demands as possible. Army officials said this analysis is useful because it enables the Army to identify the units it would use the most. However, the analysis overstated the availability of the Army's enabler units because it assumed they could deploy more frequently and for longer duration than DOD's policies allow. The Army did not identify enabler unit shortfalls, or the risk those shortfalls pose to meeting mission requirements.", "According to Army guidance, the Army's planning process should assess mission risk for both combat and enabler units. The Army did not complete this type of assessment for its enabler units during its most recent force planning process because the Army assessed the risk operational demands pose to the health of the Army's force, not mission risk. Without a mission risk assessment for both the Army's planned combat and enabler force structure, the Army has an incomplete understanding of mission risk and is not well-positioned to develop mitigation strategies. Furthermore, as currently implemented, its process does not include analyses needed for the Army to routinely prepare a mission risk assessment for both its combat and enabler force structure.

Additionally, in  2011, Congress passed the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among  other things, sets limits for national defense spending through fiscal year  2021. In response to these spending limits the Army announced it would  reduce its planned end strength from a high of about 1.11 million soldiers  in fiscal year 2011 to 1.045 million soldiers by fiscal year 2016. In June  2014, DOD stated that the Army would further reduce its end strength to  980,000 soldiers by fiscal year 2018, a level at which the Army stated that  it could execute the National Defense Strategy, but at significant risk.

As part of this review, DOD examined ways to obtain cost  savings by altering the Army\u2019s future force structure.

Army leaders, reacting to what  they considered to be unacceptable reductions, commissioned analyses  to determine the end strength and number of BCTs the Army needed to  execute the missions specified in defense planning guidance. The  analysis determined that the Army should retain a minimum of 52 BCTs,  including 30 in the active component, in order to best meet the missions  specified in defense planning guidance.

Specifically, the Army plans to eliminate 17 BCTs from its force structure  relative to its fiscal year 2011 force (a 23 percent reduction in the number  of BCTs). However, because the Army decided to redesign its BCTs by  increasing its composition from a two maneuver battalion to three  battalion formation, the Army estimates that it will be able to retain 170  maneuver battalions in its force structure\u2014a net reduction of 3 battalions  compared to fiscal year 2011 (less than 2 percent), as shown in table 1.", "Maintain minimum number of positions in generating force units and the  trainees, transients, holdees, and students accounts.

Specifically, the Army tasked  the two largest organizations in its generating force (U.S. Army Medical  Command and TRADOC) with evaluating their position requirements and  concluded that the Army needs a minimum of 87,400 active component  soldiers in the generating force for an end strength of 980,000 soldiers.

Assessing risk to the force entails determining how  frequently and for how long individual types of enabler units would need  to deploy to meet the maximum amount of demands possible, given the  previously identified combat force structure, and does not entail  identifying missed mission demands or documenting unresourced unit  requirements. The Army then determined the length of time at home for  each type of enabler assessed, and compared the result with that for the  Army as a whole, in order to determine the level of stress (\u201crisk\u201d) on that  type of unit. The Army\u2019s analysis necessitates making key assumptions  about how enablers would be used, some of which contrasted from  current DOD deployment practices.

Similarly, the Army assumed that it  could deploy its reserve component enabler units more frequently than  DOD\u2019s current policy allows.", "Army officials told us that assessing risk to the force for its enablers is  useful because the Army can identify the units it would use the most and  those that it would use least. Based on its analyses of the frequency and  length of deployments for each type of enabler unit assessed, the Army  developed and prioritized options to mitigate risk to the enabler force.  These options included adding structure to more utilized units and taking  reductions from or divesting less-utilized enabler units. For example, the  Army\u2019s analyses showed that one type of engineer unit spent far less time  at home than the Army\u2019s other units during a contingency, and so the  Army added an additional engineer unit to its structure to mitigate this  stress. In contrast, the Army determined that it had excess support  maintenance companies in its force structure and decided to eliminate 6  of these units.", "Additionally, the Army analyzed its enabler units to identify which units  would be needed during the first 75 days of a conflict. Army officials used  war plans to identify the minimum number of each type of enabler unit  that would be needed to execute the war plan and then compared that  requirement to the number of those units that would be available to meet  those requirements. Army officials told us that assessing early  deployment requirements is useful because the Army can assess whether  it needs to move units from its reserve component to its active component  in order to ensure that early deployment requirements can be met.", "Assessing risk to the force and early deployment requirements does not  identify potential mission shortfalls in the enabler inventory, however, and  these shortfalls could lead to missed mission demands. When the Army  has conducted mission risk assessments for its enabler units outside of  TAA it has been able to identify and mitigate risk. In May 2014, the  TRADOC Analysis Center completed mission risk assessments for  certain types of artillery units, air and missile defense, and truck units,  among other units. These analyses showed that some types of units were  unable to meet projected mission demands and provided information  needed for the Army to develop mitigation strategies. For example, the  Army\u2019s assessment of artillery units identified unmitigated mission risk  and determined that these units could meet only about 88 percent of  demands during a major contingency. To address this risk, Army officials  said that they recommended a change to the Army\u2019s deployment  practices for these units to allow one type of unit to be substituted for  another. This change would enable these units to meet approximately 94  percent of mission demands during a major contingency. Similarly, in  another example, the Army\u2019s assessment of its truck units found that  planned reductions could limit the Army\u2019s ability to transport troops  around the battlefield, among other risks. The Army intends to add 4  medium truck companies to its force structure by the end of fiscal year  2019 in part to address this risk.", "In its January 2016 report, the National Commission on the Future of the  Army identified enabler capabilities that in its view needed further risk  assessment and risk mitigation. As previously discussed, Army leaders  decided to reduce enabler units they judged less critical, such as military  police, transportation, chemical, and explosive ordnance disposal units, in  part to preserve the Army\u2019s combat force structure. However, the National  Commission on the Future of the Army identified some of these same  units as having shortfalls\u2014including units that provide transportation,  military police, and chemical capabilities. The Commission recommended  that the Army complete a risk assessment and assess plans and  associated costs of reducing or eliminating these shortfalls."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TAA Does Not Routinely Assess Mission Risk for Both Combat and Enabler Force Structure", "paragraphs": ["Army guidance indicates that the Army\u2019s TAA process should assess  mission risk for its combat and enabler force structure, but the Army did  not complete a mission risk assessment during its most recent TAA. In  addition, its TAA process is not being implemented in a manner that  would routinely prepare such an assessment. According to the Army\u2019s  force development regulation, the Army\u2019s TAA process is intended to  determine the requirements for both the Army\u2019s combat and enabler force  structure to meet the missions specified in defense planning guidance,  document unresourced requirements, and analyze risk given resource  constraints. When assessing risk, the Army\u2019s risk management  guidance states that the Army should identify conditions that create the  potential for harmful events and analyze how such conditions could cause  mission failure. Within this context, Army officials told us that the TAA  process should assess mission risk by assessing how the Army\u2019s combat  and enabler force structure could lead to a failure to meet the missions  specified in defense planning guidance. According to the Army\u2019s risk  management guidance, once the Army identifies mission risk, it then  should analyze and prioritize strategies to mitigate identified risk.", "In the near term, although the Army\u2019s guidance and risk management  framework indicate the Army should complete a mission risk assessment  for its combat and enabler force structure, the Army did not do so during  its most recent TAA for its enabler units, instead assessing the risk to the  force and early deployment requirements for these units. Army officials  stated that they did not complete this assessment because the Army  assessed how ongoing demands affected the health of the Army\u2019s force  and not the mission risk associated with shortfalls. However, our review  found that the Army\u2019s guidance does not require that the Army complete  an assessment of the risk to force.", "Army officials are currently revising the Army regulation that documents  its force development processes, but the draft does not currently include  a requirement that the TAA process assess mission risk for the Army\u2019s  combat and enabler force structure. Without an assessment of the  mission risk associated with the planned enabler force structure  documented in the Army\u2019s October 2015 Army Structure Memorandum,  the Army has an incomplete understanding of the risks that may arise  from the potential shortfalls in its enabler inventory. Accordingly, the Army  is not well positioned to develop strategies to mitigate these risks. Army  officials told us the next opportunity to complete this mission risk  assessment and develop mitigation strategies would be as part of its  ongoing TAA for fiscal years 2019 through 2023.", "Furthermore, the Army is required to complete TAA every year and as  currently implemented its TAA process does not include the modeling and  analyses needed to routinely prepare a mission risk assessment for its  combat and enabler force structure. Army officials told us that they  recognize a need to expand TAA to include mission risk assessments for  a set of the Army\u2019s enabler units, consider potential strategies to mitigate  this risk, and implement such strategies; but have not revised TAA to  include these elements. Without expanding the TAA process to routinely  require a mission risk assessment for the Army\u2019s combat and enabler  force structure as part of future iterations of TAA, the Army will continue  to not be well positioned to identify mission risk and develop mitigation  strategies when making future force structure decisions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Facing end strength reductions, the Army made a decision to retain  combat capabilities to provide maximum warfighting capability and  flexibility.

Additionally, by completing a mission risk assessment for its  planned force before completing its ongoing TAA for fiscal years 2019  through 2023, the Army will be better positioned to identify improvements  to its TAA process so that it can complete such assessments on a  recurring basis moving forward.
