With regard to performance management, VA has an ongoing initiative to revise its approach for measuring rehabilitation success at the individual employee, regional, and national levels. However, the new approach VA is considering for employees reflects only the number, not the rate of successful outcomes, and therefore would not provide sufficient context for understanding program success. VA has not yet developed its new approaches for assessing rehabilitation success regionally and nationally. Also, VA began surveying participants' satisfaction with the program and plans to use the results to manage performance; while VA has generally followed good survey design practices, the agency has not fully assessed the reliability of early customer satisfaction results. In terms of workload management, VA has taken steps to reduce paperwork burdens on regional offices. However, several offices still reported heavy workloads and noted that VA's formula for allocating staff among offices does not consider other staff duties affecting workloads, such as education counseling. In addition, VA has not studied the relative effectiveness and efficiency of regional offices' approaches for assigning staff to manage workloads.

In fact, according to VA data, some of these veterans  were ultimately placed in a job, but the job was not seen as suitable given  their disability.

While about half of these veterans completed the program within  3 to 6 years, many took considerably longer (see fig. 4). Furthermore, it  appears that time frames for completing the program have not changed  substantially for more recent applicants. For example, looking at VR&E  participants who successfully attained suitable employment during fiscal  year 2012, we found their average time from application to completion  was also 4 years 7 months, with a range similar to that for fiscal year  2003 applicants.

Of those veterans who started since fiscal year 2003 and received some  employment services, most (about 70 percent) pursued a 4-year college  degree, and these veterans typically took longer to complete the program  than those who pursued other types of training such as community  college degrees or vocational training.

The data on applying again  following rehabilitation are similar for veterans who entered in fiscal years  2004 and 2005. Moreover, the expanded eligibility criteria authorized by  the VOW Act have not so far had a substantial impact on the number of  veterans returning for additional services. According to data provided by  VA, between May 2012 and April 2013 only 10 veterans nationwide  received additional VR&E services under these new VOW Act criteria.  Managers or staff in a number of regional offices told us the new criteria  would not significantly expand the population of veterans eligible for  additional VR&E services: several noted that almost all the veterans who  would qualify under the new criteria are already eligible under the old  criteria.

For example, VR&E staff in  one office said veterans may want to train for jobs in law enforcement,  even though they have PTSD or another psychological condition that  makes this goal unrealistic. Some veterans we interviewed cited  challenges coming to agreement with their counselors on an employment  plan. For example, one said he wanted to study theology, but his  counselor felt that studying to become a teacher would be more  appropriate, and he ultimately left the program because of this  disagreement. In addition, managers or staff in all eight offices we  contacted said veterans may come to the VR&E program with the goal of  furthering their education rather than obtaining a job, or may have a  misperception about the purpose of the VR&E program. For example, a  VRC in one office said she must explain to veterans that VR&E only  provides training when it is necessary to achieve employment. She feels  veterans\u2019 chance of success would be enhanced if they entered the  program with specific employment goals in mind, rather than training  goals.

The vast majority of those who entered the  program since fiscal year 2003 and received some employment services  have worked with at least two counselors, and a substantial proportion  (about one-third) worked with four or more.

VRCs in another office told us a change in life circumstances\u2014such as  marriage, the birth of a child, or a death in the family\u2014may make it more  difficult to complete training.

A VRC in one office explained that, in the state  served by his office, veterans who received technical training in the  medical field while in the military may still need additional training to pass  a state certification exam to work in a comparable civilian job. Along  similar lines, one veteran said he had responsibilities for benefits  counseling, training, and recruitment while in the military that are  comparable to the skills needed in a civilian human resources job.

VA central and regional office officials noted  that the rehabilitation rate goal can incentivize a VRC to hold onto an  inactive case, even if the veteran has clearly left the program, because  holding onto inactive cases instead of closing them can help regional  offices and individual VRCs increase their rehabilitation rates and more  easily reach their goals for a particular fiscal year. When staff delay  closing cases like this, an office\u2019s or individual\u2019s rehabilitation rate may  appear higher than it really is in one year and lower in another year,  leading to an inaccurate picture of VA\u2019s success in rehabilitating veterans.  Furthermore, while cases remain in interrupted status, VRCs are still  required to attempt contact with veterans every 60 days, which can limit  the time spent working with veterans who are actively participating. In  addition to the incentive to hold onto inactive cases, VA officials noted  that the rehabilitation rate does not capture all of the benefits VR&E  provides to veterans. In particular, the current calculation excludes MRG  cases, where the veteran obtained some value from VR&E services but  did not obtain and maintain suitable employment. Because it does not  explicitly include MRG cases in the assessment of VR&E performance,  VA\u2019s current measure does not fully reflect the value it provides to  veterans. Another concern raised by some regional officials was that  having a uniform rehabilitation rate goal for every office does not account  for regional differences in factors affecting employment, such as local job  market conditions.", "To address these and other issues, VA established four workgroups to  review and make recommendations for improving VR&E\u2019s individual  employee performance standards. The resulting draft recommendations  included eliminating VR&E\u2019s rehabilitation rate measure and replacing it  with a measure of the number of positive outcomes\u2014specifically, the  number of successful employment and independent living rehabilitations  and MRG cases. Four regional offices were recommended to pilot the  revised measure. According to a VA official, VA is expected to approve  these draft recommendations by the end of fiscal year 2014. Also, in  comments provided after reviewing a draft of this report, VA stated that it  is developing VA-wide and regional office measures of program success,  and expects to implement the VA-wide measures in fiscal year 2015.", "While the current rehabilitation rate has limitations, the measure VA is  considering as an alternative may not necessarily be a better way to  monitor and demonstrate VR&E\u2019s success. Specifically, VA is considering  replacing its current outcome measure\u2014which tracks those who obtained  suitable jobs relative to those who did not\u2014with a measure that tracks  only the number of any positive outcomes. According to VA officials,  positive outcomes would include not just veterans who obtained suitable  employment, but also veterans who obtained other benefits (such as  MRG) from the VR&E program. Good practices for performance  measurement suggest that measures should allow agencies to  transparently report their success to the Congress and public, and identify  and address performance variances across their programs. The  proposed measure of specific numbers of positive outcomes lacks this  transparency because it does not account for veterans who left the  program without obtaining suitable employment or other discernable  benefits. It also obscures VA\u2019s success in achieving its core mission  because it does not separate veterans who obtained suitable employment  from those who received other, lesser benefits. Finally, measuring only  numbers of positive outcomes is less effective for monitoring and  managing performance across regional offices\u2014that is, comparing each  office\u2019s relative rate of success to identify those that may serve as models  or require further oversight.", "Aside from considering changes to its outcome measures, VA has taken  other steps to help regional offices better manage their interrupted cases,  but it is unclear how successful these efforts have been. For example, VA  uses performance goals to hold regional offices and VRCs accountable  for monitoring interrupted cases and keeping their proportions below  certain thresholds. The current goal is 11 percent for regional offices and  12 percent for individual VRCs. Also, VR&E\u2019s central office has provided  tools and training to help VR&E managers monitor the number and  average time of cases in interrupted status, and percent in interrupted  status over 180 days.

According to several regional office  managers and staff we interviewed, cases are typically closed when  veterans have maintained employment for this 60-day minimum, as  problems with a veteran maintaining employment were most likely to  occur in the first 60 days of employment if they occurred at all. However,  if a veteran appears to be at high risk of losing a job, for example, the  VRC can keep the case open for a longer period to provide additional  supports. Some VRCs noted that this can occur when a veteran has a  serious mental health condition, for example. According to VA data on  about 38,000 veterans who applied for VR&E between fiscal years 2003  and 2012 and have been rehabilitated to employment, over one-third  were tracked in employment for 6 months or longer before having their  cases closed as rehabilitated, and some were tracked for 1 year or  more.

Other regional officials cited  advantages of specialization. For example, the VRC can: (1) manage  caseloads without being distracted by a larger range of tasks (for  example, assessing entitlement, preparing rehabilitation plans and  monitoring veterans\u2019 progress on their plans); and (2) develop expertise in  one phase of the VR&E process.

These  factors (which we also may refer to as covariates, variables, or predictors)  included age, sex, education, branch of service, number of counselors,  number of discontinuations, severity of disability, type of disability, year of  first application to the program, VR&E services provided (\u201cservice track\u201d),  and the regional offices that managed veterans\u2019 cases.", "A key strength of the VR&E administrative data is its volume. The total  number of veterans available for analysis, using the population defined  above, was 133,679. Table 4, below, shows how the data were  distributed across years of program entry and program outcomes. The  large sample size available for analysis allowed us to estimate valid and  precise relationships between completion times and a large number of  covariates. We confirmed the adequacy of the sample by examining the  cell sample sizes in tabulations of potential covariates.", "We assessed the degree of correlation among the initial list of covariates,  in order to identify those that would be redundant or introduce the  possibility of spurious estimates. Most of the potential covariates were not  strongly intercorrelated, except for the number of counselors and  discontinuations, the number of counselors and regional offices, and age  and era of service. The pair-wise correlations for these covariates ranged  from 0.37 to 0.52. Including all of these covariates in our model would  have inflated the estimated relationships between them and program  completion times. Therefore, we included age and number of counselors  in the final list of covariates, and excluded era of service, number of  discontinuations, and number of offices from our model.", "Measuring most of the covariates of interest was straightforward, and can  be determined for a subset of meaningful predictors, as shown in Table 6  below. However, measuring certain covariates\u2014such as regional offices,  certain VR&E services, and disability type\u2014required more complex  measurement decisions.", "Because veterans can be served by a number of regional offices over  time, measuring the offices serving each veteran is challenging. In our  data, veterans\u2019 cases were managed by more than 4,100 permutations of  regional offices. The large number of permutations made it difficult to  meaningfully analyze variation across offices, and, in any case, produced  sample sizes that were too small for modeling purposes. To simplify the  measurement, we focused on the last office where each veteran was  enrolled, as a measure of regional office at program completion. Because  veterans could have discontinued their programs multiple times and could  have been served by as many as six offices, the last office was a logical  proxy for the office that could have influenced the final outcome most  strongly.", "Because we selected only veterans from the VA administrative data who  received employment-related services, this group received job training or  job placement assistance. We created a single measure of services  received by creating categories for specific services related to  employment, such as job placement services, and specific types of job  training received, such as high school or college education. Table 5 below  identifies the services we measured.", "Finally, veterans could have been diagnosed with one or more disabilities,  such as mental health conditions, ear disorders, and/or cardiovascular  disorders. This allows for a potentially large number of unique  combinations of disorders, which makes it difficult to create mutually  exclusive and exhaustive groups. To avoid this problem, we compared  veterans who had each type of disorder to veterans who did not have the  disorder, using binary indicators for the presence or absence of each  diagnosis. While the possibility of multiple disabilities makes these  indicators mutually inclusive, our measurement scheme provided a  concise way to collapse the many unique combinations of disorders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Survival Model and Statistical Assumptions", "paragraphs": ["The purpose of survival modeling is to estimate the probability of an event  by various follow-up times or the average rate of event occurrence at any  one follow-up time. Because these two quantities are mathematically  equivalent, we used two different methods that produce similar results but  vary in their ease of interpretation. where nj is the number of veterans who are \u201cat risk\u201d of rehabilitation and  dj is the number of rehabilitations observed at tj. We estimated failure  probabilities for various subgroups of veterans, in order to describe the  association between these factors and the chance of rehabilitation by 5  and 8 years.", "To corroborate these associations and control for alternative variables  that could account for them, we used multivariate survival models\u2014and  the Cox Model for Proportional Hazards, in particular\u2014to estimate the  average rate of event occurrence at any one time in an observation  period, also known as the \u201chazard rate.\u201dinterest is rehabilitation, and the time period of observation is fiscal year  2003 through fiscal year 2012. In our analysis, we defined censored  outcomes as a veteran\u2019s remaining in the program at the end of fiscal  year 2012 or having discontinued from a program without yet re-applying  (see table 5 above).", "The formula for our Cox regression model was  \u03bbi(t)= \u03bb0(t)exp(xi b) ,  where \u03bbi(t, xi) is the hazard rate for veteran i at time t, xi = xi1 ,..., xip is a  vector of p covariates, and xib is a linear combination of covariates and  coefficients, with no intercept term. As described above and in table 6, the  covariates included: age, sex, job training services, the interaction of sex  and job training services, education, branch of service, number of  counselors, severity of disability, and disability type. The term \u03bb0(t) is the  \u201cbaseline hazard rate,\u201d or the rate implied when all covariates equal zero.  (Note that the equation simplifies to \u03bb0(t) when this is true.)", "The Cox Model assumes that the hazard rates are proportional across  values of the covariates throughout the observation period. If the hazard  in one group exceeds that of a reference group, the model assumes that  the proportional difference in rates will remain constant, and that the  difference in hazard rates across groups does not decline, increase, or  reverse direction over time. For example, the model assumes that the  rehabilitation rate for veterans with mental health conditions differs from  the rate for veterans without this type of condition by a constant amount  throughout the observation period.", "However, because a particular data generation process may not satisfy  the proportional hazards assumption, we plotted the estimated hazards  for various values of each covariate over time and formally tested the  assumption for each covariate using statistical tests based on the model\u2019s  Shoenfeld residuals. We found a non-zero slope in a generalized linear  regression of the Schoenfeld residuals on functions of time for several  variables. A non-zero slope indicates that the hazards are not  proportional across values of the covariates over time.across all variables further suggested that the hazard function was not  proportional.", "To identify the most serious departures from the proportional hazard  assumption, we plotted the cumulative hazard function over time for the  covariates that failed the Schoenfeld test. These plots suggested that the  last office and first year of application covariates had strongly  disproportional hazards. The remaining variables only failed to meet the  proportional hazard assumption in a category coded for \u201cmissing data,\u201d  and the other variables that appeared to be disproportional were not  meaningfully associated with rehabilitation times.", "To adjust for most seriously non-proportional hazards, we stratified the  model by last office and first year of application. Stratification allowed us  to control for these two factors while also allowing their hazard functions  to vary over time across offices and years of application. After stratifying  by last office and first year of application, the proportional hazard  assumption for the model was more consistent with our data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Results", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis identified a number of factors that had strong and  statistically significant associations with rehabilitation times, as shown in  Table 5.", "Veterans took more time to complete their programs if multiple counselors  worked with them. Average completion times increased at a higher rate  as the number of counselors increased from 1 to 5 than from 6 to 9 or  more. For example, veterans with 2 counselors had average rehabilitation  times that were 29 percent slower, on average, than veterans with 1  counselor. In contrast, veterans with 9 or more counselors had average  rehabilitation times that were about 1 percent slower than veterans with 8  counselors. In exploratory analysis, we found that veterans who more  often discontinued and re-entered the program and who were served by  multiple regional offices were more likely to work with multiple counselors,  and that discontinuing more frequently was associated with slower rates  of rehabilitation. However, when we estimated Cox models that controlled  for the number of times discontinued and the number of regional offices  used, we found that the number of counselors still had a meaningful  association with success. Nevertheless, a reciprocal relationship, in which  longer program times are associated with more counselors, may also  explain this pattern.", "The presence of mental health conditions substantially decreased  completion rates. Veterans with mental health conditions completed their  programs at a rate that was about 27 percent slower on average than  veterans who did not have mental health conditions.", "As expected, the type of services veterans received was among the  strongest predictors of completion times. Veterans who received job  placement services finished their programs about 4.5 times more quickly  than veterans who were pursuing an undergraduate education. This is  consistent with the nature of VR&E\u2019s job placement services, which focus  on veterans who already have the skills to pursue employment. Veterans  who received apprenticeships, non-vocational training, unpaid work at a  federal agency, vocational or technical education, or non-degree college  credit hours finished their programs about 1.6 to 2.4 times more quickly  than veterans pursuing an undergraduate college degree. In contrast, the  average completion rate for veterans pursuing a graduate degree was  only 28 percent quicker than for veterans pursuing an undergraduate  degree. As a whole, these results suggest that veterans pursuing  undergraduate or graduate degrees require more time to complete their  programs than veterans receiving other training.", "The amount of prior education was associated with faster program  completion rates. As compared to veterans with only a high school  degree, veterans with some college, an undergraduate degree, or a  graduate degree had completion rates that were 1.2 to 1.5 times faster,  on average. Because these estimates control for the type of services  received and the type and severity of disabilities, veterans with more prior  education appear to have finished more quickly regardless of the training  they received or the nature of their disabilities.", "Finally, veterans with disability ratings of less than 100 percent finished  their programs more quickly than veterans with disability ratings of 100  percent, with completion rates that were about 1.5 times more quickly on  average.disabilities face greater challenges to timely program completion, even  holding constant factors such as type of training, prior education, and  age."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor Training Gaps Identified by VA in 2010 and the Agency\u2019s Efforts to Address", "paragraphs": ["Training gaps     New VRCs  How to provide services to veterans recently  discharged from the military  How to provide services to veterans with severe  disabilities  How to determine when extended evaluation is  necessary and conduct subsequent individualized  extended evaluation plan development  How to closeout cases for different veteran outcomes  (e.g., for veterans who achieved suitable employment  or maximum rehabilitation gain)", "For new and experienced VRCs   How to provide services to veterans with traumatic  brain injuries (TBI)", "How to provide services to veterans with post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)", "How to conduct a preliminary and/or comprehensive IL  assessment  How to input benefit awards into the computer system   (e.g., inputting the decision to provide a veteran a  subsistence allowance)", "2-hour course on VR&E fiscal accuracy and integrity Two 1-hour courses on VR&E processing of  subsistence allowance awards 1-hour course on employment adjustment allowances VA added this course to the fiscal year 2013 curriculum to address changes to its guidance for  independent living and delivered the training in September, 2013.
