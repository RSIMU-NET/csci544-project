GAO first designated information security as a government-wide high-risk area in 1997. This was expanded to include the protection of cyber critical infrastructure in 2003 and protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information in 2015.", "DHS plays a key role in strengthening the cybersecurity posture of the federal government. Among other things, DHS has initiatives for (1) detecting and preventing malicious cyber intrusions into agencies' networks and (2) deploying technology to assist agencies to continuously diagnose and mitigate cyber threats and vulnerabilities.", "This statement provides an overview of GAO's work related to DHS's efforts to improve the cybersecurity posture of the federal government. In preparing this statement, GAO relied on previously published work, as well as information provided by DHS on its actions in response to GAO's previous recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is spearheading multiple efforts to improve the cybersecurity posture of the federal government. Among these, the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) provides a capability to detect and prevent potentially malicious network traffic from entering agencies' networks. In addition, DHS's continuous diagnostics and mitigation (CDM) program provides tools to agencies to identify and resolve cyber vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis.", "In January 2016, GAO reported that NCPS was limited in its capabilities to detect or prevent cyber intrusions, analyze network data for trends, and share information with agencies on cyber threats and incidents. For example, it did not monitor or evaluate certain types of network traffic and therefore would not have detected malicious traffic embedded in such traffic. NCPS also did not examine traffic for certain common vulnerabilities and exposures that cyber threat adversaries could have attempted to exploit during intrusion attempts. In addition, at the time of the review, federal agencies had adopted NCPS to varying degrees. GAO noted that expanding NCPS's capabilities, such as those for detecting and preventing malicious traffic and developing network routing guidance, could increase assurance of the system's effectiveness in detecting and preventing computer intrusions and support wider adoption by agencies. By taking these steps, DHS would be better positioned to achieve the full benefits of NCPS.", "The tools and services delivered through DHS's CDM program are intended to provide agencies with the capability to automate network monitoring, correlate and analyze security-related information, and enhance risk-based decision making at agency and government-wide levels. In May 2016, GAO reported that most of the 17 civilian agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers Act that also reported having high-impact systems were in the early stages of CDM implementation. For example, 14 of the 17 agencies reported that they had deployed products to automate hardware and software asset inventories, configuration settings, and common vulnerability management but only 2 had completed installation of agency and bureau/component-level dashboards. Some of the agencies noted that expediting CDM implementation could be of benefit to them in further protecting their high-impact systems. GAO concluded that the effective implementation of the CDM program can assist agencies in resolving cybersecurity vulnerabilities that expose their information systems and information to evolving and pernicious threats. By continuing to make available CDM tools and capabilities to agencies, DHS can have additional assurance that agencies are better positioned to protect their information system and information.", "In addition, DHS offered other services such as monthly operational bulletins, CyberStat reviews, and cyber exercises to help protect federal systems. In May 2016, GAO reported that although participation varied among the agencies surveyed, most agencies had found that the services were very or somewhat useful. By continuing to make these services available to agencies, DHS is better able to assist agencies in strengthening the security of their information systems."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In a January 2016 report, GAO made nine recommendations related to expanding NCPS's capability to detect cyber intrusions; notifying customers of potential incidents; providing analytic services; and sharing cyber-related information, among other things.

In  particular, I will focus on two of the department\u2019s initiatives: the National  Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS), operationally known as  Einstein, and the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program.", "In developing this testimony, we relied on our previous reports as well as  information provided by the department on its actions in response to our  previous recommendations. A more detailed discussion of the objectives,  scope, and methodology for this work is included in each of the reports  that are cited throughout this statement.", "The work on which this statement is based was conducted in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform audits to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on  our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies are dependent on computerized (cyber) information  systems and electronic data to carry out operations and to process,  maintain, and report essential information. The security of these systems  and data is vital to public confidence and the nation\u2019s safety, prosperity,  and well-being. Virtually all federal operations are supported by computer  systems and electronic data, and agencies would find it difficult, if not  impossible, to carry out their missions and account for their resources  without these information assets. Hence, ineffective security controls to  protect these systems and data could have a significant impact on a  broad array of government operations and assets.", "Computer networks and systems used by federal agencies are often  riddled with security vulnerabilities\u2014both known and unknown. These  systems are often interconnected with other internal and external systems  and networks, including the Internet, thereby increasing the number of  avenues of attack and expanding their attack surface.", "In addition, cyber threats to systems supporting the federal government  are evolving and becoming more sophisticated. These threats come from  a variety of sources and vary in terms of the types and capabilities of the  actors, their willingness to act, and their motives. For example, foreign  nations\u2014where adversaries possess sophisticated levels of expertise and  significant resources to pursue their objectives\u2014pose increasing risks.", "Safeguarding federal computer systems has been a long-standing  concern. This year marks the 20th anniversary of when GAO first  designated information security as a government-wide high-risk area in  1997. We expanded this high-risk area to include safeguarding the  systems supporting our nation\u2019s critical infrastructure in 2003 and  protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information in 2015.", "Over the last several years, GAO has made about 2,500  recommendations to agencies aimed at improving the security of federal  systems and information. These recommendations identified actions for  agencies to take to strengthen their information security programs and  technical controls over their computer networks and systems. Many agencies continue to be challenged in safeguarding their information  systems and information, in part because many of these  recommendations have not been implemented. As of February 2017,  about 1,000 of our information security-related recommendations had not  been implemented.", "Our audits of the effectiveness of information security programs and  controls at federal agencies have consistently shown that agencies are  challenged in securing their information systems and information. In  particular, agencies have been challenged in the following activities:", "Enhancing capabilities to effectively identify cyber threats to agency  systems and information. A key activity for assessing cybersecurity  risk and selecting appropriate mitigating controls is the identification of  cyber threats to computer networks, systems, and information. In  2016, we reported on several factors that agencies identified as  impairing their ability to identify these threats to a great or moderate  extent. The impairments included an inability to recruit and retain  personnel with the appropriate skills, rapidly changing threats,  continuous changes in technology, and a lack of government-wide  information sharing mechanisms. We believe that addressing these  impairments will enhance the ability of agencies to identify the threats  to their systems and information and be in a better position to select  and implement appropriate countermeasures.", "Implementing sustainable processes for securely configuring  operating systems, applications, workstations, servers, and network  devices. In our reports, we routinely determine that agencies do not  enable key information security capabilities of their operating systems,  applications, workstations, servers, and network devices. Agencies  were not always aware of the insecure settings that introduced risk to  the computing environment. We believe that establishing strong  configuration standards and implementing sustainable processes for  monitoring and enabling configuration settings will strengthen the  security posture of federal agencies.", "Patching vulnerable systems and replacing unsupported software.", "Federal agencies we have reviewed consistently fail to apply critical  security patches on their systems in a timely manner, sometimes  doing so years after the patch becomes available. We have  consistently identified instances where agencies use software that is  no longer supported by their vendors. These shortcomings place  agency systems and information at significant risk of compromise,  since many successful cyberattacks exploit known vulnerabilities  associated with software products. We believe that using vendor- supported and patched software will help to reduce this risk.", "Developing comprehensive security test and evaluation procedures  and conducting examinations on a regular and recurring basis.  Federal agencies we have reviewed often do not test or evaluate their  information security controls in a comprehensive manner. The agency  evaluations we reviewed were sometimes based on interviews and  document reviews (rather than in depth security evaluations), were  limited in scope, and did not identify many of the security  vulnerabilities that our examinations identified. We believe that  conducting in-depth security evaluations that examine the  effectiveness of security processes and technical controls is essential  for effectively identifying system vulnerabilities that place agency  systems and information at risk."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Laws Provide a Framework for Securing Agencies\u2019 Information and Systems", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA)  provides a comprehensive framework for ensuring the effectiveness of  information security controls over information resources that support  federal operations and assets and for ensuring the effective oversight of  information security risks, including those throughout civilian, national  security, and law enforcement agencies. The law requires each agency to  develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security  program to provide risk-based protections for the information and  information systems that support the operations and assets of the  agency.", "FISMA also establishes key government-wide roles for DHS. Specifically,  with certain exceptions, DHS is to administer the implementation of  agency information security policies and practices for information systems  including: monitoring agency implementation of information security policies and providing operational and technical guidance to agencies; operating a central federal information security incident center; and deploying technology upon request to assist the agency to  continuously diagnose and mitigate cyber threats and vulnerabilities.", "In addition, the Cybersecurity Act of 2015 requires DHS to deploy,  operate, and maintain for use by any federal agency, a capability to (1)  detect cybersecurity risks in network traffic transiting to or from agency  information systems and (2) prevent network traffic with such risks from  traveling to or from an agency information system or modify the traffic to  remove the cybersecurity risk."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Advancing DHS Initiatives Could Improve the Cybersecurity Posture of the Federal Government", "paragraphs": ["In implementing federal law for securing agencies\u2019 information and  systems, DHS is spearheading several initiatives to assist federal  agencies in protecting their computer networks and electronic information.

Deployed in stages, NCPS, operationally known as  EINSTEIN, has provided increasing capabilities to detect and prevent  potential cyber-attacks involving the network traffic entering or exiting the  networks of participating federal agencies. Table 1 provides an overview  of the EINSTEIN deployment stages to date.", "The overarching objectives of NCPS are to provide functionality that  supports intrusion detection, intrusion prevention, analytics, and  information sharing. However, in January 2016, we reported that NCPS  had partially, but not fully, met these objectives:  Intrusion detection: NCPS provided DHS with a limited ability to  detect potentially malicious activity entering and exiting computer  networks at federal agencies. Specifically, NCPS compared network  traffic to known patterns of malicious data, or \u201csignatures,\u201d but did not  detect deviations from predefined baselines of normal network  behavior. In addition, NCPS did not monitor several types of network  traffic and therefore would not have detected malicious traffic  embedded in such traffic. NCPS also did not examine traffic for  certain common vulnerabilities and exposures that cyber threat  adversaries could have attempted to exploit during intrusion attempts.", "Intrusion prevention: The capability of NCPS to prevent intrusions  was limited to the types of network traffic it monitored. For example,  the intrusion prevention function monitored and blocked e-mail  determined to be malicious. However, it did not monitor malicious  content within web traffic, although DHS planned to deliver this  capability in 2016.", "Analytics: NCPS supported a variety of data analytical tools,  including a centralized platform for aggregating data and a capability  for analyzing the characteristics of malicious code. However, DHS  had not developed planned capabilities to facilitate near real-time  analysis of various data streams, perform advanced malware  behavioral analysis, and conduct forensic analysis in a more  collaborative way. DHS planned to develop and implement these  enhancements through 2018.", "Information sharing: DHS had yet to develop most of the planned  functionality for NCPS\u2019s information-sharing capability, and  requirements had only recently been approved at the time of our  review. Agencies and DHS also did not always agree about whether  notifications of potentially malicious activity had been sent or received,  and agencies had mixed views about the usefulness of these  notifications. Further, DHS did not always solicit\u2014and agencies did  not always provide\u2014feedback on them.", "In addition, while DHS had developed metrics for measuring the  performance of NCPS, the metrics did not gauge the quality, accuracy, or  effectiveness of the system\u2019s intrusion detection and prevention  capabilities. As a result, DHS was unable to describe the value provided  by NCPS.", "To enhance the functionality of NCPS, we made six recommendations to  DHS, which if implemented, could help the agency to expand the  capability of NCPS to detect cyber intrusions, notify customers of  potential incidents, and track the quality, efficiency, and accuracy of  supporting actions related to detecting and preventing intrusions,  providing analytic services, and sharing cyber-related information. DHS  concurred with the recommendations. In February 2017 when we  followed up on the status of the recommendations, DHS officials stated  that they have implemented 2 of the recommendations and initiated  actions to address the other 4 recommendations. We are in the process  of evaluating DHS\u2019s actions for the two implemented recommendations.", "In January 2016, we also reported that federal agencies had adopted  NCPS to varying degrees. Specifically, the 23 civilian agencies covered  by the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act that were required to  implement the intrusion detection capabilities had routed some traffic to  NCPS intrusion detection sensors. However, as of January 2016, only 5  of the 23 agencies were receiving intrusion prevention services, due to  certain policy and implementation challenges. For example, officials  stated that the ability to meet DHS security requirements to use the  intrusion prevention capabilities varied from agency to agency. Further,  agencies had not taken all the technical steps needed to implement the  system, such as ensuring that all network traffic was being routed through  NCPS sensors. This occurred in part because DHS had not provided  network routing guidance to agencies. As a result, it had limited  assurance regarding the effectiveness of the system.", "We recommended that DHS work with federal agencies and the Internet  service providers to document secure routing requirements in order to  better ensure the complete, safe, and effective routing of information to  NCPS sensors. DHS concurred with the recommendation. When we  followed up with DHS on the status of the recommendations, DHS  officials said that nearly all of the agencies covered by the CFO Act are  receiving at least one of the intrusion prevention services, as of March  2017. Further, the officials stated that DHS has collaborated with the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to develop new guidance for  agencies on perimeter security capabilities as well as alternative routing  strategies. We will evaluate the network routing guidance when DHS  finalizes and implements it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effective Implementation of the CDM Program Could Improve Information Security at Agencies", "paragraphs": ["The CDM program provides federal agencies with tools and services that  are intended to provide them with the capability to automate network  monitoring, correlate and analyze security-related information, and  enhance risk-based decision making at agency and government-wide  levels.

The CDM blanket purchase agreement is available to federal, state, local,  and tribal government entities for acquiring these capabilities.", "There are three phases of CDM implementation:  Phase 1: This phase involves deploying products to automate hardware  and software asset management, configuration settings, and common  vulnerability management capabilities. According to the Cybersecurity  Strategy and Implementation Plan, DHS purchased Phase 1 tools and  integration services for all participating agencies in fiscal year 2015.", "Phase 2: This phase intends to address privilege management and  infrastructure integrity by allowing agencies to monitor users on their  networks and to detect whether users are engaging in unauthorized  activity. According to the Cybersecurity Strategy and Implementation  Plan, DHS was to provide agencies with additional Phase 2 capabilities  throughout fiscal year 2016, with the full suite of CDM phase 2  capabilities delivered by the end of that fiscal year.", "Phase 3: According to DHS, this phase is intended to address boundary  protection and event management for managing the security life cycle. It  focuses on detecting unusual activity inside agency networks and alerting  security personnel. The agency planned to provide 97 percent of federal  agencies the services they need for CDM Phase 3 in fiscal year 2017.", "As we reported in May 2016, most of the 18 agencies covered by the  CFO Act that had high-impact systems were in the early stages of CDM  implementation.
