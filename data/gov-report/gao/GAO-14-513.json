In 2011, we  reviewed suspension and debarment efforts at selected agencies and  found that the agencies with the most procurement-related suspensions  and debarments shared common characteristics, including a suspension  and debarment program with dedicated staff, detailed policies and  procedures, and practices that encourage an active referral process. We  made recommendations to the Departments of Commerce, Health and  Human Services (HHS), Justice, State, the Treasury, and the Department  of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA)\u2014six agencies with billions of dollars in annual contracting  obligations that lacked these characteristics and had virtually no  procurement-related suspensions and debarments for fiscal year 2009.

We reviewed relevant agency documents and  interviewed suspension and debarment and inspector general officials.  We also used information we obtained from the agencies since 2011  through our annual recommendation follow-up efforts.", "To provide information on changes in the level of suspension and  debarment activity at the six agencies, we reviewed data on the number  of suspensions, proposed debarments, and debarments reported in the  Interagency Suspension and Debarment Committee\u2019s (ISDC) annual  reports to Congress for fiscal years 2009 through 2013. For the purposes  of this report, we reviewed both procurement and nonprocurement-related  actions. To assess data reliability, we asked the agencies to verify the  data reported to ISDC and identify steps taken to ensure data consistency  and accuracy. We found the data sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  summarizing changes over time in the agencies\u2019 level of suspension and  debarment activity. We were not able to use data from the official  government system used to track suspension and debarment data as we  did in our 2011 report because the General Services Administration  (GSA) could not provide the data in time to meet the timeframes of this  review due to system upgrades. Further, numerous data fields were  changed in the new system and extensive manipulation would be  required to ensure consistency over time. As a result, we were not able to  aggregate related actions such as those involving affiliates and related  parties to identify the number of cases as we did in our 2011 report. As  such, the number of actions we report is not comparable to the number of  cases we reported in 2011.", "To identify actions taken to improve oversight and government-wide  suspension and debarment efforts, we reviewed guidance issued by OMB  in 2011, and reports issued by the ISDC for fiscal years 2011 through  2013.

To gain insight into how government-wide  guidance and actions may have affected suspension and debarment  efforts at an agency not included in GAO\u2019s 2011 review, we selected the  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), an agency with high contract dollar  obligations and relatively few suspensions and debarments for fiscal  years 2006 through 2010. For VA, we reviewed their suspension and  debarment policy, guidance, procedures, and data.

The Nonprocurement Common Rule (NCR)  establishes the policies and procedures governing suspension and  debarment for discretionary nonprocurement awards (i.e., grants,  cooperative agreements, scholarships, or other assistance). The FAR  and the NCR specify numerous causes for suspensions and debarments,  including fraud, false statements, theft, bribery, tax evasion, and any  other offense indicating a lack of business integrity. A suspension is a  temporary exclusion pending the completion of an investigation or legal  proceeding which generally may not last longer than 18 months, while a  debarment is an exclusion for a reasonable, specified period depending  on the seriousness of the cause, but generally should not exceed 3 years.  A suspension or debarment under either the FAR or NCR has  government-wide effect for all purposes, so that a party precluded from  participating in federal contracts is also precluded from receiving grants,  loans, and other assistance, and vice versa.", "OMB has the authority to issue guidelines for nonprocurement  suspensions and debarments and the Office of Federal Procurement  Policy within OMB provides overall direction for government-wide  procurement policies, including those on suspensions and debarments  under the FAR. ISDC, established in 1986, monitors the government- wide system of suspension and debarment. The ISDC consists of  representatives from 24 federal agencies, as well as 18 independent  agencies and government corporations. The Duncan Hunter National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 augmented and clarified  certain ISDC functions to include providing assistance to help agencies  achieve operational efficiencies in their suspension and debarment  programs. The ISDC was also made responsible for coordinating lead- agency responsibility when multiple agencies have a potential interest in  pursuing suspension and debarment of the same entity.", "In 2011, we made recommendations to improve agency and government- wide suspension and debarment efforts. We reviewed 10 agencies and  found that the four agencies with the most procurement-related  suspension and debarment cases shared common characteristics: a  suspension and debarment program with dedicated staff, detailed policies  and procedures, and practices that encourage an active referral  process. Agencies are required to establish procedures for referring  appropriate matters to their suspension and debarment official for  consideration. The six agencies with few or no procurement-related  suspensions or debarments for the period we reviewed\u2014Commerce,  HHS, Justice, State, Treasury, and DHS\u2019s FEMA\u2014did not have these  characteristics regardless of each agency\u2019s volume of contracting activity.

For example, officials from the Departments  of Commerce, State, and the Treasury stated that improved coordination  between the Office of the Inspector General and the Suspension and  Debarment Official coupled with increased training and awareness  resulted in more referrals and the processing of more actions.

Justice officials stated that one factor that may  have contributed to an increased number of referrals and actions is the  Attorney General\u2019s January 2012 memorandum to all litigating authorities  and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, reminding them to  consider whether the facts of a case could be used as a basis for an  exclusion or debarment and to coordinate with agency suspension and  debarment authorities. HHS officials noted that an increased number of  actions have resulted in part from the Office of Inspector General  providing additional resources for training investigators and auditors on  how to make suspension and debarment referrals involving procurement  and nonprocurement matters.
