For example, FPS had joint responsibility for coordinating facility protection with other federal agencies. DHS did not have joint responsibility for coordinating facility protection with FPS. GAO recommended DHS fully evaluate placement options for FPS. DHS concurred, and officials stated they conducted an assessment.

For almost  50 years, FPS has been charged with protecting federal facilities and the  millions of employees and individuals who work in or visit them. FPS  provides physical-security and law-enforcement services at about 9,000  facilities, a majority of which are held or leased by the General Services  Administration (GSA).", "The organizational placement of an office or agency can affect its  performance and ability to meet its mission. Our prior work has found that  during FPS\u2019s previous organizational placements in GSA and two  agencies within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), it  experienced a number of operational, management, and funding  challenges, which had a bearing on its ability to accomplish its mission.  Most recently, in January 2019, we reported that FPS had made progress  in addressing some of these challenges, but others persisted. We also  identified criteria DHS should consider in evaluating organizational  placement options for FPS.", "In May 2019, DHS announced its decision to transfer FPS from its  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to its  Management Directorate, and to report to the Under Secretary for  Management. We have also previously reported on practices to consider  in implementing organizational transformations or reorganizations. In  light of DHS\u2019s decision, this testimony describes (1) considerations for  FPS\u2019s placement in DHS\u2019s Management Directorate, and (2) steps to  transition FPS.", "This statement is primarily based on our January 2019 report. For that  report, we reviewed our 2002 work related to organizational transformation, which we conducted prior to the creation of DHS. From  this prior work, we identified five key criteria for assessing potential  placement options for FPS and we applied those key criteria to eight  agencies that we identified as potential organizational placement options  for FPS. For each criterion, we also identified elements (i.e.,  characteristics) that were specific to FPS based on our review of FPS  documents, our prior work on topics related to the criterion, as well as our  discussions with federal officials, an association representing federal law  enforcement officers, and a former high-ranking official in the former  National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD)\u2014now reorganized  as CISA\u2014with knowledge of FPS. We identified placement options at  agencies inside and outside of DHS that have similar responsibilities,  where FPS was previously placed, or that reflected FPS\u2019s management  preference. We also reviewed our prior work on organizational change  and Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government for relevant  management responsibilities.", "Our January 2019 report includes further details on the scope and  methodology of our work.", "We conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on  our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["While the core mission of protecting federal facilities has remained  constant as FPS has moved from one agency to another, its  responsibilities have changed. In the 1970s, GSA created FPS as part of  its Public Buildings Service (PBS). While in GSA\u2019s PBS, FPS was  responsible for protecting GSA\u2019s held or leased facilities, providing both  physical security and law enforcement services. To protect buildings, FPS  officers developed physical security risk assessments, installed security  equipment, and oversaw contract guard services. As a part of its law  enforcement services, among other duties, FPS officers enforced laws  and regulations aimed at protecting federal facilities and the persons in  such facilities and conducted criminal investigations.", "Following the attacks on September 11, 2001, the Homeland Security Act  of 2002 was enacted. It created DHS and moved FPS from GSA to the  new department, effective in March 2003. Within DHS, FPS was placed in  U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), where its  responsibilities grew beyond solely protecting GSA buildings to include  homeland security activities such as implementing homeland security  directives and providing law-enforcement, security, and emergency- response services during natural disasters and special events.", "In 2009, DHS proposed transferring FPS from ICE to NPPD. In explaining  this transfer in DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2010 budget justification to Congress,  DHS stated that having FPS and NPPD\u2019s Office of Infrastructure  Protection in the same organization would further solidify NPPD as DHS\u2019s  lead for critical infrastructure protection. FPS was placed in NPPD and  continued to lead physical security and law enforcement services at GSA- held or GSA-leased facilities and continued its efforts in homeland  security activities. In November 2018, legislation was enacted that  reorganized NPPD to an organization that had a greater statutory focus  on managing cyber risks and authorized the Secretary of Homeland  Security to determine the appropriate placement for FPS within DHS and  begin transfer of FPS to that entity.", "Throughout FPS\u2019s organizational placements in DHS, we have reported  on persistent challenges it faced in meeting its mission to protect facilities.  In 2011, we reported on FPS\u2019s challenges in transferring mission support  functions from ICE to NPPD. While FPS was in NPPD, we reported on  FPS\u2019s challenges related to managing and overseeing contract guards  and collaborating with GSA and the United States Marshals Service  (Marshals) on facility security. We made recommendations to help  address these challenges and FPS has made progress on some of these  recommendations. For example, in September 2018, FPS and GSA  established a formal agreement on roles and responsibilities related to  facility protection, as we recommended. However, in our January 2019  report, we identified challenges related to other aspects of overseeing  contract guards and collaboration with other agencies on physical security  that had persisted. As of June of 2019, FPS continues to work on  establishing a contract guard-management system. However, FPS is  unable to assess its guards\u2019 capabilities across its portfolio because the  system is not fully implemented nor does it interact with its training  system. As of 2019, federal physical security continues to be part of our  federal real-property management\u2019s high-risk area."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Key Criteria for Evaluating Placement Options", "paragraphs": ["In 2002, we reported on organizational and accountability criteria for  establishing DHS.

We found that none of the selected agencies  met all the organizational placement criteria; thus, any of the  organizational placement options could result in both benefits and trade- offs. In instances where placing FPS within DHS met our criteria (that is,  instances where DHS was similar to FPS), FPS could experience  benefits. In those instances where the criteria were not met, we reported  it would be incumbent upon any agency to consider and address any  potential trade-offs in order to ensure the decision was successful.", "We reviewed FPS as a \u201cstandalone\u201d entity reporting directly to the Deputy  Secretary of DHS and found this placement option met several key  criteria. Table 2 below summarizes our analysis.", "For the first four criteria\u2014(1) mission, goals, and objectives; (2)  responsibilities; (3) organizational culture; and (4) information sharing and  coordination\u2014we determined that DHS met the criteria if the agency or its  subcomponents had any similarities to FPS. For the last criterion\u2014 mission support\u2014we determined that DHS met the criterion if the agency  or its subcomponents had similarities to FPS or could provide FPS  needed mission support.", "Mission, Goals, and Objectives. In January 2019, we reported that  FPS\u2019s mission focused on the protection of federal facilities and the  people working in and visiting those facilities. DHS was similar to FPS in  that its mission statement and goals as stated in its strategic plan include  an explicit focus on the protection of infrastructure or specific facilities.  Our prior work found that placing an agency into an organization that has  a similar mission might help ensure that the agency\u2019s mission receives  adequate funding, attention, visibility, and support. Our January 2019  work reported that one of DHS\u2019s goals\u2014as noted in its strategic plan  covering fiscal years 2014 to 2018\u2014was to reduce risk to the nation\u2019s  critical infrastructure. DHS and FPS share objectives that focus on  mitigating risks and responding to incidents.", "Responsibilities. In January 2019, we reported that FPS has facility- protection and physical-security responsibilities and law-enforcement, and  contract-guard oversight responsibilities. DHS was similar to FPS as it  had responsibilities for physical security and performed law enforcement  functions. As a part of its physical security activities, FPS conducted  facility security assessments, identified countermeasures (e.g.,  equipment and contract guards) best suited to secure a facility, and  oversaw contract guards. As a part of its law enforcement activities, FPS  proactively patrolled facilities, responded to incidents, and conducted  criminal investigations. FPS also provided additional operational law  enforcement support, at the direction of the Secretary of Homeland  Security, to address emerging threats and homeland security incidents.  One of FPS\u2019s most critical activities was overseeing about 13,500  contract guards who were posted at federal facilities and were responsible for controlling access to facilities, responding to emergency  situations involving facility safety and security, and performing other  duties. FPS was responsible for ensuring, among other things, that these  guards are performing their assigned duties and have the necessary  training and certifications. DHS, however, only used a limited number of  contract guards and therefore had less responsibility. At the time of our  review, DHS officials told us they procured about 130 guards.", "Organizational Culture. In January 2019, we reported that while there  are many areas relevant to organizational culture, law enforcement was a  key aspect of FPS\u2019s organizational culture, according to officials we  interviewed from an association of security companies and a former, high- ranking official in NPPD. DHS had a similar culture in that it was a law  enforcement agency.", "Information Sharing and Coordination. In January 2019, we reported  that Component Intelligence Programs (CIP) were organizations in DHS  that collected, gathered, processed, analyzed, produced, or disseminated  information related to national homeland security. In 2016, DHS  designated a division within FPS as a CIP, a move that allowed FPS  more access to information on threats other DHS agencies have identified  and actions they plan to take. While DHS, like FPS, had access to and  could share information related to national homeland security, DHS did  not have joint responsibility for coordinating facility protection with FPS.  Rather, FPS shared this responsibility with GSA, and these two agencies  and Marshals had joint responsibility for protecting courthouses. FPS has  faced challenges with coordinating with these agencies in the past. For  example, in September 2011, we reported that FPS, Marshals, and other  agencies involved in protecting courthouses (i.e., GSA and the  Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts) faced challenges related to  coordination, such as in the implementation of roles and responsibilities  and the use or participation in existing collaboration mechanisms.", "Mission Support. In January 2019, we reported that mission support was  comprised of financial management, human capital, information  technology systems for financial management, and law enforcement  training. FPS owned and used many of the key operational and business- related information technology (IT) systems and applications it needs to  carry out its mission. However, FPS received some mission support  services from other agencies in DHS, such as human capital and some  aspects of information technology. We found that if FPS changed its  organizational placement it would need mission support in these areas.  For example, FPS did not have delegated examining authority to allow it  to fill competitive civil service jobs and relied on NPPD to provide this  service. DHS had the authority to fill competitive service jobs that could  support FPS needs. Further, FPS used a financial management IT  system owned by ICE. DHS could provide FPS access to financial  management systems that can support FPS. Finally, FPS offered its own  training courses and would still need access to DHS\u2019s Federal Law  Enforcement Training Centers.", "In our January 2019 report, we did not assess FPS as a placement within  DHS\u2019s Management Directorate. Further, we recommended DHS (1)  identify the specific goals of a change in FPS\u2019s placement\u2014that is, what  DHS expects to achieve by moving FPS to another agency, and (2) fully  evaluate placement options for FPS based on what DHS expects to  achieve by changing FPS\u2019s placement, an assessment of FPS\u2019s current  placement, and other best practices such as an analysis of alternatives  assessing the benefits and trade-offs. DHS agreed with our  recommendations. In May 2019, FPS officials told us that the Acting  Secretary\u2019s decision to place FPS within the Management Directorate  was based upon an assessment of placement options within DHS using  criteria and analyzing the trade-offs. GAO has not yet received DHS\u2019s  assessment of placement options. We will assess the actions DHS has  taken in response to our recommendations when we receive DHS\u2019s  assessment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Steps to Transition FPS", "paragraphs": ["Our prior work offers valuable insights for agencies to consider when  evaluating or implementing a reorganization or transformation, and can  provide insights for making any transition regarding FPS.

First, in May 2012,  we reported on key questions for agency officials to consider when  evaluating and implementing an organizational change that involves  consolidation. Table 3 provides a summary of these key questions.
