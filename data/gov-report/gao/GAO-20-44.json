OMB defines program as the functions or activities which agencies  are authorized and funded by statute to administer and enforce.  Programs typically involve broad objectives. OMB views projects as  temporary efforts with defined scopes to create products or services to  improve the efficient and effective implementation of programs. Because  programs are comprised of projects, programs inherently address the  projects subsumed within them. Consequently, our discussions of  programs throughout this report also pertain to projects.

OMB implemented some PMIAA requirements using existing  processes put in place to implement GPRAMA. We previously reported  that GPRAMA provides important tools that can help decision makers  address challenges facing the federal government, such as the annual  reviews of progress on agency strategic objectives conducted during  strategic reviews and the implementation of federal government priority  goals. Federal government priority goals, also known as cross-agency  priority (CAP) goals, are written by OMB in partnership with agencies.  GPRAMA requires OMB to coordinate with agencies to develop CAP  goals, which are 4-year outcome-oriented goals covering a number of  complex or high-risk management and mission issues. For example,  OMB directed agencies to align their noninformation technology major  acquisition programs with relevant strategic objectives so they could  assess progress for the PMIAA required program portfolio reviews  concurrent with required GPRAMA strategic reviews.", "GPRAMA also requires OMB to present a program inventory of all federal  programs by making information available about each federal program on  a website.

Top  leadership commitment is one of the five criteria we use to assess  whether progress is being made to address and ultimately remove areas  from our high-risk list. As we have reported in our March 2019 High-Risk  Series report, leadership commitment is the critical element for initiating  and sustaining progress, and leaders provide needed support and  accountability for managing risks. Leadership commitment is vital if  agencies are to adequately address high-risk areas, and trilateral  meetings have been critical in focusing leadership attention in the past.  Because OMB officials have met on only five of 35 high-risk areas, it  remains to be seen if they will meet on all high-risk areas in the future.  Convening the trilateral meetings on all high-risk areas in the 2-year  reporting cycle, would better position OMB to enhance the leadership  commitment needed to make greater progress on the remaining high-risk  areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OMB Occasionally Discussed High-Risk Areas with Some Agencies throughout 2018 and 2019 beyond Trilateral and Strategic Review Meetings", "paragraphs": ["Staff from OMB said that they sometimes have briefings related to  agencies\u2019 high-risk areas separate from the annual strategic review  meetings and high-risk trilateral meetings.

OMB  partnered with the General Services Administration to complete a  prototype of a dashboard to show cost, schedule, and performance data  from each program or project within a portfolio of programs. The  dashboard also provides a short description of each program or project  and its strategic alignment to the agency\u2019s relevant strategic goal. Staff  from OMB\u2019s Office of Federal Procurement Policy said the dashboard  could provide them with some visibility and improved transparency for  major acquisitions programs. According to the PMIAA strategic plan, the  dashboard would display the agency portfolio and summarize  performance for each item in the portfolio, similar to the portfolio reviews  of IT programs required by the Federal Information Technology  Acquisition Reform Act. Initially, according to OMB, it plans to request  summary information for each portfolio, and restrict the dashboard to  authorized government employees. Moving forward, OMB staff said that  as the portfolio management process matures, a portion of the dashboard  may be available to the public, similar to the IT dashboard.", "OMB staff told us they are in conversation with agencies about how to  overcome difficulties in collecting data for the dashboard. According to  OMB, the results from the pilot portfolio review showed that agencies  experienced challenges with collecting high-quality data. OMB staff said  there will likely be more metrics for large construction projects because  management practices for them are more mature than for other types of  programs, such as services.

A little more than half of agencies  responding to our PMIAA questionnaire provided ideas on how to  measure implementation of PMIAA, such as tracking completion of their  identified PMIAA milestones, developing their own survey as a baseline  measure, or using their agency implementation plan outcomes to  measure results. Six agencies\u2019 questionnaire responses noted that they  are planning to use existing metrics to assess program performance,  either through internal processes or their annual strategic review process.  For example, Treasury plans to focus in the near term on tracking  completion of milestones of PMIAA implementation, such as major  program and project alignment to department strategic objectives,  development of an information-sharing site for program and project  management resources, and workforce capabilities, among other things.  VA anticipates developing outcome measures associated with successful  program execution and is leveraging measures from existing plans, such  as their Acquisition Human Capital Plan.", "OMB staff told us that they have no plans to identify measures to assess  outcomes of PMIAA because it is too early and agencies are in the early  stages of implementation. Rather than tracking anything specific, they told  us that OMB looks at whether agencies\u2019 PMIOs are engaged, if agencies  are using training material and mentorship programs, the involvement of  chief senior level officers, and if there is funding in the budget for program  management certificate programs. However, OMB has not identified  specific measures to track any of these areas.", "In collaboration with OMB, VA developed a program management  maturity model survey identify capability gaps, obtain insights, and enable  benchmarking of program management capabilities. It surveyed agencies\u2019  level of maturity on a range of program management capabilities, such as  talent management, governance, and portfolio management. Maturity  assessment surveys can be useful tools for measuring progress to  develop capacity in areas such as program management, according to  subject matter specialists. Periodically measuring maturity can help  agencies institutionalize continuous assessment and improvement. PMI  also supports using such tools to identify trends that can help pinpoint  actions needed and opportunities to learn from more mature  organizations.", "We have found that ongoing performance measurement can serve as an  early warning system to management and as a vehicle for improving  accountability to the public. We have previously reported that providing  baseline and trend data can help to assess an agency\u2019s performance  more fully because the data show progress over time and decision  makers can use historical data to assess performance.", "As OMB and agencies move forward with PMIAA implementation, it will  be critical to measure how agencies are maturing or building their  capacity in the areas of program and project management. Such  measures could include showing how OMB\u2019s program management  standards and principles are integrated into agencies\u2019 programs and  policies, the improvement of data quality used to track agency program  outcomes in the program portfolio reviews, and improvement in program  manager skills. Although not required by PMIAA, it is a good practice for  OMB and agencies to consider ways to measure the effects of the act.  Without establishing such measures to assess PMIAA outcomes, it will be  challenging to gauge how agencies are making progress to identify  trends, or to help agencies improve data quality."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The program and project management standards OMB developed are  less detailed than accepted standards and are missing several elements  that would have made them more useful. For example, the OMB  standards do not provide a minimum threshold against which agencies  can gauge to what extent they have met each standard. Further, OMB\u2019s  current governance structure is insufficient for further developing and  maintaining program management standards. Although OMB received  input from stakeholders to develop the standards and plans to update  them in partnership with the PMPC in 2020, OMB does not have a  governance structure that assigns roles and responsibilities to further  develop, approve, maintain, or monitor standards. Having such a  governance structure for managing efforts going forward could help  sustain the program standards as they change over time.", "OMB did not follow most leading practices for designing pilots and may  have missed opportunities to make improvements for fiscal year 2019  portfolio reviews. OMB has not determined if it plans to conduct additional  pilot efforts. Going forward, as OMB expands the portfolio reviews to  other types of program areas beyond non-IT major acquisitions, it has the  opportunity to develop and learn from additional pilots. Although OMB  staff have not yet determined if they will do additional pilots for program  management in the future, they could decide to pilot the portfolio reviews  of grants that they plan to initiate in fiscal year 2020.", "OMB has not identified other program areas beyond non-IT major  acquisitions and grants to be included in future portfolio reviews.  Communicating to agencies about specific program areas, portfolio  review procedures, time frames, and expectations beyond 2020 could  help agencies better direct their efforts to improve the portfolio review  processes and help ensure continued progress to implement PMIAA  more broadly.", "As of October 2019, OMB had not taken any actions in response to the  recommendations in our September 2017 report and has not yet fully  established an inventory of federal programs. Such an inventory of  programs could be a critical tool to help agency officials identify and  manage programs across the federal government. Furthermore, if OMB  were to fully implement our recommendations and complete the required  inventory of federal programs, it would assist agencies to match  resources to agencies\u2019 program management needs and assist agencies  in preparing for future PMIAA portfolio reviews. Furthermore, OMB  provides three different definitions for a \u201cprogram\u201d in its guidance for  PMIAA, GPRAMA, and the DATA Act. Having different definitions of what  constitutes a program could lead to confusion among agencies. It could  also cause increased burden on agencies as they work to identify,  maintain, and report on three sets of differently defined programs.", "Meetings between OMB, relevant agencies, and us have been critical for  past progress on high-risk areas. However, OMB has held these trilateral  meetings to address only five of 35 high-risk areas since it began  implementing PMIAA. These meetings could both demonstrate and  improve the commitment of agency leadership to high-risk areas across  the federal government. As we have reported, leadership commitment is  a key tenet in agencies\u2019 ability to address high-risk areas. Without  convening trilateral meetings on each high-risk area, OMB might miss  opportunities to make progress toward addressing high-risk areas by  improving leadership commitment to addressing them.", "The PMPC did not address our High-Risk List during its meetings nor has  it made recommendations to OMB about high-risk areas.
