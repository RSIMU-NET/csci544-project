As stated earlier, a civil case  could lead to penalties up to $200,000, while a criminal case\u2014usually  pursued if lobbyists\u2019 noncompliance is found to be knowing and corrupt\u2014 could lead to a maximum of 5 years in prison.", "Officials reported that for the 2012 reporting period, the Office sent  demand letters, made phone contacts or sent emails to eight registrants  on the chronic offenders list. Demand letters list the number of times the  registrant was referred by the Secretary of the Senate and Clerk of the  House; describe the number of occasions that lobbying disclosure reports  were not filed by the deadline; and request registrants to immediately file  the outstanding reports and contact the Office within 10 days to resolve  the matter. Four of the registrants filed the outstanding reports or  terminated their registration after being contacted by an Assistant U.S.  Attorney. Additionally, in September 2012, the Office reached settlement  agreements with two of the registrants from the chronic offenders list.  One firm agreed to pay $50,000 and the other $30,000 in civil penalties  for repeatedly failing to file disclosure reports. As of March 2013, both  firms have paid the fines in full and complied fully with their outstanding  and ongoing reporting requirements. The Office sent demand letters to  the remaining two registrants from the chronic offenders list on February  4, 2013. As of March 5, 2013, the two registrants have not responded to  the demand letters. The Assistant U.S. Attorney is preparing a  memorandum to request legal authority to pursue civil or criminal  penalties against both registrants. Civil Division management will review  this request and determine the appropriate action.", "The Office continues to monitor and review the chronic offenders list to  determine whether to continue enforcement actions, which includes  considering legal actions or dismissing certain cases."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Attorney General for review and  comment.

To assess whether these  disclosure data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report,  we reviewed relevant documentation and spoke to officials responsible for  maintaining the data. Although registrations and reports are filed through  a single web portal, each chamber subsequently receives copies of the  data and follows different data cleaning, processing, and editing  procedures before storing the data in either individual files (in the House)  or databases (in the Senate). Currently, there is no means of reconciling  discrepancies between the two databases caused by the differences in  data processing. For example, Senate staff told us during previous  reviews that they set aside a greater proportion of registration and report  submissions than the House for manual review before entering the  information into the database, and as a result, the Senate database would  be slightly less current than the House database on any given day  pending review and clearance. House staff told us during previous  reviews that they rely heavily on automated processing, and that while  they manually review reports that do not perfectly match in formation file  for a given registrant or client, they will approve and upload such reports  as originally filed by each lobbyist even if the reports contain errors or  discrepancies (such as a variant on how a name is spelled).  Nevertheless, we do not have reasons to believe that the content of the  Senate and House systems would vary substantially. For this review, we  determined that House disclosure data were sufficiently reliable for  identifying a sample of quarterly disclosure (LD-2) reports and for  assessing whether newly filed registrants also filed required reports. We  used the House database for sampling LD-2 reports from the third and  fourth quarters of calendar year 2011and the first and second quarters of  calendar year 2012, as well as for sampling year-end 2011 and midyear  2012 political contributions (LD-203) reports and finally for matching  quarterly registrations with filed reports. We did not evaluate the Offices  of the Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of the House, both of which  have key roles in the lobbying disclosure process, although we consulted  with officials from each office, and they provided us with general  background information at our request and detailed information on data  processing procedures.", "To assess the extent to which lobbyists could provide evidence of their  compliance with reporting requirements, we examined a stratified random  sample of 100 LD-2 reports from the third and fourth quarters of 2011 and  the first and second quarters of 2012. We excluded reports with no  lobbying activity or with income less than $5,000 from our sampling  frame. We drew our sample from 49,286 activity reports filed for the third  and fourth quarters of 2011 and the first and second quarters of 2012  available in the public House database, as of our final download date for  each quarter. One LD-2 report in the sample was amended after the  lobbyist was notified of being selected for the sample but prior to the  review. As a result, we excluded this report from our sample and replaced  it with another LD-2 report for the same quarter. Our sample was not  designed to detect differences over time and we did not conduct tests of  significance for changes from 2010 to 2012.", "Our sample is based on a stratified random selection, and it is only one of  a large number of samples that we may have drawn. Because each  sample could have provided different estimates, we express our  confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results as a 95  percent confidence interval. This interval would contain the actual  population value for 95 percent of the samples that we could have drawn.  All percentage estimates in this report have 95 percent confidence  intervals of within plus or minus 10.5 percentage points or less of the  estimate itself, unless otherwise noted. When estimating compliance with  certain of the elements we examined, we base our estimate on a one- sided 95 percent confidence interval to generate a conservative estimate  of either the minimum or the maximum percentage of reports in the  population exhibiting the characteristic. the amount of income reported for lobbying activities,  the amount of expenses reported on lobbying activities,  the names of those lobbyists listed in the report,  the houses of Congress and federal agencies that they lobbied, and  the issue codes listed to describe their lobbying activity.", "Prior to each interview, we conducted an open source search to identify  lobbyists on each report who may have held a covered official position.  We reviewed the lobbyists\u2019 previous work histories by searching lobbying  firms\u2019 websites, LinkedIn, Leadership Directories, Who\u2019s Who in American  Politics, Legistorm, and U.S. newspapers through Nexis. Prior to 2008,  lobbyists were only required to disclose covered official positions held  within 2 years of registering as a lobbyist for the client. HLOGA amended  that time frame to require disclosure of positions held 20 years before the  date the lobbyists first lobbied on behalf of the client. Lobbyist are  required to disclose previously held covered official positions either on the  client registration (LD-1) or on the first LD-2 report when the lobbyist is  added as \u201cnew.\u201d Consequently, those who held covered official positions  may have disclosed the information on the LD-1 or a LD-2 report filed  prior to the report we examined as part of our random sample. Therefore,  where we found evidence that a lobbyist previously held a covered official  position, we conducted an additional review of the publicly available  Secretary of the Senate or Clerk of the House database to determine  whether the lobbyist properly disclosed the covered official position.  Finally, if a lobbyist appeared to hold a covered position that was not  disclosed, we asked for an explanation at the interview with the lobbying  firm to ensure that our research was accurate. Despite our rigorous  search, it is possible that we failed to identify all previously held covered  official positions for all lobbyists listed. Thus, our estimate of the  proportion of reports with lobbyists who failed to disclose properly  covered official positions is a lower-bound estimate of the minimum  proportion of reports that failed to report such positions.", "In addition to examining the content of the LD-2 reports, we confirmed  whether year-end 2011 or midyear 2012 LD-203 reports had been filed  for each firm and lobbyist listed on the LD-2 reports in our random  sample. Although this review represents a random selection of lobbyists  and firms, it is not a direct probability sample of firms filing LD-2 reports or  lobbyists listed on LD-2 reports. As such, we did not estimate the  likelihood that LD-203 reports were appropriately filed for the population  of firms or lobbyists listed on LD-2 reports.", "To determine if the LDA\u2019s requirement for registrants to file a report in the  quarter of registration was met for the third and fourth quarters of 2011  and the first and second quarters of 2012, we used data filed with the  Clerk of the House to match newly filed registrations with corresponding  disclosure reports. Using direct matching and text and pattern matching  procedures, we were able to identify matching disclosure reports for  2,753, or 90 percent, of the 3,074 newly filed registrations. We began by  standardizing client and registrant names in both the report and  registration files (including removing punctuation and standardizing words  and abbreviations, such as \u201ccompany\u201d and \u201cCO\u201d). We then matched  reports and registrations using the House identification number (which is  linked to a unique registrant-client pair), as well as the names of the  registrant and client. For reports we could not match by identification  number and standardized name, we also attempted to match reports and  registrations by client and registrant name, allowing for variations in the  names to accommodate minor misspellings or typos. For these cases, we  used professional judgment to determine whether cases with typos were  sufficiently similar to consider as matches. We could not readily identify  matches in the report database for the remaining registrations using  electronic means.", "To assess the accuracy of the LD-203 reports, we analyzed stratified  random samples of LD-203 reports from the 31,894 total LD-203 reports.  The first sample contains 80 reports of the 10,948 reports with political  contributions and the second contains 80 reports of the 20,946 reports  listing no contributions. Each sample contains 40 reports from the year- end 2011 filing period and 40 reports from the midyear 2012 filing period.  The samples from 2012 allow us to generalize estimates in this report to  either the population of LD-203 reports with contributions or the reports  without contributions to within a 95 percent confidence interval of plus or  minus 8.6 percentage points or less, and to within 4.7 percentage points  of estimate when analyzing both samples together. Our sample was not  designed to detect differences over time and we did not conduct tests of  significance for changes from 2010 to 2012. We analyzed the contents of  the LD-203 reports and compared them to contribution data found in the  publicly available Federal Elections Commission\u2019s (FEC) political  contribution database. We interviewed staff at the FEC responsible for  administering the database and determined that the data reliability is  suitable for the purpose of confirming whether a FEC-reportable  disclosure listed in the FEC database had been reported on an LD-203  report.", "We compared the FEC-reportable contributions reporting on the LD-203  reports with information in the FEC database. The verification process  required text and pattern matching procedures, and we used professional  judgment when assessing whether an individual listed is the same  individual filing an LD-203. For contributions reported in the FEC  database and not on the LD-203 report, we asked the lobbyists or  organizations to explain why the contribution was not listed on the LD-203  report or to provide documentation of those contributions. As with covered  positions on LD-2 disclosure reports, we cannot be certain that our review  identified all cases of FEC-reportable contributions that were  inappropriately omitted from a lobbyist\u2019s LD-203 report. Our estimates of  the percentage of reports that omit contributions is a lower-bound  estimate. We did not estimate the percentage of other non-FEC political  contributions that were omitted because they tend to constitute a small  minority of all listed contributions and cannot be verified against an  external source.", "To identify challenges to compliance, we used structured interviews and  obtained the views from 90 different lobbying firms included in our sample  of 100 LD-2 reports rather than on the total number of interviews  conducted, on any challenges to compliance. To obtain their views, we  asked them to rate their ease with complying with the LD-2 disclosure  requirements using a scale, of \u201cvery easy\u201d, \u201csomewhat easy\u201d, \u201csomewhat  difficult\u201d or \u201cvery difficult.\u201d In addition, using the same scale we asked  them to rate the ease of understanding the terms associated with LD-2  reporting requirements.", "To describe the resources and authorities available to the Office and its  efforts to improve its enforcement of the LDA, we interviewed officials  from the Office and obtained updated information on the capabilities of  the system they established to track and report compliance trends and  referrals, and other practices established to focus resources on  enforcement of the Act. The Office provided us with updated reports from  the tracking system on the number and status of referrals and chronically  noncompliant offenders.", "The mandate does not include identifying lobbyists who failed to register  and report in accordance with LDA requirements, or whether for those  lobbyists who did register and report all lobbying activity or contributions  were disclosed.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2012 through April 2013  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
