Responsibility for formulating guidance on these plans and for assessing executive branch COOP capabilities lies with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), under the Department of Homeland Security. FEMA guidance, Federal Preparedness Circular (FPC) 65 (July 1999), provides elements of a viable COOP capability, including the requirement that agencies identify their essential functions. GAO was asked to determine the extent to which (1) major civilian executive branch agencies have identified their essential functions and (2) these agencies' COOP plans follow FEMA guidance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From an assessment of 34 COOP plans against FEMA guidance, GAO found that most agencies' plans identified at least one function as essential. However, the functions identified in each plan varied widely in number-- ranging from 3 to 399--and included functions that appeared to be of secondary importance, while at the same time omitting programs that had been previously defined as high-impact programs. (Examples of these highimpact programs are Medicare, food stamps, and border inspections.) For example, one department included \"provide speeches and articles for the Secretary and Deputy Secretary,\" among its essential functions, but did not include 9 of 10 high-impact programs for which it is responsible. Several factors contributed to these shortcomings: FPC 65 did not provide specific criteria for identifying essential functions; FEMA did not review the essential functions identified when it assessed COOP planning; and it did not conduct tests or exercises to confirm that the essential functions were correctly identified. Unless agencies' essential functions are correctly and completely identified, their COOP plans may not effectively ensure that the most vital government services can be maintained in an emergency. Although all but three of the agencies reviewed had developed and documented some of the elements of a viable COOP plan, none of the agencies could demonstrate that they were following all the guidance in FPC 65. There is a wide variation in the number of agencies that addressed various elements identified in the guidance. A contributing cause for the deficiencies in agency COOP plans is the level of FEMA oversight. In 1999, FEMA conducted an assessment of agency compliance with FPC 65, but it has not conducted oversight that is sufficiently regular and extensive to ensure that agencies correct the deficiencies identified. Because the resulting COOP plans do not include all the elements of a viable plan as defined by FPC 65, agency efforts to provide services during an emergency could be impaired."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As you know, essential government services can be interrupted by a range  of events, including terrorist attacks, severe weather, or building-level  emergencies.

This directive also designated the Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as executive agent for executive  branch continuity of operations (COOP) planning, which includes the  responsibility for formulating guidance on such planning and for assessing  the status of executive branch COOP capabilities. In response, FEMA  issued guidance to agencies, entitled Federal Preparedness Circular (FPC)  65, in July 1999. The circular states that in order to have a viable COOP  capability, agencies should identify their essential functions. These  functions then provide the basis for subsequent planning steps. The  circular also identified eight elements of a viable COOP capability.", "Concerned about the ability of the federal government to continue to  provide essential services during an emergency, you requested us to report  to you concerning some aspects of headquarters contingency plans from a  number of civilian departments and agencies.

Such disruptions, particularly if  prolonged, can lead to interruptions in essential government services.  Prudent management, therefore, requires that federal agencies develop  plans for dealing with emergency situations, including maintaining  services, ensuring proper authority for government actions, and protecting  vital assets.", "Until relatively recently, continuity planning was generally the  responsibility of individual agencies. In October 1998, PDD 67 identified  FEMA\u2014which is responsible for responding to, planning for, recovering  from, and mitigating against disasters\u2014as the executive agent for federal  COOP planning across the federal executive branch. FEMA was an  independent agency until March 2003, when it became part of the  Department of Homeland Security, reporting to the Under Secretary for  Emergency Preparedness and Response.", "PDD 67 is a Top Secret document controlled by the National Security  Council. FPC 65 states that PDD 67 made FEMA, as executive agent for  COOP, responsible for   formulating guidance for agencies to use in developing viable plans;  coordinating interagency exercises and facilitating interagency  coordination, as appropriate; and  overseeing and assessing the status of COOP capabilities across the  executive branch.", "According to FEMA officials, PDD 67 also required that agencies have  COOP plans in place by October 1999.", "In July 1999, FEMA issued FPC 65 to assist agencies in meeting the October  1999 deadline. FPC 65 states that COOP planning should address any  emergency or situation that could disrupt normal operations, including  localized emergencies. FPC 65 also determined that COOP planning is  based first on the identification of essential functions\u2014that is, those  functions that enable agencies to provide vital services, exercise civil  authority, maintain safety, and sustain the economy during an emergency.  FPC 65 gives no criteria for identifying essential functions beyond this  definition.", "Although FPC 65 gives no specific criteria for identifying essential  functions, a logical starting point for this process would be to consider  programs that had been previously identified as important. For example, in March 1999, as part of the efforts to address the Y2K computer problem,  the Director of OMB identified 42 programs with a high impact on the  public:   Of these 42 programs, 38 were the responsibility of the 23 major  departments and agencies that we reviewed. (App. III provides a list of  these 38 high-impact programs and the component agencies that are  responsible for them.)", "Of these 23 major departments and agencies, 16 were responsible for at  least one high-impact program; several were responsible for more than  one.", "Programs that were identified included weather service, disease  monitoring and warnings, public housing, air traffic control, food stamps,  and Social Security benefits. These programs, as well as the others listed in  appendix III, continue to perform important functions for the public.", "The Y2K planning to support these high-impact programs included COOP  planning and specifically addressed interdependencies. Planning included  identifying partners integral to program delivery, testing data exchanges  across partners, developing complementary business continuity and  contingency plans, sharing key information on readiness with other  partners and the public, and taking other steps to ensure that the agency\u2019s  high-impact program would work in the event of an emergency.", "Although the identification of essential functions was established as the  first step in COOP planning, FPC 65 also identified an additional seven  other planning topics that make up a viable COOP capability. The guidance  provided a general definition of each of the eight topics and identified  several actions that should be completed to address each topic. Table 1  lists the eight topic areas covered in FPC 65 and provides an example of an  action under each."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many COOP Plans Did Not Address Previously Identified Essential Functions or Interdependencies with Other Entities", "paragraphs": ["The identification of essential functions is a prerequisite for COOP  planning because it establishes the planning parameters that drive the  agency\u2019s efforts in all other planning topics. For example, FPC 65 directs  agencies to identify alternative facilities, staff, and resources necessary to  support continuation of their essential functions. The effectiveness of the  plan as a whole and the implementation of all other elements depend on the  performance of this step.", "Of the 34 agency COOP plans we reviewed, 29 plans included at least one  function that was identified as essential. These agency-identified essential  functions varied in number and scope. The number of functions identified  in each plan ranged from 3 to 399. In addition, the apparent importance of  the functions was not consistent. For example, a number of essential  functions were of clear importance, such as   \u201censuring uninterrupted command, control, and leadership of the   \u201cprotecting critical facilities, systems, equipment and records\u201d; and  \u201ccontinuing to pay the government\u2019s obligations.\u201d", "Other identified functions appeared vague or of questionable importance:   \u201cprovide speeches and articles for the Secretary and Deputy Secretary\u201d;  \u201cschedule all activities of the Secretary\u201d; and   \u201creview fiscal and programmatic integrity and efficiency of  Departmental activities.\u201d", "In contrast to the examples just given, agencies did not list among their  essential functions 20 of the 38 \u201chigh-impact\u201d programs identified during  the Y2K effort at the agencies we reviewed.", "Another important consideration in identifying essential functions is the  assessment of interdependencies among functions and organizations. As  we have previously reported, many agency functions rely on the  availability of resources or functions controlled by another organization,  including other agencies, state and local governments, and private entities.  (For example, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Financial Management  Service receives and makes payments for most federal agencies.) The  identification of such interdependencies continues to be essential to the  related areas of information security and critical infrastructure protection.  Although FPC 65 does not use the term \u201cinterdependencies,\u201d it directs  agencies to \u201cintegrate supporting activities to ensure that essential  functions can be performed.\u201d", "Of the 34 plans we reviewed, 19 showed no evidence of an effort to identify  interdependencies and link them to essential functions, which is a  prerequisite to developing plans and procedures to support these functions  and all other elements of COOP planning. Nine plans identified some key  partners, but appeared to have excluded others: for instance, six agencies  either make or collect payments, but did not mention the role of the  Treasury Department in their COOP plans.", "The high level of generality in FEMA\u2019s guidance on essential functions  contributed to the inconsistencies in agencies\u2019 identification of these  functions. In its initial guidance, FPC 65, FEMA provided minimal criteria  for agencies to make these identifications, giving a brief definition only.  According to FEMA officials, the agency is currently developing revised  COOP guidance that will provide more specific direction on identifying  essential functions. According to these officials, FEMA expects to release  the revised guidance in March 2004.", "Further, although FEMA conducted several assessments of agency COOP  planning between 1995 and 2001, none of these addressed the identification  of essential functions. In addition, FEMA has begun development of a  system to collect data from agencies on the readiness of their COOP plans,  but FEMA officials told us that they will not use the system to validate the  essential functions identified by each agency or their interdependencies.  According to FEMA officials, the agencies are better able to make those  determinations. However, especially in view of the wide variance in  number and importance of functions identified, as well as omissions of  high-impact programs, the lack of FEMA review lowers the level of  assurance that the essential functions that have been identified are  appropriate.", "Additionally, in its oversight role, FEMA had the opportunity to help  agencies refine their essential functions through an interagency COOP test  or exercise. According to FPC 65, FEMA is responsible for coordinating  such exercises. FEMA is developing a test and training program for COOP  activities, but it has not yet conducted an interagency exercise to test the  feasibility of these planned activities. FEMA had planned a  governmentwide exercise in 2002, but the exercise was cancelled after the  September 11 attacks. FEMA is currently preparing to conduct a  governmentwide exercise in mid-May 2004.", "Improper identification of essential functions can have a negative impact  on the entire COOP plan, because other aspects of the COOP plan are  designed around supporting these functions. If an agency fails to identify a  function as essential, it will not make the necessary arrangements to  perform that function. If it identifies too many functions as essential, it  risks being unable to adequately address all of them.

Following FPC 65,  FEMA issued more detailed guidance in April 2001 on two of FPC 65\u2019s eight  topic areas: FPC 66 provides guidance on developing viable test, training,  and exercise programs, and FPC 67 provides guidance for acquiring  alternate facilities.

Following this assessment, FEMA  gave agencies feedback on ways to improve their respective COOP plans,  and it made general recommendations, not specific to individual agencies,  that addressed programwide problems. However, FEMA did not then  follow up to determine whether individual agencies made improvements in  response to its feedback and general recommendations. Besides inquiring  about actions in response to the September 2001 attacks, the 2001  assessment was designed to provide an update on programwide problems  that had been identified in the assessments of 1995 and 1999.

However, according to FEMA  officials, while they recognize the need for some type of verification, FEMA  has not yet determined a method of verifying these data.", "Without regular assessments of COOP plans that evaluate individual plans  for adequacy, FEMA will not be able to provide information to help  agencies improve their COOP plans.

First, they stated that before its transition to the Department of  Homeland Security, the agency did not have the legal or budgetary  authority to conduct more active oversight of the COOP activities of other  agencies. However, FPC 65 states that PDD 67 made the agency responsible  for guidance, coordination, and oversight in this area, in addition to  requiring agencies to develop COOP plans. Accordingly, although it cannot  determine how agencies budget resources for such planning, it does have  the authority to oversee this planning. Second, according to these officials,  until last year, the agency devoted roughly 13 staff to COOP guidance,  coordination, and oversight, as well as the development of FEMA\u2019s own  COOP plan.

Further, FEMA  has done very little to help agencies identify those functions that are truly  essential or to identify and plan for interdependencies among agency  functions. FEMA has begun taking steps to improve its oversight, by  developing more specific guidance and a system to track agency-provided  COOP readiness information, and it is planning a governmentwide  exercise. However, although the proposed guidance and exercise may help  agencies improve their plans, the system that FEMA is developing to  collect data on COOP readiness is weakened by a lack of planning to verify  agency-submitted data, validate agency-identified essential functions, or  identify interdependencies with other activities.
