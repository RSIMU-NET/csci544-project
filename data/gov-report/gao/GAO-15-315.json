In carrying out its mission, the Library increasingly relies on IT systems, particularly in light of the ways that digital technology has changed the way information is created, shared, and preserved.", "The House Appropriations Committee report accompanying the 2015 legislative branch appropriations bill required GAO to conduct a review of IT management at the Library. GAO's objectives focused on the extent to which the Library has established and implemented key IT practices and requirements in, among other areas: (1) strategic planning, (2) governance and investment management, (3) information security and privacy, (4) service management, and (5) leadership. To carry out its work, GAO reviewed Library regulations, policies, procedures, plans, and other relevant documentation for each area and interviewed key Library officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Library of Congress has established policies and procedures for managing its information technology (IT) resources, but significant weaknesses across several areas have hindered their effectiveness:", "Strategic planning: The Library does not have an IT strategic plan that is aligned with the overall agency strategic plan and establishes goals, measures, and strategies. This leaves the Library without a clear direction for its use of IT.", "Investment management: Although the Library obligated at least $119 million on IT for fiscal year 2014, it is not effectively managing its investments. To its credit, the Library has established structures for managing IT investments\u2014including a review board and a process for selecting investments. However, the board does not review all key investments, and its roles and responsibilities are not always clearly defined. Additionally, the Library does not have a complete process for tracking its IT spending or an accurate inventory of its assets. For example, while the inventory identifies over 18,000 computers currently in use, officials stated that the Library has fewer than 6,500. Until the Library addresses these weaknesses, its ability to make informed decisions will be impaired.", "Information security and privacy: The Library assigned roles and responsibilities and developed policies and procedures for securing its information and systems. However, its implementation of key security and privacy management controls was uneven. For example, the Library's system inventory did not include all key systems. Additionally, the Library did not always fully define and test security controls for its systems, remediate weaknesses in a timely manner, and assess the risks to the privacy of personal information in its systems. Such deficiencies also contributed to weaknesses in technical security controls, putting the Library's systems and information at risk of compromise.", "Service management: The Library's Information Technology Services (ITS) division is primarily responsible for providing IT services to the agency's operating units. While ITS has catalogued these services, it has not fully developed agreements with the other units specifying expected levels of performance. Further, the other units were often not satisfied with these services, which has contributed to them independently pursuing their own IT activities. This in turn has resulted in units purchasing unnecessary hardware and software, maintaining separate e-mail environments, and managing overlapping or duplicative IT activities.", "Leadership: The Library does not have the leadership needed to address these IT management weaknesses. For example, the agency's chief information officer (CIO) position does not have adequate authority over or oversight of the Library's IT. Additionally, the Library has not had a permanent CIO since 2012 and has had five temporary CIOs in the interim.", "In January 2015, at the conclusion of GAO's review, officials stated that that the Library plans to draft an IT strategic plan within 90 days and hire a permanent CIO.

In 1996, we  issued a report on a management review of the Library, covering six  major issue areas, including its use of IT. Among other things, the  review found that (1) the Library lacked a sufficient strategic focus on  information resources management that was linked to its mission  objectives; (2) its existing technology infrastructure was not integrated  across the Library at a level appropriate to reduce interfaces between  systems, lessen the need for maintenance resources, and minimize  redundant data; (3) technology programs and projects were not managed  as investments, with insufficient attention paid to program and project  costs, priorities, and performance; and (4) the Library had not decided  whether it should continue to build new systems in-house or whether it  would be more cost-effective to acquire these capabilities elsewhere. The  report recommended a number of actions the Library could take to  improve its management of IT in these areas. In commenting on the  report, the Library acknowledged the need to link information resources to  its mission objectives and re-focus its infrastructure to reflect changes in  the technology environment.", "The findings in this report were echoed in a review conducted by the  National Academy of Sciences and in several reports from the Library\u2019s  Inspector General (IG). In 2000, the National Academy of Sciences  released a report, commissioned by the Library, that examined the need  for the Library to develop a digital strategy to cope with the fact that  content was increasingly being produced in digital forms. The study  found that all Library service units spent money on IT and that this  spending was not fully coordinated across the Library. It was unable to  quantify this spending because the Library had not established financial  accounting for IT. The study concluded that \u201chadow systems and  duplication are the inevitable outcome of such arrangements.\u201d  Additionally, the study found that strategic direction for IT must come from  the office of the Librarian, but that the most senior members of that  office\u2014the Librarian of Congress, Deputy Librarian, and Chief of Staff\u2014 did not have any specific background or expertise in IT.

For example, according to the SLA  governing the management of eCO, in the event of a disaster that  affects IT operations in the main data center, ITS is to recover the  eCO system at its alternate computing facility within 24 hours of  the disaster. However, ITS did not establish targets for any of the  other 28 services in its service catalog, such as the amount of  time systems are available as part of its hosting service.", "According to the ITS Assistant Director for Operations, ITS recently  established service-level targets for one additional service: the service  desk. These targets pertained to how quickly problems should be  resolved, depending on their severity. He added that these targets reflect  ITS\u2019s intent to provide the same level of service to all of its customers.  However, the service units have not agreed to these targets. According to  the ITS Assistant Director for Operations, he briefed the services units on  these targets and received feedback, but acknowledged that ITS did not  establish formal agreements with the service units. Without agreement  from the service units, it is unclear whether these service-level targets will  meet the unique business needs of the Library\u2019s service units.", "The ITS Assistant Director for Operations further stated that ITS has  drafted a policy documenting its approach to developing SLAs. If  approved, the policy will call for ITS to continue to develop two types of  SLAs\u2014(1) those with individual service units to define a unique service,  and (2) SLAs with the Library of Congress as a whole. Although the draft  policy calls for the use of service-level targets for Library-wide SLAs, it  does not do so for SLAs with individual service units. Moreover, given that  the policy is to govern ITS, it is unclear whether the policy will reflect an  SLA structure that covers the IT services and customers in a manner best  suited to meet the needs of both ITS and its customers. For example, the  policy would no longer allow ITS to enter into agreements with individual  service groups within a service unit\u2014such as NLS. At the conclusion of  our review, the ITS Assistant Director for Operations told us that ITS  submitted the policy to the Library\u2019s interim CIO in January 2015. He also  stated that the ITSC and Executive Committee will complete their reviews  by May 2015 and that SLAs under the new policy will be completed by  September 2015.", "Until the Library establishes and implements an SLA structure\u2014to include  the use of service-level targets\u2014that meets the needs of the organization,  there is increased risk that ITS will not provide services that meet the  needs of its customers. In the case of the Copyright Office, this risk has  been realized. For example, according to the Copyright CIO, the Library  controls when eCO is shut down for maintenance and these have, at  times, been scheduled during periods of heavy traffic from the office\u2019s  external users."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Service Units Were Often Not Satisfied with Library IT Services, but ITS Has Not Established a Plan for Improvement", "paragraphs": ["The weaknesses in ITS\u2019s implementation of service-level management  practices were reflected by inconsistent satisfaction with the services that  it provides. To be successful, IT organizations should measure the  satisfaction of their users and take steps to improve it. In this regard,  effectively managing activities to improve user satisfaction requires  planning and executing such activities in a disciplined fashion. The  Software Engineering Institute\u2019s IDEALSM model is a recognized approach  for managing efforts to make system improvements. According to this  model, user satisfaction improvement efforts should include a written plan  that serves as the foundation and basis for guiding improvement  activities, including obtaining management commitment to and funding for  the activities, establishing a baseline of commitments and expectations  against which to measure progress, prioritizing and executing activities  and initiatives, determining success, and identifying and applying lessons  learned. Through such a structured and disciplined approach,  improvement resources can be invested in a manner that produces  optimal results.", "However, ITS has not demonstrated that user satisfaction improvement  efforts are being guided by a documented plan that defines prioritized  improvement projects and associated resource requirements, schedules,  and measurable goals and outcomes. Instead, efforts that the office  undertook to improve user satisfaction were ad hoc and did not meet with  success. Specifically, ITS only measures user satisfaction for 1 of the 31  services it provides to other service units (help desk services).", "In the absence of comprehensive data on ITS customer satisfaction, we  surveyed the heads of the Library\u2019s seven service units, as well as the  head of NLS, about the extent to which they were satisfied with the IT  services provided by ITS. The results showed that ITS\u2019s customers\u2014the  Library\u2019s service units\u2014vary in the extent to which they are satisfied with  the services provided by ITS, but collectively these customers are  generally not satisfied.", "Specifically, the average score for all IT services provided by ITS was  3.17 (on a 5-point satisfaction scale, where 1 is very dissatisfied and 5 is  very satisfied), and the scores for each service ranged from a low of  2.33 to a high of 4.40. More specifically, only 2 of the 29 services had an  average score above 4, indicating that service units were generally very  satisfied or somewhat satisfied with these services. The majority of the  services\u201419 of the 29 services\u2014ranged from 3.75 to 3.0, indicating that  service units were generally neither satisfied nor dissatisfied or somewhat  satisfied with these services. Lastly, a little more than a quarter of the  services (8 of 29) had an average score below 3, which indicates that  service units were generally neither satisfied nor dissatisfied or somewhat  dissatisfied. Table 6 shows the average customer satisfaction score for  each of the 29 IT services that ITS provides.", "In addition to providing scores, the survey respondents also provided  written comments. Five factors were cited by two or more respondents as  contributing to their dissatisfaction with the services provided by ITS:", "Lack of transparency: Six of the eight respondents cited a lack of  transparency from ITS as a source of dissatisfaction with its services.  For example, two respondents discussed transparency issues with the  Library\u2019s IT Continuity of Operations Planning: one cited issues with  testing, while the other discussed a need for more transparency with  respect to the decision making on the priority of systems to be  recovered in the event of a disaster. Further, one respondent stated  that OSI/ITS develops the IT strategic direction for the organization  without consulting with the senior leadership of the respondent\u2019s  service unit.", "Poor quality of service: Five respondents cited the poor quality of  service provided by ITS as a key source of dissatisfaction. For  example, three respondents described problems with the Library\u2019s  telework infrastructure, noting that the service is frequently  unavailable. Additionally, two respondents stated that the  configuration of the software used to prevent access to certain  websites results in overbroad restrictions. One respondent also noted  that the implementation of the process used to gain access to  restricted sites is uneven\u2014some requests are resolved in a timely  manner, while others are not. In addition, one respondent stated that  during recent data center emergencies, data were lost by ITS.  Similarly, according to that respondent, during a power outage in  2009, ITS could not maintain power to the data center because of  known problems with one of its emergency power devices, resulting in  unplanned outages and disruptions to day-to-day operations.", "Inconsistent implementation of IT management processes: Five  respondents cited inconsistent implementation of IT management  processes as one of the reasons for their dissatisfaction with some of  the services provided by ITS. For example, two respondents  described weaknesses in ITS\u2019s implementation of project  management practices, noting that ITS needs more experienced  project managers and improvements in cost estimating. Additionally,  four respondents cited problems with ITS\u2019s change management  practices: two respondents stated that ITS frequently does not follow  its established process, one said that the process takes months to  review applications, and the other said that more consistent  configurations and settings are needed. Furthermore, two  respondents stated that the Library has not conducted testing needed  for its continuity of operations and disaster recovery process.  Additionally, three respondents described challenges relating to the  certification and accreditation process, citing problems with cost,  timeliness, and inconsistent implementation.", "Inconsistent communication: Four respondents cited inconsistent  communication as a reason for dissatisfaction with some of the  services provided by ITS. For example, three respondents stated that  ITS did not always effectively communicate when outages in IT  systems were to occur. One respondent described instances where  they were informed of outages affecting public-facing systems from  external customers before they were notified by ITS. In addition, one  respondent described instances where they received conflicting  information and direction from ITS.", "Use of outdated technology: Four respondents cited outdated  technology used by ITS as a reason for dissatisfaction with its  services. For example, two respondents stated that ITS needs to  invest in a modern infrastructure; one respondent explained that,  without such an infrastructure, the Library will not be able to meet the  technical requirements for acquiring and stewarding digital collections.", "According to ITS, it has recently taken steps to measure and improve  user satisfaction. For example, in September 2014, ITS began conducting  surveys of customers that used its service desk, and reported that it  received very positive feedback on this service.", "However, ITS has not demonstrated that user satisfaction improvement  efforts are being guided by a documented plan that defines prioritized  improvement projects and associated resource requirements, schedules,  and measurable goals and outcomes. Given the Library\u2019s reliance on IT  services provided by ITS, as well as the results of our survey, it is critical  that ITS identify and implement improvements in a disciplined and  structured fashion. For example, as discussed later in this report,  continued dissatisfaction with ITS services may have led customers to  perform the services themselves in order to improve their IT performance  and decrease their reliance on ITS. Without a documented improvement  plan, efforts to improve user satisfaction may be reduced to trial and  error, and ITS will not be able to adequately ensure that it is effectively  investing resources on improvement efforts that will satisfy users."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Duplicative or Overlapping IT Activities Are Being Performed by Service Units across the Library", "paragraphs": ["The lack of an enterprise-wide approach to managing IT, in combination  with dissatisfaction with the services provided by ITS, has contributed to  other service units independently performing duplicative or overlapping  activities in support of their business needs. For example, although ITS is  responsible for the Library\u2019s primary IT service desk (which provides IT  troubleshooting service to all Library personnel), CRS and Library  Services maintain separate service desks for their personnel. According  to the CRS CIO and the Chief of Library Services Automation Planning &  Liaison Office, although the service desks maintained by CRS and Library  Services perform some functions that ITS\u2019s service desk performs (e.g.,  resetting passwords), their service desks also perform unique functions.  However, because they perform some overlapping functions, the Library  may be spending more than it needs to on these service desks.", "As another example, as previously mentioned, according to the official  who served as acting CIO from April 2014 to January 2015, each service  unit is responsible for managing its own human capital skills. For  example, that official told us that, for its own staff needs, OSI identifies  skills and competencies when an individual leaves the organization or  when OSI plans to hire additional staff.", "Additionally, although the service units vary in the extent to which they   in the past 3  purchase IT, all of them have purchased commodity ITyears. For example, most of the service units have purchased desktops,  laptops, and workstation software. Table 7 identifies commodity IT  purchased by Library service units and NLS in the past 3 years.", "As a result, there is increased risk that the service units will make  duplicative investments in commodity IT. In the case of monitors and  workstation software, this risk has been realized. Because, as previously  discussed, the Library did not have an accurate inventory of its non- capitalized IT assets, we visited the Library\u2019s warehouse in Landover,  Maryland. At that facility, we observed that, as of December 2014, ITS  had approximately 100 24-inch monitors that were purchased in 2010.  However, instead of using the monitors purchased by ITS, Library  Services purchased 82 additional 24-inch monitors between June 2013  and July 2014. Of particular concern is that Library Services purchased all  of these monitors after the Library\u2019s IG issued a report noting this surplus  of monitors.", "According to Library Services, at the time that it purchased the monitors,  it was not aware that ITS had 24-inch monitors. It added that ITS  previously maintained a \u201cPC Store\u201d from which Library Services acquired  computers, monitors, printers, and scanners; however, this service was  discontinued about 3 years ago. Since that time, according to Library  Services, its attempts to purchase equipment have met with mixed  success, and it has often needed to acquire equipment independently.", "Finally, Library Services stated that it recently became aware of monitors  available through ITS and is working with them to obtain as many as  possible to meet its needs.", "The Library has also made duplicative investments in desktop software,  which has led the Library to purchase too many licenses. For example,  collectively, the Copyright Office, Library Services, and ITS purchased  459 licenses to Microsoft\u2019s Visio 2010 Professional, but as of November  2014 were only using 227. According to the ITS Assistant Director for  Operations, service units are responsible for tracking the usage of  licenses that they procure. He noted, however, that ITS is implementing a  new system to be used to track and analyze data on the usage of  software licenses. Additionally, according to the ITS Assistant Director for  Operations, in some cases the Library has decided to purchase more  licenses than are currently required in anticipation of additional Library  employees, existing employees who will be reassigned to roles requiring  the licenses, and new contractors who will need the licenses. However,  this does not explain why the Library is not using almost half of the  licenses it purchased for this application.", "According to the Copyright Office Chief of Operations, the Copyright  Office needs software that can allow access to the many and varied  digital formats submitted by registration customers. He added that, in  recent years, ITS has increasingly required the Copyright Office to  purchase its own licenses for applications that were previously centrally  funded and that the Copyright Office does not consistently receive  information from ITS regarding what licenses the Library has or how  many users are on each license.", "In addition to purchasing commodity IT, each of the service units and NLS  perform many of the same types of IT activities. For example, CRS, NLS,  OSO, and OSI manage and support servers. Table 8 identifies key IT  activities independently performed by the service units.", "In performing these activities, the Library has made potentially duplicative  investments in IT for four of the eight IT activities identified above.  Specifically:", "Server management and support: ITS and CRS each operate and maintain separate environments for the same server virtualizationsolution: VMware. As another example, OSEP and CRS maintain,  separate from ITS\u2019s Application Hosting Environment, their own  technical infrastructures for hosting their organizations.", "Network management: OSEP\u2019s Physical Security Network is  completely separate from the rest of the Library\u2019s network.  Consequently, OSEP acquires and maintains network devices, many  of which would not be needed if its systems were hosted on the  Library of Congress Data Network. Additionally, although more  integrated with the Library of Congress data network than OSEP\u2019s  network, CRS\u2019s Enterprise Infrastructure General Support System  also includes a number of network devices that CRS purchases and  manages largely independent of ITS.", "Directory services management: ITS, CRS, and OSEP maintain  separate environments for authenticating and authorizing users and  computers. These three organizations also maintain separate e-mail  environments. Additionally, ITS and OSEP both operate and maintain  different solutions for performing two-factor authentication.", "Internet and web management: Although OSI has a Web Services  division, which is responsible for developing strategies, plans,  standards, and policies to guide the Library\u2019s web initiatives, the  Copyright Office updated its website in July 2014 independently of  OSI\u2019s Web Services division. The Special Assistant to the Register of  Copyrights stated that this was because OSI did not understand the  office\u2019s requirements and needs. However, the Chief of the Web  Services division stated that he had met with Copyright staff and  attempted to reach agreement on updating the website  collaboratively.", "In addition, although the Copyright Office only performs two of the above- mentioned IT activities, officials have recently expressed their intent to  make additional investments in IT that could be duplicative of activities  performed by ITS. In particular, the Copyright Office has requested  funding for its own software application development environment, as well  as a \u201cdigital repository\u201d for deposits of works (e.g., films, books, music,  photographs, and software) for which copyright owners are asserting  ownership and seeking protection. However, ITS has a software  application development environment, and currently works with the  Copyright Office to maintain digital deposits.", "Another consequence of potentially duplicative IT activities is that the  Library may be spending more than it needs to on IT-related staff. As  previously mentioned, the IT activities performed outside of OSI and ITS  are performed and led by the 134 IT staff that work for other service units.  In fiscal year 2014, the Library spent about $15 million on the salaries for  these staff. Table 9 identifies the amount that each service unit spent on  salaries for IT staff in fiscal year 2014.", "As described in more detail below, officials from CRS and OSEP offered  various reasons for why they needed to manage much of their IT  independent of ITS, and the Copyright Office described reasons why the  structure used to manage its IT systems is not adequate.", "According to the Director of CRS, CRS tries to leverage ITS resources  whenever possible, and the Director described the division between  ITS and CRS as a \u201cdivision of labor.\u201d However, the Director also  stated that CRS needs to maintain independence when managing its  IT because of its unique mission in support of Congress. In particular,  the Director stated that CRS must be able to (1) provide information to  Congress quickly and (2) keep its information confidential. Regarding  the timeliness of CRS\u2019s responses to Congress, a senior advisor to  the CRS Director noted that CRS is directed by law to provide efficient  and effective service to Congress. With respect to confidentiality,  the Deputy Director of CRS told us that CRS considers its information  gathering to be covered under the \u201cSpeech or Debate Clause\u201d of the  U.S. Constitution. Accordingly, that individual stressed the  importance of keeping CRS\u2019s information confidential, and expressed  concern about storing CRS data with the rest of the Library\u2019s data. To  this end, the Director of CRS stated that it must have separate IT  because its IT group has a better understanding of what CRS and  Congress need than ITS. A senior advisor to the CRS Director added  that CRS is directed by law to have \u201cthe maximum practicable  administrative independence\u201d in performing its duties to Congress.  According to this individual, the division between ITS and CRS has  evolved over the years as a result of this administrative  independence.", "Regarding OSEP, a senior electronic security engineer explained that  it maintains its systems independent of ITS because it has always  done so. In particular, that official stated that previous iterations of its  camera and physical intrusion detection systems were not integrated  with IT and, therefore, OSEP did not need the assistance of ITS. He  noted, however, that these systems are now integrated with IT. The  OSEP Director said the office is open to a solution that involves ITS  but that ITS had expressed a lack of knowledge of security systems.  The Director added that OSEP coordinated with ITS on a statement of  work for an assessment of staffing, technology improvements, and  best practices for its IT.", "With respect to the Copyright Office, its General Counsel stated in a  memo prepared for GAO that the \u201ccurrent IT regime impedes the  Copyright Office\u2019s ability to carry out its legal responsibilities.\u201d Among  other things, the General Counsel stated that the existing Library IT  infrastructure cannot ensure the security or integrity of digital deposits.  For example, she explained that the Library has decided to host  Copyright IT systems in the same environment as other Library  systems, with the result that ITS staff\u2014not Copyright Office staff\u2014are  responsible for administering many of the security controls.  Additionally, the General Counsel stated that, despite the requirement  to be able to retain published works for 75 years and unpublished  works for the full term of the copyright, the Copyright Office\u2019s eCO  system does not have the capability to validate the integrity of these  works. Further, the Library does not have any systems that are  capable of storing digital deposits for 75 years or more.", "These concerns are understandable, given that service units were often  not satisfied with the services provided by ITS. Accordingly, service units  may believe that pursuing IT solutions and commodity IT independent of  ITS is their only viable alternative. Nevertheless, allowing service units to  do so likely increases costs and inefficiencies.", "Our research on reducing duplicative IT investments in the executive  branch has found that through the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s  PortfolioStat initiative\u2014a process where agencies gather information on  their IT investments and develop plans for consolidation and increased  use of shared-service delivery models\u2014agencies can avoid duplicative,  wasteful, and low-value investments. Congress also recently recognized  the value of these reviews when it required executive branch agencies to  complete them annually. However, the Library has not performed such  a review.

For example, as previously mentioned, the  former Deputy Librarian (1) drafted an IT strategic plan, (2) chaired the  Web Governance Board, and (3) led the Library\u2019s efforts to consolidate  mobile phone contracts and geospatial information systems.", "However, in December 2014, the Librarian reassigned the individual  serving as Deputy Librarian to be a senior advisor to the Librarian.", "Subsequently, in January 2015, the Librarian appointed the Law Librarian  to be the new Deputy Librarian.", "After we shared the preliminary results of our review with the Library in  January 2015, the Librarian announced plans to hire a permanent CIO  and deputy CIO; according to the Chief of Staff, the Library plans to do so  by September 2015. While this search is conducted, the interim CIO will  be responsible for drafting the Library\u2019s IT strategic plan, chairing the  Web Governance Board, and leading the Library\u2019s efforts to consolidate  mobile phone contracts and geospatial information systems. Although  appointing a permanent CIO could potentially address the Library\u2019s gap in  IT leadership, the details of this position have yet to be fully defined. If the  Library hires a permanent CIO with responsibility for IT, sufficient  authority, and clearly defined responsibilities, it will be better positioned to  effectively acquire, operate, and maintain its IT in support of its mission."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As information is increasingly created, shared, and preserved digitally,  effectively managing its IT resources will be even more critical for the  Library to carry out its mission of preserving and making available the  knowledge and creative output of the American people. To its credit,  although not required to do so, the Library has embraced standards and  practices set forth in laws that require executive branch agencies to  develop processes for investment management, information security, and  privacy. However, widespread weaknesses in implementing these  processes and several other IT management disciplines call into question  whether the Library is well positioned to meet the challenges of making  the most efficient and productive use of its technology resources. Just as  important, the Library\u2019s lack of strong, consistent leadership in these  areas has hampered its ability to make needed improvements in the face  of long-standing challenges.", "Specifically, without an up-to-date IT strategic plan that is linked to the  overall agency strategic plan and includes goals, performance measures,  strategies, and interdependencies among projects, the Library will lack a  clear definition of what it wants to accomplish with IT and strategies for  achieving those results. This challenge is compounded by the lack of a  complete and reliable enterprise architecture that accurately captures the  Library\u2019s current IT environment, describes its target environment, and  outlines a strategy for transitioning from one to the other. Additionally, the  Library will be hindered in carrying out an IT strategy without an  organization-wide assessment of its human capital needs, and plans for  addressing any gaps.", "Further impeding the Library\u2019s ability to make strategic decisions is an  incompletely implemented process for managing the selection and  oversight of its IT investments. Specifically, the lack of clearly defined  roles and responsibilities and other gaps in policies have resulted in an  inconsistent approach to reviewing and selecting investments for the  Library\u2019s portfolio. As a result, there is less assurance that proposed  investments are receiving adequate scrutiny and that the Library is  expending its resources on the appropriate mix of systems that will  effectively and efficiently meet its needs. Moreover, by not applying  adequate oversight to investments that have already been selected, the  Library is not in a position to ensure that they are meeting cost, schedule,  and performance goals and delivering the capabilities the agency needs  to carry out its mission. More basically, because the Library does not  have accurate data on what it spends on IT each year or an accurate  inventory of IT assets, it is limited in its ability to make informed  investment decisions or ensure that it does not waste money on IT.", "Concerns about the Library\u2019s ability to acquire IT systems that meet its  needs are further raised by the absence of organization-wide policies to  ensure that its systems acquisition process follows disciplined practices in  the areas of risk management, requirements development, cost  estimating, and schedule development. The lack of such policies has led  to the incomplete implementation of these practices among the  investments we reviewed. Without following such key practices, the  Library will be challenged in ensuring that systems are delivered on time  and within budget and that they deliver the capabilities needed by its  users.", "Another significant area of concern is the Library\u2019s inconsistent  implementation of agency-wide information security and privacy  programs. While, to its credit, the Library has established roles and  responsibilities and policies and procedures for information security and  privacy, significant weaknesses in implementing key security  management controls call into serious question whether the information  and systems at the Library are being adequately protected. These  weaknesses, in areas such as documenting security controls, conducting  security testing, developing remedial action plans, establishing  contingency plans, carrying out security training, ensuring that contracts  address security requirements, and assessing risks to privacy, could  provide opportunities for either intentional or inadvertent compromise of  the Library\u2019s systems, resulting in unauthorized access, modification, or  loss of sensitive information, or disruption to the Library\u2019s operations.  These issues are further highlighted by a number of weaknesses we  found in technical security controls that are intended to limit unauthorized  access to the Library\u2019s systems and ensure their integrity.", "While ITS\u2014as the central IT organization within the Library\u2014is  responsible for providing IT-related services to the Library\u2019s other units,  the lack of satisfaction with these services has contributed to the other  units pursuing their own IT activities, potentially resulting in duplicative  investments and wasted resources. Although the reasons units provided  for managing much of their IT independently are understandable given  inconsistent satisfaction with the services provided by ITS, allowing  service units to do so likely increases costs and inefficiencies. Without a  plan for improving the units\u2019 satisfaction with ITS services and an  organization-wide evaluation of the costs and benefits of the Library\u2019s  fragmented approach to carrying out IT activities, the agency may be  missing opportunities to eliminate duplication, improve the efficiency of its  delivery of IT services, and save taxpayer dollars.", "Key to all these shortcomings, the Library has lacked consistent, effective  leadership for its IT efforts. Because the Library\u2019s CIO position lacks  adequate authority and oversight, the agency has diminished assurance  that investments in IT are being coordinated organization-wide and that  they provide an appropriate mix of capabilities that support the Library\u2019s  mission while avoiding unnecessary duplication.", "The Library\u2019s intention to appoint a permanent CIO is a positive  development, but it will be important to clearly define this position and  ensure that this official has sufficient authority to address the many  challenges facing the Library\u2019s IT management. If it follows through on  plans to appoint such an official and invests the position with the  appropriate authority, the Library will be in a stronger position to address  the IT management challenges we have identified and make a more  effective and efficient use of technology to support its mission."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To provide stable, consistent, and effective leadership for addressing the  weaknesses identified in this report, as well as for improving the  organization\u2019s management of IT, we recommend that the Librarian  expeditiously hire a permanent chief information officer responsible for  managing the Library\u2019s IT and ensure that this official has clearly defined  responsibilities and adequate authority, consistent with the role of a chief  information officer as defined by best practices.

Our specific objectives for this review were to assess the extent to which  the Library of Congress (1) addressed in its strategic planning the IT and  related resources required to meet its goals and objectives; (2)  established an IT governance structure to manage the selection, control,  and evaluation of IT investments; (3) used IT acquisition and  development best practices; (4) established programs for ensuring the  information security and privacy protection of its information and  information systems; (5) used best practices for managing IT services;  and (6) has a chief information officer (CIO) with authority to exercise  control and oversight of IT management functions.", "To address our first objective, we reviewed the agency\u2019s overall strategic  plan, and evaluated its draft IT-specific strategic plan against key  practices for IT strategic planning that we have previously identified.Those best practices include developing an IT strategic plan that aligns with the agency\u2019s overall strategic plan, provides results-oriented goals and performance measures that describes interdependencies within and across projects so that these  permit it to determine whether it is succeeding,  identifies the strategies it will use to achieve desired results, and  can be understood and managed.", "Additionally, because an enterprise architecture can help an organization  determine how it can most effectively execute its IT strategic plan, we  evaluated the agency\u2019s enterprise architecture documentation against key  practices identified in our enterprise architecture framework to determine  the extent to which the Library had established a well-defined enterprise  architecture, as well as demonstrated institutional commitment to its  architecture. Those practices include developing an architecture that thoroughly describes the current and  target states of an organization\u2019s IT systems and business operations  and identifies the gaps and specific intermediary steps that the  organization plans to take to achieve its target state; developing an organizational policy for enterprise architecture; and establishing an executive committee representing the enterprise that  is responsible and accountable for enterprise architecture.", "Further, because of the importance of sustaining an IT workforce with the  necessary skills to execute an agency\u2019s strategic plan, we obtained and  reviewed the Library\u2019s human capital plan. We compared this plan to  best practices we have identified in human capital management. Those  practices include analyzing the gaps between current skills and future needs and developing strategies for filling the gaps.", "We also interviewed the enterprise architect, architecture review board  chair, Director of the Information Technology Services (ITS) directorate,  former acting Chief Information Officer (CIO), former Deputy Librarian,  and Librarian of Congress to obtain information about the Library\u2019s IT  strategic planning activities.", "In addressing our second objective, we compared agency documentation  against critical processes associated with Stages 2 and 3 of GAO\u2019s  information technology investment management framework.the framework includes the following key processes:  instituting the investment board, providing investment oversight, and capturing investment information.  selecting investments that meet business needs,Stage 3 includes the following critical processes: defining the portfolio criteria, creating the portfolio, evaluating the portfolio, and conducting post-implementation reviews.", "Specifically, we reviewed written policies, procedures, guidance, and  other documentation that provided evidence of establishing commitment  to critical processes, such as Library of Congress Regulation 1600:  Information Resource Management Policy and Responsibilities; the  Library of Congress Information Resource Management Plan; the IT  Steering Committee charter; and guidance and templates for the selection  process, development stage oversight, and the post-implementation  review process. We also reviewed IT Steering Committee meeting  minutes to determine whether the committee was successfully  implementing its documented policies and procedures, as well as for  evidence of its decision-making processes. In addition, we reviewed data  from the system used by Integrated Support Services to track and  manage the Library\u2019s assets, including those relating to IT.", "Additionally, we selected three investments as case studies to determine  the extent to which key activities associated with the critical processes  were being carried out. To choose these investments, we identified the 16  investments that the IT Steering Committee was overseeing or  considering for review as of July 2014. To narrow this list, we excluded  investments that (1) were in the planning stages, (2) had been completed,  or (3) would be fully deployed prior to the completion of our review. We  then selected the one investment that was managed by more than one  service unit: Library Services and the Office of Strategic Initiatives\u2019 (OSI)  Twitter Research Access investment. We then selected two investments  sponsored by service units other than Library Services and OSI to ensure  coverage of other service units. These additional two investments were  the Office of Support Operations\u2019 (OSO) Facility Asset Management  Enterprise (FAME) investment and the Office of the Librarian\u2019s  Momentum Upgrade and Migration investment.", "For these three investments, we reviewed evidence of the implementation  of project-level IT investment management processes, including  investment concept proposals, investment charters, development stage  quarterly reports, budget plans, and an IT Steering Committee scoring  worksheet that evaluated risk factors along with the significance of  potential benefits.

With respect to IT equipment  and services captured in the Library\u2019s accounting system, we identified  budget object class codes (i.e., codes used by the Library to classify  spending) associated with IT. To do so, we performed the following three  steps:", "First, we asked the Office of the Chief Financial Officer to identify  budget object classification codes that, based on the executive  branch definition of IT, were associated with IT. The Library  identified 16 codes associated with IT.", "Second, we identified budget object classification codes that are  consistent with the Technical Reference Model in OMB\u2019s Federal  Enterprise Architecture Reference Model.26 codes.", "Third, we shared the additional 26 budget object classification codes  with the Library Office of the Chief Financial Officer, the National  Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS), and  ITS to review, comment, and provide additional information. Based on  their comments, we removed 16 codes from our review and added 1  code.", "As a result, we identified 27 budget object classification codes that were  associated with IT, 4 of which were associated with both IT and non-IT  spending. We then asked the Library to provide us with detailed  information for all obligations it made in fiscal year 2014 that were  associated with these codes. For the 4 codes that were used to classify  both IT and non-IT spending, we identified the obligations classified under  these codes that were greater than $2,500. For these selected  obligations, we asked the service units to identify, based on the executive  branch definition of IT, obligations associated with IT. We then added  these obligations to those associated with the other 23 codes to complete  our estimate of the Library\u2019s IT equipment and services.", "Regarding the data in the Library\u2019s human resource system, we obtained  from the Library\u2019s Human Resources division (1) the number of Library  staff employed under IT-related job series during fiscal year 2014 and (2)  the salary information, in aggregate form, for those employees during that  fiscal year. We then added this information to our estimate of the Library\u2019s  IT equipment and services. We used this combined figure as our estimate  of the Library\u2019s IT spending for fiscal year 2014. We then shared our  estimate with each service unit to review, comment, and provide  additional information.", "To determine the reliability of the IT spending data, we reviewed Office of  the Chief Financial Officer documentation and previous Office of the  Inspector General Reports on the Library\u2019s financial statements, and  interviewed Office of the Chief Financial Officer officials familiar with the  financial system to understand the controls used on to create and classify  obligations. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our  purpose, which was to provide an estimate of the Library\u2019s IT spending;  however, the estimate does not reflect all of the Library\u2019s IT spending. For  example, the Library has not defined IT and has not fully established  guidance on how to classify IT expenses in its financial accounting  system, Momentum. Although Library guidance identifies 5 budget object  classification codes as being associated with IT, as noted, we identified  additional codes that are used for IT transactions. Additionally, the Library  did not ensure that all IT-related transactions were properly associated  with IT-related codes. For example, OSI associated about $2.5 million of  its IT budget with a code that, according to Library guidance, excludes IT  spending.", "Further, as discussed previously, our estimate does not reflect obligations  of $2,500 or less that are associated with 4 budget object classification  codes for which the Library made both IT and non-IT obligations. In  addition, our estimate does not include salary information for all staff that  perform key IT activities. In response to our request for the salary  information for all staff whose primary job responsibility is IT, the  Assistant Director of Human Resources Services provided information on  employees whose job title related to the information technology  management series (2210). However, a Copyright budget analyst and the  Library\u2019s Chief Financial Officer stated that the Library has employees  that perform key IT activities, but whose job titles fall outside of the  information technology management series.", "To determine the reliability of the cost estimates for the investments  reviewed by the Library\u2019s IT Steering Committee, we (1) performed  testing for obvious errors in accuracy and completeness, and (2)  interviewed officials knowledgeable about the template used to produce  the estimates. Additionally, as discussed in more detail below, we also  assessed the extent to which the estimates were created using leading  practices consistent with a comprehensive estimate, as identified in  GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide. However, none of the  investments\u2019 estimates fully met the comprehensive characteristic.  Despite this limitation, we believe that the cost data are sufficiently  reliable for our purpose\u2014that is, as an indicator of the general range of  the portion of the Library\u2019s IT spending that is reviewed by the ITSC.", "To address the third objective, we compared Library policies and  procedures in key IT acquisition management areas\u2014risk management,  requirements development, cost estimating, and scheduling\u2014to leading  practices identified by industry and GAO. We also determined the extent  to which the three selected investments identified above were  implementing these key IT acquisition practices. Specifically, with respect  to risk management and requirements development, we reviewed policies  and procedures developed by ITS, as well as acquisition documentation  from the three selected investments, and compared them to risk  management and requirements development best practices identified by  the Software Engineering Institute\u2019s (SEI) Capability Maturity Model\u00ae  Integration for Acquisition (CMMI-ACQ).", "The key risk management practices were developing a risk management strategy; identifying and documenting risks; evaluating, categorizing, and prioritizing risks; developing risk mitigation plans; and monitoring the status of each risk periodically, and implementing the  risk mitigation plans as appropriate.", "The key requirements development practices were eliciting stakeholder needs, developing customer requirements, and prioritizing customer requirements.", "We analyzed investment risk documentation, including risks identified in  investment charters, acquisition plans, and risk registers; risk mitigation  plans; and quarterly performance reports submitted to the IT Steering  Committee.

An  estimate created using the leading practices exhibits four broad  characteristics: it is accurate, well documented, credible, and  comprehensive. Each of these characteristics is associated with a specific  set of leading practices, which in turn are made up of a number of specific  tasks. We assessed ITS\u2019s guidance against each of the four  characteristics. Each characteristic was assessed as either being fully  met\u2014the Library provided complete evidence that satisfies the associated  tasks of the leading practices; substantially met\u2014the Library provided  evidence that satisfies a large portion of the associated tasks of the  leading practices; partially met\u2014the Library provided evidence that  satisfies about half of the associated tasks of the leading practices;  minimally met\u2014the Library provided evidence that satisfies a small  portion of the associated tasks of the leading practices; or not met\u2014the  Library did not provide evidence that satisfies any of the associated tasks  of the leading practices.", "In assessing the reliability of the estimates developed by the three  selected investments, we only assessed practices associated with the  comprehensive characteristic. We did so because none of the  investments\u2019 estimates fully met the comprehensive characteristic, and  this characteristic must be completed in order for the estimate to fully  address the other three characteristics. We assessed these estimates  using the same scoring methodology (i.e., fully met, substantially met,  partially met, minimally met, and not met) as described above for the  review of ITS\u2019s cost estimating policies and procedures. We shared our  analysis with Library officials to review, comment, and provide additional  information.", "Finally, regarding our assessment of the Library\u2019s scheduling, we  reviewed policies and procedures developed by ITS, as well as  scheduling documentation from the selected investments, and compared  them to leading practices set forth in the exposure draft of GAO\u2019s   This guide defines 10 leading practices  Schedule Assessment Guide.that are vital to having integrated and reliable master schedules. Similar  to a well-developed cost estimate, a schedule created using the leading  practices exhibits four broad characteristics: it is comprehensive, well- constructed, credible, and controlled. Each characteristic is associated  with a specific set of leading practices, which, in turn, are made up of a  number of specific tasks. We assessed ITS\u2019s guidance against each of  the four characteristics.", "In assessing the reliability of the schedules developed by the selected  investments, we only assessed practices associated with the well-  constructed characteristic. We did so because none of the schedules  substantially addressed the practices associated with this characteristic,  and because this characteristic relates to the foundational practices for a  high-quality, reliable schedule. We assessed ITS\u2019s policies and  procedures, as well as the investment schedules using the same  methodology (i.e., fully met, substantially met, partially met, minimally  met, and not met) as previously described for our assessment of ITS\u2019s  cost estimating policies and procedures. We shared our analysis with  Library officials to review, comment, and provide additional information,  and we adjusted our analysis where appropriate.", "To address our fourth objective, we reviewed relevant information security  and privacy laws and guidance, including National Institute of Standards  and Technology (NIST) standards and guidance, to identify federal  security and privacy control guidelines. We then reviewed the Library\u2019s  security and privacy policies and procedures to determine their  consistency with these guidelines.", "Additionally, we selected nine Library systems as case studies to  determine the extent to which NIST guidelines and Library policy were  being implemented. We chose these systems by following these six  steps:", "First, using lists of systems developed by the Chief Information  Security Officer (CISO), the Copyright Office, and Library Services as  the basis for our selected systems, we separated the systems into  eight groups\u2014each of the seven service units, as well as NLS.

For Library Services, we randomly  selected SYMIN II from the two systems.", "Finally, because NLS did not have any general support systems or tier  1 systems, we identified NLS systems with a moderate FIPS 199  impact level and randomly selected the NLS Production Information  Control System/NLS Integrated Operations Support System  (PICS/NIOSS).", "In summary, this selection process resulted in the following nine systems:", "CRS Enterprise Infrastructure General Support System,", "OSEP Physical Security Network, eCO,", "OFCO Momentum,", "SYMIN II, and", "PICS/NIOSS.", "ITS Application Hosting Environment,  ITS Library of Congress Data Network,  ITS Library of Congress Office Automation System,  Using NIST guidelines for an effective agency-wide information security  program, we evaluated the Library\u2019s information security program in the  following areas:  Incident handling: We compared the Library\u2019s incident handling  procedures to NIST guidance on the key steps that agencies should  take when responding to incidents. To determine the effectiveness  of the Library\u2019s response to incidents, we selected 22 incidents to  review as case studies. To choose the incidents, we obtained a list of  all incidents reported between October 1, 2013, and September 2,  2014. In order to narrow the list of incidents, we removed (1) incidents  for which the Library determined that the incident did not require  investigation or was a false positive and (2) incidents with a status of  open or canceled. We then separated the remaining incidents into  eight groups\u2014each of the categories that the Library uses to classify  incidents. With the exception of one category\u2014recon activity\u2014we  randomly selected 3 incidents from each category. For the recon  category, we selected its 1 incident for our review. For these selected  incidents, we reviewed documents from the Library\u2019s incident tracking  system to determine the extent to which the Library had performed  analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, reporting, and post- incident procedures in accordance with NIST guidance. To verify the  reliability of the data in the agency\u2019s incident handling system, we  examined it for obvious outliers, omissions, and errors. We  determined that these data were sufficient for our purposes, which  was to select incidents to use as case studies and determine the  extent to which the Library handled those incidents consistent with  NIST guidance.", "Inventory of systems: We assessed the Library\u2019s policy for its  system inventory against relevant NIST guidelines.comprehensiveness and accuracy of the Library\u2019s system inventory,  we compared the inventory provided to us by the Library\u2019s CISO with  a separate list provided by Library Services. We also asked the CISO  and officials from each service unit to verify the accuracy and  completeness of these lists. Although we determined the inventory  was not complete and accurate, we believe that the system lists  collectively, with lists of tier 0, tier 1, and general support systems, are  sufficiently reliable for our purpose\u2014that is, to select systems as case  studies for our review.", "System security plans: We compared Library policy on system  security plans with relevant NIST guidance.assessed system security plans for the nine selected systems against  the NIST guidelines.", "Security test and evaluation: We assessed Library policy on  security testing against relevant NIST guidelines.compared testing documentation for the nine selected systems  against the NIST guidance and Library policy.", "Remedial action plans: We compared Library policy on plans of  action and milestones (POA&M) with relevant NIST guidance.Additionally, we reviewed POA&Ms for the nine selected systems and,  for eight of the systems, identified the number of POA&M items that  were delayed, as of December 2014. Regarding the OSEP Physical  Security Network, OSEP had not reported any updates to its POA&M  items since September 2013; we identified the number of items that  were open as of that date, when the items were originally reported. To  verify the reliability of the agency\u2019s POA&M data, we examined them  for obvious outliers and errors. Excluding the data for the OSEP  Physical Security Network, which had not been updated since  September 2013, we determined that the POA&M data were sufficient  for our purpose, which was to identify the number of items with a  status of \u201cdelayed.\u201d", "Authorization to operate: We assessed Library policy on   We also  authorization to operate against relevant NIST guidelines.assessed the extent to which the Library completed authorizations to  operate for the nine selected systems.

In addition, we determined  the extent to which the Library developed contingency plans for the  nine selected systems, as called for by NIST guidance and Library  policy.", "Security and privacy awareness training: We assessed Library  policy on security and privacy training against relevant NIST  guidance. Additionally, we obtained the lists of users identified in  three systems: ITS Library of Congress Office Automation System,  CRS Enterprise Infrastructure General Support System, and OSEP  Physical Security Network. We did so because these were the three  systems in our sample for which the Library maintains instances of the  Library\u2019s primary service for authenticating and authorizing users. We  then compared these lists with the list of users the Library reported as  having completed the security and privacy awareness training in fiscal  year 2014. We shared our analysis with Library officials to review,  comment, and provide additional information.", "Contract requirements for information security: We compared  Library policy on contract requirements for information security with  relevant NIST guidance.which the contracts supporting the nine selected systems included the  contract requirements called for by Library policy and NIST guidance.", "In addition, we determined the extent to  To evaluate the Library\u2019s controls over its information systems, we used  our Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual, which contains  guidance for reviewing information system controls that affect the  confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computerized information. We  also used NIST standards and guidelinesprocedures, practices, and standards. Specifically, we reviewed controls  in the following areas:", "Authorization: For all users with elevated privileges to the selected  nine systems, we reviewed the extent to which those users had been  authorized to use the system with those elevated permissions,  consistent with NIST guidance.", "Identification and authentication: With respect to the selected  systems, we assessed controls used to authenticate and authorize  users against NIST guidance.", "Cryptography: We observed configurations for providing secure data  transmissions across the network to determine whether sensitive data  were being encrypted consistent with NIST guidance.", "Background investigations: We identified all users with elevated  privileges to the selected nine systems and then asked the Library\u2019s  personnel security officer whether the Library had performed a  background investigation for each, consistent with NIST guidanceand Library policy.", "Physical security and environmental safety: We identified four  Library facilities in the United States that include an IT data center: (1)  the James Madison Building on Capitol Hill; (2) the NLS facility in  northwest Washington, D.C.; (3) the Packard Campus of the National  Audio-Visual Conservation Center in Culpepper, Virginia; and (4) the  Library\u2019s alternate computing facility in Manassas, Virginia. We visited  each of these facilities and assessed the physical security and  environmental controls supporting their data centers against relevant  NIST guidance. Additionally, because the Library did not have an  accurate inventory of its non-capitalized IT assets, we also visited the  Library\u2019s warehouse in Landover, Maryland, and assessed the  physical security and environmental controls supporting this facility.", "To address our fifth objective, we evaluated ITS\u2019s service management  documentation against leading industry practices for managing IT services identified in the Information Technology Infrastructure Library. We evaluated the service management practices of ITS, which functions  as the Library\u2019s central IT organization and is the primary provider to each  service unit throughout the Library. The service management practices  were developing a service catalog; defining how service-level agreements (SLA) should be structured so  that IT services and customers are covered in a manner best suited to  the organization\u2019s needs; and establishing SLAs consistent with that structure that describe the IT  services, specify roles and responsibilities of both parties, and  document service level targets.", "Specifically, we reviewed ITS\u2019s service catalog and SLAs between ITS  and its customers.

Because the Library did not have  comprehensive metrics for the satisfaction with ITS\u2019s services, we  conducted a web-based survey of ITS customers. We designed a draft  questionnaire in close collaboration with our survey specialist. We also  conducted pretests with four officials: one official representing the largest  service unit (Library Services), one official representing the smallest  service unit (Law Library), the Director of ITS, and the former acting CIO.  From these pretests, we made revisions as necessary to reduce the  likelihood of overall and item non-response as well as reporting errors on  our questions.", "We sent the survey via e-mail to the head of each service unit, as well as  the head of NLS, on October 15, 2014. Log-in information was e-mailed  to all contacts. We e-mailed those who had not completed the  questionnaire at multiple points during the data collection period, and we  closed the survey on November 3, 2014. We received a completed  questionnaire from each service unit and NLS.", "Because we surveyed all of the unit heads and therefore did not conduct  any sampling for our survey, our data are not subject to sampling errors.  However, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce  non-sampling errors. For example, differences in how a particular  question is interpreted, the sources of information available to  respondents, or the types of people who do not respond to a question can  introduce errors into the survey results. We included steps in both the  data collection and data analysis stages to minimize such non-sampling  errors. Our analysts answered respondent questions and resolved  difficulties that respondents had in completing our survey. Although the  survey responses cannot be used to generalize the opinions and  satisfaction of all customers that receive services from ITS, the responses  provide data for our defined population.", "The final questionnaire asked the heads of the service units and NLS to  identify the extent to which they are satisfied or dissatisfied with the  services provided by ITS.providing satisfactory IT services to its customers, we described the  results on a 5-point satisfaction scale, where 5 is \u201cvery satisfied\u201d and 1 is  \u201cvery dissatisfied.\u201d", "To determine the extent to which ITS is  To obtain additional narrative and supporting context from stakeholders,  survey respondents were given multiple opportunities to provide  additional open-ended comments throughout our survey. Using these  open-ended responses, we conducted a content analysis in order to  identify common factors.

We also reviewed network diagrams and system  security plans for the nine systems we selected as part of our fourth  objective.", "In addition, we reviewed portions of the Library\u2019s hardware and software  inventories to determine if it had made duplicative IT investments in  selected areas:", "Monitors: Because the Library did not have an accurate inventory of  its non-capitalized IT assets, we visited the Library\u2019s warehouse in  Landover, Maryland, and reviewed the facility\u2019s physical and  environmental controls. At that facility, we observed that ITS had  approximately 400 19-inch monitors purchased in 2008 and about 100  24-inch monitors that were purchased in 2010. Although these  monitors were several years old, according to ITS officials, they had  never been used and were still in their original packaging. In order to  determine whether service units purchased duplicative monitors, we  asked each service unit, but not including OSI, to provide an inventory  of its monitors. We received inventories from NLS, the Law Library,  and Library Services. We then identified 19-inch and 24-inch  monitors in these inventories (1) that were of a different model  number than those purchased by ITS and (2) for which their  respective manuals were copyrighted later than 2008 for the 19-inch  monitors and later than 2010 for the 24-inch monitors.", "Software licenses: We identified software applications that were  purchased by more than one service unit and determined the extent to  which the Library purchased too many or too few licenses. To select  the applications, we used the software inventories developed by ITS  and CRS with automated tools for deploying software to workstations  that they manage. First, for the ITS inventory, we identified  applications that were deployed to two or more service units. Second,  in order to ensure that we only selected software purchased by the  Library, we removed any applications that were published by the  Library itself. Third, using an open source search, we removed  applications that can be legally obtained for free. Fourth, we removed  applications that were being used for entities outside of the Library.  Fifth, we eliminated purchases made by the Library\u2019s Inspector  General. Based on these steps, we identified 24 applications. We then  compared these 24 applications to CRS\u2019s application inventory to  determine whether CRS purchased any of these applications. For  these 24 applications, we obtained the relevant license agreements,  and compared the number of licenses purchased to the number of  licenses deployed throughout the Library. We chose to report on  applications where the Library purchased at least 100 more licenses  than it had deployed. To verify the reliability of the data on the number  of deployed licenses, we examined it for obvious outliers, omissions,  and errors, and interviewed officials familiar with the data to gain an  understanding of the controls used to create and maintain the data.  We determined that these data were sufficient for our purposes, which  was to describe the number of Microsoft Visio 2010 Professional  licenses the Library deployed.", "We discussed the duplicative IT activities and investments with officials  responsible for managing IT in CRS, the Copyright Office, Library  Services, and OSEP.", "To address our sixth objective, we evaluated the Library\u2019s IT policies and  the position description of the Library\u2019s CIO against key practices we  identified based on our research on and experience with federal  agencies. These practices related to the following areas:", "Commodity IT: The CIO should have the responsibility and authority,  including budgetary and spending control, for commodity IT.", "Mission-specific systems: The CIO should have the ability to  adequately oversee mission-specific systems to ensure that funds  being spent on component agency investments will fulfill mission  needs.", "Relationships between CIO and components: The responsibilities  and authorities governing the relationship between the CIO and  component organizations should be defined.", "We also compared the tenure of the Library\u2019s recent CIOs to results from  our research which found that CIOs and former agency IT executives  believed it was necessary for a CIO to stay in office for 3 to 5 years to be  effective and 5 to 7 years to fully implement major change initiatives in  large public-sector organizations. Further, we interviewed the Chief of  Staff, former Deputy Librarian, and Librarian of Congress to obtain  information about the Library\u2019s plans for hiring a full-time CIO.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2014 to March 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
