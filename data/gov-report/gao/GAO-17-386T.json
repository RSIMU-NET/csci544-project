Of these 11 recommendations, 3 have been implemented based on agency action."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO's prior work has identified four Medicaid program integrity issues\u2014where the program is vulnerable to improper payments such as those made for services that were not covered, were not medically necessary, or were not provided\u2014as well as actions taken by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to address the issues and additional actions that should be taken.", "Enrollment Verification: In response to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), CMS established a more rigorous approach for verifying financial and nonfinancial information needed to determine Medicaid beneficiary eligibility. Despite CMS's efforts, however, there continue to be gaps in efforts to ensure that only eligible individuals are enrolled into Medicaid, and that Medicaid expenditures for enrollees\u2014particularly those eligible as a result of the PPACA expansion\u2014are matched appropriately by the federal government.", "Oversight of Medicaid Managed Care: CMS has provided states with additional guidance on their oversight of Medicaid managed care. Oversight of managed care is increasing in importance and improvements in measuring the improper payment rate are needed. For example, the estimated improper payment rate for managed care is based on a review of payments made to managed care organizations, and does not review any underlying medical documentation. GAO and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General have identified incomplete and untimely managed care encounter data\u2014data that managed care organizations are expected to report to state Medicaid programs, allowing states to track the services received by beneficiaries enrolled in managed care.", "Provider Eligibility: PPACA included multiple provisions aimed at strengthening the screening of providers who enroll to participate in Medicaid. While the act requires that all providers and suppliers be subject to licensure checks, it gave CMS discretion to establish a risk-based application of other screening procedures, such as fingerprint-based criminal-background checks for high-risk providers. Also, CMS regulations now require that all Medicaid managed care providers enroll with the state Medicaid agency, which has the potential to improve oversight of providers in managed care. However, GAO's work based on 2 states and 16 health plans identified challenges screening providers for eligibility, partially due to fragmented information.", "Coordination between Medicaid and the Exchange: CMS implemented a number of policies and procedures to ensure that individuals do not have duplicate coverage (enrolled in both Medicaid and in subsidized coverage through an exchange, which is a marketplace where eligible individuals may compare and purchase private health insurance). CMS has conducted checks to identify individuals with duplicate coverage, and plans to complete these checks at least two times per coverage year, which has the potential to save federal\u2014as well as beneficiary\u2014dollars. However, CMS has not developed a plan for assessing whether the checks and other procedures\u2014such as thresholds for the level of duplicate coverage deemed acceptable\u2014are sufficient to prevent and detect duplicate coverage."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss program integrity efforts  intended to prevent improper payments in the Medicaid program.  Medicaid is a federal-state health financing program projected to cover  about 72 million people in fiscal year 2016 and a significant component of  federal and state budgets. In fiscal year 2016, Medicaid expenditures  were estimated to total about $576 billion, with the federal government  spending about $363 billion and combined state spending of about $213  billion. As a result of flexibility in the program\u2019s design, Medicaid consists  of 56 distinct state-based programs.", "The program\u2019s size and diversity make it particularly vulnerable to  improper payments, including payments made for treatments or services  that were not covered by the program, that were not medically necessary,  or that were never provided. In fiscal year 2016, improper payments  totaled an estimated 10.5 percent ($36 billion) of federal Medicaid  expenditures, an increase from an estimated 9.8 percent ($29 billion) in  fiscal year 2015. While the percentage of improper payments is  increasing, the concerns are not new; we added Medicaid to our list of  high-risk programs in January 2003, because of the program\u2019s risk of  improper payments, as well as insufficient federal and state oversight.", "States are the first line of defense against Medicaid improper payments.  Specifically, they must comply with federal requirements to ensure the  qualifications of the providers who bill the program, detect improper  payments, recover overpayments, and refer suspected cases of fraud and  abuse to law enforcement authorities. At the federal level, the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the Department  of Health and Human Services (HHS), is responsible for supporting and  overseeing state Medicaid program integrity activities. The Deficit  Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) expanded CMS\u2019s oversight role by, for  example, establishing the Medicaid Integrity Program and including other  provisions designed to increase CMS\u2019s support for state activities to  address Medicaid fraud, waste, and abuse. The DRA provided  appropriations to implement the Medicaid Integrity Program, and the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), enacted in March  2010, gave CMS and states additional provider and program integrity  oversight tools. In particular, PPACA and its implementing regulations  require state Medicaid agencies to terminate the participation of any  provider that has been terminated on or after January 1, 2011, under  Medicare, any other state Medicaid program, or Children\u2019s Health  Insurance Program.", "Beginning in 2014, PPACA also provided millions of low-income  Americans new options for obtaining health insurance coverage\u2014through  the Medicaid program or through an exchange, which is a marketplace  where eligible individuals may compare and purchase private health  insurance. Because many low-income individuals experience income  volatility, they are likely to transition between Medicaid and subsidized  exchange coverage. PPACA required the creation of a coordinated  eligibility and enrollment process for Medicaid and the exchanges to  streamline the eligibility determination process, and to ensure that  individuals are enrolled in the coverage for which they are eligible, and  transferred to the appropriate form of coverage if their eligibility changes.", "Streamlining eligibility determinations necessitated the adoption of new  policies and information technology systems by the states, and can  require significant coordination between states and the federal  government. CMS oversight is crucial to ensure that determinations of  Medicaid eligibility are appropriate, and that the risk of coverage gaps and  duplicate coverage\u2014generally not permitted under federal law\u2014is  minimized.", "You asked GAO to testify today on program integrity issues in Medicaid,  including issues associated with the Medicaid expansion. My remarks  focus on four key Medicaid program integrity issues we have identified, as  well as the progress CMS has made addressing them, and the related  challenges the agency and states continue to face.", "My remarks today are based on our large body of work on the Medicaid  program, including our 2015 report on key issues facing the Medicaid  program, as well as agency responses to recommendations that we have  made. See appendix I for a list of related GAO products and appendix II  for selected recommendations. Those reports provide further details on  our scope and methodology. We conducted all of the work on which this  statement is based in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Under the Medicaid program\u2019s federal-state partnership, CMS is  responsible for overseeing the program, while state Medicaid agencies  are responsible for the day-to-day administration of the program.  Although subject to federal requirements, each state develops its own  Medicaid administrative structure for carrying out the program, including  its approach to program integrity. To monitor program integrity in  Medicaid, CMS estimates the national improper payment rate on an  annual basis through the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM)  program. The PERM involves reviews of sampled fee for service claims,  payments to managed care entities, and beneficiary eligibility  determinations in the states; the national improper payment rate is a  weighted average of states\u2019 rates in each of these components.", "State Medicaid programs do not work in isolation on program integrity;  instead, there are a large number of federal agencies, other state entities,  and contractors with which states must coordinate. (See fig. 1.)  Recognizing the importance of federal state collaboration on program  integrity issues, in November 2016, along with the Office of Management  and Budget, we convened a meeting with state auditors, CMS, and other  federal officials to discuss ways to strengthen collaboration between the  federal government and the states.", "In recent years, Medicaid expenditures and enrollment grew under  PPACA. Growth in enrollment is primarily due to more than half of the  states choosing to expand their Medicaid programs by covering certain  low-income adults not historically eligible for Medicaid coverage, as  authorized under PPACA. In addition to expanding Medicaid eligibility,  PPACA required the establishment of health insurance exchanges in all  states, and provided for federal subsidies to assist qualifying low-income  individuals in paying for exchange coverage. States may elect to  establish and operate an exchange, known as a state-based exchange,  or allow CMS\u2014which is responsible for overseeing the exchanges\u2014to do  so within the state, known as a federally facilitated exchange (FFE). As  of March 2015, CMS operated an FFE in 34 states, and 17 states were  approved to operate state-based exchanges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Despite Steps Taken, Additional Efforts Are Needed to Control Medicaid Improper Payments", "paragraphs": ["CMS has taken steps to improve Medicaid program integrity and reduce  improper payments; however, additional actions should be taken to help  further prevent improper payments.

For example, in response to PPACA, CMS established a  more rigorous approach to verifying financial and nonfinancial information  needed to determine Medicaid beneficiary eligibility. CMS created a tool  called the Data Services Hub that was implemented in fiscal year 2014 to  help verify beneficiary applicant information used to determine eligibility  for enrollment in qualified health plans and insurance-affordability  programs, including Medicaid. The hub routes to and verifies application  information in various external data sources, such as the Social Security  Administration and the Department of Homeland Security. According to  CMS, the hub can verify key application information, including household  income and size, citizenship, state residency, incarceration status, and  immigration status.", "Despite CMS\u2019s efforts, there continue to be gaps in the agency\u2019s efforts to  ensure that only eligible individuals are enrolled into Medicaid. In  particular, our work found that federal and selected state-based  marketplaces approved health insurance coverage and subsidies for 9 of  12 fictitious applications made during the 2016 special enrollment period.  In another study, we found that CMS also had gaps in ensuring that  Medicaid expenditures for enrollees\u2014including enrollees eligible as a  result of the PPACA expansion\u2014are matched appropriately by the federal  government. Specifically, we found that CMS had excluded from review  federal Medicaid eligibility determinations in the states that have  delegated authority to the federal government to make Medicaid eligibility  determinations through the federally facilitated exchange. To address this  gap in oversight of eligibility determinations, we recommended that CMS  conduct reviews of federal Medicaid eligibility determinations to ascertain  the accuracy of these determinations and institute corrective action plans  where necessary. In October 2016, HHS provided additional information  indicating that the department is relying upon operational controls within  federal marketplaces to ensure accurate eligibility determinations as well  as new processes that would identify duplicate coverage. However, we  continue to believe that without a systematic review of federal eligibility  determinations, the agency lacks a mechanism to identify and correct  errors and associated payments.", "Lastly, CMS requires all states to participate annually in the Eligibility  Review Pilots to test different approaches to measuring the accuracy of  eligibility determinations under the new beneficiary enrollment  processes. Oversight of beneficiary eligibility is important to program  integrity. Our prior work has identified thousands of Medicaid  beneficiaries involved in potential improper or fraudulent payments. Some  of the concerns that we identified included beneficiaries having payments  made on their behalf concurrently by two or more states, and payments  made for claims that were dated after a beneficiary\u2019s death."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improving Oversight of Managed Care", "paragraphs": ["CMS has taken steps to provide states with additional guidance on their  oversight of Medicaid managed care organizations. In October 2014,  CMS made available on its website the managed care plan compliance  toolkit to provide further guidance to states and managed care plans on  identifying improper payments to providers. In May 2016, CMS issued a  final rule on Medicaid managed care, which requires states to conduct  periodic audits of financial data submitted by, or on behalf of each  Medicaid managed care plan. The final rule takes additional steps to  improve oversight of Medicaid managed care, with some provisions  applying after 2018. CMS has also taken action in response to  recommendations that we made with regard to increasing guidance for  states, requiring states to audit managed care organizations, and  providing states with additional audit support.", "Oversight of Medicaid managed care is increasing in importance as  states\u2019 use of managed care plans to deliver services has been growing.  More than half of all Medicaid beneficiaries are now enrolled in managed  care plans, and nearly 40 percent of Medicaid expenditures are for health  care services delivered through managed care. The estimated improper  payment rate for managed care is currently less than one percent;  however, this estimate is based on a review of the payments made to  managed care organizations and does not review any underlying medical  documentation. Additional actions on the part of CMS and the states are  critical to improving program integrity in Medicaid. In particular, we and  the HHS Office of Inspector General have identified incomplete and  untimely managed care encounter data. Encounter data are data that  managed care organizations are expected to report to state Medicaid  programs, allowing states to track the services received by beneficiaries  enrolled in managed care.

Additionally, CMS regulations now require that the  state Medicaid agency enroll all Medicaid managed care providers, which  has the potential to improve oversight of providers in managed care.", "Prior to PPACA, if one state terminated a provider from its Medicaid  program, a provider could potentially enroll in or continue participation in  another state\u2019s Medicaid program, leaving the latter state\u2019s program  vulnerable to potential fraud, waste, and abuse. Our prior work has  identified hundreds of Medicaid providers who were potentially improperly  receiving Medicaid payments. Potential improper behavior included  providers with suspended or revoked licenses, improper mailing  addresses, or deceased providers.", "Actions to ensure appropriate oversight of Medicaid providers, however,  continue to require additional action on the part of CMS and the states.  Our work, which was based on 2 states and 16 health plans, found that  these states and health plans used information that was fragmented  across 22 databases managed by 15 different federal agencies to screen  providers\u2014and that these databases did not always have unique  identifiers. Our work resulted in in a recommendation that CMS identify  databases best suited for oversight of provider eligibility and coordinate  with other agencies to explore the use of a unique identifier. CMS  regulations now require that the state Medicaid agency enroll all Medicaid  managed care providers, which has the potential to improve oversight of  providers in managed care. However, CMS has not yet evaluated  whether the additional database merit further action or considered ways  to ensure that a unique identifier is available so that providers can be  accurately identified. We also found that the 10 selected states that we  reviewed used inconsistent practices to make data on ineligible providers  publicly available, which could result in provider screening efforts that do  not identify ineligible providers. CMS has taken action that is responsive  to another recommendation on providing guidance to state Medicaid  programs, establishing expectations and best practices on sharing  provider screening data among states and Managed care plans.
