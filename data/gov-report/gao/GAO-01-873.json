Capital will become more permanent, and new risk-based and leverage capital requirements will also be implemented. The new capital structure has the potential to address the risks associated with advances as well as the direct acquisition of mortgages. However, it is too early to assess the overall adequacy of the structure. So far, direct acquisition appears to provide regional diversification of mortgage acquisitions and incentives to member institutions for sound mortgage underwriting and servicing through the sharing of credit risks. However, risks could be affected if changes are made in the level of mortgage acquisition activity and in the risk-sharing agreements between the FHLBanks and their member institutions. Such changes might also increase the importance of risk-based capital requirements compared to the leverage requirements of the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB). Risks in the FHLBank System will increase because of expanded collateral provisions in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and direct mortgage acquisition activity. Mitigation of that risk will depend on risk management by the FHLBanks, the adequacy of capital structure, and oversight by FHFB. In addition to the FHLBanks, the acquisition activity could also generate additional risks for the enterprises. Although the FHLBank System and the enterprises primarily engage in different business activities, these differences may decrease if direct mortgage acquisition activity grows dramatically. Having one housing government sponsored enterprise (GSE) regulator for safety and soundness and mission compliance would provide greater independence and objectivity, greater prominence, improved ability to assess the competitive impact of new initiatives on all housing GSEs, and improved ability to ensure consistency of regulation of GSEs that operate in similar markets."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report responds to a mandate in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001 that we analyze the adequacy of the capital structure of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLBank) System. The FHLBank System\u2014 which consists of 12 regional FHLBanks and the System\u2019s Office of Finance\u2014is cooperatively owned by member financial institutions.Currently, FHLBank capital lacks permanence compared to other firms\u2019 capital because it is redeemable with only 6 months\u2019 notice. As such, its usefulness as a cushion in times of stress is questionable. The existence of joint and several liability within the System also means that a FHLBank\u2019s capital must be available to protect the System if one or more FHLBanks suffer losses severe enough to erode their capital. In addition, in part because the FHLBank System is a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) whose failure could lead to government intervention and potential losses to the taxpayer, there are regulatory capital requirements imposed by the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB) in the form of minimum leverage and risk-based capital levels. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) of 1999 mandated a new capital structure that would increase the permanence of FHLBank capital and require that FHFB promulgate capital requirements related to the risk of activities undertaken by FHLBanks. The FHLBanks have not yet completed their plans to implement their new capital structures, which limited the scope of our analysis.", "As agreed with your offices, our objectives were to (1) describe the basic characteristics of the capital structure being established for the cooperative FHLBank System; (2) analyze how risk management policies and the new capital structure address interest rate, credit, and operations risks that are associated with advances and the direct acquisition of mortgages; and (3) compare and contrast the risk-based capital standards proposed by FHFB for the FHLBank System to the standards proposed by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the enterprises).", "FHFB and OFHEO have proposed new capital standards that are related to the risks of unexpected losses, but these standards have not been implemented. To date, FHFB and OFHEO have enforced leverage capital requirements that are based on asset, debt, and/or activity levels rather than the risks of specific activities. The FHLBanks facilitate mortgage financing primarily by making collateralized loans, called advances, to their members. These loans are funded by issuing consolidated bonds, which are the joint and several liability of the FHLBanks, through the System\u2019s Office of Finance. In contrast to the cooperatively owned FHLBank System, the enterprises are private corporations with publicly traded stock.", "To complete our work, we reviewed FHFB and OFHEO capital standards; analyzed FHLBank proposals for the use of expanded collateral provisions and permissible uses of advances under GLBA; analyzed FHLBank information on direct mortgage acquisition programs; and interviewed financial institution regulatory body and GSE officials. We did not verify the accuracy of data provided by FHFB and the FHLBanks. We obtained and analyzed information the FHLBanks considered to be proprietary. Therefore, we do not report specific details of the various FHLBank products. In addition, although we made observations of some elements of risk management that appear to be implemented at the FHLBanks, we did not analyze risk management procedures employed by the FHLBanks, FHFB\u2019s oversight of risk management, nor the risks associated with FHLBank investments. We also did not analyze the risks of activities that have been or might be undertaken by either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.", "We conducted our work in Washington, D.C., between February 2001 and June 2001, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Written comments on a draft of this report from FHFB appear in appendix V.

Congress created GSEs to help make credit available to certain sectors of the economy, such as housing and agriculture, in which the private market was perceived as not effectively meeting credit needs. GSEs receive benefits from their federal charters that help them fulfill their missions. The federal government\u2019s creation of and continued relationship with GSEs have created the perception in the financial markets that the government would not allow a GSE to default on its obligations, even though intervention is not required. As a result, GSEs can borrow money in the capital markets at lower interest rates than comparably creditworthy private corporations that do not enjoy federal sponsorship, and market discipline is reduced. In fact, during the 1980s, the government did provide limited regulatory and financial relief to Fannie Mae when it experienced significant financial difficulties, and, in 1987, Congress authorized $4 billion to bail out the Farm Credit System, another GSE. Additional background on the FHLBank System, the enterprises, FHFB, OFHEO, and financial risks are presented in appendix II.", "Our mandate directs us to analyze interest rate, credit, and operations risks. Interest rate risk is a component of what is commonly called market risk. Market risk is the potential for financial losses due to the increase or decrease in the value or price of an asset or liability resulting from broad movements in prices, such as interest rates, commodity prices, stock prices, or the relative value of foreign exchange. Credit risk is the potential for financial loss because of the failure of a borrower or counterparty to perform on an obligation. Credit risk may arise from either an inability or unwillingness to perform as required by a loan, a bond, an interest rate swap, or any other financial contract. Operations risk is the potential for unexpected financial losses due to inadequate information systems, operational problems, breaches in internal controls, or fraud. It is associated with problems of accurately processing or settling transactions and with breakdowns in controls and risk limits. Individual operating problems are considered small-probability but potentially high-cost events for well-run firms. Operations risk includes many risks that are not easily quantified, but controlling these risks is crucial to a firm\u2019s successful operation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A More Permanent Capital Structure Is Being Established for the FHLBank System", "paragraphs": ["The FHLBank System is establishing a new capital structure that will include new risk-based and leverage capital requirements and will also make capital more permanent. FHLBank capital will continue to differ from capital issued by publicly traded corporations, however, because of the cooperative nature of the FHLBank System. Additionally, each FHLBank\u2019s capital is potentially available throughout the System, because the FHLBanks are jointly and severally liable for the System\u2019s outstanding debt securities.

These new capital standards, when fully implemented, will replace the current \u201csubscription\u201d capital structure for the FHLBanks. Under the current structure, the amount of capital that each FHLBank issued was determined by a statutory formula that dictated how much FHLBank stock each member had to purchase. A principal shortcoming of the subscription capital structure was that the amount of capital each FHLBank maintained bore little relation to the risks inherent in the FHLBank\u2019s assets and liabilities. Under the new structure, FHLBanks will be required to maintain longer-term permanent capital and total capital in amounts sufficient for the FHLBanks to comply with the minimum risk- based and leverage capital requirements established by GLBA.", "We have consistently supported the concept of risk-based capital standards applied in combination with a leverage ratio that requires a minimum capital-to-asset ratio for the FHLBanks. A risk-based capital standard has a number of benefits. First, it gives the government a mechanism to influence risk-taking without involving itself in the FHLBanks\u2019 daily business. Second, it gives FHLBanks\u2019 shareholders an incentive to demand that management not take undue risks, since increased risk taking would impose additional costs resulting from raising additional capital. Third, it provides a buffer that should be adequate to absorb unforeseen losses to FHLBanks and thus helps prevent or reduce potential taxpayer losses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHLBank System Capital Will Become More Permanent", "paragraphs": ["The new capital structure the FHLBank System is implementing will also result in more permanent capital. After the enactment of GLBA in 1999, membership in the FHLBank System became all voluntary. Voluntary members can generally redeem stock with 6 months\u2019 notice. Capital redeemable on such short notice does not provide a cushion against unexpected losses. Therefore, the change to all voluntary members increased the need for more permanent capital that could not necessarily be redeemed with 6 months notice, and GLBA required implementation of a more permanent capital structure.", "Under the new capital structure, the FHLBanks are permitted to issue Class A stock, which can be redeemed with 6 months\u2019 notice, and Class B stock, which can be redeemed with 5 years\u2019 notice, or both. To help ensure that capital does not dissipate due to redemption in time of stress, GLBA does not allow a FHLBank to redeem or repurchase capital if following the redemption the FHLBank would fail to satisfy any minimum capital requirement. Based on discussions with FHFB officials and their review of draft capital plans, it appears that a majority of FHLBanks might initially implement an exclusive Class B stock structure, while other FHLBanks might implement a mixed structure. The presence of 5-year capital, combined with the requirement that member institutions lose benefits of membership in the System if they withdraw capital, acts to create a financial interest that mirrors some, though certainly not all, characteristics of publicly traded perpetual equity stock.", "Permanent capital is defined in GLBA as amounts paid in for Class B stock plus the retained earnings. Class A stock plus permanent capital is to be at least 4 percent of assets. Class A stock plus 1.5 times permanent capital is to be at least 5 percent of assets. Therefore, a FHLBank meeting the 4 percent requirement will also meet the 5 percent requirement if its permanent capital equals at least 2 percent of assets. In addition, only permanent capital is included in the capital definition for the risk-based capital component of the minimum capital standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHLBank Capital Will Continue to Differ From Capital Issued by Publicly Traded Corporations", "paragraphs": ["Although the new capital structure will result in more permanent capital, FHLBank capital will continue to differ from the capital issued by publicly traded corporations such as the enterprises or banks.

Stock issued by publicly traded corporations can be bought and sold freely and publicly at a market- determined price. In contrast, a FHLBank member institution can redeem FHLBank stock at par value as long as all restrictions are met. For example, a member can withdraw capital with prior notice (i.e., of 6 months or 5 years) if after redemption the FHLBank satisfies all minimum capital requirements. However, FHLBank member institutions lose benefits of membership in the System if they withdraw minimum capital required for membership. This lessens incentives to remove capital, if, for example, FHLBank earnings declined.", "Second, investors cannot be obligated to buy the stock of publicly traded corporations. However, FHLBank members can be required to buy additional FHLBank stock to ensure that the FHLBank meets its capital requirements.

Joint and several liability for the payment of consolidated obligations gives investors confidence that System debt will be paid. Another related characteristic of joint and several liability is that it potentially creates a large pool of capital from all FHLBanks to provide a cushion in the event of unexpected System losses. However, joint and several liability also puts all FHLBanks at risk because of the possibility that one FHLBank could become troubled and not be able to meet its debt obligations. In such a situation, the troubled FHLBank would have incentives to undertake risky activities because profits would accrue to the FHLBank\u2019s owners, whereas losses and erosion of capital could fall on others. This scenario creates incentives for the FHLBanks to monitor each other\u2019s activities, which FHLBank officials told us they do through a number of System-wide bodies of representatives from the 12 FHLBanks.", "In theory, joint and several liability appears to make most System capital available in the event of large, unexpected losses in the System. However, concerns about how joint and several liability would operate in the event of a default or delinquency on a consolidated obligation prompted FHFB to issue regulations in 1999. The regulations establish a process by which FHFB will look first to the assets of a FHLBank that received the proceeds of the consolidated obligation. The regulations also contain certification and reporting requirements with which the FHLBanks must comply. For example, the FHLBanks must certify before the end of the each calendar quarter that they will remain in compliance with the liquidity requirements and will remain capable of making full and timely payments on their consolidated obligations. A FHLBank that is unable to provide the required certification must provide additional notifications to FHFB, such as a payment plan specifying the measures the FHLBank will take to make full and timely payments of all its obligations. The regulations also specify that FHFB may order any FHLBank to make principal and interest payments due on any consolidated obligation in the System. In this case, each contributing FHLBank is entitled to reimbursement from the FHLBank that was responsible for making the payment. Liability is to be allocated among the other FHLBanks on a pro rata basis in proportion to each FHLBank\u2019s participation in all consolidated obligations.", "Joint and several liability provides incentives for the FHLBanks to monitor each other and appears to make most System capital available in the event of large, unexpected losses in the System. However, joint and several liability in a cooperative system has never been tested. The FHLBanks have never defaulted on principal or interest payments due on a consolidated obligation. Another cooperative GSE with joint and several liability, the Farm Credit System (FCS), experienced severe economic stress in the middle-1980s. To provide a broader perspective on joint and several liability, we obtained information on the FCS experience during and following its financial rescue by the federal government.

Therefore, more so than other regulators, FHFB must be prepared to act in case a FHLBank\u2019s financial condition weakens. Second, although joint and several liability creates incentives for the FHLBanks to monitor each other\u2019s activities, the FHLBanks do not have the authority to direct a financially troubled FHLBank to take corrective actions.

Based on existing direct mortgage acquisition activity, direct acquisition appears to provide regional diversification of mortgage acquisitions and incentives for sound underwriting by member institutions from member exposure to credit risks. However, this activity is relatively new, and its level is expected to grow, thereby increasing risks. In addition, risks could be affected if changes are made in the risk-sharing agreements between the FHLBanks and their member institutions.

However, GLBA authorized advances to community financial institutions utilizing small business and agricultural loan collateral that will likely introduce greater credit and operations risk. Interest rate risk will not change, and FHLBanks will continue to manage this risk as they have managed it for traditional advances. The FHLBanks have extensive experience in managing their traditional advance business and have developed financial management policies for managing risks, as required by FHFB. In addition, according to FHFB, the FHLBanks typically require 10 to 25 percent more than the value of an advance in collateral. Largely due to collateral protection and the System\u2019s lien status, FHLBanks have never experienced a credit loss on their advance business.", "In contrast to their traditional advance business, advances to community financial institutions utilizing small business and agricultural loan collateral are inherently riskier and generate credit risk that is more difficult to evaluate. First, small business and agricultural loans are more heterogeneous than single-family residential mortgage loans. In particular, small business loans finance businesses involved in a wide range of economic activities. Unlike mortgage loans that have fairly homogeneous characteristics, loans to a wide variety of sectors are more difficult to analyze. In addition, the value of each business is determined largely by the performance of those operating it. In contrast, appraising the value of a housing unit providing collateral for a single-family residential mortgage loan is more straightforward. Operations risk would also increase, because FHLBanks have not fully developed the expertise, information systems, and operational procedures necessary for these new activities.", "Both FHFB and the FHLBanks recognize that the new collateral will entail greater credit risks than residential mortgage collateral. FHFB requires a FHLBank, prior to accepting the new collateral for the first time, to file a notice to demonstrate that the FHLBank has the capacity to manage the risks associated with the new types of collateral to be accepted.According to FHFB, the FHLBanks are requiring 65 to 150 percent more collateral over the size of advances when the collateral is loans secured by small businesses or farms.

One of the measures is duration of equity. This measures the sensitivity of market value of equity to changes in interest rates.

Holding mortgage assets exposes FHLBanks to interest rate risk, because the FHLBanks assume the risk for any changes in the market value of the retained mortgage assets. If interest rates increase at a time when new debt has to be issued, borrowing costs will increase while returns from fixed-rate mortgage asset holdings remain constant. Because borrowers tend to prepay and refinance their mortgages when interest rates decline, falling interest rates carry another form of interest rate risk called prepayment risk. To the extent that FHLBanks rely on long-term debt that cannot be refinanced, returns will fall without a corresponding decline in debt costs. The prepayment risk associated with mortgage holdings differs from that associated with advances, because the advances to member institutions carry prepayment penalties. The FHLBanks, however, currently have experience in managing prepayment risk because they have investment holdings of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and the associated prepayment risk. The FHLBanks and the enterprises tend to use financial instruments such as long-term, callable debt to limit their exposure to interest rate risk from holdings of mortgage assets.", "FHLBanks use derivatives and callable debt to hedge interest rate risk resulting from direct investments in mortgage assets. To the extent that the duration of mortgage assets differs from that of debt obligations, FHLBanks often enter into a matching interest rate exchange agreement. This agreement is one form of financial derivative called an interest rate swap, in which the counterparty pays cash flows to the FHLBank designed to mirror, in timing and amount, the cash outflows the FHLBank pays on the consolidated obligation. The FHLBanks also use other financial arrangements to manage interest rate risk. For example, callable debt allows the FHLBank as issuer to buy (i.e., call) back issued debt when interest rates decline. Callable debt is attractive as a source of funds for mortgage asset holdings, because borrowers tend to prepay their mortgages and refinance when interest rates decline. FHLBanks had $224.5 billion of callable debt outstanding as of December 31, 2000, out of total consolidated obligations of about $592 billion.", "Direct mortgage acquisitions expose the FHLBanks to credit risk. To qualify for FHLBank purchase, as is true for purchase by the enterprises, mortgage insurance is required for mortgage loans with loan to value ratios of over 80 percent. FHLBank purchases have included conventional mortgage loans with private mortgage insurance as well as mortgage loans with federal guarantees or insurance. The FHLBanks\u2019 credit risk management includes enforcement of lender guidelines for member institutions participating in direct mortgage acquisition. The FHLBanks have established stated actions they will take to ensure that member institutions follow these guidelines. For example, the FHLBanks are to collect quality control reports from participating members and perform a quality control review on a sampling of the mortgages purchased from each member. Participating members are also subject to audit by the FHLBank or its designated agents. FHLBank establishment and enforcement of guidelines for participating members help the FHLBanks mitigate credit risk by increasing the degree of assurance that lenders meet fundamental standards for originating and servicing mortgages. The FHLBanks credit risk management also includes implementation of lender credit enhancement requirements that subject participating member institutions to credit risk. For example, the FHLBank establishes an account in which payments to member institutions are reduced in the event of mortgage defaults. These credit enhancements further help the FHLBanks mitigate credit risk by creating incentives for sound mortgage underwriting and servicing by participating members. The FHLBanks also seek wide geographic distribution of their mortgage acquisitions to limit their exposure to any particular regional economic downturn.", "Lenders who hold mortgages and member institutions use an infrastructure to manage their credit risk that is different from the infrastructure used by secondary market entities, such as the enterprises. These institutions can benefit in their management of credit risk from their potential ability to better understand their local markets and thereby the credit risk associated with mortgages they fund or mortgages they sell in which they still take on credit risk. In addition, institutions that take on credit risk from mortgages they originate do not face the moral hazard problems secondary market entities have when they purchase mortgages and take on the associated credit risks. To address the moral hazard problem, secondary market entities develop infrastructures to oversee the lending and servicing practices of lenders from whom they purchase mortgages.", "Direct mortgage acquisitions expose the FHLBanks to operations risk, because in the past the FHLBanks had not developed the expertise, information systems, and operational procedures to approve and oversee lenders. Exposure to operations risk is related to the FHLBanks\u2019 exposure to credit risk, because new operating infrastructure and procedures are necessary to the extent that member exposure to credit risk reduces the moral hazard problem faced by the FHLBanks. If the FHLBanks have little exposure to credit risk and moral hazard, then operations risk will be lower. The actions taken to avoid moral hazard, including systems used to provide lender oversight, entail operations risk. In contrast, credit and operations risks from traditional advances have been minimal because of collateral requirements.", "As of December 31, 2000, the FHLBanks held slightly over $15 billion in fixed, long-term, single-family mortgages compared to about $1.4 billion as of year-end 1999.

The 10 FHLBanks from Boston, New York, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, Indianapolis, Chicago, Des Moines, Dallas, Topeka, and San Francisco, currently participate in MPF.", "Although MPF offers multiple products, they share some common characteristics. First, mortgage purchases are limited to mortgage loans below the conforming loan limit for the enterprises, which is currently $275,000 for a single-family housing unit. Second, the FHLBank holds an account with funds generated from transactions between the FHLBank and the member bank. This account takes the first-loss position after primary mortgage insurance payments; that is, costs due to borrower mortgage defaults are taken from this account before other sources of funds are utilized to cover credit losses. The funds are generated by providing the FHLBank a price deduction at time of sale and/or from an annual flow of payments. The latter device is often called a spread account, because it represents a spread between payments due to the member institution from the FHLBank (e.g., to compensate the member for taking on credit risk) and payments actually made by the FHLBank.Third, for some MPF products the member institution is required to supply additional credit enhancements in the form of direct loss guarantees and/or supplemental insurance to provide a second-loss position before the FHLBank is exposed to credit losses. The loss positions taken by the first-loss account and the second-loss supplemental insurance and lender guarantees are lender provided credit enhancements. By FHFB regulation, the FHLBank requires the member institution to provide collateral to secure direct loss guarantees provided by the lender. The collateral is protected by the lien status applicable to collateral used to secure advances.", "The FHLBank of Chicago has two primary means of achieving regional diversification of its credit risk. First, it purchases mortgages from member institutions that are affiliated with large, nationwide lenders, and second, it invests in the mortgage acquisitions (called participations) made by the nine other FHLBanks that participate in MPF. Table 1 presents the geographic distribution of MPF mortgages as of year-end 2000. Based on all MPF mortgage loans to date, it appears that regional diversification has been achieved. According to FHLBank of Chicago officials, MPF serves both large and small FHLBank member institutions.", "The FHLBanks of Cincinnati, Indianapolis, and Seattle participate in the other direct mortgage acquisition program, which is named the Mortgage Partnership Program (MPP). MPP was initiated near year-end 2000. As of year-end 2000, less than $500 million in mortgage loan holdings were accounted for by the FHLBanks participating in MPP.", "MPP is in its infancy compared to MPF.

How these assets are funded and how the risks are transferred or shared has important implications for regulatory capital treatment at both the depository institution and at the GSE. For example, when mortgages along with all the attendant risks are sold outright to a GSE, the only relevant capital requirement would be at the GSE level. Alternatively, when a depository institution purchases an MBS issued by a GSE, there is a capital charge imposed at the depository level that is to reflect the credit risk of GSE obligations as well as a capital charge at the GSE level. For those funding arrangements in which credit risk is maintained, in whole or in part, at the depository institution level, the capital treatment by the depository institution regulators and the GSE regulators interact. From an integrated perspective it is important that risks and capital requirements are in proper relation to one another. Otherwise certain arrangements can be disadvantaged if capital charges are too high or advantaged if they are too low. As such, supervision is particularly important.", "Depository institutions that engage in secondary market transactions with GSEs must hold capital based on (1) the amount of GSE obligations in their portfolios, (2) their capital investment in the GSEs, and (3) the risks retained when selling or transferring mortgage assets to a GSE. The depository regulators we interviewed told us that they generally assign relatively low credit risk weights to depository institution holdings of GSE obligations, because they take into account the perception of implied federal backing of GSE obligations. The regulators told us that depository institution holdings of FHLBank debt, enterprise debt, and enterprise MBS are in the 20 percent risk category. Thus, rather than the general requirement of $8 in capital for each $100 of assets in the 100 percent risk category, such as unsecured loan assets, $1.60 of capital is required (that is, 8 percent of $20). Therefore, depository institutions that sold mortgages in the secondary market and purchased an equivalent amount of GSE backed MBS would lower their credit risk and their capital requirements. In fact, the combined capital requirement, including the capital requirement at the GSE level, would be lower possibly reflecting the GSEs\u2019 ability to reduce overall credit risk through geographic diversification. Currently, depository institutions are required to hold $4 in capital for each $100 in mortgage loan holdings and $1.60 of capital for each $100 in enterprise MBS holdings, and the enterprises are required to hold capital equal to 0.45 percent of MBS issued and held by outside investors. Thus, the transfer can result in $2.05 of total capital required rather than $4 of capital required without the transfer of assets.", "The depository institution regulators have also established capital requirements for the risk associated with depository institution investments in GSE equity. The regulators told us that currently FHLBank capital is in the 20 percent risk category although they are actively reviewing this capital treatment and considering the new capital structure being established for the FHLBank System. In addition, they told us that enterprise equity is generally in the 100 percent risk category; the one exception is the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the regulator of national banks, which places enterprise equity in the 20 percent risk weight category. The regulators stated that their supervision activities address concentrations of pledged assets and risks at individual depository institutions that could result from heavy reliance on FHLBanks as a funding source.", "The depository institution regulators have provided guidance on the risk- based capital treatment of only one MPF program, MPF 100. Under this program, the member institution acts as agent for the FHLBank, underwriting, servicing and providing a credit enhancement for residential mortgage pools. The member receives fees for the credit enhancement that it provides. The FHLBank provides a first-dollar loss protection cushion equal to 100 basis points of the total mortgage pool\u2019s unpaid balance. As the FHLBank incurs credit losses allocable to this protection, the credit enhancement fees paid by the FHLBank to the member are reduced. However, the credit enhancement fees are not recorded on the balance sheet of the member institution until received. The second-loss credit enhancement provided by the member institution is sized so that the senior piece held by the FHLBank would have the credit quality equivalent to a double-A rating.", "The depository institution regulators determined that since expected receipt of the guarantee fees by the member institution is not a balance sheet asset, and since the member institution is under no obligation to pay anything to the FHLBank, there is no risk of loss to the member\u2019s capital. The only consequence to the member institution in the case of credit losses is the receipt of a lower level of credit enhancement fees. Because expected credit losses would not affect the member\u2019s balance sheet, the depository institution regulators determined that the FHLBank is in the first-loss position. They determined that the member institution\u2019s capital requirement would be based on the face value of the second-loss credit enhancement.", "In contrast, the FHFB analysis of the credit enhancement structure of MPF 100 leads to a different result. According to the FHFB analysis, because the member institution\u2019s credit enhancement fees are reduced if the FHLBank incurs losses from the first-loss cushion due to mortgage defaults, the member\u2019s fees are contingent upon the performance of the mortgage pools. FHFB determined that because the member bears the economic responsibility of the expected credit losses from the first dollar of loss, the member is effectively in the first-loss position.", "While the depository institution regulators have provided guidance on one particular mortgage participation product, they have yet to opine on others. It is also likely that new products could arise with various combinations of credit risk sharing arrangements. The depository institution regulators have issued proposed regulations that would change the risk-based capital treatment of credit enhancements. The rules currently in effect provide for differing capital treatment for credit enhancements that have the same economic effect, depending on whether the credit enhancement is retained in a sale of assets or acquired in some other way.

Figure 2 provides more information on double leveraging.", "Enterprise officials told us that FHLBank capital is not adequate to support the risks of direct mortgage acquisition, because debt issued to finance the investment is a liability on the balance sheet of the FHLBank, the investment is an asset on the balance sheet of the FHLBank, and the capital of the FHLBank is downstreamed noncapital proceeds from member institutions.", "This approach appears to be an analogy based on accounting flows resulting from on-balance sheet investments by the FHLBanks. Based on our analysis, there appear to be countervailing factors that lessen the applicability of the analogy as a way of analyzing the ability of capital to address the risks of FHLBank mortgage acquisitions. First, the approach focuses on leverage directly, rather than on the relationship between capital and risks. The present risk sharing arrangements, which include the requirement that the member institution be in the first-loss position, limit credit risk to the FHLBank. At the member institution level, depository institution regulators rely on supervisory tools to limit exposure to potential risks resulting from FHLBank mortgage acquisitions.", "As a second countervailing factor, MPF and MPP are not the only secondary mortgage market programs that reduce total capital requirements. When the enterprises purchase mortgages from depository institutions, capital requirements for the depository institutions are reduced without a corresponding increase in enterprise capital requirements. As stated above, depository institution regulators generally assign relatively low credit risk weights to depository institution holdings of GSE obligations. One reason why the capital requirements at the enterprise level are lower is that the enterprises can reduce credit risk through geographic diversification of their mortgage servicing portfolios.", "However, the relationship between the credit risk reduction from geographic diversification and the reduction in total capital required has not been established. As in the case of FHLBank mortgage acquisitions, depository institution regulators rely on regulatory oversight.", "As a third countervailing factor, even if capital should be consolidated between FHLBanks and member institutions in some manner, the holding company analogy lacks sufficiency as a method of analysis. Consolidation of balance sheets has the most merit in the case of a parent holding company that controls a subsidiary in which the parent funds the closely controlled subsidiary with instruments not acceptable as regulatory capital and in turn uses the subsidiary as an investment vehicle. In the case of the FHLBank System, a parent holding company does not exist. The FHLBank System is a cooperative in which member institutions provide System capital, but no one member appears to hold a controlling interest in the corporate governance decisions of any one FHLBank. In addition, joint and several liability combined with all voluntary membership motivates the FHLBanks to monitor each other\u2019s financial activities.", "While we have treated the concept of double leveraging as a distinct issue, the more fundamental concern raised by the enterprises appears to be associated with the nature of FHLBank capital.

Therefore, the GSE would also operate in a similar manner to the enterprises. We indicated that such authorization could increase the overall amount of GSE activity in the mortgage market and, as a result, raise the potential amount at risk in case of a government bailout; increase the level of GSE risk, because entities operating in new markets often have greater managerial and operations risk than those operating in established markets; increase credit risk if the new entity attempted to establish market share by lowering underwriting standards; and increase competition and thereby reduce mortgage interest rates to borrowers.", "Risks in the FHLBank System will increase from its direct mortgage acquisition activity.

We have pointed out the advantages of combining oversight responsibilities in one agency. Such an agency could be more independent and objective than the separate regulatory bodies and could be more prominent than either one alone. Although the GSEs operate differently, the risks they manage and their missions are similar. The regulators\u2019 expertise in evaluating GSE risk management could be shared more easily within one agency. In addition, a single regulator would be better positioned to be cognizant of specific mission requirements, such as special housing goals and new programs or initiatives any of the GSEs might undertake, and should be better able to assess the competitive effect on all three housing GSEs and better ensure consistency of regulation for GSEs that operate in similar markets. Having all staff in one regulatory agency should also facilitate coordination and sharing of expertise among staff responsible for safety and soundness and mission compliance.

However, it is too early to assess the overall adequacy of the structure, because the capital plans and risk management practices to be implemented by the FHLBanks and capital supervision practices to be followed by FHFB are not yet known.", "Based on activity to date, direct acquisition appears to provide regional diversification of mortgage acquisitions and incentives to member institutions for sound mortgage underwriting and servicing through the sharing of credit risks. However, risks could be affected if changes are made in the level of mortgage acquisition activity and in the risk-sharing agreements that are currently present between the FHLBanks and their member institutions. Such changes might also increase the importance of risk-based capital requirements compared to FHFB leverage requirements.", "Going forward, risks in the FHLBank System will increase due to expanded collateral provisions in GLBA and direct mortgage acquisition activity. Effective mitigation of that risk will depend on risk management by the FHLBanks, the adequacy of the capital structure, and oversight by FHFB. In addition to the FHLBanks, the acquisition activity could also generate additional risks for the enterprises. Although currently the FHLBank System and the enterprises primarily engage in different business activities, these differences may decrease if direct mortgage acquisition activity grows dramatically.

The FHLBanks raise funds by issuing consolidated debt securities in the capital markets. The System was set up in 1932 to extend mortgage credit by making loans, called advances, to its member institutions, which in turn lend to home buyers for mortgages. Home mortgage loans and other collateral secure advances. These advances help member institutions, originally limited to thrifts and insurance companies, by enhancing liquidity and providing access to national capital markets. In 1989, as part of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA), Congress opened membership to nonthrift federally insured depository institutions that offer residential mortgage loans. Thrifts with federal charters remained in the System as mandatory members while nonthrift institutions were voluntary members. GLBA created all voluntary membership and expanded the purposes of System advances with corresponding expansion in eligible collateral for community financial institutions. As of December 31, 2000, the FHLBanks held about $438 billion in advances to members; $186 billion in investments, $16 billion in directly acquired mortgage assets; and $31 billion in capital, of which $728 million was in the form of retained earnings.

The enterprises are to accomplish this mission by purchasing mortgages from lenders (banks, thrifts, and mortgage bankers) who can then use the proceeds to make additional mortgage loans to home buyers. The enterprises issue debt to finance mortgage assets that they retain in their portfolios. A majority of purchased mortgages, however, are pooled to create mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that are sold to investors. The enterprises collect fees for guaranteeing the timely payment of principal and interest on MBS held by investors.

In a value at risk approach, the loss is estimated based on alternative possible interest rate patterns over the chosen time period. However, if approved by FHFB, a cash flow model can be used by a FHLBank as an alternative to a value at risk approach. When estimating interest rate risk and calculating capital required, each FHLBank is required to have sufficient permanent capital to meet the value at the risk level established by FHFB. The exposure to interest rate risk in each model is to depend on the level of stress from interest rate movements and any hedges used which affect the actual exposure to interest rate movements.

The added capital will be the difference between the market value of the capital and 85 percent of the book value of the FHLBank\u2019s capital. This requirement was implemented because FHFB was concerned that the book value of capital might not adequately reflect the economic value of capital in some cases. This requirement forces the capital available to cover interest rate risk to have a market or economic value of at least 85 percent of the book capital value. This requirement is consistent with a value at risk approach, which calculates the market value of capital available under different economic stresses.", "FHFB also established technical restrictions on how the internal value at risk model was to be designed in its risk-based capital regulation. FHFB required that the probability of a loss greater than the estimate of the market value of the bank\u2019s portfolio at risk shall not exceed 1 percent.Thus, the estimated net market value of the portfolio will cover estimated losses 99 percent of the time. In the regulation, FHFB directed each FHLBank to assume a stress period of 120-business days, based on historic interest rates from 1978 to 1 month before the capital requirement is calculated. FHFB stated that the periods chosen should be representative of the periods of greatest potential stress in the market given the FHLBank\u2019s portfolio.

At the same time, the level of credit risk in the remaining mortgages may increase if borrowers with poorer credit ratings cannot prepay. In addition, other factors such as the recent history of interest rates and the number of mortgages at different interest rates may interact with declining rates to affect prepayments. Consequently, the cash flow model can only calculate credit risk changes due to prepayments, if the values of all variables that affect prepayments and credit risk are fully specified in the model. To fully understand how interest rate risk and credit risk interact, a modeler would have to test different mixes of input variables, including interest rate changes.

The criteria was based on a 10-year stress period for both an increasing rate and decreasing rate environment that could affect losses for an enterprise. In both environments, the rates move during the first year and stay constant for the rest of the 10-year period. The act specifies that capital must be sufficient to cover the more stressful of the two interest rate environments. (See fig. 5 for a detailed enumeration of the interest rate environments that the 1992 act required OFHEO to use.)", "According to the 1992 act, OFHEO must assume that the enterprises acquire no new mortgages other than those deliverable under existing commitments at the beginning of the 10-year stress period. This approach focuses on the risks embedded in the book of business that existed at the beginning of the stress test period. This restriction on new business forces the model to act as if the enterprises are winding down their business during the stress period."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Congress Established the Stress for Operations Risk as 30 Percent of the Sum of Capital for Interest Rate and Credit Risk", "paragraphs": ["Operations risk is also specified in the 1992 act and is equal to 30 percent of the sum of interest rate risk and credit risk.
