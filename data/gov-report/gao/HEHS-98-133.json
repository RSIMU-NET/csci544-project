Although federal legislation establishes the normal retirement age for full pension benefits at 65, many individuals leave the labor force 5 to 10 years earlier. Labor force participation rates among 55- to 64-year-old men have declined since at least the 1960s. For those who retire before becoming eligible for Medicare, the availability of health benefits is of particular concern. Coverage for most Americans is tied to employment\u2014the very link that is severed by retirement or loosened by a person\u2019s gradual detachment from the labor force. Since 55- to 64-year-olds are more likely to use medical services, insurance they purchase directly in the individual market may be expensive and harder to pay for, considering the decline in income as a result of retirement. Because fewer employers offer retiree health coverage as a benefit and individually purchased insurance, when available, may be prohibitively expensive, the proportion of this age group that is uninsured may rise."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Eligibility, Access, and Coverage Differ by Source of Insurance", "paragraphs": ["Although most of the near elderly receive coverage as a benefit through their employer, some purchase health insurance on their own. The former is commonly referred to as employer-based group coverage and the latter as individual coverage. Complementing these two types of private health insurance are public programs, including Medicaid for the poor and Medicare for the elderly and disabled. Fundamental differences distinguish employer-sponsored group coverage from the individual insurance market and public insurance programs.", "Employer-Based. Eligibility for group health coverage through an employer typically depends on holding or having held a full-time job or working a sufficient number of hours to meet a minimum eligibility requirement. Increasingly, however, firms are imposing age and length of service eligibility requirements for retiree health benefits. Premiums in the group market are often considerably lower than those in the individual market because they are based on the experience of the entire group, and the larger the group, the smaller the impact of high-cost individuals on the overall premium. Also, individuals with employer-based coverage do not face the task of accessing the insurance market or identifying and comparing a multitude of products on their own. Rather, the employer arranges access and greatly simplifies the task of identifying and comparing products. Employers who offer health coverage generally provide a comprehensive benefit package with an associated deductible and copayment. Normally, annual out-of-pocket costs are capped, and health services beyond that point are reimbursed at 100 percent. Finally, selecting cost-sharing options and paying for the products is often eased by employer contributions and payroll deductions.", "Individual Market. Instances when Americans may turn to the individual market for health insurance include employment in part-time or temporary jobs, periods of unemployment between jobs, and retirement prior to Medicare eligibility. Unlike employer-based health benefits, however, eligibility and premiums in the individual markets of many states are determined on the basis of the risk associated with each applicant\u2019s demographic characteristics and health status. As a result, coverage in the individual market for those aged 55 to 64 and for individuals whose health is declining may be unavailable or considerably more expensive. Since consumers must absorb the entire cost of coverage themselves, carriers have recognized the importance of offering affordable options to people with different economic resources and health needs, and offer a wide range of health plans with a variety of covered benefits and cost-sharing options. The cost-sharing arrangement selected is a key determinant of the price of an individual insurance product\u2014the higher the potential out-of-pocket expenses, the lower the premium, and the greater the financial risk to the consumer. Finally, because carriers in many states can exclude preexisting health conditions from coverage, the benefits purchased may not be comprehensive. Recent federal legislation, discussed below, prevents preexisting condition exclusions for eligible individuals leaving group coverage.", "Public Insurance Programs. Significant differences also exist in eligibility for and coverage available through public programs such as Medicaid and Medicare. Medicaid, financed jointly by the federal government and the states, is the dominant public program for financing health coverage for low-income Americans\u2014families, primarily women and children, and the aged, blind, and disabled. Medicare is a national insurance program established in 1965 for elderly Americans aged 65 or older. For Americans under age 65, only those with end-stage renal disease or those who have been determined disabled under the Social Security Act qualify for Medicare. Disabled individuals must fulfill a 2-year waiting period before they are eligible for Medicare; however, in most states, the low-income disabled who receive Supplemental Security Income automatically qualify for Medicaid.", "Medicare benefits contain more gaps than those offered through Medicaid or a large employer. For example, standard (fee-for-service) Medicare has separate benefits for hospitalization (part A) and physician/outpatient (part B) services. Those eligible for Medicare are automatically enrolled in part A but must pay a premium to elect part B coverage. Part A has a relatively high deductible for each hospitalization and requires copayments for stays longer than 60 days. Part B has a separate deductible, requires 20 percent coinsurance for physicians\u2019 bills, and does not cover prescription drugs. Unlike most employer-based insurance, neither part A nor part B has a limit on out-of-pocket costs. To cover some of the gaps in Medicare coverage, beneficiaries often purchase Medigap insurance; alternatively, if available, they may enroll in a Medicare managed care plan, which generally offers a richer benefit package than fee-for-service Medicare, often with no premium. Finally, some beneficiaries have access to employer-based retiree health benefits, which supplement their Medicare coverage. Medicaid, like most employer-sponsored coverage, offers a comprehensive benefit package, but the depth of coverage varies substantially among states. Federal guidelines require coverage of a broad range of services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital care, physician services, laboratory services, and nursing home and home health care. Most of those enrolled in the program incur no out-of-pocket expenses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Role in Ensuring Access to Private Health Insurance", "paragraphs": ["Although the decision to offer health benefits to workers or retirees is essentially voluntary, several federal laws have influenced their provision by employers. For example, since 1954, the tax code has encouraged employment-based health coverage by making employer health benefit payments tax deductible and by excluding employer-provided benefits from employees\u2019 taxable income. Also, ERISA, which was enacted in 1974, allows employers to offer uniform national health benefits by preempting states from directly regulating employer benefit plans. ERISA, however, does impose some federal requirements on employer-based plans, including requirements to provide employees with a plan description within 90 days of enrollment and implement a process for appealing claim denials. Because of the federal preemption of state regulation, the rights of active and retired employees under ERISA are largely determined in the courts. Appendix I contains a description of the role of ERISA in safeguarding access to coverage provided voluntarily by an employer.", "In addition, federal law guarantees that individuals leaving employer-sponsored group health plans have access to continued coverage, and ultimately to a product in the individual market. First, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), which amended ERISA, requires group health plans covering 20 or more workers to offer 18 to 36 months of continued health coverage to former employees and their dependents in certain circumstances, such as when an employee is terminated or laid off, or quits or retires. Although COBRA is not specifically targeted at the near elderly, it clearly provides this age cohort with the opportunity to continue health coverage as they transition from the active workforce to retirement. The mandate to offer continuation coverage, however, does not oblige employers to share in the premium.", "The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) further guarantees access to individual market coverage to individuals leaving group health plans. Group-to-individual portability is available to eligible individuals who, among other criteria, have exhausted their available COBRA or other conversion coverage, regardless of their health status and without the imposition of coverage exclusions for preexisting conditions. HIPAA, however, does not provide similar guarantees of coverage for others in the individual market."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The Chairman, Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, asked us to assess the ability of Americans aged 55 to 64 to obtain health benefits through the employer-sponsored or individual insurance markets.

Appendix II discusses some of the strengths and limitations of the CPS and other surveys that we considered. As part of our analysis of the CPS, we separately examined two subgroups of the near elderly\u2014those aged 55 to 61, who are more likely to be in the labor force, and those aged 62 to 64, who have a greater chance of being retired. Since the March CPS asks respondents about their employment, retirement, health, income, marital, and social security status, we were able to make observations about the relationship of these variables to the health insurance status of the near elderly. To supplement CPS data on the health status of this age cohort, we also obtained more objective data on their health conditions, health care use, and health care expenditures from the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research and the National Center for Health Statistics.", "To determine trends in employer-based health insurance coverage for those who retire before reaching Medicare eligibility, we conducted a literature review on employer-based health benefits for early retirees. The focus of that review included information on (1) factors contributing to the decline in employer-based benefits, (2) terminations of retiree coverage, (3) changes in the terms and conditions under which coverage is made available to both current and future retirees, and (4) retirement and the influence of health benefits. We culled data on more recent trends in retiree coverage from periodic surveys sponsored by private benefit consultants and by the federal government. In general, we only reported trend data from nationally representative surveys.", "Information on continuation coverage is not available from the March 1997 CPS. Consequently, in order to examine the extent of the near elderly\u2019s utilization of COBRA coverage, we relied on analyses of two special CPS supplements sponsored by the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration of the Department of Labor\u2014one conducted in 1988 and a second in 1994. We supplemented these analyses with data drawn from (1) the administrative records maintained by a COBRA third-party administrator and (2) an annual survey that attempts to measure adverse risk selection as a result of COBRA.", "To determine the access of the near elderly to the individual insurance market, we updated information collected in our 1996 report on the cost and coverage trade-offs faced by Americans who rely on this market for coverage. In particular, we contacted officials from a number of state insurance departments and insurance carriers to obtain information about carrier underwriting practices, current premium prices for the most popular products, and recent state and federal legislation that affect individuals\u2019 access to this market. Because certain aspects of individual insurance markets can vary significantly among states, our 1996 study relied on case studies of such markets in a number of states. Although the findings from these states, including the premium prices of individual products, cannot be generalized to the nation as a whole, we believe they are reasonably representative of the range of individual insurance market dynamics across the country. Also updated were 1995 data for each state concerning individual market insurance reforms, high-risk pools, and insurers of last resort.", "The following chapters of this report focus on how the near elderly obtain health insurance and the obstacles they face in doing so. Understanding a few key distinctions among the various types of surveys used will facilitate the understanding of the data presented in this report. First, surveys can have different units of analysis. Certain surveys are based on interviews with a sample of individuals, some of whom are near elderly; others are the product of information collected from a sample of employers or establishments. Because of these different units of analysis, it is often difficult to make comparisons across the two types of surveys. Second, although various surveys collect information relevant to understanding the insurance status of the near elderly, 55- to 64-year-olds are not usually their primary focus. As a result, a particular sample may not be sufficiently large to precisely answer questions about a certain subset of the near elderly. Conversely, the survey (or an analysis by others) may have defined the near-elderly group differently, making it difficult to report on an issue with respect to 55- to 64-year-olds.", "Changes in survey methodology over time often preclude or complicate the identification of insurance trends among the near elderly. This is particularly true about employer survey data from the 1980s but also affects some surveys conducted in the 1990s. Though the changes may have improved the reliability and relevance of the data, they are often not comparable with earlier results from the same survey. Finally, some of the data sets are proprietary, and not all of the information collected is publicly available. The sample sizes, and thus the precision of the estimates derived, vary. Throughout this report, we alert the reader to the source of the survey data being reported, any limitations in that data, and any caveats that must accompany the survey findings because of the size of the sample.", "A number of experts on retiree health benefits and insurance markets commented on a draft of this report. They generally agreed with our presentation of the evidence on the near elderly\u2019s access to health insurance. We incorporated their comments as appropriate.

As the near elderly retire or cut back on their hours of work, they run the risk of severing their link to employer-based health insurance. Nonetheless, the percentage of uninsured in this age group is relatively low because of their increased reliance on health insurance through the individual market, Medicaid, and Medicare. Health, income, and employment status appear to influence how the near elderly obtain coverage. In general, those with individual insurance appear to have more in common with recipients of employer-based coverage than with the near elderly who had other sources of health benefits such as Medicaid or Medicare. Specifically, a smaller percentage of those with employer and individual coverage had low incomes, were minorities, were not working, or were in poor health. Key differences between those with individual and employer-based coverage, however, are that a larger percentage of the former were women, unmarried, unemployed, and with low incomes. There is also a similarity between the 55- to 64-year-olds who had public insurance and those who were uninsured. As compared with those with other sources of coverage, a higher percentage of both groups had low incomes, were minorities, were not working, or were in poor health.

More than 90 percent of the near elderly who worked full time had some kind of health insurance, compared with 82 percent of those who did not work at all. Moreover, the number of hours worked affected the source of coverage\u2014that is, whether the insurance was obtained through an employer, the individual market, or public sources (see fig. 2.9). For example, 81 percent of the near elderly who worked full time in 1996 had employer-based coverage, compared with only 65 percent who worked part time and only 46 percent of those who did not work. These differences are even more dramatic when we distinguish employer-based coverage through the individual\u2019s employer from that obtained through a spouse. Specifically, about 73 percent of full-time workers had coverage through their employer, compared with 46 percent of part-time workers and 25 percent of those who did not work. In addition, those aged 55 to 64 who worked part time were more likely to purchase individual insurance than were those who worked full time. This pattern may be explained by the possibility that those who worked full time were more likely to have employer-based health insurance at retirement.

Thus, individuals who worked for an employer as opposed to being self-employed were more likely to have employer-based health insurance through that employer, while the latter were more likely to have individually purchased insurance. Eighty-three percent of those who worked for a public employer in 1996 had coverage through their employer as did 67 percent of those who worked for a private employer. In contrast, 42 percent of the incorporated self-employed and 27 percent of the unincorporated self-employed had this source of coverage.

Just as the insurance status of the near elderly varied according to their relative attachment to the workforce or to the type of work performed, whether or not a person had insurance as well as the type of insurance they held also varied by the reasons given for not working (see table 2.8).", "First, whether or not an individual had insurance differed depending on the reason given for not working.

Today, many policymakers are concerned about the future viability of employer-based retiree health coverage and the implications for older Americans who are not yet eligible for Medicare. Evidence from several different sources paints a picture of eroding retiree health benefits. Because each of these sources alone gives an incomplete picture, this chapter uses both employer and retiree surveys to describe the current situation and future outlook for employer-based retiree health benefits.", "The number of medium and large employers offering health insurance to retirees appears to have dropped precipitously from levels reported in the 1980s. Moreover, during the 1990s, it has continued to drift slowly downward. Coincidentally, the decline in employers offering retiree coverage has been exacerbated by a shift in employment away from firms more likely to offer coverage toward those less likely to do so, that is, from manufacturing to service industries. When retiree health benefits are offered by a large employer, retiree participation has also declined\u2014a development attributed to the trend toward greater cost sharing. However, this decline has been offset, in part, by an increase in labor force participation among women. Thus, retirees who decline coverage from a former employer may have access to less expensive insurance through a working or retired spouse. Although the decision by larger employers not to offer retiree health benefits has affected some current retirees, it will have a greater effect on those who will retire in the future. This finding appears to be supported by the fact that the decline in the availability of employer-based coverage has not resulted in as large an increase in early retirees without private health insurance.", "Though employer surveys demonstrate that fewer firms are offering retiree health coverage, they provide limited evidence as to how changes in the terms under which such benefits are proffered affect their affordability for both current and future retirees. The sketchy evidence available does suggest that retirees are being asked to contribute a larger share of the premium than active employees. If past trends are a reliable indicator, increased cost sharing may suppress the demand for retiree health benefits even though some firms continue to make them available. The erosion in retiree health coverage has persisted, despite a turnaround in two trends that had contributed to the decline\u2014the abatement in health care inflation and the reemergence of a strong, internationally competitive economy.

According to Rappaport and Malone, however, retiree health coverage evolved more as an afterthought to pension benefits\u2014a way to ease the transition from employment to retirement. Health insurance was generally considered a goodwill gesture and an inexpensive addition to the total retirement package. Eligibility was usually based on pension plan eligibility, regardless of the retiree\u2019s age or years of service. And many employers paid the full premium for retiree health coverage because of its reasonable cost at the time and the difficulty of collecting premiums from retirees.", "Medicare, created in 1965, spurred the general expansion of retiree health coverage by making it much less expensive for employers to offer to help meet retiree health care needs. Most employers that provided retiree health coverage did so on a lifetime basis. The trend, especially for firms with labor unions, was to continuously improve retiree health benefits. With relatively few retirees, comparatively small health benefit costs, and a philosophy that American manufacturing would continue to dominate world markets, employers rarely even measured or voiced concern about the cost of retiree medical benefits.", "This situation began to change during the 1980s. A coincidence of factors and trends gave rise to attempts by some employers to modify or even eliminate retiree health benefits, including (1) sharply rising medical costs, (2) heightened foreign competition, (3) corporate takeovers, (4) the declining bargaining power of labor, and (5) a change in accounting standards. This last factor is often cited as a major contributor to the decline in employer-based retiree health coverage. In 1993, after over a decade of discussion, large employers were required to report annually on the liability represented by the promise to provide retiree health benefits to current and future retirees. The new accounting standard, commonly referred to as FAS 106, does not require that employers set aside funds to pay for these future costs and thus it does not affect their cash flow.There was concern, however, that these liabilities would affect companies\u2019 stock prices. Since employers typically cover retiree health costs as they are incurred, this liability is largely unfunded. The estimated liability in 1988 of between $221 billion and $332 billion was staggering and is widely viewed as having served as a wake-up call to employers about the magnitude of their future obligations.

The report compares data collected on retiree health coverage from special supplements to the August 1988 and September 1994 CPSs.

Only 34 percent still retained coverage several years after retirement. The decline in participation during retirement has several explanations. First, some individuals elect COBRA at retirement because no retiree coverage is offered. Such coverage, however, is only temporary\u2014generally 18 months for a worker leaving a job. Second, as figure 3.1 shows, firms are less likely to offer coverage to individuals who are Medicare-eligible than to early retirees. Thus, some retirees may have lost employer-based coverage when they reached age 65. Third, some individuals qualify for Medicare before age 65 because of a disability. Fourth, some retirees have access to health insurance through a spouse\u2019s employer. Fifth, some employers may have unexpectedly stopped offering coverage to retirees after an individual retired.

The decrease in the proportion of early retirees with private health insurance does not appear to correspond to the magnitude of the decline in the availability of retiree coverage documented in employer surveys and in the 1988 and 1994 CPS supplements. Among the possible reasons for the mismatch between availability and coverage trends are that (1) the decision to retire is often predicated on the availability of health benefits; (2) coverage may be available through other sources, such as a working or retired spouse; (3) employers\u2019 decisions not to offer retiree health benefits are frequently directed at future rather than current retirees; and (4) individuals may have postponed their retirement plans to avoid becoming uninsured or because of the high costs of purchasing individual insurance or COBRA continuation coverage.

The information available on these terminations, primarily in the form of newspaper articles and information on lawsuits brought by affected retirees, is often anecdotal rather than systematic.

Though the reaction of some employers was to discontinue or to not offer retiree coverage, those that still provide such benefits have often changed the terms under which they are offered. The objective, as with a similar restructuring of active workers\u2019 benefits, was to help control costs. Three commonly cited changes involve increasing cost sharing, changing eligibility requirements, and reshaping plan choice.

Today, virtually all employers have done so. Often, older groups of retirees were grandfathered into existing, more generous, health plans and changes were only applicable to new hires or individuals who retired after a certain date.

Thus, some retirees who find coverage from their own employer too expensive may be switching to plans with lower cost sharing available through a working or retired spouse."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Shift to a Defined Contribution", "paragraphs": ["Traditionally, employer-based health benefits have been an open-ended commitment by employers to pay for covered medical services. The liability represented by such a commitment as well as the escalating costs of medical services over time has stimulated employers to look for ways to limit their financial obligation, or at least to make it more predictable. The shift toward capitated health plans represents one approach. Another technique is for an employer to translate the benefit offered into a cash value either by instituting an aggregate cap on expenditures or by offering retirees a fixed cash benefit. Such an approach is often referred to as a defined contribution. Though several surveys\u2014notably Hewitt (1997) and Mercer (1992)\u2014have addressed the issue of employer caps, others such as Foster Higgins and Peat Marwick have limited data on this phenomenon.The following Hewitt data must be considered with the recognition that it is largely based on information from clients and as a result may overstate the prevalence of employer dollar caps.", "According to Hewitt, employers began to introduce dollar caps on their future retiree health obligations in the early 1990s, largely in response to new accounting rules that require them to report the accrued obligation for retiree health benefits. Few large employers had such caps in 1991, but by 1996, 36 percent had some form of dollar cap on their subsidy for early retirees, and 39 percent had caps for post-age-65 retiree coverage. Hewitt reports that the caps can take many forms, including caps on total costs: the company will not spend more in total for retiree health coverage than twice what was spent as of a certain date; per capita caps: the subsidy per person will not exceed a fixed amount; caps with service component: the employer share is fixed at a specified dollar amount that is then multiplied by years of service.", "Hewitt suggests that many employer caps on retiree health expenditures are fixed dollar caps without a built-in adjustment for inflation. Since a fixed-dollar cap dramatically reduces a firm\u2019s liability for retiree coverage by shifting the responsibility for future cost increases to retirees, Hewitt believes that there will be significant pressure to revisit these expenditure limits in the future. However, if the caps are not adjusted, retirees will shoulder any future cost increases. Hewitt emphasized that the dollar caps introduced since 1991 are largely intended to control \u201caccounting costs\u201d for purposes of FAS 106.", "A variation on an expenditure cap is a maximum lifetime benefit. In 1994, Peat Marwick reported that some employers had more restrictive maximum lifetime benefits for their retiree population. Thus, compared with 57 percent of active workers, only 47 percent of retirees have no maximum lifetime benefit or one that is equivalent to $1 million or more. On the other hand, Peat Marwick also reported that retiree lifetime limits were increased for 38 percent of retirees in 1993, with only 2 percent of retirees receiving a decrease."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Eligibility Requirements Have Been Tightened", "paragraphs": ["Employers have used changes in participation rules to reduce their liability for retiree health coverage and to differentiate their treatment of workers with varying lengths of service. While the cost implications of these new eligibility rules are clear for employers, their impact on the affordability of coverage is less so. Moreover, changes in labor force mobility could result in fewer active workers ever qualifying for a benefit that is, at the same time, becoming less widely available.", "In the past, retiree health coverage was treated as a benefit that accrued at retirement. Under those eligibility rules, workers with only a few years of service and those with many years were often treated equally. Because retirement was the only test, the responsibility and cost of a retiree\u2019s health care were borne fully by the last employer. More recently, employers have modified their eligibility requirements by tying them to years of service. The three most common methods employers use to determine eligibility for retiree health benefits are (1) length of service, (2) age, or (3) some combination of the two. Peat Marwick has reported that the proportion of retirees enrolled in plans with both a minimum service and age requirement increased from 56 to 79 percent between 1992 and 1997. In 1996, Foster Higgins reported that the most common service and age requirements were 10 years and 55 years old, respectively. When the requirement is the sum of age and service, Foster Higgins indicated that firms commonly require 75 \u201cpoints.\u201d For example, an individual at age 55 with 20 years of service would receive 75 points.", "More stringent eligibility requirements have potentially serious implications for future retirees. First, if workers change jobs frequently, especially as they become older, they may not qualify for retiree health benefits at all. In 1994, 2 percent of workers (over 100,000 individuals) who did not continue employer-based coverage into retirement reported that they failed to meet either the age or the service requirement or some other prerequisite. Second, full health benefits may not accrue at retirement. Thus, some employers tie cost sharing to years of service. For example, an official we interviewed at one company said the company requires 35 years of service to qualify for the maximum employer contribution\u201475 percent. Retirees with only 19 years of service qualify for a substantially lower employer contribution\u201430 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Jump in Early Retiree Enrollment in Managed Care", "paragraphs": ["Many large employers adopted a managed care strategy in the late 1980s to help combat double-digit health care inflation. Thus, between 1987 and 1996 managed care enrollment in employer-sponsored health plans nearly tripled, from 27 percent to 75 percent, and has continued to grow. Until more recently, elderly Americans have lagged behind younger age groups in the extent to which they are enrolled in managed care, but this situation appears to be changing rapidly, especially in the case of early retirees. It is not clear what is accelerating the move of early retirees into managed care. Cost sharing and lack of choice may both be contributing, but we do not know how much.", "In 1996, Foster Higgins reported that the movement of retirees into managed care is helping to slow down the overall growth in employers\u2019 health insurance costs. By 1996, over half of covered early retirees were enrolled in a managed care plan\u2014either a preferred provider organization (PPO), a point-of-service (POS) plan, or an HMO. Only 1 year later, managed care enrollment had grown to 70 percent, largely because of the increase in the number of early retirees joining HMOs. Foster Higgins attributed decreased costs for early retirees of 4.3 percent in 1997 to the jump in HMO enrollment. Table 3.8 compares early retiree health plan enrollment for 1996 and 1997 with that of active workers. According to Foster Higgins, the transition of early retirees into managed care plans has been even more rapid than the earlier shift by active workers.", "It is not obvious what is motivating early retirees to move so quickly into managed care plans such as HMOs. Clearly, the fact that employers have reserved the right to make changes to early retiree health benefits has increased employers\u2019 flexibility, allowing them to manage the cost of those benefits much as they do for active workers. Moreover, some large employers no longer view early retirees as an extension of their active employee population but recognize that the per capita costs of early retirees make them the most expensive component of their overall health benefit costs.", "In the case of active workers, employers recognized that financial incentives could be an important tool in encouraging managed care enrollment. Thus, in a 1997 report, we noted that some large employers now vary their subsidy according to the cost of the coverage option, making it cheaper for a worker to enroll in a managed care plan.Interviews with a sample of large employers suggest that some firms are applying this same technique to early retirees. Thus, in one industry, early retirees are now in a separate risk pool, with premiums 30 to 40 percent higher than for active workers. These higher costs are passed on through the cost-sharing formula to early retirees who choose a non-HMO product. However, for an early retiree who selects a community-rated HMO, the cost is the same as that for an active employee."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Individual Insurance: Unaffordable or Unavailable Alternative for Many Near Elderly", "paragraphs": ["As a growing number of employers reduce or eliminate their support for retiree health benefits by scaling back premium contributions or increasing cost sharing, many affected retirees look to the individual market for coverage until they become eligible for Medicare.

For example, for non-HMO plans offered by medium and large employers, annual deductibles are most commonly between $100 and $300, and a significant percentage have no deductible. In contrast, annual deductibles in the individual market are commonly between $250 and $2,500.", "The cost-sharing arrangement selected by the consumer is a key determinant of the price of an individual insurance product, and the higher the potential for out-of-pocket expenses, the lower the premium. In November 1996, we reported that carrier and insurance department representatives thought that the level of consumer cost sharing had been increasing in recent years, reflecting consumers\u2019 efforts to keep premiums affordable. A representative of one national carrier said that among its new enrollees in 1995, 40 percent chose $500 deductibles, 50 percent chose $1,000 deductibles, and the remaining 10 percent chose deductibles ranging from $2,500 to $10,000. Also, individual market reforms enacted in New Jersey originally limited carriers to offering only standard plans with deductibles of $150, $250, $500, or $1,000 and with prescribed ranges of cost-sharing options. An insurance department official said that because consumers showed little interest in the lower-deductible plans, New Jersey no longer offers the $150 and $250 deductible options for new individual insurance applicants. Instead, beginning on September 1, 1997, the state offers deductibles of $1,500, $2,250, $2,500, $3,000 and $4,500 in addition to the original $500 and $1,000 deductible options.

For example, on the basis of past experience, carriers anticipate that the likelihood of requiring medical care increases with age. Consequently, a 57-year-old in the individual markets of most states pays more than a 30-year-old for the same coverage. In the group market, however, this older individual would usually pay the same amount as the other members of the group, regardless of the individual\u2019s age.", "Table 4.1 demonstrates for selected carriers the range in premiums charged in the individual markets of four states to applicants based solely on differences in their ages.

This process is called medical underwriting.", "A carrier may deny coverage to applicants determined to be in poorer health and more likely to incur high medical costs. Individuals with serious health conditions such as heart disease are virtually always denied coverage. Similarly, those with such non-life-threatening conditions as chronic back pain and varicose veins may be denied coverage. The most recent declination rates for carriers with whom we spoke ranged from zero in states where guaranteed issue is required to about 23 percent. Carriers in those states that do not prohibit medical underwriting typically deny coverage to about 15 percent of all applicants.", "These declination rates could be understated for two reasons. First, the rates do not take into account carriers who attach riders to policies to exclude certain health conditions or carriers that charge unhealthy applicants a higher, nonstandard rate for the same coverage. Thus, although a carrier may have a low declination rate, it may attach such riders and charge higher, nonstandard premiums to a substantial number of applicants. For example, while one carrier with whom we spoke declines only about 15 percent of all individual applicants, it attaches exclusionary waivers to the policies of 38 percent of the non-HMO applicants it accepts. Thus, persons with chronic back pain, glaucoma, or diabetes may have all costs associated with the treatment of those conditions excluded from coverage. Insurance agents are also generally aware of which carriers medically underwrite and have a sense as to whether applicants will be accepted or denied coverage. Consequently, they will often deter individuals with certain health conditions from applying for coverage from certain carriers. When this occurs, the declination rate is not an accurate indicator of the proportion of potential applicants who are ineligible for coverage.", "The ability of carriers in some states to underwrite applicants may have the most adverse effects on those aged 55 to 64. Because of the existence of certain health conditions, many of these individuals have retired or work only part time, and consequently, may have fewer resources with which to purchase insurance. For these individuals, carriers\u2019 underwriting practices may often result in premiums priced prohibitively high, or even worse, denial of coverage altogether."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Access to Individual Market Varies Among States, Affecting Near Elderly Differently", "paragraphs": ["As discussed, without state restrictions that prohibit the practice, carriers generally base premium rates on the demographic characteristics and health status of each applicant.

The baseline is the monthly premium charged to a healthy 25-year-old male.", "Because carriers anticipate that the likelihood of needing medical care increases with age, all carriers in the states listed except those that were prohibited by law from doing so charged higher premiums to older applicants. For example, an Arizona PPO plan costs a 25-year-old male $66 a month and a 64-year-old male $253 for the same coverage, a difference of $187. Similarly, a 64-year-old male would have paid $286 more than the 25-year-old male for a PPO product from one Illinois carrier. As the table indicates, all applicants in New Jersey, New York, and Vermont, regardless of age, would pay exactly the same amount for the same insurance coverage from the same carrier. The individual insurance reform legislation enacted in these states requires community rating, a system in which the cost of insuring an entire community is spread equally among all members of the community, regardless of their demographic characteristics or health status. Given the median income of the near elderly, rates in the individual market may pose an affordability problem to some. For example, the premiums for popular health insurance products in the individual markets of Colorado and Vermont are at least 10 percent and 8.4 percent, respectively, of the 1996 median family income of married near-elderly couples. Typically, Americans under age 65 spent about 4 percent of household income in 1994 on health care\u2014an amount that includes not only insurance premiums or employer-required cost sharing but also out-of-pocket expenses for copayments, deductibles, and services not covered by health insurance. (See app. V for a comparison of the affordability premiums in the individual market with cost sharing under employer-based coverage.)", "Without state restrictions, carriers will also evaluate the health status of each applicant to determine whether to charge an increase over the standard premium rate, to exclude a body part or existing health condition from coverage, or to deny the applicant coverage altogether. For example, while four of the carriers automatically deny coverage to an applicant with preexisting diabetes or exclude from coverage all costs associated with treating this condition, one carrier will accept the applicant but will charge him or her a significantly higher premium to cover the higher expected costs. Also, an applicant who had cancer within the past 3 years would almost always be denied coverage from all carriers we interviewed except those in the guaranteed-issue states of New Jersey, New York, and Vermont.", "In non-guaranteed-issue states, applicants who have a history of cancer or other chronic health conditions are likely to have a difficult time obtaining coverage. Since the near elderly are more likely to use medical services and develop such conditions as they grow older, they may have an even more difficult time accessing coverage in the individual markets of certain states. However, high-risk insurance pools have been created in a number of states and act as a safety net to ensure that otherwise uninsurable individuals can obtain coverage, although at a cost that is generally 125 to 200 percent of the average or standard rate charged in the individual insurance market for a comparable plan. Although the near elderly in Colorado, Illinois, and North Dakota who are denied coverage from one or more carriers may obtain coverage through the high-risk pool, they may be required to pay $316 to $638 more each month for this coverage.

First, similar to COBRA, some states extend continuation requirements to groups of fewer than 20, and several states require carriers to offer individuals a product comparable to their group coverage on a guaranteed-issue basis. HIPAA further guarantees access to individual market coverage for eligible individuals leaving group health plans. This group-to-individual portability is only available to eligible individuals who have exhausted their available COBRA or other conversion coverage and who meet several other eligibility criteria.

To limit adverse selection, carriers in most states do not have to accept individuals who are eligible for employer or government-sponsored insurance, and in some states carriers are only required to accept applicants during a specified, and usually limited, open enrollment period.", "Twenty of the states that have passed some reform in the individual market included a provision in their legislation that attempts in some way to limit the amount carriers can vary premium rates or the characteristics they may use to vary these rates. This number represents an increase of 2 states (Massachusetts and South Dakota) from the 18 we previously had identified. Most of these states allow carriers to vary, or modify, premium rates charged to individuals within a specified range according to differences in certain demographic characteristics such as age, gender, industry (type of employment), geographic area, and use of tobacco. For example, while New Hampshire only allowed carriers to modify rates on the basis of age, South Carolina allowed carriers to use differences in age, gender, geographic area, industry, use of tobacco, occupational or avocational factors, and any additional characteristics not explicitly specified, to set premium rates. Most of the 20 states, however, limit the range over which carriers may vary rates among individual consumers. In fact, at least three of these states require carriers to community-rate their individual products, with limited or no exceptions.

Similar to the experience of non-HIPAA-eligibles who rely on the individual market for coverage, carriers in the federal fallback states typically evaluate the health status of applicants and offer healthier HIPAA-eligibles access to standard products. Although these products may include a preexisting condition exclusion period, they may cost considerably less than the HIPAA product and will likely attract the healthier individuals. Unhealthy HIPAA-eligibles in these states may have access to only the guaranteed access product, and some may be charged an even higher premium on the basis of their health status. However, a similarly situated individual who was not eligible for a HIPAA product may still be denied coverage or have certain conditions excluded from coverage. So, while an early retiree whose employer eliminated coverage would typically be eligible for one of these guaranteed access products, no similar guarantees of access to coverage exist for those who historically have relied on the individual market as their sole source of coverage.

Although the mandate does not oblige firms to share in the cost of continuation coverage\u2014a major difference from most employer-based health benefits, which are commonly heavily subsidized\u2014employers contend that there is an implicit subsidy because sicker, more costly individuals are likely to elect COBRA.", "Categories of the near elderly who might potentially benefit from continuation coverage include those who (1) are laid off, (2) experience a cutback in hours that makes them ineligible for health benefits, (3) retire, or (4) are younger spouses of individuals who become eligible for Medicare and thus relinquish employer-based health insurance for their entire family. An attractive feature of COBRA for the near elderly is its ability to temporarily fill the gap in coverage that exists when an employer provides health benefits to active workers but not to retirees. Moreover, COBRA may be used as a bridge to Medicare by individuals who coordinate their retirement age with the eligibility period.", "Because the employer is not required to pay any portion of the premium, COBRA may be an expensive alternative for the near elderly\u2014especially since the loss in employer-based coverage is probably accompanied by a decrease in earnings. The limited information available on eligibility for and use of COBRA by Americans in general and the near elderly in particular is based on past experience and may not reflect incentives to elect and exhaust continuation coverage created by the implementation of HIPAA. Moreover, the information leaves many important questions unanswered. In general, the near elderly appear to be more likely to elect COBRA than younger age groups. Analysis of two studies that examined data from special CPS supplements suggests that COBRA use by the near elderly in 1988 and 1994 was relatively small compared with the size of this age group. On the one hand, these estimates represent the lower boundary of COBRA use by the near elderly since neither includes both retired and nonretired 55- to 64-year-olds. On the other hand, both may overestimate the use of continuation insurance, since employers have told us that some individuals only elect COBRA to receive dental or vision coverage\u2014benefits that are not always offered to those with access to employer-based retiree health insurance. A proprietary database whose results cannot be generalized to the whole population suggests that, on average, 61- to 64-year-olds only keep continuation coverage for a year. Finally, although there is a strong rationale for those near elderly who lack an alternative source of coverage and who can afford the premium to elect COBRA, there is no systematically collected evidence on the extent to which such elections affect employer costs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Terms and Conditions of COBRA Coverage", "paragraphs": ["The terms and conditions of COBRA eligibility are complex, in part because of (1) its broad scope, (2) the fact that it addresses coverage for individuals and families whose connection to an employer has been broken, and (3) the protections for enrollees built into the election process.", "There are two broad categories of qualifying events under COBRA, with the coverage period linked to the type of event:", "Work-related.

However, in the case of separation or reduction in hours as a result of a disability, coverage can be extended for an additional 11 months if the disability is determined under the Social Security Act and existed during the first 60 days of COBRA coverage. The cost for those additional 11 months rises from 102 percent to 150 percent of the applicable premium. Dependents are also eligible for the full 29 months of coverage. For those who qualify on the basis of family events, coverage is available for up to 36 months. Finally, in the case of multiple qualifying events, coverage is limited to 36 months.", "Three factors make COBRA administration complex for firms: the lack of personnel departments at smaller firms, the detachment of enrollees from the active workforce, and the election time frames and notification requirements. COBRA eligibility rules must be implemented not only by large firms with established personnel and benefit staffs but also by small businesses where benefit management may be an ancillary duty. Further complicating administration of COBRA is the fact that firms must create systems and procedures for individuals who are no longer on their payroll and who may be more difficult to contact than an employee who reports for work. For example, payroll deductions, the typical means of collecting an employee\u2019s share of the health insurance premium, are not an option for a former worker. Finally, the terms under which an employer must proffer continuation coverage add to the administrative burden. The employer has 14 days to notify individuals that they qualify for COBRA. After notification of eligibility, an individual has 60 days to elect coverage and 45 days to make a retroactive payment for covered health services\u2014benefits that may actually have already been accessed by the enrollee 4 months earlier. As discussed in the following section, some employers are concerned that these election time frames contribute to adverse selection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Evidence on Use of COBRA by the Near Elderly", "paragraphs": ["More than 10 years after the establishment of continuation coverage on a nationwide basis, there is a dearth of systematically collected data on (1) how many individuals are eligible, (2) how many enroll, (3) the demographic characteristics of those who elect coverage, or (4) the average health care costs of COBRA enrollees. Since eligibility is not conditioned on age, the handful of studies on COBRA often examine its use in general rather than focusing on the near elderly. Information from CobraServe, a third-party COBRA administrator, provides insights on the election rates of retirees who become eligible for COBRA compared with younger age groups, but the data are not nationally representative. The only nationally representative data on the use of COBRA by the near elderly are special supplements to the CPS conducted in 1988 and again in 1994.However, because they used different methodologies, the two studies based on these data only provide a rough estimate of COBRA use by 55- to 64-year-olds.", "According to the CobraServe data, the near elderly appear to be more likely than other age groups to elect COBRA, but the number doing so is relatively small. About 10 percent of the over one-half million workers in the database became eligible for COBRA between October 1, 1990, and September 30, 1991, and approximately 21 percent enrolled. We presumed enrollees to be near elderly if they elected coverage at retirement or when a spouse became eligible for Medicare. Using these assumptions, approximately 1,600 of the 12,536 enrollees were near elderly. The election rates of the near elderly were high\u201433 percent for retirees and 60 percent for spouses of those who became eligible for Medicare. However, the actual number of near-elderly enrollees was small. For example, only 196 individuals elected COBRA because a spouse became eligible for Medicare. Overall, the election rate of those aged 61 and older was 38 percent, while the election rate for those under age 40 was 17 percent. In addition, the length of the enrollment period was higher for older individuals from 1987 to 1991. The 61- to 64-year-olds used COBRA for an average of 12 months\u20144 months longer than those aged 41 to 60. Only 11 percent of all beneficiaries remained enrolled for the full 18 to 36 months allowed. Several hypotheses can be offered for the higher election rates by older, compared with younger, individuals. First, the near elderly may be more willing to sacrifice current income to pay the insurance premium, given their greater medical needs. Second, younger workers may have access to health insurance through another family member. Finally, the longer election rates by older individuals suggest that they are less likely than younger Americans to obtain other employment.", "Analysis of two studies that examined data from special CPS supplements suggests that COBRA use by the near elderly in 1988 and 1994 was relatively small compared with the size of this age group.

Even though the enrollee typically pays the full premium plus an administrative surcharge, employers contend that there is an implicit subsidy in continuation coverage because enrollee costs typically exceed that premium, raising average costs per enrollee. Notwithstanding the concern about higher costs as a result of the COBRA mandate, few employers appear to collect data to substantiate their concerns. Some employers told us that they believe such efforts would be fruitless because COBRA is unlikely to change\u2014in fact, legislative interest appears to be focused on COBRA expansions. And employers point out that demonstrating adverse selection is made all the more difficult by the enrollment growth in capitated health plans, which often lack the claims data necessary to compute average costs for those who elect COBRA.", "Logic suggests that adverse risk selection, a well-recognized factor in the individual insurance market, may be encouraged by the terms and conditions established for continuation coverage. At the same time, the fact that risk-averse individuals may elect coverage is also relevant to predicting employer costs. The election of COBRA coverage by the near elderly in the absence of other insurance alternatives may, in some instances, reflect an antipathy to living without health insurance, given their greater risk of illness. Since COBRA election is associated with turnover, the demographics of a firm or industry will also have a significant impact on COBRA costs. Taking all these factors into consideration, some analysts have suggested that it is not possible to predict whether COBRA will lead to higher or lower net costs for an employer. The limited quantitative data available tend to highlight the random nature of the high costs often attributed to COBRA."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cost Calculus for a COBRA Enrollee", "paragraphs": ["COBRA is an adjunct to employer-based group coverage, but its incentive structure may have more in common with the operation of the individual insurance market. Table 5.1 compares the characteristics of group and individual coverage. While the purchase of an individual health insurance policy is purely voluntary, coverage in the group market is tied to employment. Group insurance rates are often considerably lower than rates in the individual market where, absent state reforms prohibiting the practice, premiums usually reflect the demographic and health characteristics of the purchaser. In contrast to individual rates, employer-based costs typically reflect the experience of the entire group. Thus, there is an inverse relationship between group size and the impact of employees with high health care costs: the larger the group, the smaller the impact (see table 5.2). From the perspective of individuals contemplating the purchase of continuation coverage, the absence of an employer subsidy places COBRA on a par with individual insurance: it is similarly expensive but cheaper than individual coverage because COBRA permits enrollees to maintain the group rate. In summary, the high cost and voluntary nature of COBRA suggest that individuals will go through a personal calculus in deciding whether to elect coverage: Individuals whose expected medical expenses exceed the premium are more likely to elect continuation coverage.", "Some evidence suggests, however, that factors other than expected medical expenses play a role in who elects COBRA. Thus, some individuals may be risk-averse and willing to pay the high cost of continuation coverage. The near elderly might well be expected to fall into this category. Anecdotal evidence from employers suggests that parents whose children lose dependent child status may also be risk-averse. The health benefit manager at one large company told us that the firm\u2019s well-educated employees understand the value of health benefits, the randomness of catastrophic illness, and the financial consequences of being uninsured. Many of the firm\u2019s COBRA elections are young adults who lose health benefits under their parents\u2019 company policy when they graduate from college. The benefit manager at another firm told us that the COBRA premiums for her son who had just graduated from college were very high but that the financial risk of going without coverage was more worrisome to her than the cost. The CobraServe database referenced earlier indicates that election rates for loss of dependent child status are as high as those for retirees.", "COBRA election is also influenced by affordability considerations. Since COBRA does not require employers to subsidize the premium, the enrollee is generally responsible for paying the full cost of coverage. For 1997, Mercer/Foster Higgins reported that, on average, the total annual premium for employer-based coverage for an active employee was $3,820. This average cost would represent an enormous increase in out-of-pocket costs for a COBRA enrollee, considering that large employers typically contribute 70 to 80 percent of the premium for active workers. However, aggregate premium data hide the considerable variation in health benefit costs across firms and thus the potential expense to COBRA enrollees. Firm size, benefit structure, locale, and aggressiveness in negotiating rates all affect a company\u2019s health care premiums.", "At one large, New England-based firm that does not negotiate with health plans but rather accepts a community rate for HMO coverage, we were told that the full premium for family coverage was approximately $5,000 per year; in contrast, the company\u2019s indemnity plan would cost a COBRA enrollee about $12,000 annually. According to the firm\u2019s benefit manager, an individual enrolled in the indemnity plan who became eligible to elect COBRA would not be allowed to select the less expensive HMO option until the next annual open enrollment period. The full premium for family coverage for retiree health plans offered by the Milwaukee-based Pabst Brewing Company ranged from about $5,646 to $7,933 per year. In 1996, Pabst terminated health benefits for 750 early retirees. Since Pabst had paid the total cost of practically all of the health plans it offered to retired workers, the COBRA cost would have come as a rude awakening to affected retirees. Assuming an obligation for such high premiums occurs at a time when individuals eligible for COBRA are undergoing a transition\u2014a transition that may be associated with a reduction in family income. As a result, Marquis and Long hypothesized that COBRA participation will rise with age because of higher liquid assets and because of the need to protect those assets from potentially high health expenditures.", "Since the cost of COBRA coverage is associated with a particular firm, the demographic profile of a company will affect both its average health care expenditures and the costs associated with COBRA. Thus, a firm with an older workforce that does not offer retiree health benefits or a company with a large number of women in their childbearing years might expect to incur higher expenditures than a firm consisting of young, healthy males.", "And the number of COBRA enrollees who actually do become pregnant or suffer from an expensive illness associated with old age will raise an employer\u2019s average health insurance costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Quantitative Data Highlight Randomness of Average COBRA Costs", "paragraphs": ["There are only limited quantitative data on adverse selection attributable to COBRA. Though this evidence suggests that COBRA enrollees are on average more expensive than active employees, it is insufficient support for a generalizable conclusion. Instead, the evidence tends to underscore the randomness of high-cost cases at a particular firm and the relationship between the demographics of a firm and the number of high-cost cases they experience.", "Marquis and Long analyzed the cost of individuals who elected continuation coverage at three different firms. Their study found that costs for COBRA enrollees were higher than for active employees in all three plans by amounts ranging from 32 to 224 percent. Adjusting these costs for the demographic characteristics of participants, however, shows that health risk is not always higher among COBRA enrollees. Thus, in one of the firms, the higher cost of COBRA continuation coverage was entirely attributable to demographic differences, especially the much higher proportion of women among enrollees. Adjusting for those differences, COBRA enrollees actually had somewhat lower levels of health care spending than active workers. At a second firm, demographic differences, including the older age of COBRA enrollees, did not explain the higher costs, indicating that those on continuation coverage were indeed poorer health risks than the company\u2019s active employees.", "In addition, Spencer, a Chicago-based benefit consulting firm, has conducted a survey of COBRA costs and experience among a small sample of firms since 1989. Unlike the Marquis and Long analysis, Spencer does not attempt to distinguish between the impact of health risk and demographics on firms\u2019 costs. Among its limitations, the survey sample is not random and only about 5 percent of firms contacted responded to the questionnaire. The respondents include a mix of small, medium, and large companies with no apparent oversampling of smaller firms, whose size would magnify the impact of adverse selection on their future premiums. Of the limited number of questionnaires returned in 1997 (191), fewer than one-half were able to supply cost data, and six very large employers represented 71 percent of the total COBRA elections. The survey has consistently shown that (1) costs vary radically and unpredictably among employers; and (2) overall, the costs of COBRA enrollees are higher than those of active workers. Since 1991, average COBRA costs have hovered at about 150 percent of active employee costs. The official responsible for the survey told us that he is constantly struck by the randomness of an individual firm\u2019s experience from year to year. Thus, a firm could have 10 COBRA elections during a year and no claims, or one election and $150,000 in associated medical expenditures. In 1997, about 25 percent of respondents reported that COBRA costs were lower than for active workers, while 75 percent reported that COBRA costs were higher."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Observations", "paragraphs": ["Forecasting the insurance status of future generations of near elderly is inherently risky. Since it is not entirely clear why employers are continuing to reassess their commitment to retiree health insurance, it is possible that unforeseen developments will halt or even reverse the erosion that has occurred over the past decade. Among potential scenarios that could affect the incentives for both employers and near-elderly individuals are (1) a tightening of labor markets as a result of having a smaller active labor force or a low unemployment rate, (2) changes in the tax treatment of retirement income, and (3) a postponement of retirement because of insufficient postretirement income.", "In addition to events that could affect the erosion in employer-based retiree coverage, use of the HIPAA guaranteed-access provision by eligible individuals may improve entry into the individual market for those with preexisting health conditions who lack an alternative way to obtain a comprehensive benefits package. Depending on the manner in which each state has chosen to implement HIPAA, however, cost may remain an impediment to such entry. Since group-to-individual portability is only available to qualified individuals who exhaust available COBRA or other conversion coverage, HIPAA may lead to an increased use of employer-based continuation insurance. Moreover, additional state reforms of the individual market may improve access and affordability for those who have never had group coverage or who fail to qualify for portability under HIPAA rules.", "Despite the possibility of countervailing trends, however, the evidence available today suggests that future generations of retirees are less likely to be offered health benefits when they leave the active workforce. With the number of 55- to 64-year-olds estimated to grow from 8 percent of the population today to 13 percent by 2020, the impact, in the absence of affordable and accessible alternatives, could lead to an increase in the number of uninsured near-elderly Americans. At the same time, the evidence also suggests that those with continued access to employer-based retiree health coverage will shoulder more\u2014in some instances significantly more\u2014of the financial burden. Compared with premiums in the individual market, the typical cost-sharing requirements faced by retirees with employer-based coverage today do not appear to be greatly out of line with those faced by active employees. However, cost-sharing policies being implemented by some firms could eventually create affordability problems for those who retain access to employer-based coverage. If more firms base their financial contribution to retiree coverage on years of service, workers who change jobs frequently throughout their careers may find the employer subsidy small in relation to the overall premium. Some experts suggest that the traditional employer-employee contract has already been fundamentally altered, with both parties less likely to view the work contract as a lifelong arrangement.", "A major unknown that could also affect the continued commitment of employers to retiree coverage is the federal government\u2019s response to the Medicare financing problem\u2014a dilemma created by the imminent retirement of the baby-boom generation. Experts are divided about the impact on employer-based coverage of actions that shift costs to the private sector, such as increasing the eligibility age for Medicare.

The voluntary nature of these employer-based benefits as well as the manner in which coverage is funded has important regulatory implications.

In fact, an employer\u2019s freedom to modify the conditions of coverage or to terminate benefits is a defining characteristic of America\u2019s voluntary, employer-based system of health insurance. Moreover, employer-based health benefits are typically funded on a pay-as-you-go basis. In contrast, the sheer magnitude of accumulated employer-employee contributions to retirement funds demonstrates the importance of greater regulation of pension benefits. Thus, ERISA not only requires employers to fund their pension plans but gives employees vested rights upon meeting certain service requirements. Health benefits, on the other hand, are excluded from such funding and vesting requirements.", "Although ERISA was passed in response to concerns about the solvency and security of pension plans, some of its provisions, including federal preemption of state regulations, also apply to employer-sponsored health coverage. The preemption effectively blocks states from directly regulating most employer-based health plans, while allowing states to oversee the operation of health insurers.

For the age groups reported in our study, these ratios ranged from 0.855 to 0.998. The response rate for the CPS is an overall measure of the extent to which houses and persons selected for the sample are actually represented in the sample of respondents. For the March 1997 CPS, the response rate was about 90 percent. This response rate is reasonable and somewhat higher than for most of the other surveys.", "A major difference between the CPS March supplement and surveys such as SIPP and HRS is that the latter are designed to follow a group of respondents (often referred to as a \u201cpanel\u201d of individuals) over a period of time\u20142-1/2 to 4 years for the SIPP and 10 to 12 years for HRS\u2014while the CPS is primarily designed to be cross-sectional, largely focusing on the 12 months preceding the interview. As a result, we did not use the CPS to directly measure how the health, income, and insurance status of individuals or groups change over time. To better understand the estimates we reported in chapter 2, it is important to be aware of how some of the CPS questions are worded and the responses categorized. The following explains four categories of questions.", "Insurance Status. The CPS questions that we used to determine insurance status ask whether respondents were covered through various sources of insurance (for example, employer-based, individual, and Medicare). However, they do not ask for the length of coverage or whether the individual was covered through these sources at the time of the interview. Thus, the results of these questions overestimate the size of the insured population because respondents are considered insured for the entire year if they were insured at all during the preceding 12-month period\u2014regardless of their insurance status at the time of the interview or the length of time they were insured. Conversely, the wording of these questions produces an underestimate of the uninsured population because, regardless of their insurance status at the time of the interview, a respondent must have been uninsured for the entire year to be categorized as uninsured.", "Some people may receive coverage from several sources. To avoid double counting, we prioritized the source of coverage reported by the CPS. For our analysis, employment-based coverage was considered primary to other sources of coverage, and respondents were classified as having employment-based coverage even if they also had other types of coverage. The other types of health insurance coverage were prioritized in the following order: Medicare, Medicaid, military/veterans, and individual insurance. Also, with respect to coverage through the individual insurance market, the CPS questionnaire does not distinguish between comprehensive and more limited policies that are available.", "Employment Status. The CPS questions that we used for employment status are similar to those on insurance status. Specifically, respondents are considered employed if they worked at all in the year, and not employed only if they did not work at all during the past 12 months. As a result, these questions overestimate the employed population and underestimate the number who did not work.", "Health Status. The CPS asks respondents to categorize their health as excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor. The question is worded in the present tense and implies an answer relating to the respondent\u2019s health at the time of the interview. In our analysis, however, we correlated health status with other characteristics such as employment and insurance status, which, as noted, had a different temporal context. In general, poor health equated to a weakened workforce attachment and to an increased likelihood of having public coverage or being uninsured. To the extent a respondent\u2019s health status at the time of the interview differed from that during the preceding 12 months, the relationship between the two variables is weakened. Consequently, when we report differences in employment or insurance status relative to health status, we are probably underestimating the extent to which the latter has affected these other characteristics.", "Income Status. The gross income data we report overstates the amount of disposable income available to nonelderly Americans because it does not take into account the taxes they must pay. On the other hand, income alone is an incomplete measure of wealth and the ability of individuals to afford individual market premiums or employer-imposed cost sharing. Although the inclusion of assets such as homes, investments, and savings would provide a more comprehensive measure of affordability, such data are not available through the CPS. Moreover, income comparisons between different age groups are complicated by differences in family size and financial obligations. For example, a married couple in their thirties with several children and a mortgage may earn more than a near-elderly couple whose children are grown and who own their home, but their financial obligations are clearly not comparable.

Moreover, rather than reporting the number of establishments that offer retiree coverage, the results are presented in terms of how many workers have access to retiree health benefits. In contrast to the firms and establishments surveyed by benefit consultants or BLS, the unit of analysis for the CPS supplements is individuals. These individuals were asked whether they continued employer-based coverage at retirement or later during retirement and to identify the reason they discontinued coverage. In 1994, \u201cretiree coverage not offered by employer\u201d was added to the list of reasons, but it was not used in the 1988 questionnaire.

It is not difficult to imagine an individual in poor health continuing to work to maintain access to employer-based benefits that are not available to retirees. Similarly, it appears that the near elderly would be averse to leaving the workforce without health benefits. But does the availability of coverage actually encourage retirement earlier than it might otherwise occur? Despite the limitations of most studies, they all agree that there is a positive correlation between access to health benefits and the retirement decision. However, they disagree, often substantially, on the extent of the impact, suggesting a need for additional empirical research.", "First, a 1993 study by Hurd and McGarry found that the availability of retiree health insurance at least partly funded by the employer reduced the probability that an individual would be working full time after age 62 by between 18 and 24 percent. In addition, a 1994 study by Karoly and Rogowski found that the availability of postretirement health benefits would increase the probability of men retiring early by 50 percent.However, their study may overestimate the effect because the availability of retiree health insurance was imputed, and the estimated retirement impact of health benefits may be highly correlated with retirement decisions for reasons other than health insurance, such as pension plan provisions. Third, using a life-cycle model of retirement that incorporates the value of retiree health benefits and also includes information on pension accruals, Gustman and Steinmeier found that employer-based coverage lowers male retirement age by about 1.3 months. The authors acknowledged that their methodology may tend to underestimate the effect of health benefits on retirement. Furthermore, a 1994 study by Madrian reported that individuals with access to health insurance retired between 5 and 16 months earlier than those lacking coverage and that the probability of retiring before age 65 was between 7 and 15 percentage points higher for individuals with retiree health insurance. Shortcomings of the study included (1) an inconclusive attempt to control for participation in a pension plan and (2) the fact that the results were based on the recollections of individuals who had been retired as long as 15 years and had to recall their pension and health insurance status at the time of retirement.", "Finally, a 1993 study by Gruber and Madrian focused on the early retirement impact of state and federal COBRA coverage. They found that continuation mandates have an effect on retirement among men aged 55 to 64. Specifically, 1 year of coverage raised the probability of being retired by 1.1 percentage point. However, they also reported that this additional year of coverage raises the probability of being insured by 6 percentage points, suggesting that many of these individuals would have retired in the absence of such coverage. Finally, contrary to basic intuition, the effects are not necessarily the strongest at older ages but decline with age."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Affordability of Health Insurance for the Near Elderly", "paragraphs": ["Using data from the March 1997 CPS and 1995 and 1996 information on insurance premiums, we estimated the percentage of median income that a 55- to 64-year-old would have to commit to health insurance under a number of possible scenarios, including purchasing coverage through the individual market in a community-rated state (Vermont) as well as one that had no restrictions on the premiums that could be charged (Colorado) using 1996 rates for a commonly purchased health insurance product and cost sharing under employer-based coverage using 1995 Peat Marwick estimates of the lowest, highest, and average retiree contribution.", "While no official affordability standard exists, research suggests that older Americans commit a much higher percentage of their income to health insurance than do younger age groups. Congressional Budget Office calculations based on data from the BLS Consumer Expenditure Survey indicate that between 1984 and 1994, spending by elderly Americans aged 65 and older on health care ranged from 10.2 percent to 12.9 percent of household income. In 1994, elderly Americans spent 11.2 percent of household income, about three times as much as younger age groups. These estimates include costs other than premiums or employer-imposed cost sharing\u2014for example, copayments, deductibles, and expenditures for medical services not covered by insurance.", "Table V.1 compares the cost of health insurance purchased in the individual market and employer-imposed cost sharing for early retirees with the median income of the near elderly in 1996.", "As demonstrated by table V.1, the near elderly\u2019s share of employer-subsidized coverage is generally lower than for coverage purchased through the individual market. For example, on average, employer-based family coverage for retirees at $2,340 annually represents 4.7 percent of median family income. In contrast, costs in the individual market can be significantly higher\u2014in part, because they lack an employer subsidy. In Colorado, the annual premium for a commonly purchased individual insurance product in 1996 was about $2,500 for single coverage and $5,000 for a couple\u2014representing about 12 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of median income for 55- to 64-year-olds. While less expensive than the Colorado example, premiums for health insurance through the individual market in Vermont\u2014a community-rated state\u2014would represent 9.9 percent of median income for single coverage and 8.4 percent of median income for a couple. For more than one-half of the near elderly, these individual market costs typically exceed average health care spending for Americans under age 65\u2014in some cases significantly. In April 1998, the Center for Studying Health System Change reported that older adults who purchased individual coverage typically spent a considerably higher proportion of their income on premiums than other adult age groups\u2014about 9 percent for the 60- to 64-year-old group."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expansions of COBRA Coverage", "paragraphs": ["Since 1986, COBRA eligibility has been expanded on a number of occasions:", "COBRA was made available to retirees whose former employer had declared bankruptcy (P.L. 99-509).", "Coverage was extended from 18 to 29 months for certain disabled COBRA enrollees (P.L. 101-239).
