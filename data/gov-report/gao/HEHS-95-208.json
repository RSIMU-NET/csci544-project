Foster care provides primarily food and housing to meet the physical needs of children who are removed from their homes. Child welfare services are designed to address the complex family problems associated with children\u2019s abuse, neglect, exploitation, or delinquency. In providing child welfare services, caseworkers may also refer children and their families to mental health agencies, medical facilities, or elsewhere for specialized treatment and services.", "Child welfare services are critical in helping prevent the need for foster care as well as in achieving appropriate and stable permanent living arrangements for children placed in foster care. Most states and counties provide some child welfare services directly and purchase others from private agencies. Available services vary considerably from one area to another in number, type, intensity, and duration, although calls and visits with caseworkers are considered essential in most areas.", "Children generally enter foster care for their own protection because their parents will not or cannot take care of them. When problems such as abuse or neglect are identified, the child welfare system may intervene with services designed to improve the situation and avoid removing children from their homes. If such services cannot ensure children\u2019s safety and well-being in their homes, the child welfare system petitions the court to place children in foster care, either in the homes of relatives or nonfamily foster parents, group homes, or institutions.", "Foster care provided by relatives, who are often grandmothers, is known as kinship care. States may choose whether to license relatives as foster parents and provide foster care payments. On the other hand, states require nonfamily foster parents to be licensed and pay them an average of $8 to $15 a day per child for food, housing, and incidental expenses. States also license group homes and institutions to provide care by paid staff. These homes receive an average of $100 a day per child for food, housing, and overhead expenses. Foster care is a temporary solution until children can be returned safely to their parents, adopted, or placed in some other permanent living arrangement; however, some children remain in foster care until their eligibility for foster care assistance expires, generally at age 18.", "Under federal law, states must provide foster care if they participate in Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC), the largest federal welfare program providing cash assistance to poor families. States receive federal matching funds for about half of all foster children because these children would have qualified for AFDC had they remained in their homes. For the other half, states and localities are the sole source of government support. In addition, states and localities supply the majority of government funds for child welfare services. Many states directly administer foster care and child welfare, but nearly one-third delegate this authority to their counties, including several states with the largest caseloads\u2014California, Pennsylvania, and New York.", "Two titles under the Social Security Act provide federal funding targeted specifically to foster care and related child welfare services. (See app. II.) Title IV-E provides an open-ended individual entitlement for foster care maintenance payments to cover a portion of the food, housing, and incidental expenses of children from AFDC-eligible families. Title IV-E also provides payments to adoptive parents of eligible minority foster children or others with special needs, such as health problems, that may make adoptive homes more difficult to find. Title IV-B provides limited or \u201ccapped\u201d funding for child welfare services to foster children as well as children remaining in their homes.", "In 1995, total IV-E funding was $3.6 billion and total IV-B funding was $453 million, representing about 97 percent of all federal funding targeted to child welfare and protection, including foster care. Another nine programs provided an additional $136 million in federal funds to states for activities designed to protect the safety and well-being of children.", "Under the Child Protection Block Grant passed by the House in 1995, foster care and the other child welfare programs would be replaced by a single block grant to states with capped funding. (See apps. III and IV.) In addition, proposals for an AFDC block grant would cap federal funding and repeal AFDC eligibility rules that currently enable states to claim IV-E foster care funds.

Most of the 1 million abused or neglected children remained in their homes. However, about 15 percent were considered in imminent danger and placed in foster care.

Not only are more minorities entering, but, once placed in foster care, African American and Hispanic children remain longer and leave at slower rates than whites. African American children, in particular, are disproportionately represented in foster care, as shown in figure 3, and, if the trend continues, caseloads may increasingly consist of minority children removed from their homes for prolonged stays in foster care.", "Also by 1990, the average median age of children in foster care had dropped from 12.6 to 8.6 years of age, as the percentage of preschoolers increased by 50 percent and the percentage of teens declined (see fig. 4).

An estimated 62 percent of the preschool-age foster children were at risk of serious health problems due to prenatal drug exposure, more than double the 29 percent at risk of such problems in 1986.", "Children with these complex needs require a variety of community-based services and a level of care not required in the past. A California study found that foster children were 10 times more likely to use mental health services than other children on Medicaid and that they were hospitalized for mental conditions almost twice as long.

Further, federal administrative costs have increased over the same period as states have increasingly emphasized the case management and placement activities required by federal law (see app. IV) and sought full reimbursement for these activities.

Most notably, rising reports of abuse and neglect have led states to devote more resources to investigating reports, leaving less for providing services.", "Because of constrained resources and competing demands, states have not been able to ensure that child welfare services are sufficient to meet needs. For example, an APWA survey of agencies in every state found that services were limited and generally involved managing, rather than treating, families and their abused or neglected children.

In response to an APWA survey, 90 percent of states reported difficulty recruiting and retaining caseworkers. Caseworkers are at the heart of the foster care system, visiting children and families in their homes and arranging services to help prevent the need to remove children from their homes, or, in case of their removal, to find permanent living arrangements for foster children. Caseworkers also coordinate contacts among families and children with health, mental health, and other service systems.", "State officials attributed difficulties in recruiting and retaining caseworkers to several factors, including hiring freezes, low pay, and poor working conditions. These factors, in turn, led to staff shortages, high caseloads, and high burnout and turnover rates among caseworkers. In some jurisdictions, caseloads have reached 100 cases per caseworker, well above the 25 per caseworker recommended by the National Association of Social Workers. In New York City, annual turnover rates for caseworkers have been as high as 75 percent, so that each year most foster children, who have suffered from unstable families, get a new caseworker.", "Foster parents are the other essential component of an effective service delivery system, but the supply of foster parents has lagged behind the growth in the foster care caseload. While the number of children in foster care has increased, the number of foster homes has decreased. Child welfare experts attribute this growing shortage of foster homes to several factors, including the poor public image of foster care, low reimbursement rates, inadequate support services, greater difficulties caring for today\u2019s more troubled foster children, and increased employment opportunities for women.

Rather, a complex set of service delivery systems must be tapped; these are usually linked to separate categorical funding sources and different eligibility criteria.", "Because caseworkers may be overworked and families may often lack the sophistication and resources necessary to arrange services on their own behalf, some children and families may experience delays or gaps in service. For example, when we visited metropolitan areas in three states, we found that many foster children under age 3 lacked routine health examinations and immunizations.", "The goals of the child welfare system and those of various programs may also be inconsistent. For example, caseworkers report that more parents of abused and neglected children are addicted to drugs than in the past.

The proportions were even higher in some metropolitan areas, such as New York City, where about half of foster children were in kinship care in the early 1990s.

Kinship care is less costly than traditional foster homes in those states where relatives are ineligible for state foster care payments. Although relatives might be eligible for assistance from AFDC, AFDC levels are significantly lower than state foster care maintenance payments.", "Kinship care, however, poses several challenges. First, children\u2019s access to needed services may be more limited because kinship foster parents are more likely to live in impoverished communities and lack experience accessing needed services than other foster parents. Second, children may be more vulnerable to repeated neglect or abuse because they are more at risk of unsupervised visits with parents or other relatives from whose care they were removed. Third, child welfare agencies do not always monitor or supervise kinship care placements as much as traditional foster care placements. Finally, children in kinship care tend to stay in foster care longer than other foster children because, for various reasons, child welfare agencies are less likely to arrange alternative placements, such as guardianship or adoption.
