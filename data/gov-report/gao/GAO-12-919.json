A similar savings rate applied to the federal procurement budget would equal more than $50 billion dollars. In 2005, the Office of Management and Budget directed agencies to use strategic sourcing and established the FSSI program to manage governmentwide efforts. GAO was asked to assess (1) the extent to which selected agencies managed spending and achieved savings through strategic sourcing, (2) key challenges selected agency and FSSI officials face in strategically sourcing products and services, and (3) the extent to which the FSSI program managed spending and achieved savings through strategic sourcing. To do this, GAO selected four agencies that were among the highest in fiscal year 2011 procurement obligations--DOD, DHS, VA, and Energy--and reviewed governmentwide FSSI efforts. For each, GAO analyzed strategic sourcing data and policies, and interviewed responsible officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Selected agencies leveraged only a fraction of their buying power through strategic sourcing and achieved limited savings.

These agencies reported savings of $1.8 billion--less than one-half of one percent of procurement spending. While strategic sourcing may not be suitable for all procurement spending, leading companies strategically manage about 90 percent of their procurements and report annual savings of 10 percent or more. Further, most agencies' efforts do not address their highest spending areas such as services, which may provide opportunities for additional savings.", "Most selected agencies and the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) program have not fully adopted a strategic sourcing approach. In prior work, GAO found that sustained leadership and effective metrics are important factors to implementing strategic sourcing. However, leaders at DOD have dedicated limited resources to strategic sourcing, and leaders at VA and Energy are just beginning to align resources for agencywide strategic sourcing efforts. A lack of clear guidance on metrics for measuring success has also impacted the management of ongoing FSSI efforts as well as most selected agencies' efforts. In contrast, DHS leaders stood up a centralized office and hold senior managers accountable to meet goals. DHS sets targets for use of strategic sourcing contracts, and reported that nearly 20 percent of its fiscal year 2011 procurement spending was directed through strategically sourced contracts.", "The FSSI program managed little spending through strategic sourcing initiatives, but reported considerable savings. In fiscal year 2011, the program managed $339 million through several governmentwide initiatives and reported $60 million in savings.

To more fully assess strategic  sourcing at DOD, we reviewed the efforts of four component agencies\u2014 Air Force, Army, Navy, and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)\u2014which  accounted for 88 percent of DOD spending in fiscal year 2011, as well as  departmentwide efforts managed by DOD\u2019s Program Acquisition and  Strategic Sourcing (PASS) office, which is within DOD\u2019s Defense  Procurement and Acquisition Policy (DPAP) organization and reports to  the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and  Logistics (AT&L). We also examined governmentwide FSSI efforts  managed by the FSSI Program Office and overseen by OFPP. We  analyzed selected agencies\u2019 policies and interviewed agency and  governmentwide strategic sourcing officials to determine the status of  current and planned strategic sourcing efforts, with a focus on key  challenges and leading practices. To identify the commodities (both  products and services) on which the most federal procurement dollars  were spent governmentwide and by our selected agencies, we analyzed  fiscal year 2011 data from the Federal Procurement Data System\u2014Next  Generation (FPDS-NG). We determined that FPDS-NG data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our review. Further, we analyzed  selected agencies\u2019 fiscal year 2011 data on strategic sourcing to identify  current or planned strategic sourcing efforts addressing these  commodities. We also analyzed data from selected agencies on managed  spending\u2014spending through their strategic sourcing contract vehicles\u2014 and savings and other benefits from current strategic sourcing efforts.

The four  agencies varied widely in the level of spending managed through  strategic sourcing. For example, in fiscal year 2011, of the agencies we  reviewed, DHS reported the highest percentage of its total procurement  spending, nearly 20 percent, being managed through strategic sourcing  contracts. By contrast, VA reported the lowest at 1.4 percent. Figure 3  compares spending and savings through strategic sourcing at the four  agencies.", "According to some agency officials, not all of their procurement spending  may be addressable through strategic sourcing. For example, DHS  considers some spending related to natural disasters such as hurricanes  and earthquakes to be unaddressable through strategic sourcing. In  another instance, Energy officials stated that they consider less than a  third of Energy\u2019s total procurement spending to be addressable through  strategic sourcing. However, while some spending may not be suitable for  strategic sourcing, the percentage of spending selected agencies report  managing through strategic sourcing is small compared to the amount  leading companies are managing strategically. Industry groups recently  reported that leading companies they surveyed strategically manage  approximately 90 percent of their procurement spending centrally.  Moreover, leading companies we spoke with in 2012 reported that setting  goals and using metrics to measure managed spending is important. By  contrast, only a few of our selected agencies have set goals for the  amount of spending managed through strategic sourcing (see table 1).", "At DOD\u2014the federal government\u2019s largest procurer of products and  services\u2014 the Army, Navy, Air Force, and DLA together reported  spending almost 6 percent, or $19 billion, through strategic sourcing  contracts. In addition, the Defense Program Acquisition and Strategic  Sourcing (PASS) office, which coordinates strategic sourcing efforts  across the department, was unable to provide us with a comprehensive  list of departmentwide strategic sourcing initiatives, and indicated that  there are likely more strategic sourcing initiatives that are not accounted  for because departmentwide initiatives are reported on an ad hoc basis.However, they provided information on a limited number of  departmentwide strategic sourcing initiatives that together represented  more than $1 billion of spending and over $900 million in savings in fiscal  year 2011.", "The proportion of procurement spending being managed through  strategic sourcing varied widely among the military departments and DLA  (see fig. 4). For example, the Army spent more than $125 billion on  products and services in fiscal year 2011, but reported that only $280  million, or less than a quarter of one percent of procurement spending,  was strategically sourced. In contrast, DLA spent $36 billion on goods  and services in fiscal year 2011, and reported that 46 percent or $16  billion was strategically sourced. According to DOD officials, it is to be  expected that a high percentage of DLA\u2019s spending is suitable for  strategic sourcing because DLA\u2019s unique mission is to supply high  volume products that are bought across DOD, such as uniforms and food.  Although DLA\u2019s spending represents only 10 percent of DOD\u2019s total  procurement spending, DLA\u2019s strategic sourcing efforts demonstrate that  when DOD approaches procurement from a departmentwide level, it can  achieve successful outcomes. In addition, PASS officials reported savings  of $889 million in fiscal year 2011 from one initiative that leveraged  departmentwide spending on enterprise software. Specifically, the  initiative consolidates DOD commercial software, information technology  hardware, and services requirements to obtain lower prices from  information technology providers. Figure 4 provides reported fiscal year  2011 procurement spending, and strategic sourcing information for the  military departments and DLA.", "Selected agencies\u2019 reported savings added up to $1.8 billion in fiscal year  2011\u2014less than one-half of one percent of total federal procurement  spending. We previously reported that some companies achieved  reported savings of 10 percent to 20 percent of their total procurement  costs through the use of a strategic approach to buying products and  services. DHS reported fiscal year 2011 savings of $324 million. At DOD,  the military departments and DLA reported a total of $213 million in  savings for fiscal year 2011. The PASS office is just starting to collect  some data on departmentwide strategic sourcing savings and could not  definitively report savings through departmentwide strategic sourcing in  fiscal year 2011. However, based on information provided, DOD achieved  $900 million in savings from agencywide efforts. We have previously  reported that DOD has not fully collected and assessed cost savings and  other information from strategic sourcing initiatives. Energy and VA  officials reported $335 million and $56 million in savings respectively for  their strategic sourcing efforts in fiscal year 2011.", "When strategic sourcing contracts were used, agencies generally  reported rates of savings ranging from 5 percent to over 20 percent of  spending through those contracts. For example, the Navy reported  spending $145 million and achieving savings of $30 million through  strategic sourcing in fiscal year 2011; these reported savings are almost  21 percent of the spending through strategic sourcing vehicles. However,  spending through strategic sourcing was a tiny fraction of the Navy\u2019s total  procurement spending (0.1 percent). If the Navy were to direct even 10  percent of its total procurement spending of $105 billion through strategic  sourcing vehicles, and achieved savings equivalent to 21 percent of the  spending directed through strategic sourcing vehicles, it would save over  $2 billion. In another example, the Air Force reported spending $2.4  billion and achieving savings of $126 million through strategic sourcing in  fiscal year 2011. These reported savings are equal to 5 percent of the  spending through strategic sourcing.

Consequently, agencies are leaving large segments of spending  unmanaged, particularly in the area of services. We found that as the  amount of spending managed through strategic sourcing at selected  agencies increased, reported savings generally increased.", "In fiscal year 2011, more than half of the procurement spending at the  four agencies we reviewed was used to acquire services. However, we  found that strategic sourcing efforts addressed products significantly more  often than services. Officials reported that they have been reluctant to  strategically source services for a variety of reasons, such as difficulty in  standardizing requirements or a decision to focus on less complex  commodities that can demonstrate success. Leading companies we  spoke with have focused their efforts on services in the past 5 to 7 years  because of the growth in spending in that area, and have achieved  significant savings. For example, officials at one leading company told us  that they developed standardized regional labor rates to allow strategic  sourcing of services. Strategic sourcing leading practices at private  companies suggest that it is critical to analyze all procurement spending  with equal rigor and with no categories that are off limits. In addition,  achieving savings requires a departure from the status quo. An industry  group recently surveyed companies and reported that companies have  successfully strategically sourced categories of services spending that  have been off limits or controversial for most procurement organizations,  such as information technology, professional services, technical services,  and facilities management. Selected agencies are procuring many of  the same types of services, such as professional services, and are  missing opportunities to coordinate efforts. For example, DOD conducted  a spend analysis in 2010 that identified knowledge-based services such  as engineering management services and logistics management services  as the largest portfolio of spending being procured by all the DOD  components.", "Of the four agencies we reviewed, only DHS reported addressing the  majority of its top 10 spending categories of products and services. In  contrast, VA reported implemented initiatives in 3 of its top 10 spending  categories. Energy reported departmentwide initiatives for one of its top  10 categories of spending \u2013 operation of Government-Owned Contractor- Operated Research and Development Facilities, which comprises a large  percentage of the agency\u2019s total procurement spending \u2013 but officials  noted that some of their components have strategic sourcing efforts in  those top 10 spending categories where virtually all of the spending is  concentrated at one component. Because of this concentration, Energy  officials did not believe greater efficiencies could be achieved by sourcing  those commodities at a departmentwide level. At DOD, PASS officials  could not provide a comprehensive list of departmentwide initiatives and  therefore, we could not fully assess their efforts to address the  department\u2019s highest spending categories through departmentwide  strategic sourcing efforts.", "The DOD components varied in the extent to which their efforts address  their top spending categories. Of the components we reviewed, only DLA  reported initiatives addressing the majority of their highest spending  categories (see fig. 5). According to Navy officials, they choose products  and services for strategic sourcing by examining their top spending  products and services and eliminating those that they do not consider to  be good candidates for strategic sourcing. Through this analysis, Navy  officials identified engineering and technical services as a good candidate  for strategic sourcing and stated they planned to create a commodity  team in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 to develop an initiative in this  area. In addition, the Air Force reported completing multiple spend  analyses to identify and establish commodity councils, and also to  prioritize strategic sourcing initiatives within these commodity councils. Air  Force officials reported that strategic sourcing opportunities were  prioritized based on a value/complexity trade-off.", "Of the top spending categories that DOD components reported targeting  through implemented strategic sourcing initiatives, only two are services.  However, leading companies and DHS have successfully tackled some  high-spend and complex services that are comparable to DOD\u2019s high  spend services. For example, DHS has implemented a strategic sourcing  initiative for engineering and technical services, which is also in the top 10  spending categories for the Army, Air Force and Navy. DOD  acknowledges the need to better manage services spending. A DOD  instruction is in place that requires each service acquisition executive in  the military departments to collaborate with other senior officials to  determine key categories of services that can be strategically sourced,  and to dedicate full-time commodity managers to coordinate procurement  of these services. These officials are also responsible for conducting  periodic spend analyses of their procurement data. DOD officials told us  that the appointment of a senior manager for the acquisition of services at  each of the military departments and defense agencies is in progress, but  that it will take some time to fully achieve this change.", "Agency officials stated that not all categories of spending are good  candidates for strategic sourcing. However, industry sources, government  guidance, and our prior work have identified a range of strategic sourcing  tactics that are appropriate for various types of government products and  services. For example, some military officials have cited weapon systems  as one category that they do not consider to be good candidates for  strategic sourcing. While weapon systems are highly specialized items  that have a long development cycle, we have identified where weapon  systems acquisition could benefit from some strategic sourcing practices,  such as supplier relationship management. In a 2005 memo on strategic  sourcing, DOD stated that enhancing relationships with suppliers  minimizes costs, as DLA has done through long-term contracts. Further,  DOD cited the need for improving long-term strategic relationships with  suppliers in its 2010 Better Buying Power memo, and directed  components to participate in an agencywide pilot to develop preferred  supplier relationships.", "In addition, the Better Buying Power memo acknowledged a need for a  cohesive and integrated strategy for acquiring services, many of which  are among the highest spending categories for DOD. The memo cited the  use of more than 100,000 contract vehicles held by more than 32,200  contractors and also stated that contract support services spending at  DOD represented more than 50 percent of its total contract spending in  2009. However, the memo was not clear how strategic sourcing would be  incorporated into their ongoing efforts in this area. Similarly, the Defense  Business Board issued a report in January 2011 recommending that DOD  target high value areas for cross-military department coordination. The  report noted that strategic sourcing savings of even one percent at the  department would equate to billions of dollars."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Agencies\u2019 Strategic Sourcing Efforts Varied Widely", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Initiatives Address a Range of Products and Services", "paragraphs": ["Some of the four agencies have implemented many initiatives covering a  wide range of products or services, while others report only a few  initiatives that address a limited number of products or services.

In addition to the initiatives that have already been  implemented at the four agencies, officials reported a total of 85 efforts  planned for fiscal years 2012 through 2016. Many initiatives include  multiple products or services. For example, DHS reported, for fiscal year  2011, 42 implemented departmentwide initiatives that covered  approximately 270 products and services, ranging from software to  professional and program management support services. By contrast, VA  reported 4 initiatives covering flags, hearing aids, wireless devices, and  affiliate negotiation teams. At the Department of Energy, the majority of  spending through strategic sourcing is led by the management and  operating contractors who operate and maintain most of their  government-owned facilities, such as national laboratories. Energy  officials told us that labs managed by the National Nuclear Security  Administration require their contractors to collaborate to produce  contracting vehicles for common products and services used across the  program. However, national labs managed by the Office of Science do  not. The Office of Environmental Management began implementing an  initiative modeled on National Nuclear Security Administration\u2019s approach  in 2012.", "At DOD, PASS officials were unable to definitively report how many  initiatives were ongoing as of fiscal year 2011. However, they did provide  information on a limited number of ongoing departmentwide initiatives.  Within DOD, the military departments and DLA varied in the number of  efforts that they have implemented and the types of products and  services that have been addressed. For example, the Air Force reported  17 implemented initiatives whereas the Army reported 8 and the Navy  reported 7 implemented initiatives. These initiatives include products,  such as taxiway lighting and maritime coatings, and services, such as  clinical support services and integrated logistics support services.", "We found that agencies with more mature strategic sourcing programs\u2014 those with more implemented initiatives\u2014managed more spending  through strategic sourcing than those with less mature efforts. For  example, DHS had the most initiatives and had the highest percentage of  spending through strategic sourcing of the four selected agencies we  reviewed. Conversely, VA officials reported the fewest initiatives and the  lowest amount of spending managed through strategic sourcing of the  agencies we reviewed. To support strategic sourcing efforts, DHS stood  up a strategic sourcing office at its headquarters to centralize strategic  sourcing efforts when the department was created in 2003, and its  strategic sourcing program has been operating under an implemented  management directive since 2004. We reported in 2004 that VA had  success with a few initiatives. However, since that time they do not  appear to have expanded their use of strategic sourcing. According to VA  officials, efforts were stymied by a lack of reliable data. However, they are  in the process of ramping up to add resources and increase their strategic  sourcing efforts.", "Additionally, Energy\u2019s major programs\u2014National Nuclear Security  Administration, Office of Science, and Office of Environmental  Management\u2014have ongoing strategic sourcing efforts and require some  contractors operating their facilities to strategically source; however,  Energy is still working to centralize its management of strategic sourcing  initiatives and create an agencywide strategic sourcing program. In 2010,  the Deputy Secretary of Energy cited further opportunities to leverage the  department\u2019s buying power through a more centralized and less  fragmented approach, but according to Energy officials, steps have only  recently been taken to take advantage of those opportunities. For  example, the Office of Environmental Management created a partnership  in January 2012 with the National Nuclear Security Administration\u2019s  Supply Chain Management Center. Under this partnership, the  Environmental Management contractors have begun working with the  Supply Chain Management Center to create a cooperative strategic  sourcing solution that achieves efficiencies and economies of scale, and  increases productivity and cost savings. In 2012, the Office of Science  conducted a review of the National Nuclear Security Administration\u2019s  Supply Chain Management Center process and concluded that it does  not make financial or practical sense for their labs to leverage existing  efforts or establish a similar organization. They fulfill this function using  their previously established Integrated Contractor Purchasing Team. We  recently recommended that the Secretary of Energy assess whether the  National Nuclear Security Administration and the Office of Science are  taking the necessary steps to address challenges limiting implementation  of cost savings efforts. They agreed with our recommendation and are  taking steps to address it.", "Efforts across DOD components varied but in general are not mature.  Army officials reported that the Army is currently aligning and allocating  strategic sourcing responsibilities in partnership with the Army\u2019s Senior  Services Manager. In 2011, the Assistant Secretary of the Army issued a  memo establishing a strategic sourcing board structure and program. The  Air Force has been incorporating some aspects of strategic sourcing into  its procurement practices for over a decade and its efforts are the most  mature.", "The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) relies on each military  department to develop its own strategic sourcing efforts. The Defense  Business Board reported in 2011 that DOD had not incorporated  agencywide strategic sourcing into its operations and business practices.", "Rather, PASS officials told us that they conduct a detailed and  comprehensive spending analysis, which they provide to the military  departments so that they may determine which products and services  they should address. Using this detailed spend analysis to select  commodities that could be strategically sourced across DOD is not their  primary goal; instead, PASS officials told us that they used it to identify  and develop goals set forth in the Better Buying Power memo, which  addresses productivity and efficiency initiatives such as increasing  competition and reducing the use of high-risk contract vehicles. DOD  guidance has not made clear how efforts related to the Better Buying  Power memo link specifically to strategic sourcing initiatives. Military  service officials told us that they would welcome guidance on strategic  sourcing efforts from the PASS office, which is the organization  responsible for championing strategic sourcing policy and initiatives for  the department. The PASS office is currently updating its departmentwide  strategic sourcing concept of operations, and is revising additional  guidance which will include a process for regular review of DOD  component and departmentwide proposed strategic sourcing initiatives.

A lack of leadership investment has prevented  several agencies from transforming their procurement organizations to  allow for enterprisewide strategic sourcing, as leading companies have  done. For example, leaders at DOD and the Army have not devoted  resources to set up the necessary organizational structures for strategic  sourcing. In addition, agencies are still challenged to obtain and analyze  reliable and detailed agencywide spending data, which hinders their  ability to identify and study the strategic sourcing opportunities offering  the most potential benefits. Finally, the FSSI program and selected  agencies face challenges in communicating information for new and  ongoing initiatives as well as establishing and meeting utilization goals to  measure the effectiveness of these efforts and to realize cost savings.  Where agencies have overcome some of these challenges, strategic  sourcing results have improved. For example, DHS has established a  centralized strategic sourcing office, identified opportunities in high spend  areas despite data deficiencies, and taken steps to manage and monitor  ongoing efforts.

Each of these four  agencies must overcome challenges posed by insufficient leadership  support, including failure to dedicate resources and lack of management  action to address disincentives to strategic sourcing. However, all four  agencies reported they have begun to adopt some practices aimed at  addressing these challenges.", "At a few agencies, leadership has not devoted sufficient resources to  allow for strategic sourcing to be conducted at a departmentwide level.  Strategic sourcing programs can be structured in various ways that  require varying levels of resources. For example, DHS established a  strategic sourcing program office, located in the Office of the Chief  Procurement Officer, which includes DHS\u2019s Director of Strategic Sourcing  and nine additional staff members. This office coordinates with the  components to identify opportunities and develop agencywide contracts  that apply strategic sourcing principles. VA reported that in response to a  proposal from Veterans Health Administration (VHA) personnel, VA  leadership has recently committed to support the VHA in hiring  approximately 150 full time personnel who will establish commodity  management teams to identify departmentwide strategic sourcing  opportunities and develop improved requirements packages, among other  duties. Similarly, the Air Force reported that roughly 125 employees within  its Enterprise Sourcing Group are involved in cross-functional strategic  sourcing that leverages installation spending across 71 sites.", "The structure of an agency\u2019s strategic sourcing program will determine  the amount of dedicated resources that are needed; however, in two  cases we found large agencies with only one or two full time employees  who were expected to coordinate strategic sourcing across the entire  organization. The Army, which managed more annual procurement  spending than any other government agency in fiscal year 2011, currently  does not have a formal strategic sourcing program office. The strategic  sourcing function presently lies within the Policy and Oversight  Directorate under the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for  Procurement, which has committed only one staff person at a quarter  time to managing its strategic sourcing. Moreover, at the OSD level, DOD  has allocated one Deputy Director and one full-time staff member to its  PASS office. The failure of agency leaders to devote resources to  strategic sourcing has been a recurring issue. For example, in 2009, the  FSSI program reported that many strategic sourcing staff cited resource  constraints as the main barrier to implementation of strategic sourcing in  their organizations. During our review we observed that agencies that  have committed more resources to managing departmentwide strategic  sourcing efforts were better able to maintain data on their agencies\u2019  current strategic sourcing initiatives. This is a necessary step for  coordinating and managing purchases agencywide\u2014identified in our prior  work as critical to taking a strategic approach to procurement. For  example, DHS maintains a published list of available departmentwide  strategic sourcing vehicles, while Army officials told us it was difficult for  them to supply information on all initiatives because strategic sourcing  data\u2014even on Army-wide efforts\u2014are not kept centrally and would  require a data call.", "Agency officials mentioned several disincentives that can discourage  procurement and program officials from proactively participating in  strategic sourcing, and at many agencies, these disincentives have not  been fully addressed by leadership. Key disincentives identified by  agency officials include the following:", "A perception that reporting savings due to strategic sourcing could  lead to program budgets being cut in subsequent years,", "Difficulty identifying existing strategic sourcing contracts that are  available for use as there is no centralized source for this information,", "A perception that strategically sourced contract vehicles may limit the  ability to customize requirements,", "A desire on the part of agency officials to maintain control of their", "Program officials\u2019 and contracting officers\u2019 relationships with existing", "The opportunity to get lower prices by going outside of strategically  sourced contracts.", "For example, a key disincentive to implementing efforts and tracking and  reporting savings is a perception that program budgets may be cut as a  result of producing savings. Agency officials stated that a reluctance to  track and report savings for fear of budget reductions contributes to  underreporting of savings. Military officials reported a perception that any  money saved will be taken from the next year\u2019s budget. Navy officials  stated that several of their commands have expressed concerns that  tracking and reporting savings could trigger another round of budget  reductions and that the issue is frequently raised during their meetings  with Navy senior management. DOD leadership has not yet addressed  this perception for strategic sourcing efforts.", "Leaders at some agencies have proactively introduced practices that  address these disincentives to strategically source. For example, DHS  and VA reported increasing personal incentives for key managers by  adding strategic sourcing performance measures to certain executives\u2019  performance evaluations. In addition, several agencies including DOD,  DHS, and VA have instituted policies making use of some strategic  sourcing contracts mandatory or mandatory \u201cwith exception,\u201d although the  extent to which these policies have increased use of strategic sourcing  vehicles is not yet clear. Some agencies have made use of automated  systems to direct spending through strategic sourcing contracts. For  example, FSSI issued a blanket purchase agreement through its office  supplies initiative which included provisions requiring FSSI prices to be  automatically applied to purchases made with government purchase  cards. VA reported that its utilization rate for the office supplies FSSI  contracts increased from 12 percent to 90 percent after these measures  took effect. Officials from a number of agencies reported that they  expected shrinking budgets will prompt leadership to provide additional  requirements or incentives to strategically source. In fact, VA and Navy  officials reported renewed attention to strategic sourcing as a potential  tool to deal with budget cuts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Few Agencies Have Conducted Opportunity Analyses Despite a Lack of Reliable Agencywide Spending Data", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Obtaining and Analyzing Spending Data", "paragraphs": ["The FSSI program and selected agencies generally cited the Federal  Procurement Data System\u2014Next Generation (FPDS-NG)\u2014the federal  government\u2019s current system for tracking information on contracting  actions\u2014as their primary source of data, and noted numerous  deficiencies with this data for the purposes of conducting strategic  sourcing research. Agencies reported that when additional data sources  are added, incompatible data and separate systems often presented  problems. We have previously reported extensively on issues agencies  faced in gathering data to form the basis for their spend analysis.  However, some agencies have been able to make progress on  conducting enterprisewide opportunity analyses despite flaws in the  available data. For example, both the FSSI Program Management Office  and DHS told us that current data, although imperfect, provide sufficient  information for them to begin to identify high spend opportunities. DHS  has in fact evaluated the majority of its 10 highest-spend commodities  and developed sourcing strategies for seven of those based on its  analysis of primarily FPDS-NG data.", "Officials at several agencies noted that the lack of trained acquisition  personnel made it difficult to conduct an opportunity analysis and develop  an informed sourcing strategy. For example, Army officials cited a need  for expertise in strategic sourcing and spend analysis data, and OMB  officials echoed that a key challenge is the dearth of strategic sourcing  expertise in government. VA and Energy also reported this challenge. A  few agencies have responded to this challenge by developing training on  strategic sourcing for acquisition personnel. For example, the Air Force  noted that they instituted training related to strategic sourcing because it  is necessary to have people who are very strong analytically to do the  front end work for strategic sourcing, and these are the hardest to find.  The training course gives acquisition personnel strong analytical skills to  perform steps like market evaluation. VA has also begun to develop  training to address this challenge."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies Report Challenges in Executing Individual Strategic Sourcing Initiatives", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Developing the Sourcing Strategy", "paragraphs": ["Agency officials listed several challenges that they commonly face in  developing the sourcing strategy for a product or service. As with the  opportunity analysis stage, imperfect data and a lack of expertise also  pose challenges to agencies when developing a sourcing strategy. This  phase requires study of various types of information; for example, data on  the agency\u2019s requirements and historical and projected demand for the  product or service. Some agencies have found additional information on  existing suppliers and contracts to also be important in identifying  commodities to target for strategic sourcing. For example, the Air Force  also considers data on the number of contracts, the number of purchasing  locations, the number of transactions, the number of suppliers, and  estimated total cost savings for each potential commodity, among other  factors. Several agencies have historically turned to contractors to  perform this step; however some have recently decided to increase  internal expertise in this area. For example, the FSSI Program  Management Office reported hiring two new staff with relevant expertise  to help with this process.", "A few agencies also reported challenges specifically with meeting  requirements unique to government procurements. Government  procurements must meet specified socioeconomic goals; for example,  agencies are expected to award a certain portion of their contracts to  small businesses. Organizations representing small businesses have  expressed concern that federal strategic sourcing reduces contracting  opportunities for small businesses. However, while acknowledging that  reducing the number of vendors providing a product or service means  that some vendors will be unable to participate, agency officials reported  finding ways to conduct strategic sourcing efforts that allow for maximum  feasible small business participation. For example, DHS, VA, and Air  Force officials told us they collaborated with small business advocates  early in the acquisition planning stage to ensure they conducted market  research that would help determine how to maximize small business  participation. In addition, Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiatives to date  have generally awarded a number of contracts to small businesses. For  example, of 15 contracts awarded for an initiative focusing on office  supplies, 13 were awarded to small businesses, and these businesses  received over 70 percent of office supplies spending through that initiative  in fiscal year 2011. Another initiative targeting print management services  awarded 5 of 11 contracts to small businesses. Several agency small  business utilization officials with whom we spoke were generally satisfied  with FSSI and agency efforts to involve small businesses in strategic  sourcing.", "Officials at all of our four selected agencies discussed challenges in  getting buy-in among those who would be using the strategic sourcing  contracts to purchase products or services. Buyers can face a number of  disincentives to using strategic sourcing vehicles, as outlined above. In  addition to creating structures that provide incentives for participation in  strategic sourcing, several agencies incorporate practices into individual  strategic sourcing efforts to increase stakeholder buy-in. OMB, DHS, and  Air Force officials reported that one such practice is involving  stakeholders early in the process. For example, Air Force officials said  that in order for strategic sourcing to be successful, the cross-functional  commodity team must include the organization that is funding the  acquisition. DHS officials added that in order to have support with all  levels of personnel involved, it is important to have the end users in the  room when making procurement decisions. Similarly, the program  manager for GSA\u2019s planned FSSI covering wireless rate plans and  devices personally conducted extensive outreach with agencies to  understand their technical requirements and encourage customer  involvement. In response, agencies have sent representatives from  offices of both the Chief Information Officer and the Chief Acquisition  Officer to work with the team in developing the acquisition strategy.", "After strategic sourcing contracts are awarded, realizing cost savings and  other benefits depends on utilization of these contracts. Agency officials  indicated that a key challenge with strategic sourcing is communicating  new contracting options. For example, Navy officials expressed that even  though they have templates for communication that can be used when  rolling out an initiative, it is really people who determine whether the  communication will be effective. In addition to putting together a  communication plan to alert government purchase card users that use of  the office supplies FSSI was now required, Air Force officials conducted  random telephone calls to ensure these users knew of the existence of  the policy. Air Force officials believed that these communication efforts  led to a 50 percent increase in FSSI usage from March to April 2011.", "To improve the existing FSSI efforts, GSA applied lessons learned from  previous initiatives to increase buy-in and utilization. The first generation  of the office supplies initiative did not have a high utilization rate, and  officials attributed this, in part, to a failure to publicize the effort. As a  result, GSA increased its outreach efforts for the second iteration of the  initiative and developed an implementation kit\u2014a pre-packaged  communications campaign to help implement the FSSI. The kit included a  five-step implementation process, sample communications and policy  memos, and reporting templates. In fiscal year 2011, an estimated 13  percent of governmentwide spending on office supplies went through  second generation office supplies initiative contracts, up from less than 1  percent of similar spending through first generation contracts in fiscal year  2009.", "Failure to set goals and difficulty in measuring the utilization of strategic  sourcing contracts also present a critical challenge. A lack of detailed  data on spending makes it difficult for agencies to track utilization of  existing strategic sourcing contracts. FPDS-NG provides spending data  by product service code, but the products and services targeted by most  strategic sourcing initiatives are only a subset of these much broader  categories. Further, FPDS-NG lacks information on transactions below a  certain dollar threshold. Even where agencies have improved their data  on spending through strategically sourced contracts\u2014for example, a FSSI  blanket purchase agreement requires vendors to provide detailed line  item data on spending\u2014they continue to lack data that allows them to  reliably identify spending on these products and services that go to  contractors outside of strategically sourced contracts. Inability to track this  spending makes tracking utilization imprecise, but the FSSI program, VA,  and DHS have all begun tracking utilization data\u2014though imperfect\u2014and  are using utilization rates as one metric to manage strategic sourcing  efforts. VA officials acknowledged that regular monitoring of strategically  sourced spending is what creates the incentive to stabilize savings  following the initial drop in spending, which is crucial to continued  success.", "Agencies are equally challenged to produce other metrics\u2014such as  spending through strategic sourcing contracts and savings\u2014that can be  used to monitor progress. However, agencies will be increasingly called  upon to produce metrics as the use of strategic sourcing expands. For  example, in 2012 OMB issued a new cross-cutting management  improvement goal, which calls for agencies to strategically source at least  two new products or services in both 2013 and 2014 that yield at least 10  percent savings. Agencies will need to measure savings to document  their progress toward this goal. However, although recognizing the need  for guidance on how agencies are to measure savings, OMB has not yet  issued such guidance.", "The strategic sourcing savings figures reported to us by agency officials  were calculated using a variety of savings methodologies; for example,  the difference in the paid price versus the price from ordering the same  product or service from GSA schedule contracts. Other examples for  calculating savings include totaling GSA management fees avoided  because GSA schedules were not used for the procurement, and  comparison of the prices paid on the contracts before strategic sourcing  and after. Often several methodologies were used even within agencies.  We recently reported that Energy\u2019s guidance on calculating procurement  cost savings gave its maintenance and operations contractors  considerable flexibility in choosing the methods for estimating savings,  and therefore estimates could vary widely. For example, one laboratory  estimated a $9 million savings from a software purchase in 2010 using its  preferred estimation method. By other methods used elsewhere in  Energy, however, the site estimated that its savings could have been as  high as $35 million. We recommended that Energy clarify its guidance on  estimating cost savings from streamlining efforts. Energy officials  agreed with our recommendation and stated they have clarified their  guidance on developing savings estimates. In addition, our recent reports  highlighted the difficulties that agencies face when calculating acquisition  savings. Specifically, we found that agencies reported billions of dollars in  overstated and questionable savings in response to OMB\u2019s Acquisition  Savings Initiative due to differing methods of calculating savings as well  as confusion as to what should be included as savings. We also found  that when calculating savings from various efforts including strategic  sourcing, VA had double counted savings on different efforts and had not  accounted for the cost of implementing other efforts.", "In addition to savings, leading companies that we spoke with have  identified a variety of metrics they use to measure return on strategic  sourcing investments, such as the spending under management,  reductions in total cost of ownership, and efficiencies due to streamlined  processes. Agency officials have identified, but have not quantified, some  of these other benefits to strategic sourcing. Officials acknowledge that  strategic sourcing efforts can produce administrative cost savings, but  they are difficult to quantify. For example, DHS reported that  consolidating procurements using agencywide contracts streamlines the  acquisition process and saves the department significant administrative  costs; however, DHS does not quantify these savings. Strategic sourcing  efforts can also achieve efficiencies by changing buying behavior and  managing demand for products and services. For example, OSD officials  reported the Navy has been innovative in incorporating demand  management into its approach for buying wireless services. Navy\u2019s  wireless effort is down to eight plans and eight devices, and the service is  now doing demand analysis.", "Several agencies mentioned a need for sustained leadership support and  additional resources in order to more effectively monitor ongoing  initiatives. For example, DOD\u2019s PASS office\u2014with only two people to  advocate strategic sourcing policy and coordinate communication of  component initiatives\u2014does not track current strategic sourcing efforts at  the component or departmentwide level. Some agencies that have  developed metrics such as contract utilization rates report using those  metrics to increase ongoing communication with leadership and maintain  leadership investment. For example, VA officials said that they collect  utilization metrics for the FSSIs and brief the Deputy Secretary on those  metrics monthly."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiatives Managed a Small Amount of Spending and Achieved Considerable Savings, but Greater Savings Are Possible", "paragraphs": ["The FSSI program has adopted some leading practices for strategic  sourcing, such as creating the structure and processes necessary to  implement and monitor efforts.

Government agencies and commercial firms tend to have  more spending managed through strategic sourcing efforts when they  incorporate leading practices such as using their spend analysis to inform  their selection of products and services for strategic sourcing, devoting  resources to strategic sourcing efforts, and measuring the benefits of  ongoing efforts. These practices drive efficiencies and yield benefits  beyond savings, such as increased business knowledge.  Governmentwide strategic sourcing efforts have been initiated, and the  four federal agencies we reviewed have improved and expanded upon  their use of strategic sourcing to achieve cost savings and other benefits,  but some agencies\u2019 leaders, such as OSD and the Army, have not made  a sufficient commitment to strategic sourcing, investing limited resources  and failing to establish goals and performance metrics.

Accordingly, we assessed: (1) the extent to which selected agencies  managed spending and achieved savings through strategic sourcing, and  whether buying power could better be leveraged, (2) key challenges  agency and Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) officials face in  strategically sourcing products and services, (3) the extent to which  FSSIs managed spending and achieved savings through strategic  sourcing, and whether governmentwide buying power could better be  leveraged.", "To evaluate agency strategic sourcing efforts, we selected for review four  agencies\u2014Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Homeland  Security (DHS), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and Department of  Energy (Energy)\u2014among the top ten in fiscal year 2011 procurement  obligations that accounted for 80 percent of total federal procurement  spending. In addition, to more fully assess strategic sourcing at DOD, we  reviewed the efforts of four component agencies\u2014Air Force, Army, Navy,  and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)\u2014which accounted for 88  percent of DOD fiscal year 2011 spending, as well as departmentwide  efforts managed by DOD\u2019s Defense Program Acquisition and Strategic  Sourcing (PASS) office, which reports to the Under Secretary of Defense  for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (AT&L).", "We requested and analyzed data on active and planned agencywide  strategic sourcing initiatives, and any other efforts they might have begun,  but discontinued.

We did not independently verify  this information that agencies reported to us, but we did assess  information from agency officials about the reliability of the data and  resolved some discrepancies. We determined that these data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of analyzing agency-reported  strategic sourcing spending and savings data.", "To identify the products and services with the highest federal  procurement spending\u2014both governmentwide and by our selected  agencies\u2014we analyzed fiscal year 2011 data from the FPDS-NG. To  assess the reliability of the FPDS-NG, we reviewed existing  documentation and electronically tested the data to identify obvious  problems with completeness or accuracy. We determined that these data  were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of reporting governmentwide and  agency spending on products and services.", "At the selected agencies and the General Services Administration (GSA),  we interviewed strategic sourcing officials to determine the status of  current and planned governmentwide and agencywide strategic sourcing  efforts, with a focus on key challenges and leading practices. Specifically,  we asked about governance structure, obstacles to strategic sourcing, enablers or good practices in strategic sourcing, agencywide initiatives, participation in governmentwide initiatives, spend analysis, and  savings and potential other benefits from strategic sourcing efforts.", "We also obtained and reviewed agency strategic sourcing policies and  other documentation, including spend analyses, where applicable. In  addition, we reviewed previous GAO reports on leading company  practices for strategic sourcing as well as related reports on acquisition,  contract management, government streamlining, and duplication, overlap,  and fragmentation in the federal government. We also reviewed work  papers from a 2012 engagement on best commercial practices for  acquiring services. In addition, we examined related testimony before  various congressional committees. Furthermore, we reviewed the  Defense Business Board 2011 Report to the Secretary of Defense on  Strategic Sourcing, as well as literature from industry sources on  successful strategic sourcing efforts. To examine how agencies consider  small businesses in the strategic sourcing process, we interviewed  personnel at DHS and VA Offices of Small and Disadvantaged Business  Utilization and the Air Force Office of Small Business. We also analyzed  selected data to determine the number of small businesses participating  in strategic sourcing efforts and the level of spending directed to small  business contractors.", "To evaluate governmentwide strategic sourcing, we examined the FSSI  efforts led by GSA and overseen by the Office of Federal Procurement  Policy (OFPP). We interviewed strategic sourcing officials at GSA to  determine the status of current and planned FSSI initiatives, again looking  at challenges and leading practices. We sought information on topics  similar to those discussed with officials at our selected agencies, and  obtained and reviewed FSSI documentation, including spend analysis.  Similarly to the selected agencies, we requested and analyzed GSA fiscal  years 2009-2011 information on Product Service Codes, governmentwide  spending, and governmentwide savings associated with the FSSIs. In  addition, we used the results of prior work on the Office Supplies II FSSI.", "We did not independently verify the FSSI information GSA reported to us,  but we did assess information from agency officials about the reliability of  the data and resolved some discrepancies.
