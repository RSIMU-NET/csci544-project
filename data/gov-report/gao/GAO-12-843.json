In February 2012, GAO reported that 23 federal agencies had implemented nearly 700 renewable energy initiatives in fiscal year 2010-- including initiatives that supported solar energy technologies (GAO-12-260). The existence of such initiatives at multiple agencies raised questions about the potential for duplication, which can occur when multiple initiatives support the same technology advancement activities and technologies, direct funding to the same recipients, and have the same goals.", "GAO was asked to identify (1) solar- related initiatives supported by federal agencies in fiscal years 2010 and 2011 and key characteristics of those initiatives and (2) the extent of fragmentation, overlap, and duplication, if any, of federal solar- related initiatives, as well as the extent of any coordination among these initiatives. GAO reviewed its previous work and interviewed officials at each of the agencies identified as having federal solar initiatives active in fiscal years 2010 and 2011. GAO developed a questionnaire and administered it to officials involved in each initiative to collect information on: initiative goals, technology advancement activities, funding obligations, number of projects, and coordination activities.", "This report contains no recommendations. In response to the draft report, USDA generally agreed with the findings, while the other agencies had no comments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Sixty-five solar-related initiatives with a variety of key characteristics were supported by six federal agencies. Over half of these 65 initiatives supported solar projects exclusively; the remaining initiatives supported solar and other renewable energy technologies. The 65 initiatives exhibited a variety of key characteristics, including multiple technology advancement activities ranging from basic research to commercialization by providing funding to various types of recipients including universities, industry, and federal laboratories and researchers, primarily through grants and contracts. Agency officials reported that they obligated about $2.6 billion for the solar projects in these initiatives in fiscal years 2010 and 2011, an amount higher than in previous years, in part, because of additional funding from the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.", "The 65 solar-related initiatives are fragmented across six agencies and overlap to some degree in their key characteristics, but most agency officials reported coordination efforts to avoid duplication. The initiatives are fragmented in that they are implemented by various offices across the six agencies and address the same broad areas of national need. However, the agencies tailor their initiatives to meet their specific missions, such as DOD's energy security mission and NASA's space exploration mission. Many of the initiatives overlapped with at least one other initiative in the technology advancement activity, technology type, funding recipient, or goal. However, GAO found no clear instances of duplicative initiatives. Furthermore, officials at 57 of the 65 initiatives (88 percent) indicated that they coordinated in some way with other solar-related initiatives, including both within their own agencies and with other agencies. Such coordination may reduce the risk of duplication. Moreover, 59 of the 65 initiatives (91 percent) require applicants to disclose other federal sources of funding on their applications to help ensure that they do not receive duplicative funding."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United States has abundant solar energy resources and solar, along  with wind, offers the greatest energy and power potential among all  commercial domestic renewable resources currently available, according  to the National Academies of Science. While helping meet the nation\u2019s  energy needs, solar sources of electricity could also offer substantial  environmental benefits, such as a reduction in greenhouse gas  emissions, over conventional electricity generation. However, solar and  wind energy as sources of electricity at the utility scale also face  numerous challenges related to their intermittent availability and higher  costs compared with traditional energy sources. The Department of  Energy\u2019s (DOE) Energy Information Administration, an independent  statistical and analytical agency, reports that although solar energy  accounted for only 1 percent of all renewable energy electricity consumed  in the United States in 2010, solar energy use increased by about 60  percent from 2006 to 2010. DOE has also embarked on a comprehensive  effort to reduce the cost of generating electricity using solar power.", "Beyond supplying electricity to the existing infrastructure or grid (i.e., the  electricity networks that carry electricity from the plants where it is  generated to consumers, including wires, substations, and transformers),  solar energy technologies have extensive defense and space  applications. For example, the Department of Defense (DOD) has  undertaken efforts to develop technologies that allow it to use solar  energy in operational environments, such as the conflicts in Iraq and  Afghanistan, to help reduce its reliance on conventional fuel, which is very  difficult and costly to deliver and store. In addition, the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is working to develop  high-power solar electric propulsion systems to provide low-cost  abundant power for deep-space missions. As the availability and  utilization of solar energy technologies have increased, so too has federal  support to some of the agencies addressing challenges associated with  further expansion of solar energy as an electricity source and to meet  other mission-specific goals.", "In February 2012, we reported that 23 federal agencies had implemented  nearly 700 renewable energy initiatives in fiscal year 2010\u2014and a number  of these initiatives supported solar energy technologies. The existence of  such initiatives at multiple agencies has raised questions about the  potential for duplication that, in this context, occurs when multiple initiatives  support the same technology advancement activities and technologies,  direct funding to the same recipients, and have the same goals. As we  have previously reported, unnecessary duplication can potentially result  from fragmentation and overlap among government programs.  Fragmentation occurs when more than one federal agency, or more than  one organization within an agency, is involved in the same broad area of  national need. For the purposes of this report, overlap occurs when multiple  initiatives support similar technology advancement activities, similar  technologies, similar funding recipients, or have similar goals.", "In this context, you asked us to review federal initiatives that supported  solar energy technology\u2014which we termed \u201csolar-related initiatives.\u201d Our  objectives were to identify (1) solar-related initiatives supported by federal  agencies in fiscal years 2010 and 2011 and key characteristics of those  initiatives and (2) the extent of fragmentation, overlap, and duplication, if  any, among federal solar-related initiatives, as well as the extent of  coordination among these initiatives.", "To address these objectives, we collected and analyzed information from  our previous work and conducted new work. More specifically, to identify  federal solar-related initiatives and to assess the extent of fragmentation,  overlap, and duplication among these initiatives, we relied on data from  our February 2012 report on renewable energy, which identified and  collected information from solar-related initiatives active in fiscal year  2010, as well as other renewable energy initiatives. For the purposes of  this report, we defined an initiative as a program or group of agency  activities serving a similar purpose or function that involved solar energy  technologies through a specific emphasis or focus, even if solar energy  was only one part of a broader effort. We restricted our analysis to those  initiatives that supported research and development (R&D) on, or  commercialization of, innovative solar energy technologies.", "Because initiatives often supported more than one type of technology  advancement activity, some of the initiatives included in this report may  also support deployment activities. We eliminated initiatives that focused  solely on the deployment of readily available solar energy technologies.  Although not covered in this report, a range of federal, state, and other  initiatives support such deployment activities. These federal deployment  activities facilitate or achieve widespread use of technologies\u2014for  example, by federal agencies\u2019 procurement of solar energy technologies  or by federal tax or other incentives that encourage households and  businesses to adopt these technologies. We have ongoing work that  looks at some of these deployment activities, including DOE\u2019s Loan  Guarantee and Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan  Programs, and a review of wind energy technology initiatives, including  those that support deployment activities. We also recently issued reports  on tax incentives for residential energy efficiency and on renewable  energy deployment activities.", "After using our February 2012 report to identify solar-related initiatives  that supported R&D and commercialization, we developed a  questionnaire and surveyed cognizant officials at each of the six agencies  that had such initiatives to collect additional information on the initiatives\u2019  scope and key characteristics\u2014DOD, DOE, the Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA), NASA, the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the  U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Specifically, we asked questions  to ascertain the number of projects, funds obligated, type of technology  advancement activities supported, recipients funded, funding  mechanisms, initiative goals, and efforts to coordinate across other solar- related initiatives. To determine the extent to which agencies coordinated  their initiatives, we used survey responses and interviews to identify  coordination activities within and among the six agencies. We also asked  the agencies to provide us with any additional relevant initiatives that  were implemented in fiscal year 2011 that were not on our initial list, and  we sent a copy of the questionnaire to officials representing those  initiatives as well. (For further information on our questionnaire, see app.  I. For a copy of our questionnaire, see app. III.) We then analyzed the  information collected for the February 2012 report and from our  questionnaire for this report to determine the extent to which we could  identify fragmentation, overlap, and duplication of solar-related initiatives.  In addition, we interviewed agency officials responsible for solar-related  initiatives for follow-up information as needed.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2011 to August  2012 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Examples of solar energy technologies include photovoltaics,  concentrated solar power, and solar hot water. Solar cells, also known as  photovoltaic cells, convert sunlight directly into electricity. Photovoltaic  technologies are used in a variety of applications. They can be found on  residential and commercial rooftops to power homes and businesses;  utility companies use them for large power stations, and they power  space satellites, calculators, and watches. Concentrated solar power  uses mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight and produce intense heat,  which is used to generate electricity via a thermal energy conversion  process; for example, by using concentrated sunlight to heat a fluid, boil  water with the heated fluid, and channel the resulting steam through a  turbine to produce electricity. Most concentrated solar power technologies  are designed for utility-scale operations and are connected to the  electricity-transmission system. Solar hot water technologies use a  collector to absorb and transfer heat from the sun to water, which is  stored in a tank until needed. Solar hot water systems can be found in  residential and industrial buildings.", "Innovation in solar energy technology takes place across a spectrum of  activities, which we refer to as technology advancement activities, and  which include basic research, applied research, demonstration, and  commercialization. For purposes of this report, we defined basic  research to include efforts to explore and define scientific or engineering  concepts or is conducted to investigate the nature of a subject without  targeting any specific technology; applied research includes efforts to  develop new scientific or engineering knowledge to create new and  improved technologies; demonstration activities include efforts to operate  new or improved technologies to collect information on their performance  and assess readiness for widespread use; and commercialization efforts  transition technologies to commercial applications by bridging the gap  between research and demonstration activities and venture capital  funding and marketing activities.", "Congressional Budget Office, Federal Financial Support for the Development and  Production of Fuels and Energy Technologies (Washington, D.C.: March 2012). as a whole but not necessarily for the firms that invested in the activities.

(See app. II for a full list of the  initiatives). Of these initiatives, 35 of 65 (54 percent) supported solar  projects exclusively and 30 (46 percent) also supported projects that were  not solar. For example, in fiscal years 2010 and 2011, DOE\u2019s Solar Energy  Technologies Program\u2014Photovoltaic Research and Development initiative,  had 263 projects, all of which focused on solar energy. In contrast, in fiscal  years 2010 and 2011, DOE\u2019s Hydrogen and Fuel Research and  Development initiative\u2014which supports wind and other renewable  sources that could be used to produce hydrogen\u2014had 209 projects, 26 of  which were solar projects. Although initiatives support solar energy  technologies, in a given year, they might not support any solar projects. For  example, NSF officials noted that the agency funds research across all  fields and disciplines of science and engineering and that individual  initiatives invite proposals for projects across a broad field of research,  which includes solar-related research in addition to other renewable energy  research. However, in any given year, NSF may not fund proposals that  address solar energy because either no solar proposals were submitted or  the submitted solar-related proposals were not deemed meritorious for  funding based upon competitive, merit-based reviews.", "Although more than half of the agencies\u2019 initiatives supported solar  energy projects exclusively, the majority of projects supported by all 65  initiatives were not focused on solar. As shown in table 1, of the 4,996  total projects active in fiscal years 2010 and 2011 under the 65 initiatives,  1,506 (30 percent) were solar projects, and 3,490 (70 percent) were not  solar projects.", "Agencies\u2019 solar-related initiatives supported different types of solar  energy technologies. According to agency officials responding to our  questionnaire, 47 of the 65 initiatives supported photovoltaic  technologies, and 18 supported concentrated solar power; some  initiatives supported both of these technologies or other solar  technologies. For example, NSF\u2019s CHE-DMR-DMS Solar Energy  Initiative (SOLAR) supports both photovoltaic and concentrated solar  power technologies, including a project that is developing hybrid  organic/inorganic materials to create ultra-low-cost photovoltaic devices  and to advance solar concentrating technologies.", "These initiatives supported solar energy technologies through multiple  technology advancement activities, ranging from basic research to  commercialization.

For example, NASA\u2019s Solar Probe Plus Technology Development  initiative\u2014which tests the performance of solar cells in elevated  temperature and radiation environments such as near the sun\u2014 supported applied research exclusively. In contrast, NASA\u2019s Small  Business Innovations Research/Small Business Technology Transfer  Research initiative\u2014which seeks high-technology companies to  participate in government-sponsored research and development efforts  critical to NASA\u2019s mission\u2014supported all four technology advancement  activities. The technology advancement activities supported by the  initiatives were applied research (47 initiatives), demonstration (41 initiatives), basic research (27 initiatives), and  commercialization (17 initiatives).", "The initiatives supported these technology advancement activities by  providing funding to four types of recipients: universities, industry,  nonprofit organizations, and federal laboratories and researchers. The  initiatives most often supported universities and industry. In many cases,  initiatives provided funding to more than one type of recipient.  Specifically, our analysis showed that of the 65 initiatives, 23 of the  initiatives (35 percent) supported one type of recipient; 21 of the initiatives  (32 percent) provided funding to at least two types of recipients; 17  initiatives (26 percent) supported three types; and 4 initiatives (6 percent)  supported all four.

Agency officials also reported funding  solar projects via cooperative agreements, loans, and other  mechanisms.", "Agency officials reported that the 65 initiatives as a group used multiple  funding mechanisms, but we found that individual agencies tended to use  primarily one or two funding mechanisms. For example, USDA  exclusively used grants, while DOD tended to use contracts. DOE  reported using grants and cooperative agreements almost equally. For  example, DOE\u2019s Solar ADEPT initiative, an acronym for \u201cSolar Agile  Delivery of Electrical Power Technology,\u201d awards cooperative  agreements to universities, industry, nonprofit organizations, and federal  laboratories and researchers. Through a cooperative agreement, the  initiative supported a project at the University of Colorado at Boulder that  is developing advanced power conversion components that can be  integrated into individual solar panels to improve energy yields.

Similarly, the goal of the  Office of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s Engineered Bio-Molecular Nano- Devices and Systems initiative is to provide a low-cost, lightweight,  portable photovoltaic device to reduce the footprint and logistical  burden on the warfighter.", "Artificial photosynthesis. Several initiatives at DOE and NSF reported  having the broad goal of supporting artificial photosynthesis, which  converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into a fuel, such as  hydrogen. For example, one of DOE\u2019s Energy Innovation Hubs, the  Fuels from Sunlight Hub, supports basic research to develop an  artificial photosynthesis system with the specific goals of (1)  understanding and designing catalytic complexes or solids that  generate chemical fuel from carbon dioxide and/or water; (2)  integrating all essential elements, from light capture to fuel formation  components, into an effective system; and (3) providing a pragmatic  evaluation of the system under development.

A number of smaller working groups were  formed as part of this effort, including the Renewable Energy  Conversion Working Group, which includes the coordination of solar  efforts. The working groups are to meet at least once each year, but  according to a DOD official, working group members often meet more  often than that in conjunction with outside conferences and  workshops. The purpose of the meetings is to present each agency\u2019s  portfolio of research efforts and to inform and ultimately leverage  resources across the participating agencies.

The goal of the  SunShot Initiative is to reduce the total installed cost of solar energy  systems by 75 percent. SunShot officials said program managers  from all three offices participate on the SunShot management team,  which holds \u201cbrain-storming\u201d meetings to discuss ideas for upcoming  funding announcements and subsequently vote on proposed funding  announcements. Officials from other DOE offices and other federal  agencies are invited to participate, with coordination occurring as  funding opportunities arise in order to leverage resources. Officials  said meetings may include as few as 25 or as many as 85 attendees,  depending on the type of project and the expertise required of the  attending officials. Additionally, DOE and NSF coordinate through the  SunShot Initiative on the Foundational Program to Advance Cell  Efficiency (F-PACE), which identifies and funds solar device physics  and photovoltaic technology research and development that will  improve photovoltaic cell performance and reduce module cost for  grid-scale commercial applications. The initiatives that reported  participating in SunShot activities also included many that we found to  be overlapping.", "Developing joint strategies; developing mechanisms to monitor,  evaluate, and report results; and defining a common outcome. The  National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) an interagency program,  which includes DOD, DOE, NASA, NSF, and USDA, among others,  was established to coordinate the nanotechnology-related activities  across federal agencies that fund nanoscale research or have a stake  in the outcome of this research. The NNI is directed to (1) establish  goals, priorities, and metrics for evaluation for federal nanotechnology  research, development, and other activities; (2) invest in federal R&D  programs in nanotechnology and related sciences to achieve these  goals; and (3) provide for interagency coordination of federal  nanotechnology research, development, and other activities. The NNI  implementation plan states that the NNI will maximize the federal  investment in nanotechnology and avoid unnecessary duplication of  efforts. NNI includes a subgroup that focuses on nanotechnology for  solar energy collection and conversion. Specifically, this subgroup is  to (1) improve photovoltaic solar electricity generation with  nanotechnology, (2) improve solar thermal energy generation and  conversion with nanotechnology, and (3) improve solar-to-fuel  conversions with nanotechnology.", "In addition to the coordination efforts above, officials reported through our  questionnaire that their agencies coordinate through discussions with  other agency officials or as part of the program and project management  and review processes. Some officials said such discussions and reviews  among officials occur explicitly to determine whether there is duplication  of funding occurring. For example, SETP projects include technical merit  reviews, which include peer reviewers from outside of the federal  government, as well as a federal review panel composed of officials from  several agencies. Officials from SETP also participate in the technical  merit reviews of other DOE offices\u2019 projects. ARPA-E initiatives also go  through a review process that includes federal officials and independent  experts. DOE officials told us that an ARPA-E High Energy Advanced  Thermal Storage review meeting, an instance of potential duplicative  funding was found with an SETP project. Funding of the project through  SETP was subsequently removed because of the ARPA-E review  process, and no duplicative funds were expended.", "In addition to coordinating to avoid duplication, officials from 59 of the 65  initiatives (91 percent) reported that they determine whether applicants  have received other sources of federal funding for the project for which  they are applying. Twenty-one of the 65 initiatives (32 percent) further  reported that they have policies that either prohibit or permit recipients  from receiving other sources of federal funding for projects. Some  respondents to our questionnaire said it is part of their project  management process to follow up with funding recipients on a regular  basis to determine whether they have subsequently received other  sources of funding. For example, DOE\u2019s ARPA-E prohibits recipients from  receiving duplicative funding from either public or private sources, and  requires disclosure of other sources of funding both at the time of  application, as well as on a quarterly basis throughout the performance of  the award. Even if an agency requires that such funding information be  disclosed on applications, applicants may choose not to disclose it. In  fact, it was recently discovered that a university researcher did not identify  other sources of funding on his federal applications as was required and  accepted funding for the same research on solar conversion of carbon  dioxide into hydrocarbons from both NSF and DOE. Ultimately, the  professor was charged with and pleaded guilty to wire fraud, false  statements, and money laundering in connection with the federal  research grant."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided DOD, DOE, EPA, NASA, NSF, and USDA with a draft of this  report for review and comment.

The GAO report on renewable energy- related initiatives identified nearly 700 initiatives that were implemented  in fiscal year 2010 across the federal government, of which 345 initiatives  supported solar energy. For purposes of this report, we only included  those solar-related initiatives that we determined were focused on  research and development (R&D), and commercialization, which we  defined as follows:", "Research and development. Efforts ranging from defining scientific  concepts to those applying and demonstrating new and improved  technologies.", "Commercialization. Efforts to bridge the gap between research and  development activities and the marketplace by transitioning  technologies to commercial applications.", "We did not include those initiatives that focused solely on deployment  activities, which include efforts to facilitate or achieve widespread use of  existing technologies either in the commercial market or for nonmarket  uses such as defense, through their construction, operation, or use.  Initiatives that focus on deployment activities include a variety of tax  incentives. We also narrowed our list to only those initiatives that focused  research on advancing or developing new and innovative solar  technologies.", "Next, we shared our list with agency officials and provided our definitions  of R&D and commercialization. We asked officials to determine whether  the list was complete and accurate for fiscal year 2010 initiatives that met  our criteria, whether those initiatives were still active in fiscal year 2011,  and whether there were any new initiatives in fiscal year 2011. If officials  wanted to remove an initiative from our list, we asked for additional  information to support the removal. In total, we determined that there  were 65 initiatives that met our criteria.", "To identify and describe the key characteristics of solar-related initiatives  implemented by federal agencies, we developed a questionnaire to  collect information from officials of those 65 federal solar energy-related  initiatives. The questionnaire was prepopulated with information that was  obtained from the agencies for GAO\u2019s renewable energy report including  program descriptions, type of solar technology supported, funding  mechanisms, and type of funding recipients. Questions included the type  of technology advancement activities, obligations for solar activities in  fiscal years 2010 and 2011, initiative-wide and solar-specific goals, and  coordination efforts with other solar-related initiatives. We conducted  pretests with officials of three different initiatives at three different  agencies to check that (1) the questions were clear and unambiguous, (2)  terminology was used correctly, (3) the questionnaire did not place an  undue burden on agency officials, (4) the information could feasibly be  obtained, and (5) the questionnaire was comprehensive and unbiased. An  independent GAO reviewer also reviewed a draft of the questionnaire  prior to its administration. On the basis of feedback from these pretests  and independent review, we revised the survey in order to improve its  clarity.", "After completing the pretests, we administered the questionnaire. We  sent questionnaires to the appropriate agency liaisons in an attached  Microsoft Word form, who in turn sent the questionnaires to the  appropriate officials. We received questionnaire responses for each  initiative and, thus, had a response rate of 100 percent. After reviewing  the responses, we conducted follow-up e-mail exchanges or telephone  discussions with agency officials when responses were unclear or  conflicting. When necessary, we used the clarifying information provided  by agency officials to update answers to questions to improve the  accuracy and completeness of the data.", "Because this effort was not a sample survey, it has no sampling errors.  However, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce  errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling errors. For example,  difficulties in interpreting a particular question, sources of information  available to respondents, or entering data into a database or analyzing  them can introduce unwanted variability into the survey results. However,  we took steps to minimize such nonsampling errors in developing the  questionnaire\u2014including using a social science survey specialist for  design and pretesting the questionnaire. We also minimized the  nonsampling errors when collecting and analyzing the data, including  using a computer program for analysis, and using an independent analyst  to review the computer program. Finally, we verified the accuracy of a  small sample of keypunched records by comparing them with their  corresponding questionnaires, and we corrected the errors we found.  Less than 0.5 percent of the data items we checked had random  keypunch errors that would not have been corrected during data  processing. To conduct our analysis, a technologist compared all of the  initiatives and identified overlapping initiatives as those sharing at least  one common technology advancement activity, one common technology,  and having similar goals. A second technologist then completed the same  analysis, and the two then compared their findings and, where they  differed, came to a joint decision as to which initiatives broadly  overlapped on their technology advancement activities, technologies, and  broad goals. If the two technologists could not come to an agreement, a  third technologist determined whether there was overlap. To assess the  reliability of obligations data, we asked officials of initiatives that  comprised over 90 percent of the total obligations follow-up questions on  the data systems used to generate that data. While we did not verify all  responses, on the basis of our application of recognized survey design  practices and follow-up procedures, we determined that the data used in  this report were of sufficient quality for our purposes.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2011 to August  2012 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
