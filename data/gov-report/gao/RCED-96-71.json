The regulations implementing the act designate certain federal agencies, state governments, and tribal authorities as natural resource trustees and authorize them to make claims against responsible parties for natural resource damages. As of April 1995, relatively few claims had been settled and their amount was small compared with the cost of cleaning up sites, but some recent claims have been quite sizeable. These large claims have heightened concern over the potential for future claims.", "Because of your interest in the act\u2019s natural resource damage provisions, you asked us to (1) obtain information on the potential for future federal natural resource damage claims, (2) determine what funds federal agencies have collected from natural resource damage settlements and how these funds have been used, and (3) describe the procedures that federal agencies use to determine the amount of damage claims. In responding to your second question, we limited our analysis, as agreed with your offices, to the five largest natural resource damage settlements that represent nearly four-fifths of the total dollars settled through April 1995."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Under CERCLA, the parties responsible for releasing hazardous substances into the environment are liable for their cleanup. The cleanup of hazardous waste sites is administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under its Superfund program, which is financed mainly by taxes on corporate income, crude oil, and certain chemicals. EPA places the most dangerous sites on the Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) for cleanup actions. As of September 1995, there were 1,290 sites on the NPL.", "In addition to imposing cleanup obligations, CERCLA makes responsible parties liable for the costs of restoring injuries to natural resources resulting from a hazardous substance release. These resources are defined broadly under the law to include land, fish, wildlife, groundwater, and other resources belonging to, managed by, or otherwise controlled by federal or other governmental entities. Only natural resource trustees can file suits under CERCLA against parties responsible for injuring natural resources.", "The law and its implementing regulations designate federal, state, and tribal authorities as trustees for natural resources. The Department of the Interior (Interior) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are the two principal federal trustees for natural resources. Other federal agencies, such as the departments of Agriculture, Defense, and Energy, are the trustees for natural resources on the lands that they manage. States have traditionally acted as trustees for groundwater; the lands they own (e.g., state parks and forests); and fish, game, and other wildlife.", "Under CERCLA and implementing regulations, Indian tribes have certain responsibilities as natural resource trustees. Although trustees\u2019 responsibilities for natural resources are not always exclusive and can overlap, damages cannot be recovered by more than one trustee for injuries to the same resource by the same release. Thus, federal, state, and tribal trustees often coordinate their natural resource damage claims. Superfund money may not be used to restore injuries to natural resources or to conduct natural resource damage assessments. Instead, the trustees may recover monetary compensation (damages) from responsible parties to restore natural resources and to pay for the reasonable costs of assessing any damage to natural resources.", "Several factors limit recoveries for natural resource injuries, according to Interior officials. First, injuries must be traced to particular releases of hazardous substances; second, a viable and solvent responsible party must be found; third, the claim must be filed within the statute of limitations;and fourth, a federal agency must have the financial resources available to assess the damage and develop the information necessary to support a claim. Furthermore, Department of Justice (Justice) officials state that the level of appropriations to fund federal natural resource damage programs is the single most important factor in determining how many sites can be assessed for damages.", "For a site being cleaned up under CERCLA, the trustees can seek damages only for injuries that remain after the cleanup has been completed, according to Justice officials. Residual injuries occur when (1) a cleanup leaves significant contamination in the environment or (2) animal populations have been reduced or wildlife habitat has been destroyed and cannot recover quickly without human intervention. The federal trustees estimate that as of May 1995, the total compensation for residual natural resource injuries at all Superfund sites on the National Priorities List has been less than 1 percent of the total cost to clean up the sites.", "A natural resource damage claim has three basic components: the necessary and reasonable costs of performing the damage assessment; the costs of restoring the resource to the condition that would have existed at the time of the injury (restoration costs), taking into consideration the effects over time of natural and human activities unrelated to the release of contamination; and the costs associated with the loss of resources or of the benefits/services derived from such resources (e.g., a wetland\u2019s provision of habitat for animals and birds or a body of water\u2019s provision of commercial or recreational fishing opportunities) from the date of the injury until the full restoration of the resources and/or services (referred to as interim lost values).", "According to Interior and NOAA officials, the majority of natural resource damage cases involving federal trustees are settled as part of the cleanup agreement negotiated by EPA. Almost half of the settlements require the responsible party to make no separate payment for natural resource damages either because the negotiated cleanup will correct the injury to the natural resource or because no such injuries were found. Justice reports that through the end of April 1995, federal trustees had settled 98 natural resource damage cases for a total of $106 million. Of these settlements, 48 required no payment and the remaining 50 involved monetary recoveries ranging from about $4,000 to $24 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Outlook for Natural Resource Damage Claims", "paragraphs": ["At our request, Interior and NOAA officials developed preliminary estimates of the number of sites where natural resource damage claims involving federal trustees may ultimately reach $5 million or more. The agencies estimate that 60 sites may eventually have claims for damages to natural resources that will equal or exceed $5 million and that up to 20 of these sites may have claims exceeding $50 million. Sixty sites represents less than 5 percent of the current number of Superfund sites.", "Interior and NOAA officials cautioned that their projections are very preliminary and could change for a variety of reasons. Most importantly, as table 1 shows, detailed studies to assess the injuries to natural resources have not even begun at more than half (31) of the 60 sites estimated to have claims of $5 million or more. Furthermore, most of the sites have not been evaluated to determine whether natural resource losses can be traced to specific releases of hazardous substances and whether the parties responsible for these releases are capable of paying damages\u2014prerequisites to pursuing natural resource damage claims. Another factor affecting agencies\u2019 ability to make projections is that many sites will be cleaned up under the Superfund program, so that until EPA determines the scope of its cleanup efforts, the agencies do not know what, if any, residual resource damage will remain to be addressed through a claim. Finally, the value of these claims may ultimately differ from the initial estimates because the claims may be settled through negotiations with responsible parties. To date, almost all natural resource damage claims have been settled without litigation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Restoration Still in the Planning Phase for the Five Largest Sites", "paragraphs": ["Together, the five largest natural resource damage settlements\u2014Elliott Bay in Seattle, Washington; Commencement Bay in Tacoma, Washington; New Bedford Harbor on the Achushnet River in Massachusetts; Montrose located offshore Los Angeles County, California; and the Cantara Loop Train Derailment outside of Dunsmuir, California\u2014totaled $83.8 million, about four-fifths of the total dollar value of all 98 settlements reached as of April 1995. Through July 1995, about 40 percent of the moneys for the five settlements had been collected from the responsible parties. Of these collections, about 11 percent had been disbursed either to reimburse trustees for completed damage assessments or to pay for planning natural resource restorations. However, no other restoration actions had been taken with the moneys collected.", "Collections and disbursements are governed by settlement agreements. Although some of the funds collected from responsible parties are paid directly to the trustees to reimburse them for the costs they incurred in performing damage assessments, most of the funds usually reside in court-administered registry accounts until the trustees are ready to use them. Frequently, settlements are structured so that payments may take place over a period of years. Additionally, CERCLA requires that all participating parties agree to a restoration plan requiring extensive public review before the restoration can begin.", "For each of the five cases, restoration planning was taking place at the time of our review. Settlement dates ranged from December 1991 to March 1994. The reasons that restoration had not yet begun included the need at all sites to develop and obtain public comments on a restoration plan; unexpected cleanup problems at New Bedford, which hampered the planning process; and intervening lawsuits at Cantara Loop, which postponed the disbursement of collected funds.", "Table 2 summarizes the amounts collected and disbursed for the five largest settlements as of July 1995.

It did, however, direct Interior to develop standardized procedures for all trustees to consider in assessing and valuing injuries to natural resources. Accordingly, the regulations include two procedures for valuing natural resource injuries, but the trustees are not required to use these procedures. Because one procedure is limited in scope and the other procedure can be costly and time-consuming to implement, the trustees seldom fully implement either one. Instead, according to Interior and NOAA officials, the trustees most often use an abbreviated procedure that employs readily available site-specific information and scientific literature to quantify damages."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CERCLA\u2019s Requirements", "paragraphs": ["CERCLA directs that the assessment process identify the best available procedures to determine damages, including both direct and indirect injuries, and takes into consideration the ability of the ecosystem to recover on its own. CERCLA further states that the measure of injuries need not be limited by the sums required to restore or replace such resources. For example, the value of a particular service or benefit that was lost to the public while the resource was injured may also be calculated and collected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Procedures Developed in Response to CERCLA\u2019s Requirements", "paragraphs": ["In response to CERCLA\u2019s requirements, Interior developed two valuation procedures: a simplified assessment process that requires the use of minimal data (\u201ctype A\u201d) and a detailed process that requires extensive site-specific data (\u201ctype B\u201d). The use of these damage assessment procedures is optional. If the trustees elect to implement these procedures fully, they are granted a legal presumption of correctness in a court of law that shifts the burden to the defendants to prove otherwise. NOAA officials said that this rebuttable presumption is of limited value, since the trustees still must prove their case. Furthermore, since all but a few cases had been settled without litigation as of December 1995, the trustees have not had to take the time and incur the expense needed to implement these procedures fully. According to NOAA, Interior, and Justice officials, full implementation of the type B procedure is most often not necessary because settlements can be reached without it or it is impractical because of the cost and time involved. According to Interior officials, the trustees use elements of the procedures to the extent necessary to reach a settlement in a cost-effective manner. The type A procedure provides standard methods for conducting simplified natural resource damage assessments through computer modeling. As of December 1995, only one computer model had been developed for the type A procedure. This model can be used only for small incidents of limited duration (e.g., one-time spills) that occur in coastal and marine environments. The model consists of programs to perform mathematical computations and databases containing chemical, biological, and economic information. Although the model requires minimal use of actual field data because it is based on general assumptions, it can be used to assess the injuries to natural resources, quantify these injuries (e.g., the number of fish killed or acres of wetlands contaminated), and determine the damages from many types of discharges or releases. Interior has proposed adding a model for the Great Lakes region to the type A regulations. This model will also be appropriate only for small, one-time incidents.", "Federal trustees said they rarely use the type A approach for CERCLA claims because it applies to few CERCLA damage cases. It has greater application for oil spills, which are addressed under a separate law\u2014the Oil Pollution Act. As of July 1995, NOAA, the primary federal trustee for resources in coastal waters, had used this model to quantify damages at only one site. For a detailed description of this case, see appendix II.", "The type B procedure provides a set of detailed guidelines for conducting extensive site-specific studies to assess the extent of the injury and to value the damages. This procedure can involve the use of various evaluation methods and techniques. For example, the regulations specify various methods for quantifying interim values for lost use. One such technique is the travel cost analysis, which estimates the costs of the travel and extra time required to go to an alternative site rather than the injured site for a purpose such as fishing. Trustees can also use a technique referred to as the contingent valuation method. This method, which is not often used by federal trustees, employs public opinion surveys to establish a dollar value for natural resources that do not have an established market value. For example, if contamination from past mining had contributed to reducing or destroying the salmon population in a stream, members of the public would be asked what price they would be willing to pay to have that stream restored to a condition that would allow the return of salmon.", "Interior and NOAA officials said they seldom use the type B procedure fully because of the expense and time\u2014usually several years\u2014required to perform such studies. Federal officials said that they did not believe that a full type B assessment had ever been performed, but they identified five sites where the procedure had been most fully pursued. An illustration of the type B procedure appears in appendix III."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Abbreviated Procedure Most Often Used", "paragraphs": ["Federal trustees most often use an abbreviated type B procedure to quantify damages. Under this process, they follow the basic steps of the type B procedure\u2014determining the injuries, quantifying their value, and determining the damages. However, instead of employing the time-consuming and costly site-specific surveys and analyses required by the type B procedure, they use readily available off-the-shelf literature and other information to value damages using various evaluation techniques.", "The abbreviated approach is commonly used when, during a negotiation with EPA, a private party wants to settle its liability for both cleanup costs and natural resource damages at the same time. In such situations, EPA or Justice notifies the trustees of the party\u2019s request. The trustees then typically have about 2 to 3 months to assess any injury to natural resources at the site, quantify the government\u2019s claim, and, if possible, obtain a mutually satisfactory settlement agreement with the responsible party. To meet this time frame, the trustees use an abbreviated approach that draws on readily available site-specific and other information to quantify the damages.", "A 1991 settlement illustrates the use of the abbreviated process in the context of settling a party\u2019s liability for natural resource damages as part of the cleanup settlement. In this case, a solvent recovery firm was a responsible party at two different sites, both of which are included on the NPL. The natural resource damage settlement came about after the responsible party asked to resolve its liability for natural resource damages at the same time as it settled its liability for cleanup costs. After being notified of the responsible party\u2019s request, a Fish and Wildlife Service field biologist began to review available information about the potential injuries to resources at the sites. The field biologist identified data that had been gathered from the sites as part of the investigation to identify the appropriate cleanup remedies. These data were sufficient to show that injuries had occurred to federal and state trust resources. The biologist combined the data with other readily available information to quantify the damage using a relatively new technique, the habitat equivalency analysis. This analysis calculates the acreage needed to replace the services that were lost when the habitat was injured rather than calculating the dollar value of the loss, as is usually done. Using this method, the field biologist calculated that 17.5 acres of rare dune and swale lands and 31 acres of wetlands were needed to replace the injured resources."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We transmitted copies of a draft of this report to the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Attorney General for their review and comment.

We did not reproduce these comments in the appendixes.", "The first issue involves the potential for future natural resource damage claims. Interior stressed in its comments that the projected number of sites having natural resource damage claims in excess of $5 million represents a maximum number and that the actual number would likely be smaller. We have qualified our description of the estimate to indicate that it represents an upper bound.", "The second issue involves the use of the funds collected from natural resource damage settlements. All three agencies said that there are site-specific and legal reasons, beyond the control of the trustees, why restoration has not started at the five largest settlement sites. The agencies pointed out that a small experimental restoration project had begun at Commencement Bay. Interior stated that \u201crestoration planning\u201d is an essential part of the restoration process and, as such, should be reported as a restoration action. We believe it is useful, when describing the status of the program, to distinguish between restoration planning and restoration action.

NOAA and the responsible party settled the case for $205,000, which included reimbursement of the assessment\u2019s cost."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "An Application of the Type B Procedure", "paragraphs": ["The complexity of the type B damage assessment procedure is illustrated by the state of Idaho\u2019s actions in 1983 at the inactive Blackbird Mine site, located on national forest lands within the state. The federal claims were filed by Justice in 1993 on behalf of NOAA, the Forest Service, and EPA. Copper, cobalt, and other heavy metals from mining activities at this site have extensively contaminated groundwater and surface water, including 26 miles of the Panther Creek, a tributary of the Salmon River. To perform the assessment, the trustees conducted a series of technical and economic studies to determine the extent of the injury to natural resources, quantify the damages, and develop a plan to restore the injured resources. For example, NOAA commissioned an expert study to identify the effects of the mine\u2019s contamination on the sediments and small animals in the streambeds of the Panther Creek watershed. Part of this study involved taking samples at 16 sites to show the conditions both upstream and downstream of the contamination. The agency also paid consultants to study injuries to fish. These studies found toxic responses (including death) when salmon were exposed to water quality conditions similar to those found at the site. The trustees settled the case in September 1995. Although this settlement is valued at more than $60 million dollars, the only cash payment required from the potentially responsible party (PRP) is approximately $8 million for restoration and reimbursement of past damage assessment costs. The remainder of the settlement is the value of the PRP\u2019s in-kind cleanup and restoration work. The largest portion of the in-kind work is the agreement that the PRP will restore the water quality to support all life stages of the salmon by the year 2002\u2014valued at about $57 million by the trustees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine the number of future federal natural resource damage claims, we interviewed officials at Interior and NOAA. After we discovered that this information was not readily available, Interior offered to survey the agency\u2019s regional offices in order to estimate this number. From the survey, Interior developed a list of sites that it believes may have claims ranging from $5 million to $50 million and over $50 million. NOAA and Justice then reviewed this list for possible overlaps and/or omissions. In addition, we interviewed the Chief of the Mining Section in EPA\u2019s Office of Solid Waste and representatives of the Western Governors Association, the National Association of Attorneys General, and the Mineral Policy Center.", "To obtain information on how settlement dollars are being collected and spent, we focused on the top five CERCLA settlements involving federal agencies, since they accounted for nearly 80 percent of the settlement dollars that Justice had identified as of April 1995. This approach emphasizes larger and possibly more complicated and time-consuming restorations. However, since the information on the smaller settlements resides predominantly with Interior, whose operations are decentralized over numerous field offices, we decided to concentrate our efforts more cost-efficiently on the largest settlements. NOAA, as the lead trustee for four of the five settlements, provided the financial backup records, disbursement request forms, consent decrees, and memorandums of agreement for these settlements. For the fifth settlement, Cantara Loop, which was led by the state of California, the California Department of Fish and Game and the California Attorney General\u2019s Office provided information on the status of the settlement and restoration activities. We interviewed both headquarters and field office trustees for the five sites. We visited Elliott Bay in Seattle, and Commencement Bay in Tacoma, Washington. To obtain the most up-to-date information, we contacted the lead trustees in the field at the five sites as late in the data collection phase of this study as possible. Therefore, all restoration activities are reported as of December 1995.", "In identifying the approaches the trustees used to develop their natural resource damage claims, we reviewed the regulations for implementing CERCLA as well as other documents for developing damage claims. Interior and NOAA briefed us on their methods and explained how they had developed the claims for four sites.
