In 2008, Congress required DOD to compile and review an annual inventory of its contracted services to include the number of contractors providing services to DOD and the functions these contractors performed, and in 2011, amended this statute to require DOD to plan to use that inventory to inform certain department-wide decision making processes. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 mandated GAO to report on the required reviews and plans to use these inventories.", "For this report, GAO assessed the extent to which DOD components (1) reviewed contracts and activities in the fiscal year 2012 inventory of contracted services and (2) developed plans to use the inventory for decision-making. GAO reviewed relevant laws and guidance, reviewed component certification letters from 32 components, and interviewed DOD acquisition, manpower, programming, and budgeting officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) continues to face challenges in assuring that it conducts and reports on the results of its required inventory reviews. As of September 2014, 32 of the 33 components that were required to conduct an inventory review certified that they had done so and generally addressed more of the required reporting elements than in fiscal year 2011. However, GAO found limitations with the inventory review results. For example, the Air Force did not submit a fiscal year 2012 inventory certification letter and the Army's review was incomplete at the time its Secretary signed the certification. Further, components may not have fully identified all instances in which contractors were providing services that are closely associated with inherently governmental functions, a key review objective to help ensure that the DOD is not overly reliant on contractors to support core missions. DOD's March 2014 guidance, which is applicable to the fiscal year 2013 inventory, does not fully address some of the shortcomings GAO identified, including how to identify contracts for review or approaches to ensure that components adequately assess contractor activities. As a result, components may not fully identify instances of contractors providing services that are closely associated with inherently governmental functions.", "A key factor hindering the components' inventory reviews is the lack of accurate and reliable data. DOD has not resolved issues with implementing its planned common data system based on the Army's existing system. Further, in September 2014, DOD initiated a new review, due by December 2014, to identify and develop options to collect these data. This review raises a question of whether DOD will continue to implement a common data system modeled after the Army's system or attempt to develop a new system. DOD continues to lack a plan with timeframes and milestones to measure its progress toward implementing a common data system. These factors jeopardize DOD's goal to have all components, by 2016, collect statutory-required contractor manpower data. Further delays in resolving these issues will undermine the inventory's usefulness.", "The military departments generally have not developed plans to use the inventory of contracted services to facilitate DOD's strategic workforce planning, workforce mix, and budget decision-making processes, as statutorily required. Numerous offices are responsible for the various decision-making processes at the military departments, and the Secretaries of the military departments have not assigned specific responsibility for coordinating among these offices to do so. The absence of officials who are accountable for integrating the use of the inventory leaves the department at continued risk of not complying with the applicable legislative requirements to use the inventory to support management decisions. Internal control standards state that management should assign responsibility to enable an organization to achieve management objectives and to comply with laws."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends DOD revise inventory guidance to improve the review of contract functions, approve a plan of action with milestones and timeframes to establish a common data system to collect contractor manpower data, and designate a senior management official at the military departments to develop plans to use inventory data to inform management decisions.

DOD relies on contractors to  perform functions as varied as professional and management support,  information technology support, medical services, and weapon system  and intelligence support. These contractor personnel constitute a key  component of DOD\u2019s total workforce, which includes DOD active and  reserve forces and DOD civilian employees, and they are vital to helping  DOD meet its mission.

As  part of these efforts, Section 2330a of title 10 of the U.S. Code requires  DOD to annually compile, and the military departments and defense  agencies to review, an inventory of services contracted for or on behalf of  DOD during the preceding fiscal year. This inventory is intended, in part,  to help provide better insight into the number of contractor full-time  equivalents (FTEs) providing services to the department and the functions  they are performing, and determine whether any of these functions  warrant conversion to DOD civilian performance. Further, this section  also requires DOD to undertake certain actions using these inventories.  Specifically, subsections (e) and (f), respectively, direct the secretaries of  the military departments or heads of the defense agencies to, among  other things:  review the inventory to ensure that personal services contracts on the  list are performed under applicable statute and regulation and identify  contracted functions that DOD should consider for conversion; and develop a plan, including an enforcement mechanism and approval  process, to use the inventory for strategic workforce planning,  workforce mix, and budgeting decisions.", "Section 951(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2014 mandated GAO to report on DOD\u2019s implementation of title 10  section 2330a subsections (e) and (f).

We reviewed  DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2012 inventory review guidance, issued on February 4,  2013, which required the military departments and defense agencies to  certify\u2014through submission of a certification letter to the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (P&R)\u2014that  their review was conducted in accordance with subsection (e). The  guidance required components to report on seven elements, including,  among other elements, the contract selection criteria and methodologies  used to conduct the reviews, the extent to which contractors were found  to be performing inherently governmental functions and those closely  associated with inherently governmental functions, and to the extent  necessary, a plan to realign the work to government performance. We  assessed all unclassified fiscal year 2012 inventory review certification  letters submitted by 32 DOD components as of September 2014 to  determine if components addressed the seven elements specified in  DOD\u2019s February 2013 inventory review guidance.

The information DOD is to collect includes, among  other things, the services purchased, the total dollar amount of the  purchase, the form of contracting action used to make the purchase, and  the extent of competition provided in making the purchase. In 2008,  Congress amended section 2330a to add a requirement for the Secretary  of Defense to submit an annual inventory of the activities performed  pursuant to contracts for services on behalf of DOD during the preceding  fiscal year.", "The inventory is to include a number of specific data elements for each  identified activity, including:  the function and missions performed by the contractor;  the contracting organization, the component of DOD administering the  contract, and the organization whose requirements are being met  through contractor performance of the function;  the funding source for the contract by appropriation and operating  agency;  the fiscal year the activity first appeared on an inventory;  the number of contractor employees (expressed as full FTEs) for  direct labor, using direct labor hours and associated cost data  collected from contractors; a determination of whether the contract pursuant to which the activity  is performed is a personal services contract; and a summary of the information required by section 2330a(a) of title 10  of the U.S. Code.", "Within DOD, AT&L, P&R, and the Comptroller have shared responsibility  for issuing guidance for compiling and reviewing the inventory.

As we have  previously reported, the FPDS-NG\u2014the government\u2019s central repository  for contracting data\u2014has several limitations that impact its utility for  purposes of compiling a complete and accurate inventory. For example,  FPDS-NG does not capture the number of contractor FTEs or direct labor  hours used to perform each service, does not capture any services  performed under contracts that are predominately for supplies, and does  not identify more than one type of service purchased for each contract  action. As the inventory is required to identify each activity performed  pursuant to a contract for services, the use of FPDS-NG as the basis for  the data in the DOD components\u2019 inventories does not satisfy the  inventory statute, and limits the usefulness of inventory data in making  management decisions.", "As we previously reported, to obtain better visibility of its service  contractor workforce, the Army developed its Contractor Manpower  Reporting Application (CMRA) in 2005 to collect information on labor-hour  expenditures by function, funding source, and mission supported on  contracted efforts, and has used CMRA as the basis for its inventory.  CMRA captures data directly reported by contractors on services  performed at the contract line item level, including information on the  direct labor dollars, direct labor hours, total invoiced dollars, the functions  performed, and the organizational unit on whose behalf the services are  being performed. In instances where contractors are providing different  services under the same task order, or are providing services at multiple  locations, contractors can enter additional records in CMRA to capture  information associated with each type of service or location.

DOD\u2019s November 2011 plan provided for short-term and long-term  actions intended to meet the requirements of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2330a.

Further, the Army, which represents 30  percent of DOD\u2019s obligations for contracted services, submitted a  certification though its review was incomplete at the time the Secretary of  the Army signed the letter.

However, the  data supporting the certification letter revealed issues at three Army  commands that comprise more than a quarter\u2014or $23.4 billion\u2014of  the Army\u2019s reported invoiced dollars, indicating that the Army may  have overstated the contract functions reviewed. For example, the  certification letter did not include review data from the Army  Acquisition Support Command because their review was not complete  when the Army submitted its certification letter. This command  represented $10.7 billion, or 14 percent, of the Army\u2019s total invoiced  dollars for contracted services reported in fiscal year 2012. Further,  the Army Installation Management Command, which accounted for 30  percent of Army\u2019s reported contractor FTEs performing closely  associated with inherently governmental functions in fiscal year 2011,  transferred responsibility for some of these functions to the Army  Materiel Command. However, officials at the Army Materiel Command  reported that they did not include these transferred functions in the  fiscal year 2012 review, stating that there were too many new  contracts to review in one year.

DOD\u2019s February 2013 guidance for the  fiscal year 2012 inventory required components to review at least 80  percent of the functions associated with all contracts, task orders,  delivery orders, or interagency acquisition agreements listed in the  inventory. The guidance further states that priority shall be given to  contracts previously not reviewed or those that may present a higher  risk of inappropriate performance. However, the guidance does not  specify how to determine the percent of contract functions nor identify  what types of contracts may be at a higher risk of inappropriate  performance. As such, some components specified that they reviewed  a percentage of product service codes, contract obligations, individual  contracts, or contractor FTEs identified in their inventories.

DOD\u2019s  February 2013 guidance for the fiscal year 2012 inventory requires  components to consider the nature of contract performance and  administration, but it does not define what processes may be used to  review functions to determine the types of activities performed. For  example, one component\u2019s review compared inventory data to basic  information in the component\u2019s contract writing system and relied on  the component\u2019s acquisition planning process to determine how the  contract was performed. At another component, the review included  coordination with program managers, contracting officers, contracting  officer representatives, and budget officials and consideration of a  range of data and documents to identify and understand whether the  work performed under the contract included inappropriate functions.  One component we interviewed, the Army, provided additional details  in its guidance on which officials should participate in the review and  how to assess contract activities. The Army requires a checklist at  various points in the contract cycle, including contract award and  modification, to identify activities performed under the contract and  help inform the inventory review process.

The Air Force  failed to submit an inventory review certification letter while the Army  submitted incomplete review data for several major commands. In  addition, DOD components may not have fully identified all instances of  contractors performing closely associated with inherently governmental  functions. DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2013 guidance does not fully address some  of the shortcomings our review identified, including how to identify  contracts to review or the methodologies or approaches to use to ensure  the components\u2019 inventory reviews adequately assess contractor  activities. As a result, components may not fully identify instances of  contractors providing services that are closely associated with inherently  governmental functions. Without a thorough review of contractor  activities, DOD risks becoming overly reliant on contractors to support  core missions.", "Further, it is up to the department to provide a system that is capable of  providing accurate and reliable data to support these reviews. Continued  delays and uncertainties in implementing its planned ECMRA system  hinder achievement of this objective. We had previously recommended  that DOD develop a plan of action with timeframes and milestones to  measure DOD\u2019s progress in implementing a common data system, but  DOD has yet to do so. DOD identified the lack of dedicated resources as  the primary obstacle to resolving technical issues, including help desk  support and establishing common processes across the department.  DOD allocated fiscal year 2015 funding to support this effort; however,  DOD is delaying committing these resources pending the completion of a  review to identify and develop appropriate enterprise solutions, including  short- and long-term options, no later than December 1, 2014. Continued  delays in developing an implementation plan increases the risk that DOD  will be unable to collect the statutorily required data needed to serve as  the basis for DOD\u2019s inventory review process.", "Additionally, the military departments generally do not have plans to use  the inventories for strategic workforce planning, workforce mix and  insourcing decisions, or budget and programming decisions. The same is  generally true for the processes that underlie these decisions, with the  exception of the Army\u2019s efforts to use the inventory and associated review  process to help inform workforce mix and insourcing decisions. One  factor contributing to this condition is the fact that multiple offices are  responsible for performing tasks within their specific area of responsibility,  but there are no offices or individuals that have been specifically tasked to  lead or coordinate efforts to facilitate the use of the inventory within each  of the military departments. Internal control standards state that  management should establish an organizational structure, delegate  authority for key roles, and assign responsibility to enable an organization  to achieve management objectives and to comply with laws. Entrusting  one or more individuals with the responsibility for carrying out these  requirements is likely to produce more positive results quicker than if  DOD continues to engage in piecemeal and ad hoc efforts within each  functional area.
