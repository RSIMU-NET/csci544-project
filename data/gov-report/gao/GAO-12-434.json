These facilities range from facilities of proprietary or concurrent jurisdiction\u0097where authority is shared by federal and state and local police\u0097to facilities of exclusive jurisdiction, where only federal law enforcement has authority. As requested, this report assesses FPS\u0092s efforts to collaborate with state and local law enforcement for assistance in responding to incidents at these federal facilities. GAO reviewed documents on collaboration, GSA and FPS facility data, and GAO\u0092s work on key collaboration practices and internal control standards. GAO also contacted 73 selected state and local law enforcement agencies from geographic jurisdictions of varying population sizes and FPS buildings throughout the United States and interviewed FPS and GSA officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["To collaborate with state and local law enforcement, the Federal Protective Service (FPS) uses memorandums of understanding (MOU), long-standing working relationships, written guidance to FPS staff, joint operations, and other initiatives. For example, FPS has MOUs ranging from sharing radio frequency usage in Alabama, to a mutual aid agreement with the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority in Georgia. In some jurisdictions, such as the suburbs of the District of Columbia, FPS has no MOUs but has regular contact and long-standing mutual aid relationships with state and local law enforcement. To collaborate with state and local law enforcement, FPS has guidance that addresses issues such as the scope of law enforcement authorities on federal property and information sharing among jurisdictions. FPS established regional staff positions intended to improve collaboration with other organizations and has engaged in joint operations with state and local law enforcement. By comparison, other federal organizations with law enforcement responsibilities similar to FPS also use a variety of methods, ranging from the Department of Veterans Affairs\u0092 policy to seek MOUs with state and local law enforcement to the Smithsonian Institution\u0092s established relationships with the Metropolitan D.C. Police and others.", "GAO found that state and local law enforcement organizations it contacted are generally willing to assist with incidents at federal facilities. For example, 48 of 52 respondents from state and local law enforcement agencies GAO contacted about this issue said that they would respond to a call at a federally owned facility; 27 said they had done so since 2007. Overall, the variety of efforts FPS has under way is consistent with the key collaboration practices GAO has previously identified and reflects a reasonable approach to collaboration, especially when combined with the willingness of state and local law enforcement to assist.", "Although FPS has a reasonable approach to state and local collaboration, GAO found issues related to the quality of data exchanged between GSA and FPS on buildings and their locations. Through working groups, GSA is working with FPS to address these data inconsistency issues and is establishing a permanent GSA liaison at FPS\u0092s headquarters to improve data coordination. But as of the end of GAO\u0092s review, FPS still lacked complete data from GSA on the jurisdiction of about one third of the buildings it protects. GSA officials informed GAO that they are making progress with identifying building jurisdictions but were not yet in a position to provide complete information to FPS. These data are important because state and local law enforcement generally has no authority to enforce state and local law on properties of exclusive federal jurisdiction. An additional effect of not having these data is that FPS lacks assurance that in relying on state and local law enforcement to respond to incidents at federal facilities, it is not creating a situation where these entities may be exercising police authority where they lack such authority. As a result, incomplete jurisdictional data leaves FPS and state and local law enforcement less equipped to define and agree to respective roles and responsibilities when there are incidents at federal facilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In conjunction with the revised MOU that is being developed between GSA and FPS, GAO recommends the administrator of GSA ensure that efforts to identify the jurisdictions of all GSA buildings are completed and that these data are provided to FPS.

These federal  facilities range from facilities of proprietary or concurrent jurisdiction\u2014in  which authority is shared by federal and state and local police\u2014to  facilities of exclusive jurisdiction in which only federal law enforcement  has authority. FPS conducts its mission by providing security services  through two types of activities: (1) physical security activities, such as  conducting risk assessments of GSA facilities and recommending risk- based countermeasures to GSA and tenant agencies aimed at reducing  the likelihood and severity of incidents at facilities, and (2) law  enforcement activities, such as responding to incidents, conducting  criminal investigations, and exercising arrest authority.

In testimony to Congress that same year, a  DHS senior official stated that the agency was increasing its reliance on  state and local law enforcement agencies to assist in responding to law  enforcement incidents at these facilities as a way of ensuring that GSA  buildings are adequately protected. While FPS is statutorily responsible  for enforcing federal laws and regulations for the protection of federal  property and persons located on federal property regardless of the  location, state and local law enforcement agencies are responsible for  enforcing state laws and local ordinances within the particular state on  concurrent and proprietary jurisdiction locations. In 2008, we  recommended that FPS clarify roles and responsibilities of local law  enforcement agencies in responding to incidents at GSA-controlled  facilities. Since this report was issued, FPS has issued specific agency  instructions regarding coordination, hired new personnel to oversee  coordination in the regions, and pursued additional memorandums of  understanding (MOU) when needed, such as in the case of clarifying  roles and responsibilities between FPS and state and local law  enforcement.", "You asked us to provide an update on these issues. This report assesses  FPS\u2019s efforts to collaborate with state and local law enforcement for  assistance in responding to incidents at federal facilities. To meet this  objective, we reviewed relevant documentation on federal facility building  data from GSA. In addition, we emailed a self-administered set of 22  structured questions to the heads of 73 state and local law enforcement  agencies in jurisdictions throughout the United States that we determined  had FPS-protected buildings. Our non-random selection of locations  included varying population sizes served by the state and local law  enforcement agencies located in a mixture of urban and rural areas as  defined by the United States Department of Agriculture. We used the  most recent Rural-Urban Continuum Codes. We followed up our emails  with phone calls to these state and local law enforcement agencies to  obtain clarification of the responses as needed. Not every respondent  answered every question. Although the results of our structured  questionnaires cannot be generalized to the universe of jurisdictions that  interact with FPS, the results provide key insights and illustrate how these  organizations can help FPS respond to incidents.", "In 2000, the Federal Protective Service (FPS) transitioned all alarm-monitoring and  dispatching capabilities from several regional control centers to four MegaCenters.

These data include each building number with address; type of  jurisdiction; and square footage and number of personnel to assist FPS to  bill for its services, among other things. FPS personnel then input this  information into its systems electronically.

FPS instructs tenants to contact the MegaCenter  by calling 1-877-4FPS-411 and, in areas where FPS responders cannot  provide an immediate response; tenants are often directed to also dial  911. (See fig. 2.)", "In this report, we assess GSA and FPS\u2019s processes against GAO\u2019s  collaboration key practices and internal control standards. Our previous  work has broadly defined collaboration as any joint activity that is  intended to produce more public value than could be produced when  organizations act alone. We have found that key practices for  collaboration include:  identifying and addressing needs by leveraging resources to support  the common outcome and, where necessary, identifying opportunities  to leverage resources; agreeing upon agency roles and responsibilities; and establishing compatible policies, procedures, and other means to  operate across agency boundaries.", "Additionally, agencies can strengthen their commitment to work  collaboratively by articulating their agreements in formal documents, such  as an MOU. We have also reported that organizations may face a range  of barriers when they attempt to collaborate with other organizations. One  such barrier stems from agencies\u2019 concerns about protecting jurisdiction  over missions. In addition, interagency collaboration is often hindered by  incompatible procedures, processes, data, and computer systems. GAO  has identified standards in facility protection that provide a framework for  guiding agencies\u2019 efforts in this area, such as establishing a means of  coordinating and sharing information with other government entities and  the private sector. Finally, standards for controls over information  processing come from GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government. According to these standards, internal control is a  major part of managing an organization and comprises the plans,  methods, and procedures used to meet missions, goals, and objectives.", "Internal control standards specific for information systems help ensure the  completeness and accuracy of data.", "Some other federal agencies provide their own law enforcement at their  facilities.

FPS prefers a flexible approach of pursuing MOUs only when it  determines they are needed, as opposed to seeking them in all cases.  FPS\u2019s Director stated that FPS has generally not found it necessary to  create written documents, requirements, or MOUs because FPS has  always received good cooperation from state and local law enforcement  agencies when their assistance was needed. For example, in some  jurisdictions such as the suburbs surrounding the District of Columbia,  FPS has no MOUs with state and local law enforcement agencies but has  regular contact and longstanding mutual aid relationships. In addition,  several FPS Regional Directors highlighted the importance of local  response to incidents in and around federal facilities in rural areas  because of the lack of FPS staff at these locations and noted that their  informal relationships have worked successfully because state and local  law enforcement agencies were consistently reliable in their response to  these locations. FPS officials stated that mandating the pursuance of  MOUs with all law enforcement entities would not be in the best interest  of effectiveness and efficiency and would increase the burden on already  task-saturated FPS staff. In addition, it is generally up to state and local  law enforcement agencies as to whether they would be willing to enter  into an MOU with a federal agency.", "With regard to long-standing working relationships and regular contact  with state and local law enforcement, FPS Inspectors and Regional  Directors have developed relationships with state and local law  enforcement agencies and collaborate on different levels. Regional  Directors in all 11 FPS regions stated that their offices routinely had direct  contact with state and local law enforcement agencies at multiple types of  security meetings such as the Federal Executive Boards, joint terrorism  task forces, and regional fusion center meetings.state and local law enforcement agencies and FPS at these meetings  establishes mutually reinforcing or joint strategies designed to help align  activities, core processes, and resources to achieve a common outcome.  For example, FPS participates in monthly meetings of the Law  Enforcement Working Group of the Atlanta Downtown Improvement  District. State and local law enforcement chiefs or deputy chiefs from the  surrounding area, officials from 15 local colleges, and officials from other  federal agencies participate. According to an FPS regional official, the  group acts as a \u201cforce multiplier\u201d to fight crime within the district, which  includes GSA-controlled facilities. FPS officials also have discussions  with state and local law enforcement agencies as needed during  operational planning associated with special events such as the  Olympics, protests, and parades.", "FPS also has guidance for FPS staff and other efforts under way to  collaborate with state and local law enforcement. Regional Directors are  responsible for carrying out FPS policy and guidance, and state that  many of these written policies contain directives for collaboration with  state and local law enforcement. One such directive is FPS Directive  15.1.2.1, Law Enforcement Authority and Powers, which outlines the  scope of law enforcement authority on federal property. Other policies  that reference state and local law enforcement agencies\u2019 coordination  include FPS\u2019s Regional Information Sharing Program, Detention and  Arrest, and Joint Terrorism Task Force Policy, among others. Best  practices and lessons learned are also communicated throughout FPS  regions with weekly regional director conference calls, a regional  director\u2019s council that meets monthly, and yearly Regional Director  conferences.", "In addition to guidance, FPS added three new positions in fiscal year  2011 intended to improve communication and standardization across  FPS by coordinating with federal, state, and local law enforcement  officials to reduce crime at, and potential threats to, federal facilities.  These positions are titled Assistant Director for Field Operations (ADFO)  for west, central, and east operations. The ADFO will be a spokesman for  FPS, representing the Director in his or her designated area.", "Other initiatives employed by FPS include collaborative operations to  avert or obstruct potential threats inside the facility, such as the presence  of unauthorized persons, or potentially disruptive or dangerous activities,  such as potential terrorist operations and criminal activity in and around  federal buildings. Using a combination of law enforcement agencies is  consistent with facility protection key practices to establish a means of  coordinating and sharing information with other government entities.  These operations begin with planning meetings involving FPS and any  other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies that may be  called upon to assist. The operations combine physical security expertise  and law enforcement authority into an enhanced security team to provide  a visual deterrent at FPS-protected facilities. The combined team then  selects a federal building for which FPS has security oversight and  provides a highly visible presence for a select period of time with patrol  operations, explosive detection dog sweeps, and an enhanced security  posture.

At the end of our review,  GSA officials informed us that they had made significant progress  addressing this issue. More specifically, when we reviewed the property  list that GSA provided to FPS in December 2011\u2014which is provided on a  weekly basis\u2014about thirty-four percent of the properties lacked recorded  jurisdictions, including blank and pending jurisdiction categories. (See  table 2.)", "GSA officials stated that they were aware of the numerous blank data  fields pertaining to jurisdictions and that they were trying to individually  assess these fields building by building.

One FPS  regional official stated that GSA does not keep the property list as current  as FPS needs; changes occur but are not captured by GSA. For example,  the official stated that in his region, agencies sign leases about a dozen  times a year without FPS\u2019s knowledge or timely notice. FPS officials  noted that the overall number could be greater across all FPS regions.  The current MOU between GSA and FPS calls for a pre-lease  assessment of the building by FPS, but these assessments cannot be  completed if FPS is unaware of the new lease. Another FPS regional  official stated that the region uses its own building list, which is updated  by FPS regularly as information becomes available. A third FPS official  stated that the GSA list does not capture changes to buildings with a  security risk level of 1 or 2 as quickly as FPS needs. A fourth regional  official stated that the region relies on a combination of building lists from  GSA, FPS provided lists, and its own regional list. This official stated  these lists often do not reconcile because of changes that are not  updated in a timely manner.

GSA stated that only recently did it have the ability to cross- reference and address these differences, and is working with FPS to  correct them.

We also reviewed relevant federal facility building data from the  General Services Administration (GSA) including for example, each  building number with address; type of jurisdiction; and square footage and  number of personnel, among other things. We interviewed FPS officials  throughout the regions, and FPS and GSA officials at their respective  agency\u2019s headquarters in Washington, D.C., regarding the processes and  procedures for exchanging these data. We reviewed the building data for  completeness, but did not verify the accuracy of the information contained  for each building. To ensure we were assessing the exact data that FPS  uses, we requested data samples for fiscal year 2011 from both GSA and  FPS and replicated the jurisdiction category results. We assessed the  extent to which there were missing jurisdiction assignments by reviewing  pending and blank jurisdiction categories. We then assessed GSA and  FPS\u2019s processes for managing these data against GAO\u2019s Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government, Homeland Security: Further  Actions Needed to Coordinate Federal Agencies\u2019 Facility Protection  Efforts and Promote Key Practices, and Results-Oriented Government:  Practices That Can Help Enhance and Sustain Collaboration among  Federal Agencies.  According to GAO\u2019s standards for internal control in  the federal government, internal control is a major part of managing an  organization and comprises the plans, methods, and procedures used to  meet missions, goals, and objectives. Internal control, which is  synonymous with management control, helps government program  managers achieve desired results through effective stewardship of public  resources. Control activities\u2014such as reconciliations performed to verify  data completeness; an agency\u2019s data entry design features contribute to  data accuracy; data validation and editing performed to identify erroneous  data; and erroneous data that is captured, reported, investigated, and  promptly corrected\u2014contribute to data accuracy and completeness. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report.", "For comparison with FPS\u2019s coordination efforts, we contacted three  federal agencies that provide law enforcement at their facilities\u2014the  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the National Park Service (NPS)  within the Department of the Interior, and the Smithsonian Institution (SI).  To gain insight into FPS, VA, SI, and NPS coordination with state and  local law enforcement agencies, we emailed a self-administered set of 22  structured questions to the heads of 73 state and local law enforcement  agencies. Our non-random selection of locations included varying  population sizes located in a mixture of metro, urban, and rural areas as  defined by the United States Department of Agriculture using the most  recent Rural-Urban Continuum Codes for jurisdictions that we determined  had FPS, and/or VA, NPS, and SI buildings throughout the United States.  The state and local law enforcement agencies we chose included a mix of  police, sheriff, highway patrol agencies in each of the 11 FPS regions. We  also followed up our email with phone calls to these state and local law  enforcement agencies. Not every respondent answered every question  related to coordination with FPS, VA Police, U.S. Park Police, and SI  police. Additionally, the responses had varying levels of staff within the  state and local law enforcement organization reply for the organization.  Furthermore, the structured questions were related to coordination with  the Federal Protective Service, Veterans Affairs Police, Smithsonian  police, and the U.S. Park Police. Although the results of our questions  cannot be generalized to the universe of jurisdictions that have interaction  with FPS, the results provide key insights on how state and local law  enforcement collaborates with FPS to assist with federal facility  protection. These results illustrate how FPS relies on these organizations  to respond to incidents and collectively, how this multi-faceted approach  enabled us to make conclusions whether FPS\u2019s approach is reasonable.", "Further, we interviewed officials at two FPS MegaCenters\u2014the four  regional dispatch centers within FPS that are the primary focal points for  initial incident notification\u2014and toured the Suitland, Md., MegaCenter  facility. We attended an FPS operational exercise in the District of  Columbia. We also interviewed each of the 11 FPS Regional Directors to  determine how their region coordinates with state and local law  enforcement entities for the properties in their jurisdiction. We interviewed  GSA officials at GSA headquarters in the District of Columbia. We  obtained relevant documents pertaining to VA, NPS, and SI collaboration  with state and local law enforcement and interviewed agency officials.  Lastly, we reviewed prior GAO work, including reports on key practices in  interagency collaboration and facility protection.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2011 to March 2012  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the General Services Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, David Sausville (Assistant  Director), Maren McAvoy, and George Depaoli made key contributions to  this report.
