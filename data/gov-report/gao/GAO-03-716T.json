Over the past several years, the federal acquisition  environment has changed dramatically. Spending for services has  increased significantly and now represents more than 60 percent of all  federal contract spending. At the same time, there has been a reduction in  the size of the acquisition workforce, and the use of alternative contracting  approaches has been growing. The purpose of SARA is to provide federal  agencies with additional tools for addressing these developments. We fully  support this objective, and look forward to continuing to work with this  Committee and others in finding ways to promote more efficient and  effective acquisitions.", "In my testimony today, I will:    Summarize recent trends in contract spending and in the acquisition    Discuss our views on selected provisions of SARA based on relevant GAO  reports."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Contract Spending and Workforce Trends", "paragraphs": ["We recently issued several reports on acquisition spending and workforce  trends.

At six agencies,  procurement of services exceeded 75 percent of their total spending on  contracts; at one agency, the Department of Energy, nearly 100 percent of  total spending via contracts was for services (see fig. 1).", "Spending on services could increase even further, at least in the short  term, given the President\u2019s recent request for additional funds for defense  and homeland security.

To deliver training effectively, leading organizations typically  prioritize and set requirements for those in need of training to ensure their  training reaches the right people. Agencies we reviewed had developed  specific training requirements for their acquisition workforce and had  efforts underway to make training available and raise awareness of major  acquisition initiatives.

Further, some of these contracts operate under revolving fund statutes  that limit the use of fees to the authorized purposes of the funds.", "Quality training is important, and we recognize the need for adequate  funds for training.

It is critical that a client and  contractor have a clear understanding of what they are trying to achieve.", "Incentives are defined.

A client\u2019s top executives  need to provide contractors with the authority needed to carry out  solutions, since change from the outside is often met with resistance.

Excluding the energy  industry, we found limited references to companies or state agencies that  use or have used the share-in-savings concept. In addition, there are few  documented examples of share-in-savings contracting in the federal  government. Officials in federal agencies we spoke with noted that such  arrangements may be difficult to pursue given potential resistance and the  lack of good baseline performance data. In addition, in previous work,  Department of Energy headquarters officials told us they believe such  contracts can be best used when federal funding is unavailable.", "To achieve the potential benefits from the use of share-in-savings  contracting, it may be worthwhile to examine ways to overcome potential  issues. For example, in a letter to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy  in March of this year, we recognized that share-in-savings contracting  represents a significant change in the way the federal government acquires  services. To address this challenge, we underscored the need for the  Office of Federal Procurement Policy to develop guidance and policies  that could ensure that (1) appropriate data are collected and available to  meet mandated reporting requirements regarding the effective use of  share-in-savings contracting, and (2) members of the federal acquisition  workforce understand and appropriately apply this new authority."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Section 401: Additional Incentives for Use of Performance-Based Contracting for Services", "paragraphs": ["Section 401 authorizes agencies to treat a contract or task order as being  for a commercial item if it is performance-based\u2014that is, it describes each  task in measurable, mission-related terms, and identifies the specific  outputs\u2014and the contractor provides similar services and terms to the  public.

If section 401 is enacted, we believe  that clear guidance will be needed to ensure effective implementation.

Section 213 appears to address each of these criteria.  First, although protests currently may be filed with the procuring agencies,  section 213 would provide for a more effective agency-level protest  process by requiring that an agency suspend, or \u201cstay,\u201d the procurement  until the protest is resolved. Second, the process would be relatively  expeditious because decisions would be required within 20 working days.  Having an expeditious process at the agency is especially important  because section 213 would provide for a stay both during the agency-level  protest and then during any subsequent GAO protest. It should be noted,  though, that 20 working days may not be adequate for a thorough review,  particularly in complex procurements.
