In addition, as of September 30, 2008, the federal government did not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and compliance with significant laws and regulations due to numerous material weaknesses. Moreover, financial management system problems continue to hinder federal agency accountability. The federal government still has a long way to go, but over the years, progress has been made in improving federal financial management. For example, audit results for many federal agencies have improved; federal financial system requirements have been developed; and accounting and reporting standards have continued to evolve to provide greater transparency and accountability over the federal government's operations, financial condition, and fiscal outlook. In addition, the federal government issued a summary financial report which is intended to make the information in the Financial Report of the U.S. Government more understandable and accessible to a broader audience. The federal government's response to the financial markets crisis and economic downturn has created new federal accountability, financial reporting, and debt management challenges. Such challenges will require utmost attention to ensure (1) that sufficient internal controls and transparency are established and maintained for all market stabilization and economic recovery initiatives; (2) that all related financial transactions are reported on time, accurately, and completely; and (3) these initiatives are effectively and efficiently financed. Moreover, while policymakers are currently understandably focused on efforts directed toward market stabilization and economic growth, once stability in financial markets and the economic downturn are addressed, attention will have to be turned with the same level of intensity to the serious longer-term challenges of addressing the federal government's large and growing structural deficits and debt. Finally, the federal government should consider the need for further revisions to the current federal financial reporting model to recognize its unique needs. A broad reconsideration of issues, such as the kind of information that may be relevant and useful for a sovereign nation, could lead to reporting enhancements that might help provide the Congress and the President with more useful financial information to deliberate and monitor strategies to address the nation's long-term fiscal challenges."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to discuss our report on the  U.S. government\u2019s consolidated financial statements for fiscal years 2008  and 2007.

These factors, if implemented successfully, help provide a solid  foundation for improving accountability over federal government  operations and routinely producing sound cost and operating performance  information. Over a decade has passed since FFMIA was enacted and the  majority of agencies still do not have reliable, useful, and timely financial  information with which to make informed decisions and ensure  accountability on an ongoing basis. In fiscal year 2008, auditors reported  14 out of 24 CFO Act agencies\u2019 financial management systems were not in  substantial compliance with one or more of the three FFMIA requirements  and the lack of compliance with federal financial management systems  requirements was the most frequently cited deficiency of the three FFMIA  requirements.", "In addition, on January 9, 2009, OMB issued a revised Circular No. A-127,  Financial Management Systems, which redefines federal financial  management systems requirements. We are concerned that the revised  circular substantially reduces the scope and rigor of compliance testing  for agency financial management systems, omits compliance with the SGL  from the compliance indicators, and eliminates existing federal financial  management systems requirements for the financial portion of mixed  systems. Without independent auditor assessments of the financial portion  of mixed systems\u2019 capabilities and compliance with these requirements,  the Congress and agency management cannot be assured that data in these  systems and not included in agency financial statements are reliable,  resulting in increased risk of making operating, budget, and policy  decisions based on faulty data reported in the financial portion of mixed  systems\u2014such as benefit payment, logistics, and acquisition systems\u2014 which are the source of data for the core financial system. Because of the  importance of such data to routinely providing reliable, useful, and timely  financial information for managing day-to-day operations, we believe it is  important to retain financial management systems requirements for the  financial portion of mixed systems and require auditors to assess  compliance against such requirements. Further, the revised circular raised  additional concerns because it does not definitively establish  responsibilities for the agency, service provider, and auditor for assessing  compliance with FFMIA when utilizing a shared service provider under  OMB\u2019s financial management line of business (line of business) initiative.", "To reduce the cost and improve the outcome of federal financial  management systems implementations, OMB continues to move forward  on the line of business initiative, by leveraging common standards and  shared solutions. OMB anticipates that the line of business initiative will  help achieve the goals of improving the cost, quality, and performance of  financial management operations. As we reported in May 2009, although  OMB has made progress in implementing the line of business initiative, the  initiative focuses mainly on core financial systems and extensive work  remains before the goals of the initiative are achieved. For example, as  we previously recommended in 2006, OMB has yet to finalize a financial  management system concept of operations, which provides the foundation  to guide line of business-related activities. In addition, development of a  migration timeline reflecting agencies\u2019 commitment for migrating to  shared service providers has not yet been completed. Consistent and  effective implementation of FFMIA will be needed to improve the  capability of agencies\u2019 financial management systems to produce reliable,  useful, and timely information for management to efficiently and  effectively manage the day-to-day operations of the federal government  and ultimately provide accountability to taxpayers and the Congress\u2014a  key goal of the CFO Act and FFMIA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Actions Create New Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2009 (EESA), which  authorized the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP); the Housing and  Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA); and the American Recovery and  Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act), enabled the federal government  to take certain unprecedented actions involving hundreds of billions of  dollars to stabilize the financial markets and promote economic recovery.  The nature and magnitude of these actions have created new challenges  for federal accountability, financial reporting, and debt management.

Under HERA,  the federal government placed the Federal National Mortgage Association  (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie  Mac) into conservatorship.

In our most recent report on TARP, we acknowledged  Treasury\u2019s efforts to continue to improve the integrity, accountability, and  transparency of TARP transactions; however, we concluded that some  areas require ongoing attention. Among the challenges is the need to  properly measure and report each related purchase and loan transaction.  The challenges of estimating and managing costs and measuring and  reporting asset and liability values under TARP and other recent initiatives  are likely to be even greater than those associated with more traditional  federal lending activities given the fact that little, if any, historical  information is available for certain transactions from which to base  expected future cash flows. While contractual provisions may set forth  required payments for certain transactions such as preferred stock  purchases and debt obligations, for a substantial number of federal  transactions under TARP and HERA there is a significant amount of  uncertainty regarding the extent to which actual repayments to the federal  government will be made. There is simply little or no history for certain of  these large and unprecedented transactions. Moreover, the instability and  dramatic changes in financial markets, such as occurred within the last  year, make it very difficult to estimate the values of these assets and  liabilities with any level of certainty. Therefore, it is critically important for  adequate internal controls to be in place to help ensure that the cost of all  TARP and other loans and loan guarantees are properly measured and  reported and losses to the federal government minimized.", "Regarding Recovery Act programs, major accountability and reporting  challenges stem from the fact that nearly half of the approximate $580  billion of additional federal spending associated with the Recovery Act  will flow to nonfederal entities. In our April 2009 report on the Recovery  Act, we reported that certain states and the District of Columbia are taking  various approaches to ensure that internal controls exist to manage risk  including assessing known risks associated with spending under the  Recovery Act and developing plans to address those risks. However,  officials in most of the states we reviewed and the District of Columbia  expressed concerns about the lack of Recovery Act funding provided for  accountability and oversight. Such concerns are important given that the  Recovery Act includes many programs that are new or new to the  recipient and, even for existing programs, the sudden increase in funds is  outside of normal cycles and processes. Given that the majority of  Recovery Act funding was initially projected to be made available to states  and localities in 2009, 2010, and 2011, with lesser amounts available  beyond that, actions taken now would significantly improve the ability of  nonfederal entities to provide effective accountability over federal funding  under the Recovery Act. We made several recommendations to OMB in  April 2009 to help improve accountability and oversight of Recovery Act  spending, including modifying the single audit process to be a more timely  and effective audit and oversight tool for the Recovery Act. We are also  issuing our July 2009 report on the Recovery Act today. Going forward, it  will be important for qualified personnel at all levels of government to  implement proper controls and accountability measures to help ensure  separate tracking and clear reporting of this spending from the federal  level to the nonfederal recipients.", "Over $200 billion of the Recovery Act stimulus effort takes the form of tax  expenditures\u2014reductions in tax liabilities that result from preferential tax  provisions such as tax exclusions, credits, and deductions. GAO has long  been concerned that tax expenditures represent a substantial federal  commitment yet lack the level of transparency and accountability  associated with federal outlays.

Since the onset of the current recession in December 2007, the gap  between revenues and outlays has grown\u2014even before any policy  response. Because Treasury must borrow the funds disbursed, actions  taken to stabilize financial markets\u2014including aid to the auto industry\u2014 increase borrowing and so add to the federal debt.

Issuing debt  through regular and predictable offerings lowers borrowing costs because  investors and dealers value liquidity and certainty of supply. The mix of  securities, which changes regularly as new debt is issued, is important  because it can have a significant influence on the government\u2019s interest  payments. Longer-term securities typically carry higher interest rates\u2014or  cost to the government\u2014primarily due to concerns about future inflation.  However, they can also offer the Treasury certainty about what its  payments will be.", "We believe the large share of the debt that must be rolled over in the next  few years is cause for concern. Market experts generally believe that  Treasury needs to increase the average maturity of its debt portfolio. Large  and growing borrowing needs put a premium on understanding both  current and future demand for U.S. Treasury securities. To support  Congress\u2019 oversight of the use of TARP funds, we have work under way  looking at how Treasury has financed borrowing associated with the  financial market instability and analyzing additional ideas for debt  management that might assist Treasury going forward. We encourage  Treasury to explore a range of borrowing options that could support its  lowest-cost-over-time borrowing objective and to take a strategic  approach to the analysis of various options\u2014recognizing that the federal  government faces a long-term sustained increase in borrowing needs.", "As I noted, the actions to restore financial market stability and economic  growth take place within the context of the already serious longer-term  fiscal condition of the federal government. While policymakers have been  understandably focused on dealing with these financial market and  economic growth challenges, attention also needs to be given to the long- term challenges of addressing the federal government\u2019s large and growing  structural deficits and debt.", "As discussed in the Financial Report, the federal government is on an  unsustainable long-term fiscal path. The Statement of Social Insurance, for  example, shows that projected scheduled benefits exceed earmarked  revenues for social insurance programs (e.g., Social Security and  Medicare) by approximately $43 trillion in present value terms over the  75-year projection period. GAO also prepares long-term fiscal simulations  that are based on the Social Security and Medicare Trustees\u2019 projections,  but provide a more comprehensive analysis of fiscal sustainability because  they include revenue and expenditure projections for all other government  programs. Our most recent long-term fiscal simulation was issued in  March 2009. Figures 3, 4, and 5 below show the results of GAO\u2019s March  2009 simulations.", "A quantitative measure of the long-term fiscal challenge measure is called  the \u201cfiscal gap.\u201d The fiscal gap is the amount of spending reduction or tax  increases that would be needed today to keep debt as a share of GDP at or  below today\u2019s ratio. The fiscal gap is an estimate of the action needed to  achieve fiscal balance over a certain time period such as 75 years. Another  way to say this is that the fiscal gap is the amount of change needed to  prevent the kind of debt explosion implicit in figure 5. The fiscal gap can  be expressed as a share of the economy or in present value dollars.", "Under GAO\u2019s alternative simulation, closing the fiscal gap would require  spending cuts or tax increases, or some combination of the two, equal to  8.1 percent of the entire economy over the next 75 years, or about $63  trillion in present value terms. To put this in perspective, closing the gap  solely through revenue increases would require an increase in today\u2019s  federal tax revenues of about 44 percent, or to do it solely through  spending reductions would require a reduction in today\u2019s federal program  spending (i.e., in all spending except for interest on the debt held by the  public, which cannot be directly controlled) of about 31 percent to be  maintained over the entire 75-year period."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Federal Financial Reporting Model", "paragraphs": ["The Financial Report provides useful information on the government\u2019s  financial position at the end of the fiscal year and changes that have  occurred over the course of the year. However, in evaluating the nation\u2019s  fiscal condition, it is critical to look beyond the short-term results and  consider the overall long-term financial condition and long-term fiscal  challenge of the government\u2014that is, the sustainability of the federal  government\u2019s programs, commitments, and responsibilities in relation to  the resources expected to be available.", "Accounting and financial reporting standards have continued to evolve to  provide greater transparency and accountability over the federal  government\u2019s operations, financial condition, and fiscal outlook. However,  it is appropriate to consider the need for further revisions to the current  federal financial reporting model, which could affect both consolidated  and agency reporting. While the current reporting model recognizes some  of the unique needs of the federal government, a broad reconsideration of  the federal financial reporting model could address the following types of  questions:    Do traditional financial statements convey information transparently?    What is the role of the balance sheet in the federal government  reporting model?", "What kind of information is most relevant and useful for a sovereign  nation?", "How should items that are unique to the federal government, such as  social insurance commitments and the power to tax, be reported?", "In addition, further enhancements to accounting and financial reporting  standards are needed to effectively convey the long-term financial  condition of the U.S. government and annual changes therein. For  example, the federal government\u2019s financial reporting should be expanded  to disclose the reasons for significant changes during the year in  scheduled social insurance benefits and funding. It should also include (1)  a Statement of Fiscal Sustainability that provides a long-term look at the  fiscal sustainability of all federal programs including social insurance  programs, and (2) other sustainability information, including  intergenerational equity and an analysis of changes in sustainability during  the year. Recently, the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board  (FASAB) unanimously approved a proposed new standard on fiscal  sustainability reporting.  Also, FASAB is currently considering possible  changes to accounting for social insurance.", "In addition, there is a need for a combined report on the performance and  financial accountability of the federal government as a whole. This report  would include, among other things, key outcome-based national indicators  (e.g., economic, security, social, and environmental), which could be used  to help assess the nation\u2019s and other governmental jurisdictions\u2019 position  and progress.", "Engaging in a reevaluation of the federal financial reporting model could  stimulate discussion that would bring about a new way of thinking about  the federal government\u2019s financial and performance reporting needs. To  understand various perceptions and needs of the stakeholders for federal  financial reporting, a wide variety of stakeholders from the public and  private sector should be consulted. Ultimately, the goal of such a  reevaluation would be reporting enhancements that can help the Congress  deliberate on strategies to address the federal government\u2019s challenges,  including its long-term fiscal challenge."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Closing Comments", "paragraphs": ["In closing, it is important that the progress that has been made in  improving federal financial management activities and practices be  sustained by the new administration. Across government, financial  management improvement initiatives are under way, and if effectively  implemented, they have the potential to greatly improve the quality of  financial management information as well as the efficiency and  effectiveness of agency operations. However, the federal government still  has a long way to go before realizing strong federal financial management.  For DOD, the challenges are many. We are encouraged by DOD\u2019s efforts  toward addressing its long-standing financial management weaknesses  and its efforts to achieve auditability. Consistent and diligent top  management oversight toward achieving financial management  capabilities, including audit readiness, will be needed. The civilian CFO  Act agencies must continue to strive toward routinely producing not only  annual financial statements that can pass the scrutiny of a financial audit,  but also quarterly financial statements and other meaningful financial and  performance data to help guide decision makers on a day-to-day basis.  Federal agencies need to improve the government\u2019s financial management  systems to achieve this goal.", "The nature and magnitude of actions the federal government has taken to  stabilize the financial markets and promote economic recovery have  created new challenges involving accountability, financial reporting, and  debt management. A great amount of attention will need to be devoted to  ensuring (1) that sufficient internal controls and transparency are  established and maintained for all stabilization and recovery initiatives; (2)  that all related financial transactions are reported on time, accurately, and  completely; and (3) these initiatives are effectively and efficiently  financed. Importantly, the recent increase in federal debt that has resulted  largely from the federal government\u2019s response to the crisis in financial  markets and the economic downturn must be viewed within the context of  the nation\u2019s unsustainable long-term fiscal path. The longer action is  delayed to address long-term fundamental fiscal problems, the greater the  likelihood that actions to address such problems will be disruptive and  destabilizing. The federal government faces increasing pressures to  address the fiscal problems of Social Security and Medicare, yet a  shrinking window of opportunity for phasing in adjustments. GAO is  committed to sustained attention to this critically important matter.", "Given the federal government\u2019s current financial condition and the  nation\u2019s serious long-term fiscal challenge, the need for the Congress and  federal policymakers and management to have reliable, useful, and timely  financial and performance information is greater than ever. Sound  decisions on the current and future direction of vital federal government  programs and policies are more difficult without such information. We  also will continue to stress the need for development of more meaningful  financial and performance reporting on the federal government.", "Finally, I want to emphasize the value of sustained congressional interest  in these issues, as demonstrated by this Subcommittee\u2019s leadership.
