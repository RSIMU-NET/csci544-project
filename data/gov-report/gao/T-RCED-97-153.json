At the end of 3 years, the agency had spent about $4 million. However, the Forest Service has spent another 7 years and $9 million (1) studying and restudying issues without establishing a clear sequence or schedule for their timely resolution; (2) attempting to reconcile its older emphasis on producing timber with its more recent emphasis on sustaining wildlife and fish; and (3) attempting to reach agreement with federal regulatory agencies on an acceptable level of risk to individual natural resources, such as endangered and threatened species, water, and air. Our Forest Service-wide work identified that these factors have contributed to inefficiency in decision-making throughout the agency. In revising the Tongass forest plan, the Forest Service has incurred unexpected delays and high costs to better ensure that the new plan is legally defensible, scientifically credible, and able to sustain the forest\u2019s resources. Here, as elsewhere, developing a forest plan to avoid or prevail against legal challenges has become increasingly time-consuming and costly. On the Tongass, insufficient data and scientific uncertainty have hindered the development of a plan that can ensure the maintenance of viable populations of animals. As an option to further study and planning without resolution, the Forest Service may be able to move forward with a decision conditioned on an adequate monitoring component and modify the decision when new information is uncovered or when preexisting monitoring thresholds are crossed. However, as our report states, the Forest Service has historically failed to live up to its own monitoring requirements. As a result, federal regulatory agencies and other stakeholders continue to insist that the Forest Service prepare increasingly time-consuming and costly detailed environmental analyses and documentation before making a decision\u2014effectively front-loading the process and perpetuating the cycle of inefficiency.", "While the agency is being held accountable for developing a plan that may be legally defensible, scientifically credible, and able to sustain the forest\u2019s resources, it is not being held accountable for making a timely, orderly, and cost-effective decision.

However, the costs of the Forest Service\u2019s indecision in revising the Tongass plan are being borne, not by the decisionmakers, but rather by the American taxpayer and by the members of the public who are concerned about maintaining the forest\u2019s diverse species but are precluded from forming reasonable expectations about the forest\u2019s health over time and/or are economically dependent on the Tongass but are uncertain about the future availability of its uses.", "Mr. Chairman, our report identifies a framework for breaking the cycle of inefficiency by improving the Forest Service\u2019s decision-making.

For example, a scoping process begun in 1987 identified wildlife and fish habitats as two issues needing special attention in revising the Tongass plan. The Forest Service team revising the plan established a committee\u2014the \u201cviable population\u201d committee\u2014to study the viability of various old-growth-dependent species. In 1992, this committee produced a draft strategy for preserving wildlife, which was reviewed twice\u2014first by a wildlife ecologist from the Forest Service\u2019s Pacific Northwest Research Station (a research arm of the agency) and later in a report by the research station, which contained 18 individual scientific reviews and a legal review. Also in 1992, the Forest Service team revising the plan performed its own study of the viability of wildlife and fish. This study, which included an examination of the viable population committee\u2019s strategy, was also reviewed by the research station.", "In 1994, a new regional forester expanded the team revising the plan by adding research scientists from the research station and tasked them with gathering information on five issues, including wildlife viability. The agency then convened six panels of experts and scientists to assess the risk each of the nine alternatives presented in a third draft of a revised Tongass plan could pose to particular species of wildlife. Three more panels were convened to assess the potential risks posed by these alternatives to terrestrial mammals, fish and riparian areas, and old-growth forests. In March 1997, the Forest Service reconvened the panels to assess (1) the alternatives, some of which had been modified since the third draft was released for public comment in April 1996, and (2) the potential risks to certain species of fish and wildlife posed by a new preferred alternative. Today, the issue of wildlife viability has still not been resolved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agreement on Which Uses to Emphasize Has Been Difficult to Reach", "paragraphs": ["The Forest Service also has had difficulty reconciling its older emphasis on producing timber with its more recent emphasis on sustaining wildlife and fish under its broad multiple-use and sustained-yield mandate. Resolving disagreements over this issue within the agency delayed the Tongass forest plan\u2019s revision.", "Our report shows that during the last 10 years, the Forest Service has increasingly shifted the emphasis under its broad multiple-use and sustained-yield mandate from consumption (primarily producing timber) to conservation (primarily sustaining wildlife and fish). This shift is taking place in reaction to requirements in planning and environmental laws and their judicial interpretations\u2014reflecting changing public values and concerns\u2014together with social, ecological, and other factors. The increasing emphasis on sustaining wildlife and fish sometimes conflicts with the agency\u2019s older emphasis on producing timber and underlies the Forest Service\u2019s inability to achieve the goals and objectives for timber production in many of the first forest plans, including the 1979 Tongass plan.", "When the Forest Service began to revise the Tongass plan in 1987, it was just beginning, as an agency, to shift its emphasis from producing timber to sustaining wildlife and fish. This shift has not been smooth and has contributed significantly to the delays and costs incurred in revising the plan.", "For example, 3 years after the Forest Service began to revise the Tongass forest plan, the Congress enacted the Tongass Timber Reform Act of 1990. Among its provisions, the act (1) eliminated a special funding provision in a 1980 act (the Alaska National Interests Lands Conservation Act) intended to maintain the timber supply from the Tongass to the dependent industry; (2) directed the agency to maintain buffers of standing timber between designated streams and timber harvest areas to protect fish and wildlife habitat, such as spawning ground for salmon; (3) designated additional wilderness areas within the forest; and (4) designated 12 additional special management areas in which harvesting timber and building roads are generally prohibited. The 1990 act also unilaterally made nine modifications to long-term timber sale contracts held by two companies\u2014the Alaska Pulp Corporation and the Ketchikan Pulp Company\u2014that harvested large amounts of timber in the forest. Among other things, the act modified the contracts to eliminate disproportionately high harvests of old-growth timber.", "Other events reflecting the Forest Service\u2019s increasing emphasis on sustaining wildlife and fish also delayed the agency\u2019s revision of the Tongass forest plan. For example, in a 1988 decision on an appeal of the approved forest plan for the Flathead National Forest in northwestern Montana, the Associate Chief of the Forest Service directed the regional forester to leave 10 percent of certain watersheds in old-growth areas large enough to provide habitat for certain species until the regional forester completed additional analyses of these species\u2019 habitat requirements. In 1990, an interagency scientific committee\u2014established to develop a strategy for conserving the northern spotted owl in the Pacific Northwest\u2014also advocated the retention of large blocks of old-growth forests to ensure the viability of populations of old-growth-dependent species. Finally, in 1992, the Chief of the Forest Service announced plans to reduce the amount of timber harvested by clearcutting by as much as 70 percent from fiscal year 1988 levels. Forest Service officials revising the Tongass forest plan believed that this new information and these events could have a significant impact on managing a forest that, up until then, had relied primarily on even-age management (clearcutting). These officials therefore believed that the new information and events needed to be considered in finalizing the revised forest plan. By this time, the process to revise the Tongass forest plan had entered its fifth year.", "The Forest Service\u2019s response to this new information and these events was slowed, however, by internal disagreements concerning which use\u2014producing timber or sustaining wildlife and fish\u2014should be emphasized and how the forest should resolve conflicts or make choices between these competing uses on its lands. For example, the Forest Service team revising the forest plan disagreed with the viable population committee\u2019s proposed strategy for preserving certain species of wildlife on the forest. The committee\u2019s proposed strategy would have given more emphasis to sustaining wildlife than the team\u2019s preferred alternative. In our view, this disagreement permeated other decision-making levels as well, extending to the forest supervisors and regional foresters. The friction on the Tongass over mission priorities is characteristic of an agency in transition and mirrors conflicts within the Forest Service as a whole\u2014some Forest Service personnel support the agency\u2019s shift in emphasis while others continue to believe that timber should receive the same priority it did in the past."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disagreements With Federal Regulatory Agencies Have Also Delayed the Approval of a Revised Tongass Forest Plan", "paragraphs": ["Our report on the Forest Service\u2019s decision-making process states that interagency disagreements have delayed forest plans and projects.

We found that such disagreements had delayed planning for the Tongass.", "The Forest Service\u2019s April 1996 draft plan and preferred alternative represent the intermediate results of almost 9 years of planning. Not only the preferred alternative for managing the Tongass, selected by the forest\u2019s three supervisors, but also the majority of the other nine alternatives presented in the April 1996 draft plan would increase the forest\u2019s emphasis on sustaining wildlife and fish and decrease the annual timber-offering goal, compared with the current plan. According to the forest supervisors, the preferred alternative is consistent with the Forest Service\u2019s broad multiple-use and sustained-yield mandate.", "However, according to the federal regulatory agencies that are charged with implementing and enforcing environmental laws and regulations\u2014including those to conserve and protect individual natural resources, such as endangered and threatened species, water, and air\u2014the preferred alternative poses a high level of risk to wildlife and their habitat. Even though the Forest Service established an interagency policy group in mid-1994, which included program managers from the three regulatory agencies, to advise the team revising the Tongass forest plan, all three regulatory agencies criticized the April 1996 preferred alternative and suggested changes to reduce the level of risk to wildlife and their habitat.", "In particular, the Fish and Wildlife Service was concerned about the preferred alternative\u2019s guidelines for habitat management as they apply to old-growth-dependent species on the Tongass, including two species that have been proposed for listing under the Endangered Species Act (the Alexander Archipelago wolf and the Queen Charlotte goshawk). If these species are listed after a revised forest plan is approved, the Forest Service could be required to reinitiate formal consultations with the Fish and Wildlife Service to again amend or revise the plan.

However, in the revisions proposed to its planning regulations in April 1995, the Forest Service states that the scientific expertise, data, and technology currently needed to conduct the required assessments of species\u2019 viability far exceed the resources envisioned by the agency when the planning rule was developed, as well as the resources available to any agency or scientific institution. Therefore, according to the Forest Service, the viable populations requirement no longer meets its expectations.", "The proposed revisions include an option for sustaining diversity preferred by the Forest Service.

The American taxpayer bears the financial costs, while the costs associated with the uncertainty of not having an approved forest plan are borne by members of the public who are concerned about maintaining biological diversity but are precluded from forming reasonable expectations about the forest\u2019s health over time as well as those who are economically dependent on the Tongass but are precluded from forming reasonable expectations about the future availability of the forest\u2019s uses.", "Although the Forest Service has been shifting its emphasis from consumption to conservation on the Tongass as well as nationwide, the Tongass continues to play an important role in the economy of southeastern Alaska, and the Forest Service retains a responsibility under its multiple-use and sustained-yield mandate to manage the Tongass for other uses, including timber. While one long-term contract was terminated and the remaining long-term contract was recently modified to terminate no later than October 2000, the agency has sold, and will continue to sell, timber from the forest to other companies.", "Moreover, according to the Forest Service, many communities in southeastern Alaska also depend on the Tongass to provide natural resources for uses such as fishing, recreation, tourism, mining, and customary and traditional subsistence.

We identify the need to provide the agency with clearer guidance on (1) which uses it should emphasize under its broad multiple-use and sustained-yield mandate and how it is to resolve conflicts or make choices among competing uses on its lands and (2) how to resolve environmental issues that transcend its administrative boundaries and jurisdiction. Our report also identifies the need for a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the laws affecting the Forest Service\u2019s decision-making to adequately address the differences in their requirements. We believe that the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, if implemented successfully, provides a framework for addressing many of these issues and will strengthen accountability for performance and results within the Forest Service and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its decision-making.", "In addition, our report identifies the need to hold the Forest Service more accountable for its performance. In the near future, the Forest Service is required by the Government Performance and Results Act to consult with you and to consider your views in developing a strategic plan. According to the agency, one of the long-term strategic goals that it will discuss is ensuring organizational effectiveness.

Federal regulatory agencies may then be more willing to accept a higher level of risk to wildlife and their habitat in forest plans then they are willing to do now.", "In summary, Mr. Chairman, forest planning is, by its very nature, a complex and difficult process involving a multitude of resources, statutory responsibilities, and stakeholders. Moreover, solutions to some issues that affect the efficiency and effectiveness of the Forest Service\u2019s decision-making will require the involvement of other stakeholders, including the Congress and other federal agencies. However, we have observed a cascading series of factors and issues resulting in inefficiencies within the Forest Service\u2019s decision-making process that can be traced back to a lack of accountability for time and costs. Without being held accountable for the efficiency of its decision-making process, the Forest Service has allowed complexities and difficulties to become excuses for delays and increased costs rather than challenges that must be overcome in making timely decisions. One result has been that the agency has taken a reactive, rather than a proactive, approach to addressing these challenges.", "As the Forest Service\u2019s efforts to revise the Tongass plan and its planning regulations have shown, the most likely outcomes of the Forest Service\u2019s current decision-making process are indecision and delay. We believe that successful implementation of the Government Performance and Results Act should strengthen accountability for performance and results within the Forest Service and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its decision-making.

The Environmental Protection Agency and the National Marine Fisheries Service favored more expansive riparian protection than the preferred alternative provided to protect fish habitat and water quality."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Estimated Cost of the Tongass Planning Process", "paragraphs": ["During the 10 years from fiscal year 1987 through fiscal year 1996, the Forest Service\u2019s Alaska Region spent slightly over $13 million to develop the revised Tongass land management plan and environmental impact statement.

This money went into the Tongass timber supply fund. The Tongass Timber Reform Act of 1990 repealed this ANILCA provision, and the fund ceased to exist at the end of fiscal year 1991.", "As table II.1 shows, during fiscal years 1987-96, $13 million was funded from numerous Forest Service accounts to develop the plan, including ecosystem management; minerals; timber management; recreation; wildlife and fish; soil, water, and air; road construction; and Tongass timber supply. Forest Service officials were unable to provide us with information on their rationale for using the various funding accounts for fiscal years 1987-94. For fiscal years 1995 and 1996, the Forest Service began budgeting most of the funding for the plan from the ecosystem management account. An Alaska Region budget officer told us that the ecosystem management account was established to finance large-scale planning efforts such as the Tongass plan.", "As table II.2 shows, slightly more than $13 million was spent for salaries, travel, training, space leasing/utilities, printing/publishing, computer workstation leases/computer support services, and other equipment and supplies. Over $7 million, or 54 percent of the $13 million, was spent for staff salaries. An Alaska Region budget officer told us that some Tongass planning costs incurred by the regional forester, forest supervisors, some regional office administrative personnel, and Forest Service headquarters personnel are not included in these planning costs and are not readily available.", "The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
