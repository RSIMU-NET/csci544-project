For example, all VAMCs store certain medications in secured areas. However, GAO found that VAMCs have also taken unique approaches for procuring and tracking medications, as allowed under VA policy. For example, to better address medication shortages, one VAMC pharmacy GAO visited established a shortage committee that meets on a weekly basis. Another VAMC pharmacy uses an automated dispensing machine together with compatible software that allows the pharmacy to track the location of most inpatient medications in real-time (see figure).", "GAO also found that VA's oversight of VAMCs' pharmacy inventory management is limited as VA lacks a comprehensive inventory management system or a focal point for system-wide oversight. In May 2018, VA signed a contract for a new electronic health records system that should allow VA to monitor VAMCs' inventories; however, VA officials expect implementation of this system to take up to 10 years. Based on a review of VA policies and interviews with VA officials, GAO found that VA has not designated a focal point with defined responsibilities for system-wide oversight of VAMCs' pharmacy inventory management. This is inconsistent with federal internal control standards for monitoring and establishing structure and authority to achieve an entity's objectives. Without a focal point for system-wide oversight, VA has limited awareness of the unique approaches that VAMCs use to manage their inventories and is missing an opportunity to evaluate these approaches.

Veterans can receive a range of services at the approximately 170  VA medical centers (VAMC) throughout the nation, including traditional  hospital-based services such as surgery, critical care, and mental health  care. As a significant part of delivering health care to veterans, VAMCs  also provide medications, prescription refills, and other pharmacy  services. These VAMCs are generally responsible for managing their  own pharmacy inventories\u2014that is, for procuring, storing, tracking, and  dispensing medications to veterans.", "Managing pharmacy inventories effectively to provide pharmacy services  to veterans can be challenging. In 2000, a VA Office of Inspector General  (OIG) audit found that VAMC pharmacies carried excess inventory due to  a reliance on informal inventory methods and identified the need for  VAMCs to use modern inventory techniques and automated pharmacy  inventory management systems. Subsequent OIG and GAO reports  have identified some of the technological challenges VA faces in  overseeing its VAMC pharmacies. For example, a 2009 VA OIG report  found that VA could not accurately account for the medications at VAMC  pharmacies because VA lacked reliable information to do so. Similarly, in  2017 we reported that VA does not have the systems that would allow it  to keep a perpetual inventory and monitor VAMC pharmacy inventory  levels in real time. These reports have raised broader concerns about  how VA oversees its VAMCs\u2019 pharmacies.", "You asked us to review the management and oversight of VAMC  pharmacy inventories. In this report, we describe how selected VAMCs manage their pharmacy inventories; assess the extent to which VA oversees VAMCs\u2019 efforts to manage  their pharmacy inventories.", "To describe how selected VAMCs manage their pharmacy inventories,  we identified their approaches for procuring, storing, tracking, dispensing,  and disposing of medications, the main process that all pharmacies  generally use to manage their pharmacy inventories. Our review focused  on pharmacy inventory of all medications\u2014including controlled and non- controlled substances\u2014dispensed within the VAMCs\u2019 inpatient wards or  at their outpatient pharmacies. Our review focused on VAMCs\u2019  management of their inpatient and outpatient pharmacy inventories; as  such we did not review pharmacy inventory management at the  consolidated mail outpatient pharmacies. We conducted site visits at a  non-generalizable sample of five VAMCs that we selected based on  diversity in geographic regions, differences in facility complexity, and  variation in pharmacy operations efficiency determined by comparing  expected and observed pharmacy expenditures by VAMC for fiscal year  2016. Although VA officials identified limitations in the pharmacy  expenditures data, we found that the data were sufficiently reliable to use  as one criterion for selecting VAMCs to visit. The five VAMCs we visited  are located in Cheyenne, Wyoming; Danville, Illinois; Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania; Richmond, Virginia; and San Francisco, California. At each  of these five VAMCs, we toured inpatient and outpatient pharmacy  operations and conducted semi-structured interviews with VAMC officials  and staff responsible for managing pharmacy inventory\u2014including VAMC  Executives, the Chief and Associate Chief of Pharmacy Services,  pharmacy staff, and nursing staff. We also observed the information  technology (IT) systems and automated medication dispensing machines  and software that each VAMC uses to manage pharmacy inventory. In  addition, we reviewed relevant national VA and local VAMC policies and  guidance for managing pharmacy inventory.", "To examine the extent to which VA oversees VAMCs\u2019 efforts to manage  their pharmacy inventories, we assessed the extent to which VA Central  Office (VACO) and the Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN)  oversee the five selected VAMCs\u2019 management of pharmacy inventory.  The VISNs report to VACO and are responsible for managing and  overseeing VAMCs within their geographic area. To conduct our work, we  reviewed VA policies, procedures, and guidance pertaining to the  management and oversight of pharmacy inventory to determine the  extent of VACO\u2019s and the VISNs\u2019 oversight responsibilities. This included  a review of meeting minutes from regularly scheduled calls between  VACO and VISN officials. We also interviewed VACO officials from the  Pharmacy Benefits Management Service (PBM), the National Acquisition  Center (NAC), and the Office of Information and Technology (OIT) to  determine their roles in overseeing VAMC pharmacy inventory. In  addition, we interviewed the five VISN Pharmacy Executives (VPE)  responsible for assisting the selected VAMCs with pharmacy-related  tasks. We examined VA\u2019s oversight in the context of federal standards for  internal controls related to establishing structure and authority to achieve  the entity\u2019s objectives and internal controls related to monitoring. To  better understand other integrated health systems\u2019 best practices for  managing pharmacy inventory, we also interviewed representatives from  the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the Mayo Clinic,  and the Cleveland Clinic. We also reviewed our previous work and the VA  OIG\u2019s work that is related to VAMC\u2019s pharmacy inventory management.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2017 to  September 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

The steps  of the process are (1) procuring medications from vendors or other  suppliers, (2) receiving and storing medications, (3) tracking medications  to account for all items and prevent diversion, (4) dispensing medications  to patients, and (5) disposing of expired or wasted medications. Hospital  settings include both inpatient and outpatient pharmacies.", "Procurement. Pharmacies use a procurement process to order  medications for pharmacy inventory, which includes activities such as  medication selection, cost analysis, purchasing procedures, and record  keeping. As part of medication selection, pharmacies may use a  formulary, which is a list of medications that have been approved for  prescription within a hospital or health care system.", "A prime vendor or wholesaler is one of the most commonly used sources  to obtain medications for the pharmacy. Prime vendors order large  quantities of medications from manufacturers, allowing pharmacies to  purchase various products from many drug manufacturers at once.  Orders for products that are not carried by the prime vendor may need to  be ordered through another source, such as directly from the  manufacturer.", "Receipt and storage. When medications are delivered to the pharmacy,  staff are to take several steps to properly receive and store the shipment.  For example, to ensure there is segregation of duties, the person  responsible for ordering and purchasing the medications is supposed to  be different than the person receiving and stocking pharmacy inventory.  Additionally, any delivered products that require special storage  conditions, such as freezing or refrigeration, are to be checked in first to  maintain the stability of the medication.", "Tracking. Once in storage, pharmacies use a variety of tools to account  for the filling, dispensing, and removal of medications in both inpatient  and outpatient settings. Some pharmacies have software that allows them  to track inventory in real time, an ability known as maintaining perpetual  inventory. A perpetual inventory system is a method of recording the  quantity of a particular medication continuously as prescriptions are filled  and dispensed. After each prescription is filled and dispensed to the  patient, the amount of medication used for the prescription is removed  from the inventory to ensure the quantity on hand recorded by the  software is always current.", "Many medications have barcodes on their packaging to allow for easy  identification of the medication in a computer system. The barcode  generally includes the product\u2019s National Drug Code, which indicates the  name and package size of the medication. In the hospital setting,  medications can be scanned out of the pharmacy and into machines for  storage on hospital wards.", "Dispensing. In both inpatient wards and outpatient pharmacies,  automated dispensing machines and barcode technology can assist staff  in maintaining and dispensing medications to patients. Automated  dispensing machines generally include several drawers and cabinets that  have pockets or trays that hold preset levels of a variety of common  medications. They may also be used to hold controlled substances,  generally in locked boxes or cubes within the machine. On hospital wards  medication in automated dispensing machines is often packaged in unit  doses\u2014individually packaged medications for patient use. Barcodes can  help verify a prescription before nurses give medication to a patient.  Hospitals that do not have automatic dispensing machines use carts with  drawers filled with each patient\u2019s medication. Outpatient pharmacies use  automated dispensing machines to assist with filling prescriptions.  Depending on the type of automated dispensing machine, the capabilities  can include label printing, pill counting, pouring pills into prescription  bottles, and applying the label to the prescription bottle.", "Return or disposal. Medication waste and expired medications are to be  pulled from pharmacy inventory and either returned to a reverse  distributor or manufacturer for credit or, if not eligible for return, disposed  of by the pharmacy or sent to an outside company for destruction.  Reverse distributors charge a fee, which is generally a percentage of the  refund that is automatically deducted from the final refund amount.", "Figure 1 provides an overview of the steps of the pharmacy inventory  management process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Organizational Structure and Pharmacy Policies", "paragraphs": ["VA\u2019s health care system is organized into entities at the headquarters,  regional, and local levels.

These policies address various aspects of  pharmacy services, including inpatient and outpatient pharmacy services,  general pharmacy requirements, supply chain management, controlled  substances management, and the formulary management process. For  example, the Supply Chain Inventory Management directive states that all  VAMC pharmacies should use the prime vendor inventory management  software to calculate the amount of each inventory item they need to  reorder. However, the directive also states that there are additional  pharmacy inventory tools available to VAMC pharmacies and that each  pharmacy has the option to use its own automated inventory  management systems to generate orders for its prime vendor.

Specifically, PBM requires  VAMC pharmacies to conduct an annual inventory of all medications and  a quarterly inventory of 5 selected high-value non-controlled medications  at risk of diversion. PBM officials told us they remind VAMCs of the  requirement to conduct these inventories, collect and aggregate the data  from these inventories, and make summary reports from these data  available as a resource to the VPEs and VAMC Chiefs of Pharmacy. PBM  officials acknowledged that these manual workarounds are inefficient,  increase labor costs, and leave the agency with an inability to see on- hand inventory across the system in real time. Additionally, the manual  workarounds may be implemented differently at each VAMC, resulting in  varying degrees of data reliability and limited opportunities for high-level  oversight and data consolidation. PBM officials said that they do not  independently analyze these data to identify trends, and they  acknowledged that both the quarterly and annual inventories have limited  usefulness for overseeing inventory management system-wide.  Additionally, officials at some of the selected VAMCs told us they found  the quarterly and annual inventories to have limited usefulness for  managing their pharmacy inventories.", "PBM officials told us they also hold regular meetings with VPEs and  VAMCs, which provide the opportunity for discussion of pharmacy  inventory management issues. However, our review of the minutes of the  meetings between PBM and VPEs found that, over the past 3 years,  pharmacy inventory management was rarely a topic of discussion. PBM  officials noted that there is always an opportunity for open discussion at  these meetings for VPEs to raise any issues, including issues related to  pharmacy inventory management, but these discussions may or may not  be captured in the meeting minutes. PBM officials said they also  regularly discuss various topics with the VAMC Chiefs of Pharmacy and  other staff, but none of these calls are directly related to pharmacy  inventory management.", "Officials from VACO\u2019s NAC and OIT told us that they provide some  assistance related to pharmacy inventory management but do not take  part in the day-to-day management at the VAMC level and also do not  have any oversight responsibilities.

VPEs told us that they also review the  results of the quarterly inventory of five selected high-value, non- controlled substances and may follow-up with the VAMCs if their actual  inventory of the medications is inconsistent with expected levels.  Additionally, some VPEs reported that they have undertaken additional  oversight activities apart from reviewing results of the mandatory  inventories. For example, one VPE told us he has developed a dashboard  with 53 measures that, while focused on formulary management, also  have inventory management implications. Additionally, this VPE said that  a VISN-wide procurement work group meets on a monthly basis and  serves as a venue for procurement technicians to share inventory  management best practices.
