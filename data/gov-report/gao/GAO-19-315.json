Florida officials also stated that some  demonstration elements stem from state legislation, which limits their  ability to make changes in response to comments.", "According to CMS officials, historically, the agency has not requested the  full set of comments that are submitted to the states. None of the states  that we reviewed attached the actual comments that were received to the  application\u2014only summaries\u2014though some posted them on their website  or had them available upon request, according to state officials. CMS  officials told us the agency has not consistently requested that states  provide the actual comments received; however, in the last year and a  half the agency has been making more of an effort to request the full set  of comments instead of solely relying on the summaries provided in the  applications. Officials said they anticipate that this will be the agency\u2019s  standard practice going forward.", "In making demonstration decisions, CMS reviews and summarizes all  input received during the federal comment period. CMS created a  summary of comments received for all seven of the demonstrations we  reviewed. Officials said that these summaries are used to brief CMS  leadership as part of the decision-making process. We found that the  level of detail in the summaries we reviewed varied, ranging from bulleted  lists identifying and detailing common themes in support, opposition, or  both, to a few brief sentences covering all comments. This variation often  reflected the differences in the number of comments received and the  significance of the concerns raised. For example:", "CMS received about 100 comments on Washington\u2019s application  during the federal comment period that were predominantly supportive  of the new demonstration, and CMS\u2019s summary was a brief overview.", "In contrast, CMS received thousands of comments on Kentucky\u2019s  application for each of the three federal comment periods held for that  new demonstration, with many opposed to or concerned with certain  aspects of the application. CMS\u2019s summaries of comments received  on the Kentucky application provided an overview of the issues  raised, along with counts of how many fell within different themes and  how many were in support, opposition, or unrelated to what was being  proposed.", "CMS officials explained that there are unique circumstances surrounding  each demonstration\u2014a comment period with many concerns raised or  conflicting viewpoints will necessitate a longer and more detailed  summary than one that has broad support and few, if any, areas of  disagreement.", "We found instances where CMS approved changes to certain aspects of  the demonstrations that were in line with concerns raised by the  comments. Among the seven demonstrations we reviewed in-depth, CMS  received comments for four demonstrations that included concerns about  the state\u2019s proposal: Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, and Massachusetts.  For Arkansas and Kentucky, CMS either approved more limited changes  than what the state initially proposed or required that certain beneficiary  protections be in place.", "Arkansas: In its amendment application, Arkansas requested a  waiver of the requirement to provide retroactive eligibility, among  other things. Commenters were concerned that the state\u2019s proposal to  eliminate retroactive eligibility would result in gaps in coverage,  adverse health outcomes, and medical debt for members. In CMS\u2019s  approval, the agency acknowledged these concerns and allowed the  state to reduce the period for retroactive eligibility from 90 days to 30  days but not eliminate it completely. (See fig. 6.)", "Kentucky: In Kentucky, some commenters were concerned about the  state\u2019s proposal to implement a work and community engagement  requirement as a condition of Medicaid eligibility, noting that  individuals need to be healthy to work or look for a job. CMS said in its  January 2018 approval that Kentucky was exempting medically frail  individuals from this requirement, but CMS would also be requiring  that the state add certain protections for vulnerable individuals,  including maintaining a system that identifies, validates, and provides  reasonable accommodations.", "We also found there were instances where CMS approved certain  aspects of the demonstrations despite concerns raised by the comments.  CMS\u2019s rationale for those decisions varied across demonstrations. For  example, CMS noted in one instance that sufficient controls were planned  to address the concerns raised, and in another instance noted that the  potential benefits of the demonstrations outweighed the risks. The  following are examples of when CMS approved aspects of states\u2019  demonstrations without changes.", "Arkansas: In Arkansas, some commenters were opposed to the  enforcement mechanism for the state\u2019s proposal to institute a work  and community engagement requirement as a condition of  maintaining eligibility. The state proposed to disenroll beneficiaries  who fail to fulfill these requirements for any 3 months during a  calendar year and lock them out from coverage until the start of the  next calendar year. CMS approved this proposal and provided an  explanation of the circumstances under which it would happen,  underscoring that individuals have three opportunities (each of the  months they fail to fulfill the requirements) to rectify the situation or  seek an exemption before they would ultimately lose coverage. CMS  indicated in the approval letter to Arkansas that it believed the health  benefits of community engagement outweigh the health risks with  respect to those who fail to respond.", "Indiana: In Indiana, some commenters were opposed to the state\u2019s  proposal to institute a work and community engagement requirement  as a condition of maintaining eligibility. They argued, in part, that  beneficiaries who are able to work are already doing so and the  requirement is unnecessarily burdensome. CMS responded that  employment is positively correlated with health outcomes and  imposing these requirements serves the purposes of the Medicaid  statute. (See fig. 7.)", "In an effort to improve transparency around its approvals, CMS began  providing a high-level summary and response to public comments in the  demonstration approval letters beginning in January 2018. Agency  officials said this will be their standard practice going forward. Our review  of the approval letters sent between January 1, 2018, and July 31, 2018,  confirmed that CMS included a discussion of some of the issues that  were raised in 10 of 11 letters. For example, the approval letters  explained the decision to reduce the period of retroactive eligibility in  Arkansas instead of eliminating it completely, as well as the decision to  approve Indiana\u2019s proposal to implement work and community  engagement requirements. However, the approval letters do not respond  to every concern raised. For example, a number of commenters were  concerned with a request in Arkansas\u2019s amendment application to no  longer offer presumptive eligibility, but CMS did not respond to these  concerns in the approval letter. CMS officials told us that the agency is  striking a balance between transparency and processing applications in a  timely manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Extent to Which CMS Used Public Comments to Inform Monitoring and Evaluation Decisions Was Not Always Clear", "paragraphs": ["Among the four demonstration approvals for which we conducted in-depth  reviews and where public comments raised concerns\u2014approvals for  Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, and Massachusetts\u2014we observed  instances where CMS added specific monitoring requirements to the  STCs that aligned with these concerns and other cases where the agency  did not. For example:", "The STCs required Arkansas to submit a monitoring plan for its work  and community engagement requirement in order to monitor eligibility  operations and the impact on beneficiaries reapplying for coverage  after being disenrolled for noncompliance.", "In contrast, CMS did not require a monitoring plan for the Indiana and  Kentucky demonstrations, which also included work and community  engagement requirements where the public raised concerns about the  effects on beneficiaries. This remains the case for Indiana; however,  CMS\u2019s new approval of Kentucky\u2019s demonstration in November 2018  included additional monitoring requirements. Specifically, the  November 2018 STCs required Kentucky to submit a monitoring  protocol that includes measures for monitoring enrollment,  disenrollment, and eligibility suspension, among other things.", "In other cases where public comments raised concerns about the impact  of demonstrations on beneficiaries, including changes in eligibility  requirements (e.g., retroactive eligibility), we did not observe specific  monitoring requirements included in the STCs. Though CMS did not  provide any specific examples, officials told us that they consider public  input when making decisions about monitoring requirements. Officials  also said they were developing monitoring metrics and tools that they  plan to use consistently going forward for states implementing work and  community engagement requirements. As of January 2019, officials said  these materials were in draft form and under review.", "Regarding evaluations, the extent to which CMS considered concerns  raised through public comments for the four demonstration approvals was  also not always clear, including how input informed the evaluation  requirements in the STCs. For example, commenters on the applications  submitted by Indiana and Kentucky raised concerns about aspects of the  work and community engagement requirements proposed by each state,  such as the requirements for reporting work or other activities and the  circumstances under which beneficiaries would lose coverage.", "In the STCs for Indiana, CMS did not include specific hypotheses that  the state would be required to test related to its work and community  engagement policies. Instead, CMS noted that the state\u2019s goals  should inform the evaluation, subject to CMS approval. For example,  Indiana\u2019s goals included determining whether implementing work and  community engagement requirements will lead to sustainable  employment and improved health outcomes among beneficiaries.", "In the STCs for Kentucky\u2019s initial approval in January 2018, CMS  included the same language as in Indiana\u2014that the goals should  inform the state\u2019s evaluation. However, in the STCs approved for  Kentucky in November 2018, CMS added some broad guidance for  Kentucky\u2019s draft evaluation design. Specifically, CMS included a  variety of hypotheses that the state must evaluate, such as the effect  of work requirements on enrollment and the impact of the  demonstration on uncompensated care costs.", "When approving evaluation designs, the extent to which CMS considers  areas of risk identified through public input is also unclear at this time. As  of January 2019, evaluation designs for the Arkansas and Indiana  demonstrations were under review at CMS and Kentucky had not yet  submitted one.", "Regarding Arkansas\u2019s evaluation design, CMS sent a letter to the  state providing comments and feedback that seem to align with some  of the concerns raised about the demonstration through public input.  Specifically, the November 2018 letter from CMS raised concerns with  the state\u2019s \u201cbroadly defined\u201d expected outcomes of the demonstration,  which included culture of work and personal life stability. CMS  recommended that the state revise the design to include a list of  quantifiable outcomes and measures that capture the important  features, such as increased employment (e.g., hours worked, wages)  and improved health (e.g., health care utilization).", "For Massachusetts, the one demonstration with an approved  evaluation design, the extent to which CMS considered public input  during approval was unclear. For example, with regard to  Massachusetts\u2019s proposal to discontinue provisional eligibility for most  adults, commenters raised concerns about the potential effects on  beneficiaries\u2019 timely access to coverage and care; however, the  evaluation design did not include plans to examine the effects of the  policy on beneficiaries.", "Though CMS did not provide specific examples of how public input had  informed evaluation designs, CMS officials said requirements for  evaluations have been evolving as they have gained experience in  understanding the public\u2019s concerns. Officials also said they were  developing robust evaluation guidance that they plan to use consistently  going forward for states implementing work and community engagement  requirements.

Despite this progress, CMS\u2019s approach to ensuring transparency when  states propose major changes to their demonstrations has significant  gaps. The lack of policies for ensuring transparency when states make  major changes to pending applications and limited transparency  requirements applied for amendments\u2014which are being used by some  states to make major changes to their demonstrations\u2014puts CMS\u2019s goal  of transparency at risk. These gaps may leave the agency and the public  without key information to fully understand the potential impact of the  changes being proposed, including on beneficiaries and costs. These  risks take on increased importance given that CMS is encouraging states  to use the flexibility provided under demonstrations to test changes to  their Medicaid programs that could have significant effects for  beneficiaries and other stakeholders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following two recommendations to CMS:  The Administrator of CMS should develop and communicate a policy that  defines when changes to a pending section 1115 demonstration  application are considered major and should prompt a new review of the  application against the transparency requirements applicable to the  pending application.

These steps appear to formalize the approach  CMS has already been taking as demonstrated by the agency\u2019s response  to the changes submitted by Indiana and Kentucky to their applications.  Our recommendation, however, requires additional actions. In particular,  we recommended that CMS develop and communicate a policy that  includes standards for when changes are substantial enough to warrant a  new review of the application against the transparency requirements. The  transparency requirements, among other things, call for states to provide  for public notice and input at the state level before they submit their  applications. As such, holding an additional federal comment period  would not be sufficient to meet our concerns.", "Regarding our second recommendation\u2014concerning transparency  requirements for amendment applications that may have significant  impacts\u2014HHS said that it has implemented enhanced processes to  improve transparency and will review its current processes and develop  additional policies and processes, as needed, to enhance the  transparency of such applications. However, the enhanced processes  HHS referred to do not apply to amendments. Thus, HHS\u2019s planned  review of its policies alone would not be sufficient to meet our concerns.
