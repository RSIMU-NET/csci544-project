To cover such services, however, states often obtain waivers from certain federal statutory requirements. GAO was asked to review (1) trends in states' use of Medicaid home and community-based service (HCBS) waivers, particularly for the elderly, (2) state quality assurance approaches, including available data on the quality of care provided to elderly individuals through waivers, and (3) the adequacy of federal oversight of state waivers. GAO is recommending that the Administrator of CMS take steps to (1) better ensure that state quality assurance efforts are adequate to protect the health and welfare of HCBS waiver beneficiaries, and (2) strengthen federal oversight of the growing HCBS waiver programs. Although CMS raised certain concerns about aspects of the report, such as the respective state and federal roles in quality assurance and the potential need for additional federal oversight resources, CMS generally concurred with the recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From 1991 through 2001, Medicaid long-term care spending more than doubled to over $75 billion, while the proportion spent on institutional care declined. Over a similar time period, HCBS waivers grew from 5 percent to 19 percent of such expenditures--from $1.6 billion to $14.4 billion--and the number of waivers, participants, and average state per capita spending also grew significantly. Since 1992, the number of waivers increased by almost 70 percent to 263 in June 2002, and the number of beneficiaries, as of 1999, had nearly tripled to almost 700,000, of which 55 percent were elderly. In the absence of specific federal requirements for HCBS quality assurance systems, states provide limited information to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency that administers the Medicaid program, on how they assure quality of care in their waiver programs for the elderly. States' waiver applications and annual reports for waivers for the elderly often contained little or no information on state mechanisms for assuring quality in waivers, thus limiting information available to CMS that should be considered before approving or renewing waivers. GAO's analysis of available CMS and state waiver oversight reports for waivers serving the elderly identified oversight weaknesses and quality of care problems. More than 70 percent of the waivers for the elderly that GAO reviewed documented one or more quality-of-care problems. The most common problems included failure to provide necessary services, weaknesses in plans of care, and inadequate case management. The full extent of such problems is unknown because many state waivers lacked a recent CMS review, as required, or the annual state waiver report lacked the relevant information. CMS has not developed detailed state guidance on appropriate quality assurance approaches as part of initial waiver approval. Although CMS oversight has identified some quality problems in waivers, CMS does not adequately monitor state waivers and the quality of beneficiary care. The 10 CMS regional offices are responsible for ongoing monitoring for HCBS waivers. However, CMS does not hold these offices accountable for completing periodic waiver reviews, nor does it hold states accountable for submitting annual reports on the status of waiver quality. Consequently, CMS is not fully complying with statutory and regulatory requirements when it renews waivers. As of June 2002, almost one-fifth of waivers in place for 3 years or more had either never been reviewed or were renewed without a review; for an additional 16 percent of waivers, reports detailing the review results were never finalized. Regional office personnel explained that limited staff resources and travel funds often impede the timing and scope of reviews. While regional office reviews include record reviews for a sample of waiver beneficiaries, they do not always include beneficiary interviews. The reviews also varied considerably in the number of beneficiary records reviewed and their method of determining the sample."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the last decade, states have increased their support for long-term  care services in individuals\u2019 homes or in other community-based settings\u2014 such as adult day care, adult foster care homes, and assisted living  facilities\u2014as an alternative to care in nursing homes and other  institutions. For many vulnerable elderly and nonelderly individuals with  physical, developmental, or cognitive disabilities, these alternative settings  and services are seen as preferable to institutional care. Most state funding  of long-term care is through Medicaid, the federal-state health care  program for certain low-income individuals. Medicaid home and  community-based services (HCBS) waivers, authorized under section  1915(c) of the Social Security Act, are the primary means by which states  provide noninstitutional long-term care. Waivers allow states to limit the  availability of services geographically, target specific populations or  conditions, control the number of individuals served, and cap overall  expenditures\u2014actions not usually allowed under the Medicaid statute.  The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014the federal agency  that manages Medicaid\u2014reviews and approves states\u2019 requests for these  waivers and also is responsible for ensuring that states have necessary  safeguards to protect the health and welfare of individuals receiving  services through waiver programs.", "Despite the growing use of HCBS waivers, concerns have been raised  about the quality of care provided through waivers serving both elderly  and nonelderly populations. Newspaper expos\u00e9s and some state audit  reports have chronicled serious health and welfare concerns in waiver  programs across the country. Because of continued growth in the numbers  of people served through HCBS waiver programs and concerns about the  quality of care, you asked us to review (1) trends in states\u2019 use of such  waivers, particularly for the elderly, (2) state quality assurance approaches  for waivers serving the elderly, including available data on the quality of  care provided to beneficiaries, and (3) the adequacy of CMS\u2019s oversight of  state waiver programs for the elderly as well as those for other target  populations.", "To identify trends in states\u2019 use of waivers, we analyzed CMS and state  reports that contained data on waiver beneficiaries, expenditures, and  services. To identify those waivers that serve the elderly, we compiled a  list of HCBS waivers with \u201cthe aged\u201d or \u201caged and disabled\u201d as their target  populations. Throughout this report, we refer to this universe of waivers  as those \u201cserving the elderly.\u201d To assess state quality assurance activities  for waivers serving the elderly, we analyzed (1) data on quality assurance  approaches from state waiver applications and their most recent annual  reports to CMS, (2) the oversight findings reported by states in their  annual waiver reports, and (3) CMS regional office waiver reviews and  state audits of waivers completed from October 1998 through May 2002.  For a more in-depth perspective on states\u2019 quality assurance approaches  for waivers serving the elderly, we conducted structured interviews with  state officials and staff in South Carolina, Texas, and Washington. We  selected these states because they operate some of the largest HCBS  waivers for the elderly that have been in effect for 5 years or longer. We  did not attempt to assess the effectiveness of their quality assurance  approaches. To determine the adequacy of CMS oversight of state waiver  programs for the elderly as well as those for other target populations, we  obtained relevant data from officials at CMS headquarters and conducted  structured interviews with all 10 CMS regional offices on their waiver  review activities and staffing as of June 2002. See appendix I for a detailed  discussion of our scope and methodology. We conducted our review from  November 2001 through June 2003 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The jointly funded federal-state Medicaid program is the primary source of  financing for long-term care services. About one-third of the total   $228 billion in Medicaid spending in fiscal year 2001 was for long-term  care in both institutional and community-based settings. States administer  this program within broad federal rules and according to a state plan  approved by CMS, the federal agency that oversees and administers  Medicaid. Some services, such as nursing home care and home health  care, are mandatory services that must be covered in any state that  participates in Medicaid. Other services, such as personal care, are  optional, which a state may choose to include in its state Medicaid plan  but which then must be offered to all individuals statewide who meet its  Medicaid eligibility criteria. States may also apply to CMS for a section  1915(c) waiver to provide home and community-based services as an  alternative to institutional care in a hospital, nursing home, or  intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded (ICF/MR). If approved,  HCBS waivers allow states to limit the availability of services  geographically, to target services to specific populations or conditions, or  to limit the number of persons served, actions not generally allowed for  state plan services. States often operate multiple waivers serving different  population groups, such as the elderly, persons with mental retardation or  developmental disabilities, persons with physical disabilities, and children  with special care needs.", "States determine the types of long-term care services they wish to offer  under an HCBS waiver. Waivers may offer a variety of skilled services to  only a few individuals with a particular condition, such as persons with  traumatic brain injury, or they may offer only a few unskilled services to a  large number of people, such as the aged or disabled. The wide variety of  services that may be available under waivers includes home modification,  such as installing a wheelchair ramp, transportation, chore services,  respite care, nursing services, personal care services, and caregiver  training for family members. CMS\u2019s waiver application form for states  includes a list of home and community-based services with suggested  definitions. States are free to include as many or as few of these as they  wish, to include additional services, or to include different definitions of  services from those supplied with the form. See appendix II for a list of  services provided through the HCBS waivers serving the elderly and CMS\u2019s  suggested definitions of these services.", "To be eligible for waiver services, an individual must meet the state\u2019s  criteria for needing the level of care provided in an institution, such as a  nursing home, and be able to receive care in the community at a cost  generally not exceeding the cost of institutional care. States are  responsible for determining the specific financial and functional eligibility  criteria used, conducting the necessary screening and assessment, and  arranging for services to be provided. Factors that states use in assessing  functional eligibility for nursing home care and for waiver services include  the individuals\u2019 medical condition and their degree of physical or mental  impairment. Other factors that states generally consider, and which may  affect the states\u2019 ability to provide care in the community at a cost not  exceeding that of institutional care or to adequately protect beneficiaries\u2019  health and welfare, include the mix of services needed by the individual,  the availability of needed services, the cost of services, the need for home  modification, and the availability of family members or other caregivers.", "In order to receive federal funds for waiver services, a state must submit  an application to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) that  identifies the target population, specifies the number of persons that will  be served, and lists the services to be included. In addition, states are  required to provide certain assurances that necessary safeguards have  been taken to assure financial accountability and to protect the health and  welfare of beneficiaries under the waiver. Federal regulations specify that  the state\u2019s safeguards for the health and welfare of beneficiaries must  include (1) adequate standards for all providers of waiver services and   (2) assurance that any state licensure or certification requirements for  providers of waiver services are met. CMS requires that a state\u2019s waiver  application include documentation regarding the standards applicable for  each service provider. If the only requirement for a particular provider is  licensure or certification, the state must provide a citation to the  applicable state statute or regulation. If other requirements apply, the state  must specify the applicable standards that providers must meet and  explain how the provider standards will ensure beneficiaries\u2019 welfare.  Finally, states must annually report on, among other things, how they  implement, monitor, and enforce their health and welfare standards and  the waiver\u2019s impact on the health and welfare of beneficiaries.", "Initial waiver applications and amendments to initial waivers are reviewed  and approved by CMS headquarters. CMS\u2019s 10 regional offices have  primary responsibility for reviewing and approving applications to renew  waivers and amendments to renewed waivers. If CMS determines that a  waiver application meets program requirements, including sufficient  documentation to indicate that necessary safeguards are in place to  protect the health and welfare of waiver beneficiaries, it will approve an  initial waiver for a 3-year period. Subsequently, waivers may be extended  for additional 5-year periods.", "Section 1915(c)(3) of the Social Security Act provides that, upon request  of a state, HCBS waivers may be extended, unless the Secretary of HHS  determines that the assurances provided during the preceding term have  not been met. Among the assurances that the state makes are that  necessary safeguards have been taken to protect the health and welfare of  waiver participants and that the state will submit annual reports on the  impact of the waiver on the type and amount of medical assistance  provided under the state Medicaid plan and on the health and welfare of  recipients. Regulations implementing section 1915(c) provide that an  extension of a waiver will be granted unless (1) CMS\u2019s review of the prior  waiver period shows that the assurances the state made were not met and  (2) the state fails to provide adequate documentation and assurances to  justify an extension. In its explanation of this regulation, HCFA indicated  that a review of the prior period is an indispensable part of the renewal  process.", "Reviews of waiver programs for which a renewal has been requested are,  therefore, expected to occur at some point during the initial 3-year period,  and at least once during each renewal cycle. CMS guidance on the reviews  calls for on-site visits that include an examination of beneficiary and  provider records as well as interviews with state officials. If a state\u2019s  efforts to protect the health and welfare of waiver beneficiaries are  determined to be inadequate, CMS officials told us that the agency can  either bar the state from enrolling any new waiver beneficiaries until  corrective actions are taken or terminate the waiver.", "According to a recent CMS-sponsored review, oversight of waivers is often  decentralized and fragmented among a variety of agencies and levels of  government, and rarely does a single entity have accountability for the  overall quality of care provided to waiver beneficiaries. Some waiver  service providers are regulated by state licensing agencies, some are  certified by private accreditation organizations, and others operate under  terms of a contract or other agreement with a state agency. While the state  Medicaid agency is ultimately accountable to the federal government for  compliance with the requirements of the waivers, it may delegate  administration of the waivers to state units on aging, mental health  departments, or other departments or agencies with jurisdiction over a  specific population or service. About one-third of waivers for the elderly  are administered by an agency or department other than the Medicaid  agency, most often the state unit on aging. These agencies may then  contract with local networks, agencies, or providers to provide or arrange  for beneficiary services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Waivers Are Vehicle for Dramatic Growth in Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services", "paragraphs": ["Medicaid-covered HCBS services have become a growing component of  state long-term care systems, with most of the growth accounted for by  substantial increases in the number of HCBS waivers and the beneficiaries  served through waivers.

Over the past 10 years, total Medicaid  long-term care spending has more than doubled\u2014from $33.8 billion in  fiscal year 1991 to $75.3 billion in fiscal year 2001.

Every state except Arizona operates at least one such  waiver for the elderly. In 1982, the first year of the waiver program, 6  states operated HCBS waivers. By 1992, 48 states operated a total of 155  HCBS waivers. As of June 2002, 49 states and the District of Columbia  operated a total of 263 HCBS waivers, with 77 serving the elderly. The  average waiver for the elderly served 3,305 Medicaid beneficiaries in 1992  and 5,892 beneficiaries in 1999.

However, the  average per beneficiary expenditure for such waivers varied widely across  states, reflecting differences in the type, number, and amount of services  provided under waivers in different states. As shown in table 1, among  those states with waivers serving the elderly in 1999, per beneficiary  expenditures ranged from an average of $15,065 in Hawaii to $1,208 in  New York. In Hawaii, one such waiver that provided an average of 85  hours of personal assistance services per month to 91 percent of  beneficiaries of that waiver had an average cost of $10,893 per beneficiary.  A second Hawaii waiver that provided adult foster care, residential care,  or assisted living for waiver beneficiaries had an average cost of $16,958  per beneficiary.

Other  approaches are focused on providers, including licensure and inspections,  corrective action plans, sanctions, and program manuals. States may  require that certain providers be licensed or certified or meet other  requirements contained in state laws or regulations. Such providers are  generally subject to periodic inspections that may include a review of  beneficiary records to determine whether the records meet program  standards.

None of these 11 applications  included well-recognized quality assurance tools such as complaint  systems, corrective action plans, sanctions, or beneficiary satisfaction  surveys. The remaining 4 states each identified six to eight quality  assurance approaches, including at least one of these four important tools.  As shown in table 3, the two mechanisms most frequently cited by states  were (1) licensure for some HCBS waiver providers, such as home health  agencies and residential care providers, and (2) case management.", "Annual waiver reports. Compared to waiver applications, annual state  waiver reports identified more quality assurance mechanisms for waivers  serving the elderly. The quality assurance mechanisms states\u2019 annual  reports cited most frequently included (1) audits of case management  agencies, (2) reviews of provider or direct-care staff, (3) licensure and  certification of providers, (4) beneficiary satisfaction surveys or  interviews, (5) case management, and (6) training and technical  assistance. As shown in table 3, these six mechanisms were mentioned by  at least half of the 40 states that provided such information. However, as  was the case with most of the 15 waiver applications we reviewed,  complaint systems, corrective action plans, and sanctions were identified  less frequently. For example, only 13 of the 40 states identified complaint  systems for waivers serving elderly beneficiaries as a monitoring tool in  their annual waiver reports. Responding to beneficiary complaints is a  key element in protecting vulnerable nursing home residents and home  health beneficiaries.

In August 2000, some regional  office officials formally communicated to HCFA headquarters their  concern that the agency was not devoting sufficient resources to properly  monitor the quality of HCBS waiver programs. Regional office officials  responsible for waiver oversight told us that the number of staff available  for waiver oversight has not kept pace with the growth in the number of  waivers and beneficiaries served and that resource issues remain a key  challenge for waiver oversight.", "We found that CMS regional offices differed substantially in the number of  staff assigned to waiver oversight and the extent to which staff with  clinical or program expertise were assigned to waiver oversight.

Six of the 10 regional offices had two or fewer full- time-equivalent (FTE) staff assigned to monitoring HCBS waivers (see  table 7). Moreover, we found that the number of regional office staff  assigned to monitoring HCBS waivers bore little relationship to the waiver  workload.

CMS\u2019s waiver review  protocol specifies that the participation of clinical and other specialist  staff is important to assessing issues related to beneficiaries\u2019 health and  welfare. However, many regional offices indicated that they had to  \u201cborrow\u201d specialist staff from other departments within the region in order  to conduct their waiver reviews. The Seattle and Boston regional offices  provide contrasting examples of the role played by regional office  management in obtaining clinical staff to conduct reviews. According to  Seattle regional office staff, it has been a challenge to obtain specialist  staff on the waiver review teams. For 4 to 5 years, the region did not  conduct any HCBS waiver reviews. In the past 4 years, it has only  conducted three reviews\u2014regardless of the number of waivers due for  review. The region has four waivers that have never been reviewed, two  dating back to 1989. According to the staff, the prior regional  administrator did not target resources for HCBS waiver reviews, and it  was difficult to obtain clinical and other specialist staff from other  departments to assist in conducting reviews. Although it has no specialist  staff assigned to waivers, Boston regional office officials informed us that  conducting HCBS waiver reviews has been a management priority, as  evidenced by the fact that the region always includes a registered nurse or  other relevant specialist on the review team.

Without  necessary attention from CMS, these guidance and resource issues will  only be exacerbated by the expected future growth in the number of  persons served through HCBS waiver programs.

We disagree with CMS\u2019s assertion  that beneficiaries\u2019 preference for services that allow them to remain in the  community can be equated with satisfaction for the services delivered.  Even assuming that beneficiary satisfaction alone is a reliable indicator of  quality, CMS offered no empirical evidence to support its position. Only  about half of the state annual waiver reports we reviewed indicated that  states measured beneficiary satisfaction with services. Moreover, our  review of quality-of-care problems identified in waiver programs serving  the elderly demonstrated that failure to provide needed or authorized  services was a frequently cited problem.

Moreover, the use of the Independence Plus template, which requires  more specific information on states\u2019 quality assurance approaches, is  voluntary rather than mandatory."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Comments", "paragraphs": ["In its written comments, Texas stated that it supports proper federal  oversight of HCBS waivers but stressed the need to maintain flexibility in  designing waivers to meet the unique needs of residents requiring  community care.

To identify the universe of state HCBS waivers as  of June 2002, we asked the CMS regional offices to identify each waiver,  including the target population and the waiver start date. The regional  offices identified a total of 263 waivers. Using this information and other  data, we identified 77 waivers serving the elderly. To identify trends in  Medicaid long-term care and Medicaid waiver spending, we analyzed data  covering fiscal years 1991 through 2001 from HCFA reports (HCFA Form  64) compiled by The MEDSTAT Group. To identify trends in the overall  number of Medicaid waiver beneficiaries, number of elderly waiver  beneficiaries, average waiver size, and average per beneficiary  expenditures for waivers serving the elderly, we analyzed data from state  annual waiver reports (HCFA Form 372) covering fiscal years 1992  through 1999 in a database compiled by researchers at the University of  California, San Francisco.", "State Quality Assurance Mechanisms. In the absence of comprehensive,  readily available information on HCBS quality assurance mechanisms that  states use, we analyzed the information available in a subset of state  waiver applications and annual state waiver reports for waivers serving  the elderly. Specifically, we analyzed (1) initial and/or renewal  applications for the 15 largest waivers serving the elderly as of 1999 and  (2) annual state waiver reports from 70 of the 79 waivers serving the  elderly. The waiver applications are used by CMS, in part, to assess  whether the quality assurance mechanisms in place warrant waiver  approval. The annual waiver reports are required to provide a description  of the process for monitoring the standards and safeguards under the  waiver and the results of state monitoring. Of the 70 state annual waiver  reports that we analyzed, 52 contained some information about states\u2019  monitoring processes. Eight of the remaining 9 annual waiver reports were  new waivers for which the state had not yet submitted an annual report,  and for 1 waiver, a regional office did not provide a copy of the annual  state report.", "State Oversight and Quality of Care. To assess state oversight issues in  waivers serving the elderly, we examined regional office waiver review  reports for 21 waivers and state audit reports related to 5 waivers, the only  reports we were able to analyze, for a total of 23 discrete waivers. To  assess quality-of-care problems in waivers serving the elderly, we reviewed  51 waivers for which we were able to analyze regional office final reports  and annual state reports. Regional office waiver review reports identified  problems in 19 waivers, and annual state reports identified problems in 22  waivers, for a total of 36 discrete waivers. These reports identified no  quality-of-care problems in the remaining 15 waivers. We were unable to  analyze findings from 28 additional waivers because they either (1) lacked  a recent regional office waiver review completed during the period of  October 1998 through May 2002 or an annual state waiver report, (2) the  annual state waiver report did not address whether deficiencies had been  identified, or provided no information on the deficiencies found, or (3) the  waivers were too new to have had a regional office review or to provide an  annual state report.", "CMS Oversight. To determine the adequacy of CMS regional office  oversight of states\u2019 waiver programs, we asked all 10 CMS regional offices  to provide the following information for each of the waivers for which  they were responsible, including both waivers for the elderly as well as  those serving other target populations: (1) the waiver start date, (2) the  current waiver time period, (3) the fiscal year the waiver was last  reviewed, and (4) whether or not the waiver review report was finalized.  Of the 263 waivers, 228 had been in place for 3 years or more and therefore  should have had a regional office review. The other 35 waivers were less  than 3 years old and would not have yet qualified for a review as of June  2002. For information on sample sizes and duration of the reviews, we  analyzed CMS\u2019s HCBS waiver review final reports for waivers serving the  elderly that were issued during the period of October 1998 through May  2002. Fifteen of the 21 waiver review reports that we received included  information on the number of waiver beneficiary records reviewed and on  the duration of the reviews. Some review reports also provided the  number of beneficiaries that were interviewed or observed. We also  discussed regional office oversight activities with CMS headquarters\u2019 staff."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Suggested CMS Definitions of Home and Community-Based Services in Waivers Serving the Elderly", "paragraphs": ["Table 8 contains a list of services provided through the HCBS waivers  serving the elderly and the suggested CMS definitions.

Approximately $1  million was budgeted for these HCBS quality initiatives in fiscal year 2001  and $3.4 million in fiscal year 2002. Through its HCBS quality initiatives,  CMS intends to more closely assess the status of quality assurance efforts  currently in place and to provide direct assistance to states in this area.  CMS\u2019s initiatives include (1) developing a conceptual framework for  defining and measuring quality, (2) creating tools for states to adapt and  use in assessing quality, such as model consumer experience surveys, and  (3) providing technical assistance and resources for quality assurance and  improvement. These initiatives, while important, do not address the lack  of detailed requirements for states on the necessary components of an  acceptable quality assurance system or the weaknesses in regional office  oversight of state HCBS waivers that we identified elsewhere in this  report.", "Quality Framework and Expectations. CMS sponsored the development  of a framework for quality in home and community-based services that  focuses on outcomes in several key areas including beneficiary access to  care, safety, satisfaction, and meeting beneficiary needs and preferences.  The next phase involves identifying strategies that states are currently  using to monitor and improve quality within these key areas. While the  expectations contained in the quality framework have not been specified  in CMS regulations, they are reflected in the application template for  CMS\u2019s new consumer-directed HCBS waiver, Independence Plus. States\u2019  use of the template for the Independence Plus waiver is voluntary. The  template asks states for a detailed description of their quality assurance  and improvement programs\u2014something not currently required as part of  the general HCBS waiver application. Guidance for using the template  notes that the description should include (1) information on the frequency  of quality assurance activities, (2) the dimensions that will be monitored,  (3) the qualifications of persons conducting quality assurance activities,   (4) the process for identifying problems, including sampling  methodologies, (5) provisions for assuring that problems are addressed in  a timely manner, and (6) the system to receive, review, and act on critical  incidents or events.", "Quality Assurance Mechanisms. CMS is also developing quality  assessment and improvement mechanisms for states. For example, to  develop a guide for states and CMS regional offices, a contractor reviewed  the literature on quality measurement and improvement in home and  community-based care, convened an expert panel, and conducted  interviews with state officials. As of April 2003, the guide was undergoing  final clearance within CMS. It is expected to include (1) benchmarks for  effective quality assurance programs in home and community-based care,  (2) a discussion of the knowledge and mechanisms needed to design,  implement, and assess quality activities in home and community-based  care, and (3) suggestions for addressing limitations and problems in  assuring quality in home and community-based care. Another contractor  has developed and field-tested consumer experience surveys for use in  waiver programs for the elderly and for persons with developmental  disabilities. This contractor is also developing a set of performance  indicators for states to use in guiding development and assessing quality in  new self-directed HCBS waivers.", "Technical Assistance and Resources. Other CMS efforts focus on  providing technical assistance and resources to states. One contractor has  assembled a team of professionals with expertise in home and community- based services that can serve as a resource for both states and the CMS  regional offices. Services available from these teams are expected to  include conducting targeted reviews of waiver programs; providing  suggestions to states regarding their quality assurance activities;  consulting with CMS staff regarding quality aspects of specific waivers;  and providing resource materials on quality assurance monitoring and  improvement tools. This contractor is also assessing the types of data  currently gathered by a sample of states that is, or could be, used for  quality measurement and improvement; compiling information on selected  data-driven state quality efforts; and providing technical assistance to the  states. Finally, CMS sponsored a national conference on HCBS quality   measurement and improvement in May 2002. This day-and-a-half-long  conference\u2014attended by state officials, CMS staff, and others\u2014offered  training and information on strategies and techniques for quality assurance  and improvement in home and community-based care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Beneficiary Samples for and Duration of Regional Office Reviews of 15 State Waivers Serving the Elderly", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Target population", "paragraphs": ["review (days)", "The regional office review contained no information on beneficiary interviews or observations.", "This waiver review was conducted at the regional office rather than on-site at the relevant state  agencies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Comments from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
