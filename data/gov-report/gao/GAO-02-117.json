Ongoing operations refer to general property, plant, and  equipment (PP&E) facilities or other assets that are currently being  operated or are currently in use on DOD installations.

Some types of hazardous waste are identified  by their source, that is, by the specific industrial processes that produce the  waste, such as electroplating, which generates sludge from the wastewater  treatment.  Other types are defined by certain characteristics that make the  waste hazardous, such as whether it is flammable, corrosive, reactive, or  toxic. Examples of related operations include hazardous waste landfills  and incinerators, open burn/open detonation sites, and hazardous waste  storage facilities.  RCRA also regulates the operation and closure of  underground storage tanks containing petroleum or hazardous substances  and governs the cleanup of tank releases.

Our response to DOD\u2019s partial  concurrences is included in appendix III.", "In addition, DOD expressed concern that some aspects of the report were  misleading due to its interpretation of certain terms used in the report.

To limit a  discussion of cleanup costs to only those related to restoration and  disposal inappropriately narrows the applicability of the accounting  standard.  In accordance with the definition of cleanup and the scope of the  accounting standard, the estimated cost to clean up the 221 ongoing and  inactive/closed sites identified in the report are for those actions required  by federal, state, and/or local statutes to remove, contain, and/or dispose of  (1) hazardous waste from property, or (2) material and/or property that  consists of hazardous waste at permanent or temporary closure or  shutdown of associated PP&E.  If the required action\u2014which in  accordance with the accounting standard may include, but is not limited to,  decontamination, decommissioning, site restoration, site monitoring,  closure, and postclosure costs\u2014has not been accomplished, the liability  for the future costs still remains.  Therefore, the liability for the estimated  future costs to clean up the 221 sites in the report includes future closure  and postclosure costs based on requirements in current operating permits,  as well as liabilities for the remaining closure and postclosure costs of  inactive/closed operations, and closure costs for underground storage  tanks.  Included also are liabilities for remaining costs of decontamination  and/or site restoration required by corrective actions for previous  contamination of inactive/closed operations.", "DOD acknowledged that it did not fully estimate all of its environmental  cleanup costs, but believes our report overstates the extent of the  underestimation.

Overall, we reiterate  our position that our findings and conclusions are well-supported by our  results at the six installations we visited, as well as the systemic  weaknesses we identified in the areas of DOD-wide reporting systems,  record-keeping coordination and maintenance, guidance in reporting  environmental cleanup liabilities, and leadership and focus.  Further, as  explained in the introduction to the report and in appendix I, we intended  to use a representative sample to respond to our requester\u2019s question  regarding the magnitude of cleanup costs associated with DOD\u2019s ongoing  operations.  However, because DOD did not have a comprehensive system  for identifying, summarizing, maintaining, and reporting cleanup costs for  ongoing operations, DOD was unable to provide us with a reliable  population from which to select a representative sample.  Instead, we  selected two installations from each of the three military services as  examples and our conclusions about the magnitude of unreported  liabilities relate only to those six installations.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Ranking Minority Member,  House Committee on the Budget, and to other interested congressional  committees.  We are also sending copies to the  Secretary of Defense; the  Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics; the  Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller); the Deputy Under Secretary of  Defense for Installations and Environment; and the Director of the Office  of Management and Budget.

Our review, with the exception of  training ranges and weapons systems (national defense PP&E), included all  ongoing and inactive/closed operations on six active installations known to  result in hazardous waste and subject to federal, state, and/or local laws or  regulations requiring removal, containment, or disposal of that waste.", "Compliance with federal accounting standards requires the recognition of a  liability if a future outlay of resources is both probable and reasonably  estimable.  To determine if a cleanup liability was probable, we reviewed  federal financial accounting standards, environmental laws and  regulations, and DOD accounting guidance that address environmental  cleanup requirements.  We also interviewed DOD officials responsible for  financial reporting and environmental program management and regional  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) officials responsible for  overseeing the administration of federal environmental laws and  regulations applicable to DOD operations.  To determine if a cleanup  liability was reasonably estimable, we interviewed state regulatory agency  personnel responsible for administering federal, state, and local  environmental laws and regulations that regulate DOD activities and  similar commercial waste management operations.  We obtained  information on plans for cleanup, closure, and postclosure monitoring  required as part of the permitting of waste management operations for both  DOD and similar commercial activities.  We also obtained information on  cost estimates to accomplish those plans for commercial activities.", "To determine the potential scope of DOD operations requiring  environmental cleanup, we obtained the real property databases of each  military service and extracted the assets whose category descriptions (e.g.,  hazardous waste storage facility) indicated an association with a hazardous  or solid waste management or underground storage tank operation.", "Because DOD did not have a centralized or comprehensive system for  identifying, summarizing, maintaining, and reporting the cleanup costs  associated with all of its ongoing operations, we could not use  representative sampling techniques to determine the full scope and  magnitude of its related liability.  Therefore, as agreed with our requester,  we selected 6 of the more than 1,500 active installations reported by DOD  to use as examples. To make preliminary planning decisions about the  potential magnitude of the DOD-wide estimated future cleanup costs for  the operations indicated by the real property extracts, we conducted a  telephone survey of the regulatory officials from 13 states to determine an  average estimated cleanup cost for similar commercial waste management  operations.  We applied the average commercial costs, making assumptions  about operational status and remaining useful lives, to the extracted real  property assets, and ranked individual installations in order of the resulting  potential total cleanup costs. We then selected six DOD installations, two  from each military service, to conduct on-site reviews of the actual scope  and magnitude of the estimated future cleanup costs of their operations  known to result in hazardous waste.  With one exception, which was  selected for its geographical location, the remaining five installations were  selected from the top five in each service with what appeared to be the  highest potential cleanup costs. Appendix II lists the primary locations  where we performed our review.", "To determine the scope and related future cleanup cost estimates of waste  management operations and underground storage tanks for the six  individual DOD installations selected, we conducted on-site reviews at the  state regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over each installation, and at  each selected DOD installation.", "Our objective at each state regulatory agency was to obtain an  understanding of the nature, scope, and cleanup requirements of the waste  management activities at each selected DOD installation.  To accomplish  this, we: (1) interviewed relevant state regulatory agency officials, (2)  reviewed oversight, permitting, and compliance documents for the DOD  installations, and (3) if available, obtained and reviewed documentation of  cleanup cost estimates for similar commercial operations.", "Our objectives at each of the six DOD installations visited were to:   substantiate and supplement the information and insight gained at the   determine the scope of ongoing and inactive/closed operations requiring  cleanup at each installation,  determine the estimated cleanup costs for these operations, and  determine the extent to which these cleanup costs are currently being  reported for budgetary planning and financial statement purposes.", "To accomplish our objectives, we: (1) interviewed installation  environmental officials and reviewed supporting documentation  evidencing operations and their status, (2) reconciled listings of operations  and/or related assets and their status, obtained from the regulator, to  installation environmental office records, (3) physically observed the  existence and status of selected operations and the related PP&E, (4)  obtained future cleanup cost estimates prepared by the environmental  office, (5) compared our findings to installation reporting for DERP  purposes, and (6) reconciled our PP&E extracts from the military service  real property databases, and supplemental information provided by  installation real property office records, to environmental office records of  operations requiring cleanup.", "We summarized the data obtained and analyzed the results of our review by  individual installation and environmental category (see appendix IV).  We  did not independently verify the reliability of the cleanup cost estimates,  nor did we verify the existence or cleanup status of all relevant operations  at each installation visited.", "Except as noted above, our work was conducted in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards from August 2000  through May 2001.

See the \u201cAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\u201d section of this report. 2. Chapter 14 of DOD\u2019s FMR, \u201cAccrued Environmental Restoration  (Cleanup) Liabilities,\u201d is intended to provide guidance in accounting for  and accruing a liability for the costs associated with the containment,  treatment, or removal of contamination that could cause a threat to  public health and the environment.  However, the included guidance  centers around environmental cleanup primarily relating to restoration  activities and costs.  Chapter 13 of DOD\u2019s FMR, \u201cAccrued  Environmental And Non-environmental Disposal Cost Liabilities,\u201d  provides guidance in accounting for and accruing a liability for the  costs associated with the disposal of property, structures, equipment,  munitions, and weapons.  As stated in the \u201cAgency Comments and Our  Evaluation\u201d section, the federal accounting standard requirement to  account for environmental cleanup cost encompasses more than the  restoration and disposal costs guidance currently provided by the FMR.   Regardless of the terminology used, we continue to recommend that  the FMR address the broad range of activities included in the scope of  the federal accounting standard, such as closure and postclosure  monitoring costs. 3. On May 15, 2001, DOD created the new position referred to in its  comment letter, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Installations  and Environment), within the Acquisition, Technology and Logistics  office.  Because DOD has combined responsibility for both real  property and environmental issues in this position, we modified our  recommendation to require the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense  (Installations and Environment) to correct errors in real property  records and to reconcile those records with environmental site records. 4. We have modified the report to clarify the definition of \u201cstandard\u201d as  used in this report and to change the word \u201cmethodology\u201d to  \u201cmethodologies.\u201d  The underground storage tank example in our report  illustrates how the use of nonstandard methodologies can result in  inconsistent and incomparable cost estimates. 5. We disagree that the report\u2019s conclusions about the significance of  DOD\u2019s unreported liabilities are not supported. As discussed in the  body of our report and in the \u201cAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\u201d  section, the unreported environmental cleanup liability for the six  installations visited was 76 percent of the total estimated cleanup costs  for these locations.  The report\u2019s \u201cConclusions\u201d section points out the  lack of and/or weaknesses in DOD-wide reporting systems, record- keeping coordination and maintenance, and leadership and guidance in  reporting environmental cleanup liabilities.  When considered in light of  these DOD-wide weaknesses, we believe the unreported cleanup  liabilities found at the visited installations are more than adequate  support for our conclusion.  Nevertheless, in response to DOD\u2019s  concern, we have modified our report to state that until DOD addresses  the issues discussed in this report, particularly in the areas of guidance  and leadership, we cannot assure the Congress that DOD\u2019s reported  environmental liabilities can be relied on for long-range budget  planning decisions.", "Further, as stated in footnote 12 to our report, federal accounting  standards do not require DOD to record the entire cleanup cost of  ongoing operations as a liability on its current financial statements.   However, those same accounting standards (SFFAS No. 6, par. 109)  would require disclosure of the unrecognized portion of estimated total  cleanup costs.  In other words, DOD would be required to disclose in  the footnotes to its financial statements that portion of the estimated  total liability of $91 million for environmental cleanup of ongoing  operations not reported as a liability on its financial statements. 6. We agree that the scope of our work did not include an audit of all the  real property records at the installations visited and have clarified the  wording of our report to address only the relevant real property  records. 7. DOD is correct in observing that we were purposely trying to survey the  installations with the highest potential costs.  In lieu of using a  representative sample (which was not possible due to problems in  identifying a reliable population from DOD\u2019s records, as discussed in  comment 8), we selected, with one exception, two installations in each  service from the top five having the highest potential environmental  cleanup cost.  This was an attempt to obtain as complete an  understanding as possible of the broad range of cleanup activities that  may be associated with DOD\u2019s ongoing operations.  Further details on  our methodology are disclosed in appendix I, \u201cObjectives, Scope, and  Methodology.\u201d  Our assessment of potential environmental cleanup  costs for individual installations was based on data obtained from  DOD\u2019s real property records.  Review of this data during our installation  visits disclosed significant errors in the relevant real property records,  which in turn caused the initial determinations of potential cleanup  costs to be unreliable.  Thus, we could no longer be certain whether  other DOD installations would have had higher potential cleanup costs  than those selected. 8. We disagree with DOD that our methodology deviated from standard  governmental auditing procedures.  Audit sampling is applicable only  when the auditor expects to draw a conclusion about a population.   Because DOD did not have a comprehensive system for identifying,  summarizing, maintaining, and reporting cleanup cost for ongoing  operations, DOD could not provide a reliable population from which to  select a representative sample.  Instead, as stated in the body of our  report and more fully disclosed in appendix I, \u201cObjectives, Scope, and  Methodology,\u201d we selected two installations from each of the three  military services as examples, and reached conclusions about the  magnitude of unreported liabilities for only those six installations.  Our  selection was not intended to be a representative sample of DOD  installations and we drew no conclusions about any population based  solely on the results of our review of the six installations. 9. We have modified the report to disclose the amount actually reported  by the Air Force. 10. Because DOD could not provide us with detailed lists of all the costs  that comprise its reported liability, we have modified the report to  indicate that estimated cleanup costs not reported through DERP were  \u201cnot likely\u201d to have been reported in DOD\u2019s financial statements.  We  also clarified our support for this issue in footnote 13."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Staff making key contributions to this report were Fannie Bivins, Francine  DelVecchio, Steve Lipscomb, David Merrill, Sheila Miller, Octavia Parks,  Lisa Powell, Ben Severson, and Patrick Tobo."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": ["The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, exists to  support Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities and to help improve  the performance and accountability of the federal government for the American  people.
