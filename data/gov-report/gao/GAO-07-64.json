About 23 HBCUs have taken steps to participate in the program, and 14 have become borrowers. Education has collected and reported limited data on the program's utilization and has not established performance measures or goals to gauge program effectiveness, though Education officials noted they are developing measures and goals. The HBCU loan program provides access to low-cost capital financing and flexibilities not always available elsewhere, but some loan terms and conditions discourage participation, though school officials said they remain interested in the program. The low interest rate and 30-year repayment period were regarded favorably by participants and nonparticipants alike, and the program makes funds available for a broader range of needs than some federal grant programs. However, the requirement to place in a pooled escrow 5 percent of loan proceeds--an insurance mechanism that reduces federal program costs due to any program borrower's potential delinquency or default--monthly payments versus semiannual ones traditionally available from private sources of loans, and the extent to which some loans have been collateralized could discourage participation. While Education has taken steps to improve the program, significant weaknesses in its management control could compromise the program's effectiveness and efficiency. Education has recently provided schools with both fixed and variable interest rate options, allowed for larger loans, and afforded more opportunities to negotiate loan terms. Also, Education has increased its marketing efforts for the program. However, Education has not established effective management control to ensure that it is (1) communicating with schools in a useful and timely manner, (2) complying with statutory requirements to meet twice each year with an advisory board composed of HBCU experts and properly account for the cost of the program, and (3) monitoring the performance of the program's contractor. Officials from 4 HBCUs in Louisiana and Mississippi told us that in light of the extensive 2005 hurricane damage to their campuses, they were pleased with certain emergency loan provisions but concerned that there would not be sufficient time to take advantage of Education's authority to waive or modify the program provisions. School officials from the 4 schools noted that their institutions had incurred extensive physical damage that was caused by water, wind, and, in one case, fire, and that the full financial impact of the hurricanes may remain unknown for years. Although Education officials told us that they have not yet determined the extent to which the authority under the emergency legislation to waive or modify program provisions for hurricane-affected institutions would be used, the department would be prepared to provide loans to hurricane-affected HBCUs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The nation\u2019s Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), like  many of the approximately 6,500 other institutions of higher education in  the country, undertake capital improvements, including renovating  existing or constructing new instructional facilities, to provide their  students appropriate settings for learning and social development. Many  HBCUs, which number around 100 schools, face numerous challenges in  funding capital projects because they have relatively small enrollments,  limited endowments, and face other financial constraints. Despite these  challenges, HBCUs have distinguished themselves by granting a  substantial portion of the degrees earned by African-Americans. For  example, in school year 2003-2004, HBCUs granted about 13.5 percent of  all degrees earned by African-Americans while constituting only   1.5 percent of the nation\u2019s postsecondary institutions.", "To help these schools fund capital projects, Congress created the HBCU  Capital Financing Program in 1992 under the Higher Education Act of 1965  (HEA) to provide eligible HBCUs with access to low-cost financing. The  Department of Education (Education) is responsible for overall program  management and is expected to regularly consult with the HBCU Capital  Financing Advisory Board (Advisory Board). The Advisory Board is  composed of the Secretary of Education, or the Secretary\u2019s designee,  presidents of private and public HBCUs, and other experts on HBCUs.  Operation of the program is contracted to a designated bonding authority  (DBA) that, among other lending functions, raises funds by issuing bonds  for purchase by the Federal Financing Bank (FFB)\u2014a government  corporation under the supervision and direction of the Department of  Treasury (Treasury) that assists federal agencies in financing agency- issued or agency-guaranteed securities. Funds raised are subsequently lent  to eligible HBCUs at an interest rate slightly above the government\u2019s cost  of borrowing to finance qualified capital projects. As part of its  responsibilities in managing a federal credit program subject to the  Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA), Education is required to  determine the net cost to the government of extending credit over the life  of a loan\u2014the subsidy cost\u2014in the year the loan is made. Congress must  provide Education with budget authority to cover these costs before loans  are provided to HBCUs. Since the program was first funded,  appropriations legislation has, in general, limited the subsidy costs of the  HBCU capital financing to no greater than zero.", "In August of 2005, the campuses of some HBCUs in the Gulf Coast were  severely damaged by Hurricane Katrina or Rita. To assist these HBCUs in  their recovery efforts, in June 2006, Congress, in the Emergency  Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror,  and Hurricane Recovery, 2006 (Emergency Act), amended certain  statutory provisions for institutions affected by the Gulf Coast hurricane  disasters and granted the Secretary of Education the authority to waive or  modify any statutory or regulatory provisions of the program in  connection with a Gulf Coast hurricane disaster. In addition, the  Emergency Act provides that the authority to enter into, waive, or modify  the terms of a loan agreement expires 1 year after the legislation\u2019s  enactment.", "In light of the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, you  had questions about the utilization of the program and Education\u2019s  management of the program. To address your interests, we reviewed the  program by considering (1) the capital project needs of the nation\u2019s  HBCUs and the extent to which HBCUs have used the program; (2) the  relative advantages of the program, if any, compared with other sources of  funding, and schools\u2019 perspectives on the loan terms and conditions;   (3) whether Education\u2019s administration and management of the program  ensures program effectiveness; and (4) schools\u2019 perspectives on the  emergency loan provisions of the Emergency Act and Education\u2019s plans  for implementing them.", "To conduct our work, we reviewed and analyzed applicable laws and  regulations as well as program data and documents pertaining to program  participation, program policies, and agreements among Education, the  DBA, the FFB, and participating schools.

To provide some context  for understanding HBCUs\u2019 capital project needs, we analyzed available  national studies concerning such needs of postsecondary institutions and  HBCUs in particular. In addition, we reviewed alternative capital funding  sources, including private sector financing and federal grants available to  HBCUs and asked schools how these sources or funding options compare  to the program. We interviewed officials representing Education, its DBA,  the Advisory Board, the FFB, the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB), the Small Business Administration (SBA), associations  knowledgeable about HBCUs, and the Bond Market Association. We  conducted semistructured interviews with 34 HBCUs. (See app. I.) We  interviewed all 13 program participants that originated loans prior to 2006,  and a purposive sample of 21 nonparticipants.

The two principles of credit  reform are defining subsidy cost and requiring that budget authority to  cover these costs be provided in advance before new loan obligations are  incurred. OMB is responsible for coordinating the estimation of subsidy  costs. Subsidy costs are determined by calculating the net present value  of estimated cash flows to and from the government that result from  providing loans and loan guarantees to borrowers. (Guaranteed loans that  are financed by the FFB are treated as direct loans for budgetary  purposes, in accordance with FCRA.) Cash flows for direct loans include,  for example, loan disbursements to borrowers and borrower repayments  of principal and payments of interest to the government. Estimated cash  flows are adjusted to reflect the risks associated with potential borrower  delinquencies and defaults, and estimates of amounts collected on  defaulted loans. Subsidy costs can be positive or negative. If the net  present value of cash outflows exceeds the net present value of cash  inflows, the government incurs a positive subsidy cost. On the other hand,  the government realizes a gain in revenue if there is a negative subsidy.  Since the program was established, appropriations legislation has, in  general, limited the subsidy costs of the program to be no greater than  zero. In addition, the legislation authorizing the program established a  credit authority limit of $375 million; of this amount, private HBCUs are  collectively limited to borrowing $250 million, and public HBCUs are  collectively limited to borrowing $125 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "2005 Gulf Coast Hurricanes and Disaster Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Over a period of 2 months in 2005, three hurricanes struck the Gulf Coast  region of the United States, resulting in more than $118 billion in estimated  property damages.

They said that capital  projects, including the construction of new dormitories, renovation of  aging or historic facilities, repair of infrastructure, and addressing long- standing deferred maintenance are needed for a variety of reasons. New  facilities such as dormitories and student centers are often needed as a  result of enrollment growth, for example, while modernization of existing  facilities is needed to accommodate technological advances. For example,  Tuskegee University renovated an existing facility to house its hospitality  management program, creating modern meeting facilities along with a full- service hotel, which provides students with a real-world laboratory in  which they gain immediate hands-on experiences (see fig. 1). In addition,  many of the school officials who we interviewed reported that their  schools had particularly old facilities, many of which are listed in the  National Register of Historic Places.

Over the history of the program,  Education has collected some information to track program utilization,  including the number of inquiries and applications received and the loan  volume requested, approved, and awarded. However, Education has not  widely reported such data. Education has provided certain elements of its  program utilization data to Congress\u2019 appropriations committees via its  annual justifications of budget estimates documents. Table 3 shows the  data collected by Education to track program utilization.", "Education officials noted that while the data they collect are useful to  indicate the extent to which the schools have used or accessed the  program, they are inadequate to address questions concerning whether the  program is under- or overutilized or to demonstrate program effectiveness.  These officials noted that they believe program performance measures  would be useful but that developing such measures is particularly  challenging for a credit program like the HBCU Capital Financing  Program. This is so in part because participation in a loan program is  dependent on complex factors, such as schools\u2019 funding needs, the  availability of other sources of financing, and schools\u2019 desire and capacity  to assume debt. Program officials cautioned against setting firm program  participation goals, for example, because they would not want Education  to be perceived as \u201cpushing\u201d debt onto schools that either do not want to,  or should not, assume loan obligations before their circumstances warrant  doing so. Another complicating factor program officials cited was the  small number of potential program beneficiaries. One Education official  noted that Education has established performance goals and measures for  its student grant and loan aid programs, which are based on sophisticated  survey mechanisms designed to measure customer (students, parents, and  schools) satisfaction with the department\u2019s aid application, receipt, and  accounting processes. Because the scope of the student aid programs is  large, encompassing millions of students and parents and thousands of  schools, it is reasonable to develop and use such measures, the official  noted. In contrast, such measures may not be meaningful given the small  number of HBCUs and the frequency with which loans are made under the  Capital Financing Program. Nevertheless, these officials told us that they  believe program performance measures would be useful to gauge program  effectiveness. They have established a working group to develop  performance measures for the program and were consulting with OMB  and other federal officials with expertise on federal credit programs to  guide their efforts.

Some officials noted that the program offers  loans with lower interest rates than traditional bank loans. Moreover, the  program\u2019s interest rates are typically less than the interest rates schools  would be required to pay investors if they issued their own bonds to raise  funds. According to school officials and bond industry experts, some  HBCUs could obtain, and some have obtained, lower interest rates than  those offered under the program by issuing their own tax-exempt bonds.  However, this is predicated on a school\u2019s ability to obtain a strong credit  rating from a credit rating agency. Schools with weaker or noninvestment  grade credit ratings would likely have to pay investors higher interest  rates. In addition, schools issuing taxable bonds would likely pay higher  interest rates to investors, compared to the program\u2019s interest rates,  regardless of the schools\u2019 credit ratings. While schools can lower interest  rates paid to bond investors by purchasing bond insurance, the cost to do  so may be prohibitive. For these reasons, officials at Education and  HBCUs, as well as bond industry experts, told us that the HBCU Capital  Financing Program may be ideally suited for schools that have or would  receive a noninvestment grade rating. Participation in the program may  also benefit schools by enhancing their ability to issue their own bonds in  the future. An official at one HBCU, for example, told us that obtaining  and repaying a loan under the program had allowed the school to  demonstrate its fiscal stability and to subsequently issue its own bond with  a lower interest rate than was then being offered under the program.", "In addition to citing lower interest rates, a large majority of the HBCU  officials we spoke to said that the program\u2019s 30-year loan repayment  period was attractive, and some noted that private funding sources would  likely offer 20 years or less. Some school officials noted that the longer  repayment period allowed schools to borrow more or reduce the amount  of monthly payments. Borrowing larger amounts, officials reported,  allowed them to finance larger or more capital projects. Another school  we spoke with that once considered using the program said that even  though it was able to issue a tax-exempt bond and obtain a more favorable  interest rate, it could only obtain a 20-year maturity period for the bond.", "Some HBCU officials told us they preferred grants to loans but noted that,  in general, compared to other federal grant programs, more HBCUs are  eligible for the HBCU loan program, and that it also funds a wider variety  of projects. Grants are available for most HBCUs under the Higher  Education Act\u2019s strengthening institutions programs, also administered by  Education, which fund capital projects as well as other activities, such as  faculty and academic program development. However, fewer HBCUs are  eligible for other federal grant programs that provide funding for capital  projects. For example, the Department of Agriculture\u2019s 1890 Facilities  Grant Program is only for those 18 HBCUs that are land grant institutions.  Similarly, the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 facilities  improvement program provides only for those HBCUs with a biomedical  and behavioral research program. While there are a variety of other  assistance programs offered by charitable foundations, and state and local  governments, available funding is limited."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Escrow Arrangement, among Other Terms and Conditions, Was Cited as a Disincentive to Participating in the Program", "paragraphs": ["HBCU officials we spoke with\u2014participants and nonparticipants alike\u2014 reported that a disincentive to participation in the program was the pooled  escrow; additionally, other terms and conditions, such as the monthly  repayment schedule and the extent to which loans are collateralized, were  also viewed by some as deterrents. Over half of HBCU respondents we  spoke with\u2014both participants and nonparticipants\u2014agreed that the  pooled escrow was a drawback, and over one-fifth said that it actually  deters participation. The escrow funds, which reduce the federal budget  cost of the program by offsetting the estimated costs associated with  delinquent loan repayments and borrower defaults, net of collections, are  returned to program participants if no such losses occur. However, a  recent default by one borrower\u2014the first to occur in the program\u2019s  history\u2014has heightened awareness among program participants of the  financial risk for them inherent in the pooled escrow arrangement. Since  the default, Education has withdrawn funds from participating schools\u2019  escrow accounts twice and will continue doing so until the default is  resolved, leaving other schools uncertain as to how much of their own  escrow accounts will remain or be replenished. The pooled escrow  feature also presents a problem for state institutions because they are  prohibited from assuming the liability of another institution. One program  official said that this issue was common for state schools because state  law prohibits the lending of public funds to nonstate entities\u2014considered  to be the case when state funds in escrow are used to hedge against the  delinquency of another institution. One participating public HBCU  reported that it had to resolve this problem by accounting for its escrow  payments as a fee that would not be returned to the school rather than a  sum that could be recovered, as the program intends. Because the escrow  feature is mandated by law, any changes to this arrangement would  require congressional authorization. Additionally, in order to maintain the  federal subsidy cost of the program at or below zero, other alternatives\u2014 such as assessing additional fees on borrowers, or requiring contributions  to an alternative form of a contingency reserve\u2014would be necessary in  the absence of the pooled escrow arrangement.", "While frequency of payments is not as prevalent a concern as the pooled  escrow, some schools objected to the program\u2019s requirement that  repayments be made monthly as opposed to semiannually, as is common  in the private market. Schools participating in the HBCU Program have  been required by the DBA to make payments monthly, although FFB  lending policy is to require repayments only on a semiannual basis.  Despite the fact that participants have met the terms of an extensive credit  evaluation process, DBA officials expressed the view that the monthly  repayment requirement promotes good financial stewardship on the part  of the schools. However, some HBCU officials said that they incur  opportunity costs in making payments on a monthly versus a semiannual  basis. They also noted that it would be more practical if payments were to  coincide with the beginning of their semesters, when their cash flows are  typically more robust.", "Additionally, almost half of the participating schools expressed concern  about the amount of collateral they had to pledge in order to obtain a loan.  In most cases, program participants have pledged certain real property as  collateral, though endowment funds and anticipated tuition revenue are  also allowed as collateral. Some HBCU officials said their loans were  overcollateralized in that the value of the real estate pledged as security  exceeded the value of the loan. They noted that such circumstances can  present a problem for those schools trying to obtain additional capital  financing without sufficient assets remaining available as collateral. One  nonparticipant cited the collateral required of other institutions as a  reason for its decision not to participate. When asked about the amount of  collateral required, Education and DBA officials reported that the extent  and amount of collateral required to obtain a loan under the program  varies depending on the individual circumstances of an institution. The  amount of collateral required may be less for institutions that have  maintained relatively large endowments and stable tuition revenue and  more for institutions that have few or no physical properties to use as  collateral, for example. Education officials further noted that requiring the  value of collateral to be greater than the value of the loan was not an  uncommon business practice.", "Overall, more than two-thirds of the participant schools and more than a  third of the nonparticipants said they are interested in using the program  but some said that their continued or future interest in the program would  depend on its being modified. Several schools suggested the types of  projects eligible for funding could be broadened, which might allow them  to undertake capital projects that would, in turn, assist them in attracting  and retaining additional students. Campus beautification projects and  multipurpose community centers were cited as examples. In addition, they  regarded new construction\u2014for which program loans are available only  under exceptional circumstances\u2014as particularly important because new  construction attracts more students and because renovations often incur  unexpected costs. Nevertheless, many public HBCU school officials we  spoke with said that in view of their states\u2019 continuing fiscal constraints,  they expect to consider the loan program as a future funding resource."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Education Has Taken Some Steps to Improve the Program, but Weaknesses in Management Control Exist", "paragraphs": ["While Education has taken limited steps to improve the program, we  found significant weaknesses in management controls that compromise  the extent to which Education can ensure program objectives are being  achieved effectively and efficiently.

Department officials said that changes to the program were  necessary to remain competitive with other programs and the private  market. These flexible terms included a variable interest rate option and  the opportunity to negotiate the amount of additional debt that a school  can subsequently assume through other financing arrangements. In fact,  since 2003, 4 of the 7 schools that have received loans have taken  advantage of the variable interest rate. Regarding the department\u2019s  monitoring of their debt, officials at another school said that they were  able to negotiate with the DBA the amount of additional debt they could  assume\u2014from $500,000 to $1 million\u2014before they would have to notify  the department. School officials said this change was important because it  not only reduced their administrative burden but it also gave them  additional leeway to pursue other capital financing. The program made  greater use of loans for the sole purpose of refinancing existing debt since  2003. Two participants reported an estimated savings of at least   $3.7 million by refinancing under the program. According to department  officials, Education has also made greater use of the Secretary\u2019s authority  to originate loans exceeding $10 million and to make multiple loans to an  institution, providing schools with more purchasing power. Program  officials said that while the limit on the amount and number of loans that  could be made was to prevent disproportionate use of the loan fund by  larger and more affluent schools, it no longer reflected the reality of  current costs for construction and renovation or the budgetary constraints  facing many states.", "Additionally, program officials we spoke with said they had enhanced  program marketing. For example, the DBA has developed a Web site  describing the program and offering answers to frequently asked  questions. In addition, officials reported attending the national and  regional conferences for college executives shown in table 4, completing  over 60 campus site visits and contacting other school officials by  telephone. Program officials also reported that most schools received  written correspondence or an e-mail to inform them of the program. By  these efforts, all HBCUs have been contacted in 2005, according to DBA  officials. They also said they timed these outreach efforts to correspond  with schools\u2019 annual budgetary and enrollment processes in order to  prompt schools to think about potential capital projects that could fit the  program.

While program materials represent the loan  application as a 2- to 3-month process, about two-thirds of the loans made  since January 2001 were not closed until 7 to 18 months after application.  Officials from one school said that it had taken 6 to 7 months for the DBA  to relay from Education a clarification as to whether its proposed project  was eligible. Other schools reported that Education had not provided  timely or clear information about the status of their loans. In some cases,  schools reported that the lengthy loan process resulted in project delays  and cost increases over the intervening time period.

With  regard to making loan payments, several officials we interviewed said that  DBA officials had not provided information that was in sufficient detail. In  one situation, officials from one school reported that school auditors had  questioned the accuracy of the loan payment amount for which the school  was billed by the DBA because the billing statements omitted information  concerning the extent to which the amount billed included escrow  payments. Other officials noted that they had not received written  notification from the DBA concerning the full amount of their potential  liability after funds had been withdrawn from the schools\u2019 escrow  accounts to cover payments on behalf of another borrower that had  recently defaulted on a loan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Compliance with Program and Budget Laws and Federal Financial Accounting Standards", "paragraphs": ["Education has not complied with certain statutory requirements relating to  the program\u2019s operations and how federal agencies are to account for the  government\u2019s cost of federal loan programs. In creating the program,  Congress established within the Department of Education an HBCU  Capital Financing Advisory Board composed of the (1) Secretary of  Education or the Secretary\u2019s designee, (2) three members who are  presidents of private HBCUs, (3) two members who are presidents of  public HBCUs, (4) the President of the United Negro College Fund or  his/her designee, (5) the President of the National Association for Equal  Opportunity in Higher Education or his/her designee, and (6) the  Executive Director of the White House Initiative on HBCUs. By law, the  Advisory Board is to provide advice and counsel to the Secretary of  Education and the DBA concerning the capital financing needs of HBCUs,  how these needs can be met through the program, and what additional  steps might be taken to improve the program. To carry out its mission, the  law requires that the board meet with the Secretary of Education at least  twice each year. Despite this requirement, the board has met only three  times in the past 12 years, the most recent meeting occurring in May 2005.  According to Education officials, the Advisory Board did not routinely  meet because of turnover among Education staff as well as HBCU  presidents designated to serve on the board. Education officials told us  that there could have been other reasons why the Advisory Board did not  meet in earlier years, but none that they had knowledge of. Although  Education officials told us that they had believed another Advisory Board  meeting would be convened soon after the May 2005 meeting, no such  meeting has yet been scheduled.", "We also found that Education has not fully complied with requirements of  the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, which, along with guidance issued  by OMB and accounting standards, provide the framework that Education  is to use in calculating the federal budget costs of the program. In  particular, Education has excluded certain fees paid by HBCUs from its  calculations of program costs. The interest payments made by HBCUs on  program loans includes a surcharge of 1/8th of 1 percent assessed by FFB  in accordance with its policy and as permitted by statutory provisions  governing its transactions. Under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990,  these fees\u2014i.e., the surcharge\u2014are to be recognized as cash flows to the  government and included in agencies\u2019 estimated costs of the credit  programs they administer. In addition, these fees are to be credited to the  program\u2019s financing account. OMB officials responsible for coordinating  agencies\u2019 subsidy cost estimates acknowledged that Education should  include the fees in its budgetary cost estimates and noted that other  agencies with similar programs do so. Further, the written agreement  among Education, the FFB, and the DBA that governs the issuance of  bonds by the DBA for purchase by the FFB for the purpose of funding  loans under the program also stipulates that these fees are to be credited  to Education. Despite these provisions, Education has not included the  fees in its calculations of the federal cost of the program, thereby  overestimating the program\u2019s costs; nor has Education accounted for the  fees on its financial statements. Instead, the DBA has collected and held  these fees in trust. Although the contract between Education and the  DBA generally describes how the DBA is to manage the proceeds from and  the payment of bonds issued to fund loans made to HBCUs, it does not  specifically address how the DBA is to manage the payments that reflect  the 1/8th of 1 percent paid by borrowers. In general, the DBA collects  borrower repayments and remits the proceeds to the FFB to pay amounts  due on the program\u2019s outstanding bonds. However, the amounts paid to  the FFB do not include the fees paid by borrowers. As a result, it is unclear  how these funds, retained by the DBA, are to be eventually returned to the  federal government. Moreover, Education has not monitored the DBA\u2019s  handling of these funds and is unaware of the accumulated balance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Monitoring the Performance of the DBA", "paragraphs": ["Although the current DBA has been under contract with Education for  over 5 years, Education has not yet assessed its performance with respect  to key program activities and contractual obligations, although Education  officials said that they have been pleased with the DBA\u2019s performance.  One of these major activities is \u201cmarketing\u201d the capital financing program  among HBCUs in order to raise awareness and help ensure that the  program is fully utilized. Although the DBA is required by its contract with  Education to submit annual reports and audited financial statements to  Education, it has not done so. While DBA officials told us the department  has offered some informal assessments, Education officials have not  guided their marketing efforts. Still, we found indications that the DBA\u2019s  marketing strategy has likely suffered from a lack of guidance and  monitoring by Education. Officials we spoke with at 4 schools did not  know of the program, and another eight told us they had learned about it  from peers or advocacy organizations. Others were aware of the DBA\u2019s  marketing activities, but offered a number of suggestions for  improvement, citing a need for more specific information as to the extent  to which collateral would be needed, how the program meets the needs of  both private and public schools, or examples and testimonials about  funded projects. Several school officials said DBA outreach through  conferences was not necessarily well targeted\u2014either because the  selected conferences covered a full range of topics for a variety of schools  and not only HBCUs, or because they focused on issues relating to either  public or private HBCUs, or because they drew school officials not  involved in facilities planning. Additionally, the DBA has reserved its  direct contact marketing largely for 4-year schools. DBA officials justified  this decision on grounds that smaller schools tended to have more  difficulty borrowing and that they had targeted larger schools that they  believed would be most likely to benefit from the program. However, as  prescribed by law, loans are to be fairly allocated among as many eligible  institutions as possible. Because the DBA\u2019s compensation is determined as  a percentage of the amount borrowed, and the costs it incurs may not vary  significantly from loan to loan, it is important to monitor its activities to  ensure it is not making loans exclusively to schools that are likely to  borrow larger amounts and for which its potential for profit is highest.", "With regard to the DBA\u2019s basic responsibility for keeping records, we  found several cases in which critical documents were missing from loan  agreement files. Moreover, the DBA was unable to provide us with entirely  complete files for any of the 14 institutions that had participated or were  participating in the program. For example, documents that included loan  applications, decision memoranda, financial statements, and real property  titles were missing for several schools. In our file review, we found that  files for 9 schools did not include the original application. Files for   8 schools did not include the required financial statements for  demonstrating long-term financial stability, and 5 lacked DBA memoranda  pertaining to the decision to make the loan.

School  officials told us that they have not been able to fully assess all hurricane- related costs, such as replacing property, repairing plumbing systems,  landscaping, and replacing sidewalks, and as result, current estimates are  only preliminary. School officials noted that the assessment process was  lengthy because of, among other things, the time required to prioritize  campus restoration needs, undertake complex assessments of historic  properties, follow state assessment processes, and negotiate insurance  settlements. Each of the four schools we contacted incurred physical  damages caused by water and wind; one school also incurred damage by  fire. For example, the campuses of all three schools in New Orleans were  submerged in 2 to 11 feet of water for about a month after the hurricanes,  damaging the first floors of many buildings as well as their contents. As a  result, schools required removal of debris and hazardous waste (e.g., mold  and asbestos), repair and renovation, and the taking of actions  recommended by FEMA to mitigate future risks. Xavier University  officials, who preliminarily estimated $40 million to $50 million in damage  to their school, said that they faced the need to undertake several capital  projects, including replacing elevators, repairing roofs, and rehabilitating  the campus auditorium and replacing its contents. According to officials  from Southern University at New Orleans, state officials have estimated  damages at about $17 million; at the time of our visit 10 months after the  hurricanes, state insurance assessors were beginning their work on the  campus library, where mold reached all three floors, covering books, art  collections, card catalogues, and computers. Officials at Dillard University  also reported extensive damage, preliminarily estimated as high as   $207 million.

They said the normal sources of information for credit  evaluation\u2014such as audited financial records from the last 5 years\u2014 would be difficult to produce. Other conditions of the emergency loan  provisions some officials found favorable were the likelihood that loans  would be awarded sooner\u2014providing a timely infusion of funds\u2014with  more flexibility compared to other programs. Officials at both Dillard and  Xavier Universities said that because their institutions had already spent a  significant amount of their available resources, the emergency loans could  be used to bridge any emerging financial difficulties they experience as  they continue to pursue insurance settlements and assistance from other  federal agencies, including FEMA and SBA. Additionally, some school  officials said that the program may allow for greater flexibility compared  to FEMA and SBA aid.
