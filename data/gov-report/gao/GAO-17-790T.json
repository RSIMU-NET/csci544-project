Specifically, these weaknesses were related to Interior's Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)\u2014under the Office of the Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs (Indian Affairs)\u2014in overseeing education services and managing Indian energy resources, and HHS's Indian Health Service (IHS) in administering health care services. GAO cited nearly 40 recommendations in its 2017 High Risk report that were not implemented, and has since made an additional 12 recommendations in two new reports on BIE school safety and construction published in late May of this year. Interior and HHS have taken some steps to address these recommendations but only one has been fully implemented.", "Education. GAO has found serious weaknesses in Indian Affairs' oversight of Indian education. For example, in 2016, GAO found that the agency's lack of oversight of BIE school safety contributed to deteriorating facilities and equipment in school facilities. At one school, GAO found seven boilers that failed inspection because of safety hazards, such as elevated levels of carbon monoxide and a natural gas leak. In 2017, GAO found key weaknesses in the way Indian Affairs oversees personnel responsible for inspecting BIE school facilities for safety and manages BIE school construction projects. Of GAO's 23 recommendations on Indian education\u2014including recommendations cited in GAO's 2017 High Risk report and in two late May reports\u2014none have been fully implemented.", "Energy resource management. In three prior reports on Indian energy, GAO found that BIA inefficiently managed Indian energy resources and the development process, thereby limiting opportunities for tribes and their members to use those resources to create economic benefits and improve the well-being of their communities. GAO categorized concerns associated with BIA management of energy resources and the development process into four broad areas, including oversight of BIA activities, collaboration, and BIA workforce planning. GAO made 14 recommendations to BIA to address its management weaknesses, which were cited in the 2017 High Risk report. However, none have been fully implemented.", "Health care. GAO has found that IHS provides inadequate oversight of its federally operated health care facilities and of its Purchased/Referred Care program. For example, in 2016 and 2017, GAO found that IHS provided limited and inconsistent oversight of the timeliness and quality of care provided in its facilities and that inconsistencies in quality oversight were exacerbated by significant turnover in area leadership. GAO also found that IHS did not equitably allocate funds to meet the health care needs of Indians. Of GAO's 13 recommendations on Indian health care cited in GAO's 2017 High Risk report, one has been fully implemented."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO cited nearly 40 unimplemented recommendations in its February 2017 High Risk report on federal programs for Indian tribes in education, energy development, and health care, and added 12 recommendations in two new reports on BIE school safety and construction in late May of this year.

These weaknesses included  poor conditions at BIE school facilities that endangered students, and  inadequate oversight of health care that hindered IHS\u2019s ability to ensure  quality care to Indian communities. In addition, we have reported that BIA  has mismanaged Indian energy resources and thereby limited  opportunities for tribes and their members to use those resources to  create economic benefits and improve the well-being of their  communities.

This  would be consistent with the expressed view of Congress as to the  federal government\u2019s trust responsibilities, and would strengthen  confidence in the performance and accountability of our federal  government. In light of this unique trust responsibility and concern about  the federal government ineffectively administering Indian education and  health care programs and mismanaging Indian energy resources, we  added these programs as a high-risk area because they uniquely affect  tribal nations and their members.", "The focus of our high risk issue area is on management weaknesses  within federal agencies that administer programs that serve tribes and  their members. However, not all federal programs are administered by  federal agencies. In accordance with federal Indian policy that recognizes  the right of Indian tribes to self-government and supports tribal self- determination, a number of tribes have elected to take over administration  of certain federal programs and services from BIA, BIE, and IHS. Our  recommendations identified in the high risk issue area do not necessarily  reflect on the performance of programs administered by tribes.", "My testimony today will discuss our recommendations to Interior and HHS  on these issues.

In particular, we found that BIE did not have procedures in place  specifying who should be involved in making key decisions, resulting in  inaccurate guidance provided to some BIE schools about the appropriate  academic assessments required by federal law. We also found that Indian  Affairs had not developed a strategic plan with specific goals and  measures for itself or BIE or conducted workforce analysis to ensure it  has the right people in place with the right skills to effectively meet the  needs of BIE schools. Further, we found that fragmented administrative  services for BIE schools and a lack of clear roles for BIE and Indian  Affairs\u2019 Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Management  contributed to delays in BIE schools acquiring needed materials, such as  textbooks.

Four  of the boilers were located in a student dormitory, and three were located  in classroom buildings. All but one of the boilers were about 50 years old.  Although the poor condition of the boilers posed an imminent danger to  the safety of students and staff, most of them were not repaired until  about 8 months after failing their inspection, prolonging safety risks to  students and staff.

IHS oversees its health care facilities through a decentralized system of  area offices, which are led by area directors and located in 12 geographic  areas. In fiscal year 2016, IHS allocated about $1.9 billion for health  services provided by federally and tribally operated hospitals, health  centers, and health stations.

To be eligible for PRC services,  recipients must generally meet several criteria, including being a member  or descendant of a federally recognized tribe or having close social and  economic ties with the tribe, and living within a designated PRC area.  Although funding available for the PRC program has recently increased,  we have reported that the program is unable to pay for all eligible  services, and that these gaps in services sometimes delay diagnoses and  treatments, which can exacerbate the severity of a patient\u2019s condition and  necessitate more intensive treatment.", "As discussed below, we made 13 recommendations to IHS that were  unimplemented when we issued our 2017 High Risk report, with which  HHS generally agreed.

These  recommendations and matter for Congress to consider were based on  our findings of wide variations in PRC funding across the 12 IHS areas,  that these variations were largely maintained by IHS\u2019s long-standing use  of its base funding methodology, that variation in PRC funding was  sometimes not related to the availability of IHS-funded hospitals, that  IHS\u2019s estimate of PRC service users was imprecise, and that IHS allowed  area offices to distribute program increase funds to local PRC programs  using different criteria than the PRC allocation formula without informing  IHS. As a result, we suggested that Congress consider requiring IHS to develop and use a new method to allocate all PRC program funds to  account for variations across areas, and recommended that IHS use  actual counts of PRC users and variations in levels of available hospital  services in allocation formulas, and develop written policies and  procedures to require area offices to notify IHS when changes are made  to the allocations of funds to PRC programs.", "In response to our matter for Congress to consider, a bill that would have  addressed this matter was introduced in the House and reported out of  committee in 2016, but the bill did not become law.

We reported that the expansion of Medicaid and new  coverage options under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  (PPACA) may allow many American Indians to obtain additional health  care benefits for which they were not previously eligible, resulting in IHS  facilities receiving increased reimbursements from third-party payers and  an increased workload for IHS facility staff responsible for processing  these payments. We also found that IHS did not have an effective plan  in place to ensure that a sufficient number of facility staff were prepared  to assist with enrollment and to process increased third-party payments.
