GAO analyzed FCC data and documents, reviewed stakeholder comments, and interviewed agency officials, stakeholders, and low-power television licensees."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Thousands of over-the-air low-power television stations serve communities across the United States in both urban and rural areas, and about 60 percent of all such stations have either completed the digital transition or have taken steps to transition. Over half of all low-power television stations are known as translators, which retransmit major network and other stations' programming in areas that cannot receive the signals from a primary station, generally in rural and mountainous areas. The remaining stations include low-power television stations known as LPTV stations and Class A stations. Class A stations have a special status that gives them greater interference protection than translator and LPTV stations and requires them to broadcast a minimum amount of locally produced programming. Some LPTV and Class A stations serve niche or local audiences with ethnic, religious, or other programming. In July 2011, FCC issued an order that established a deadline of September 1, 2015, for low-power television stations to cease analog broadcasts, but stations may still face challenges in making the transition to digital because of regulatory uncertainty. Specifically, an FCC proposal to reallocate spectrum from broadcasting to wireless broadband created regulatory uncertainty and difficulty for stations attempting to justify investing in transitioning to digital. Such a reallocation would leave fewer channels for television broadcasts and could make it difficult for low-power stations to find an available channel that does not interfere with other stations. FCC's order noted these concerns when adopting the 2015 deadline, rather than a previously proposed deadline of 2012, but it is currently unknown whether the uncertainty posed by the spectrum reallocation will be resolved prior to 2015. FCC's order adopted other measures, such as establishing a process for Class A stations to transfer their status to their new digital channels. Previously, without such a process, some stations delayed completing their transition to digital and others lost their Class A status after they transitioned to digital and ceased analog operation. According to FCC officials, such stations can apply to regain Class A status; however, stations may be unaware of this option as it is not explicit in the order. Low-power television stations were established to reach underserved communities; FCC has noted that the stations can positively affect FCC's goals of localism and diversity. However, FCC has not collected data to evaluate the extent to which these stations fulfill unmet community needs or contribute to meeting FCC's policy goals. Specifically, FCC does not collect programming data, is limited in its ability to identify stations that are not broadcasting, and has not evaluated low-power stations' impact in assessments of the information needs of communities. Lacking such information, FCC does not know the public benefit of stations and is limited in its ability to weigh the effects of its decisions on low-power television stations against the increasing need for spectrum for broadband services. Furthermore, although FCC proposed allowing additional stations to apply for Class A status as a means to preserve community programming, it has not issued an order and may need legislative guidance to determine the future of Class A status. FCC should (1) explore options for assessing the impact of low-power stations on the communities served and on FCC's goals, and (2) work with Congress as necessary to determine what the long-term role of Class A stations should be, whether additional stations should be permitted to apply for Class A status, and what criteria stations must meet to qualify for such status. FCC stated it is taking actions to address GAO's recommendations, and provided technical comments that were incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["There are thousands of licensed over-the-air low-power television stations  located throughout the country.

Other stations provide general programming, such as  home shopping programming. Although the statutes governing the digital  transition of full-power stations did not require low-power television  stations to transition from analog to digital broadcasts during the 2009  transition of full-power stations, some low-power television stations have  transitioned to digital on their own accord.

Low-power television station licensees can include  municipalities, universities, nonprofit groups, and small businesses. The  development of low-power television stations has evolved since FCC\u2019s  1956 order allowing licensing of low-power translator stations. FCC has  maintained that most low-power television service is a \u201csecondary  service,\u201d meaning low-power television stations may not cause  interference to, and must accept interference from, full-power television  stations, which are classified as a \u201cprimary service.\u201d When interference  cannot be remedied by adjusting an antenna or other technological  methods, low-power television stations must vacate the channel. In such  cases, low-power television stations can submit a displacement  application to FCC requesting permission to move to another channel or  they can request permission to turn off their broadcast signal while  searching for another channel. Cable and satellite providers are generally  not required to carry signals from low-power television stations, but some  low-power television stations are carried by cable or satellite systems in  situations where the low-power station wants to be carried and the cable  or satellite provider decides to carry it.", "FCC uses the term \u201clow-power television stations\u201d to collectively refer to  three types of stations: (1) translator stations; (2) low-power television  stations that are not translator or Class A stations, which FCC refers to as  LPTV stations; and (3) Class A stations. To ensure consistency with  FCC\u2019s terminology, we are using the term \u201clow-power television stations\u201d  to refer to all three types of stations.  \uf0b7  Translator stations: Translator stations retransmit programming from a  primary station, such as a major network (ABC, CBS, FOX, or NBC)  or its affiliate, to audiences unable to receive the signal directly from  the primary station, usually because of distance or terrain barriers  (mountains) that limit the signal\u2019s ability to travel long distances. FCC  rules prohibit translators from originating any programming. \uf0b7  LPTV stations: As with translator stations, FCC\u2019s rules allow stations  with LPTV licenses to retransmit another station\u2019s signals, but the  rules also allow LPTV stations to originate programming. \uf0b7  Class A stations: Unlike translator stations and LPTV stations, Class  A stations are classified as a primary service. When Congress passed  the Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999 (CBPA), it  provided the existing LPTV stations a onetime opportunity to apply for  a special primary status that gave the stations some interference  protection from full-power stations, thereby limiting the instances in  which Class A stations could be displaced by full-power stations. To  qualify for Class A status, an LPTV station was required, during the 90  days prior to enactment of CBPA on November 29, 1999, to \uf0b7  have broadcast a minimum of 18 hours per day,  \uf0b7  have broadcast an average of at least 3 hours of locally produced  programming per week, and \uf0b7  be in compliance with FCC\u2019s requirements for low-power  television stations.", "Stations that applied for and received Class A status must meet  requirements that are not applied to other low-power television stations,  such as broadcasting an average of at least 3 hours per week of locally  produced programming.", "Digital broadcasting provides clearer pictures and sound than analog  broadcasting. Analog signals fade with distance, so consumers living  farther from a television tower may experience degraded audio and video.  With digital technology, pictures and sounds are converted into a stream  of digits consisting of zeros and ones. Although digital signals also fade  with distance, techniques can be applied to maintain and improve the  quality of the broadcast so that pictures and sound generally retain their  quality.", "To transition from analog to digital broadcasts, existing low-power  television stations must take the following steps:  \uf0b7  Apply to FCC for a construction permit for a digital \u201cflash cut,\u201d digital  companion channel, or digital displacement. A flash cut means the  station will simultaneously turn off its analog signal and turn on its  digital signal, using its current analog channel as its new digital  channel. A digital companion channel means a different channel is  being used for the digital channel; thus, a station could operate its  analog and digital transmissions concurrently on different channels  until it decides to cease analog broadcasts. A digital displacement  would mean that a station is moving to another channel and is  transitioning to digital. It is similar to a flash cut in that the station will  simultaneously turn off its analog signal and turn on its digital signal,  but it will be using a different channel for the digital signal.  \uf0b7  Construct its digital facilities by September 1, 2015.  \uf0b7  Apply to FCC for a digital license upon completing the construction of  its digital facilities. The station may begin broadcasting digitally while  FCC is processing its license application.", "By completing the digital transition of low-power television stations, FCC  will be able to reclaim spectrum being used by the stations that are  broadcasting in both analog and in digital (on a companion channel). In  addition, FCC has stated that having low-power television stations  complete their digital transition will simplify FCC\u2019s efforts to reallocate  broadcast spectrum for broadband purposes, since there will be more  certainty regarding which channels low-power television stations are  using for their digital operations.", "The federal government has established some funding for low-power  television stations to transition to digital. Congress created the Low- Power Television and Translator Upgrade Program, through which NTIA  made $44 million available to eligible rural stations for reimbursement of  equipment costs related to the transition from analog to digital service.  In addition, some public television low-power facilities used NTIA\u2019s Public  Telecommunications Facilities Program and USDA\u2019s Public Television  Station Digital Transition Grant Program to fund some of the costs for  transitioning to digital."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Thousand Low-Power Television Stations Are Located across the United States and Its Territories, and the Majority of Stations Have Taken Steps to Transition to Digital", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Thousands of Low-Power Television Stations Provide Programming to Communities across the United States", "paragraphs": ["As previously noted, we are using the term \u201clow-power television stations\u201d  to refer to translators, LPTV stations, and Class A stations.

According to FCC data, there are about 3,900  translators located across the country, as shown in figure 1. Translators  tend to be concentrated in both rural and mountainous areas. Translator  stations may be part of publicly owned systems that retransmit television  signals to areas that cannot receive signals from full-power stations  because they are too far away, or because terrain blocks the signals. In  such cases, translators may be the only source of free over-the-air  programming from nearby full-power television stations, including network  programming, public broadcasting, and emergency alerts. For example, a  translator association in Colorado is a publicly owned system of stations  funded by local taxes that provides the only over-the-air television service  in the area, retransmitting a number of satellite and regional full-power  stations\u2019 signals to rural communities surrounded by mountainous terrain.  Many viewers in this area cannot otherwise receive over-the-air television  signals from regional network broadcasters because of long distances  and rugged terrain.", "Some translators are part of a \u201cdaisy chain,\u201d in which multiple translators  relay signals from one translator to another, allowing the originating  station\u2019s signal to be received a few hundred miles away. Translators  receive programming on an input channel, and retransmit the signal on an  output channel, meaning two channels are used per station, as shown in  figure 2. In cases where multiple stations\u2019 signals are being retransmitted,  each station would require separate incoming and outgoing channels. For  example, a translator system in Utah retransmits signals for several Salt  Lake City stations. Because each site in Utah\u2019s translator system must  use 2 separate, nonadjacent channels to successfully retransmit each  station\u2019s signal with minimal interference, a site in the system  retransmitting nine stations\u2019 signals would need 18 channels.", "LPTV and Class A stations: According to FCC data, there are about 2,000  LPTV stations and about 500 Class A stations. As shown in figure 3,  these stations are located in both rural and urban areas throughout the  country.", "FCC does not require broadcasters to submit programming information,  with limited exceptions, so it is difficult to report on the specific types of  programming provided by low-power television stations. However, based  on our interviews and reviews of documentation, it is evident that some  LPTV and Class A stations provide foreign-language, religious,  educational (e.g., programming from a university or local school system),  and home shopping programming. For example, one licensee we  contacted owns and operates several full-power, Class A, and LPTV  stations that air Spanish-language programming as an affiliate group for  the Telemundo network. This licensee told us that its Class A stations in  Washington, D.C., and Orlando, Florida, air daily local news broadcasts.  They also hold annual community events, providing the opportunity for  face-to-face interactions between station personnel and the community.  As previously noted, LPTV stations can act as translators by  retransmitting programming from a primary station, so some LPTV  stations may actually be serving the function of a translator, and the  number of such stations is unknown. For example, a licensee told us that  a LPTV station in Colorado acts primarily as a translator, but occasionally  overrides the system\u2019s broadcast with its own broadcasts of local high- school sporting events, community meetings, and other events."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "More than Half of Low- Power Television Stations Have Taken Steps to Transition to Digital", "paragraphs": ["More than half of low-power television stations have taken steps to  transition to digital. Low-power television station representatives we  spoke with cited a number of benefits to broadcasting in digital, including  improved picture and sound quality and improved broadcast coverage.  Another significant benefit of digital is the ability to broadcast multiple  program streams through one 6-MHz channel, known as multicasting. For  example, a Class A station serving San Francisco and San Jose,  California, uses digital multicasting to provide 12 streams of television  programming on digital subchannels, including local broadcasts in  Vietnamese, Tagalog, Mandarin, Hindi, Punjabi, and Spanish.", "Once stations have received a digital construction permit from FCC, the  actions the stations must take to transition their existing facilities to digital  vary, depending on the characteristics of individual stations, their  locations, and the markets they serve. For example, some stations may  need to update transmitter equipment to carry a digital signal in place of  an analog signal. Some stations, particularly those that must broadcast  from a new channel, will need to conduct an engineering analysis to  identify available spectrum and may need to purchase a new transmitter  and antenna equipment. Once stations have completed construction of  their FCC-approved digital facilities, they must apply for a license to  broadcast in digital.

In 2004, FCC announced that the statutorily established  deadline for full-power television stations to transition to digital did not  apply to low-power television stations. In explaining its decision, FCC  noted that it did not have sufficient spectrum to give all full-power and  low-power television stations digital companion channels, and raised  concerns that forcing low-power television stations to transition to digital  via flash cuts would result in a loss of service to viewers. FCC stated that  it would set a low-power digital transition deadline sometime after the full- power transition was complete (which happened in 2009), but did not  preclude existing low-power television stations from transitioning to digital  earlier. In 2005, FCC began accepting applications from existing LPTV  and translator stations that wanted to transition to digital by using a flash  cut. FCC subsequently opened two filing windows in 2006 and 2009  during which existing low-power television stations could apply for digital  companion channels. On October 28, 2010, citing the uncertainty posed  by the potential reallocation of spectrum from broadcasting to broadband  purposes and the potential impact on low-power licensees, FCC  announced a freeze on applications for new digital low-power television  stations. However, FCC is still accepting digital flash cut, digital  displacement, and digital companion channel applications from existing  analog low-power television stations.", "In September 2010, FCC issued a Further Notice of Proposed  Rulemaking that requested public comment on potential deadlines and  proposed rules for the digital transition of low-power television stations.  In the notice, FCC proposed establishing a deadline of sometime in 2012  for low-power television stations to cease analog operations, but also  requested comment on whether a later date would be more feasible. The  majority of the comments from low-power television licensees stated that  a 2012 deadline was not feasible, and some cited the need for additional  time to raise funds, receive FCC approval of their applications, and buy  and install equipment. In July 2011, FCC issued an order establishing a  deadline of September 1, 2015, for low-power television stations to cease  analog operations and convert to digital broadcasting. FCC also stated  that it would allow low-power television stations to file for one 6-month  extension to finish completion of their digital facilities by March 1, 2016,  but that the stations must cease their analog broadcasts by the  September 1, 2015, deadline. FCC\u2019s order also adopted prior proposals  to allow low-power television stations to use full-power emission masks,  which could help some stations more easily secure a channel by filtering  the station\u2019s signal and reducing potential interference, and to increase  the power levels for low-power television stations using VHF channels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Regulatory Uncertainty Caused by FCC\u2019s Proposed Spectrum Reallocation Creates Challenges for Low-Power Television Stations\u2019 Transition to Digital", "paragraphs": ["Our interviews with low-power television stations and other industry  stakeholders indicated that the most significant challenge faced by low- power television stations is a result of regulatory uncertainty surrounding  FCC\u2019s proposed spectrum reallocation. Furthermore, although FCC\u2019s July  15, 2011, Report and Order establishes a process for Class A stations to  transfer their protected status to their digital companion channel, the lack  of such a process had previously posed challenges for some stations in  their transition to digital.", "FCC\u2019s proposed spectrum reallocation: Several licensees reported, both  in speaking with us and in written comments submitted to FCC, that the  regulatory uncertainty created by FCC\u2019s proposed spectrum reallocation  has negatively affected their ability to transition to digital. One of the  recommendations of the National Broadband Plan was for FCC to initiate  a rulemaking proceeding to reallocate 120 MHz of spectrum (equivalent  to 20 television channels) from television broadcasting to wireless  broadband to help meet the nation\u2019s increasing demand for broadband  service.  To begin the process of freeing this spectrum, FCC issued a  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in November 2010 that discussed using a  variety of tools, including incentive auctions where broadcasters could  volunteer to relinquish their spectrum in exchange for a portion of the  incentive auction proceeds\u2014which would require congressional  approval\u2014and channel sharing, meaning two or more previously distinct  stations split the use of one channel and its 6 MHz of bandwidth. FCC  would then \u201crepack\u201d broadcasters into a smaller number of channels and  auction a contiguous band of newly cleared spectrum for wireless  broadband uses. Given that the spectrum reallocation proceeding is in its  preliminary phase, it has not yet been decided how the proposed  reallocation would affect low-power television stations or if those stations  would be able to participate in incentive auctions or channel sharing.", "Low-power licensees and industry representatives told us that FCC\u2019s  proposal for reallocating broadcast spectrum for broadband purposes  created a significant amount of regulatory uncertainty about the fate of  low-power television stations. Some licensees believe that FCC should  not require low-power television stations to complete their transition to  digital until after any spectrum reallocation is completed, when there will  be more clarity regarding what channels are available for low-power  broadcasters. Low-power licensees are particularly concerned that if full- power stations are repacked into new channels, low-power television  stations could (1) be displaced if they cause interference to a relocated  full-power station, and (2) find that there are no available channels where  they could move to avoid interference. This is a concern for stations  located in urban markets where spectrum is already scarce and for  translator stations in rural areas that use several channels. As previously  noted, Utah\u2019s daisy chain system of translators retransmits signals from  several Salt Lake City stations, with each signal requiring its own input  and output channels each time it is retransmitted. Officials from the Utah  system told us that spectrum is so crowded at certain sites that they have  had to make use of alternative technologies to avoid interference. They  believe that FCC\u2019s spectrum reallocation, as proposed, would \u201cdestroy\u201d  the state\u2019s translator network. When FCC decided to adopt a digital  transition deadline of 2015, rather than the originally proposed 2012 date,  it acknowledged such concerns, noting that it would like to avoid requiring  that stations make the significant investment required for conversion to  digital facilities, when such facilities may have to be substantially modified  because of channel displacement or taken off the air altogether in  connection with the implementation of the spectrum reallocation.  However, since there is no hard deadline for the spectrum reallocation, it  could still occur after the digital transition of low-power television stations.", "In its order, FCC states that even if the reallocation is not concluded  before the digital transition deadline, a 2015 deadline will permit low- power television stations to take specific reallocation proposals into  account when finalizing their transition plans.", "Low-power television licensees and their representatives told us that it is  difficult to secure digital transition financing because of the uncertainty  created by the proposed spectrum reallocation. The majority of those with  whom we spoke noted that many low-power licensees struggle financially  and could face difficulties financing their stations\u2019 transition to digital.  Some stations have delayed their transition to digital because of concerns  that their investment will be lost because of a lack of available channels  or the need to spend additional funds to prevent interference with  relocated full-power stations. As previously mentioned, Congress  established NTIA\u2019s Low-Power Television and Translator Upgrade  Program to help fund rural low-power television stations\u2019 transition to  digital. As of June 2011, NTIA had reimbursed approximately $13 million  of the available $44 million to roughly 1,000 low-power television stations  for digital transition equipment costs. Some licensees have stated that  they would not have been able to transition to digital without federal  funds. However, NTIA\u2019s program is a reimbursement program, and some  licensees have noted that it is difficult to obtain financing for the up-front  costs. The last day to apply for funds from NTIA\u2019s program is July 2,  2012. FCC recommended that NTIA explore seeking an extension of the  statutory deadline from Congress given the number of low-power  television stations that will transition after the expiration of the program in  2012.", "FCC\u2019s actions related to Class A stations: In its July 15 Report and Order,  FCC established a process for Class A stations to transfer their protected  status to their digital companion channel, which had previously posed  challenges for some stations in their transition to digital. Prior to the  order, Class A stations that transitioned to digital by flash cutting on their  existing channel retained their Class A status since they were not  changing channels. However, this was not the case for Class A stations  that were using a digital companion channel to transition to digital. To  keep their Class A status, these stations had to continue to broadcast on  their existing analog channel, to which the Class A status was related. If  the Class A station chose to turn off its analog signal without requesting  special temporary authority from FCC to remain silent, then it lost its  Class A protected status, making the station vulnerable to displacement  by full-power stations or other primary users of spectrum. This led some  Class A stations to delay completing their transition to digital, and some  other stations lost their Class A status after transitioning to digital, as  discussed below.", "When FCC established rules in 2004 for the digital transition of low-power  television stations, it made it clear that it was not at that time providing  Class A status to the digital companion channel of an analog Class A  station. FCC stated that providing Class A status to these stations\u2019 digital  companion channels would complicate the digital transition of full-power  stations, since full-power stations must protect Class A stations from  interference. However, FCC stated that its intention was for Class A  stations to retain their status on the channel they ultimately chose for  digital operations, and that FCC would address the issue of how to permit  Class A digital companion channels after the completion of the digital  transition of full-power stations. Prior to establishing a process for Class  A stations to transfer their status to a digital companion channel, FCC  officials told us that Class A stations operating on a digital companion  channel could request special temporary authority to remain silent on  their analog facilities for up to 1 year, after which, by statute, the license  expires. While such procedures are contained in FCC\u2019s rules, FCC did  not make any public statement directing such stations to enlist this  procedure to retain their Class A status. According to FCC staff, a total of  five Class A stations lost their Class A status after transitioning to digital  and shutting off their analog signal. For example, a low-power PBS  station in Pablo, Montana, that provides local programming to the Salish  and Kootenai tribes, told us that it lost its Class A status when it  transitioned to digital in 2009 and shut off its analog signal. FCC officials  told us that these stations could apply to have their Class A status  reinstated for their digital facilities, provided that they continued to comply  with Class A eligibility requirements and that there would be no adverse  effect on other stations.

Providing service to  underserved communities could include providing television service in an  area that had none, or providing specific groups with programming  tailored to their needs (e.g., ethnic or religious programming), which was  otherwise unavailable. In addition, FCC has highlighted how service to  these communities has led to positive impacts on FCC\u2019s goals of localism  and diversity, including ownership by minorities and women. FCC\u2019s 1956  order establishing a licensing process for translators noted that the  translators were primarily intended to provide television to areas without  service, but added that they could bring multiple services to communities  too small to support several stations. FCC subsequently established a  licensing process for LPTV stations in 1982, stating that LPTV stations  could add to programming diversity and would be particularly suited to  providing local programming. In subsequent policy statements, FCC has  repeatedly cited LPTV stations\u2019 positive impact on providing service to  underserved communities and on FCC\u2019s policy goals of localism and  diversity. For example, in 1994, FCC stated that it established the LPTV  service as a means of increasing diversity in television programming and  station ownership, and noted that the hallmarks of LPTV stations are  localism and niche programming.", "In CBPA, Congress also cited localism and diversity as goals.  Specifically, it found that a small number of LPTV license holders had  operated their stations in a manner beneficial to the public good by  providing broadcasting that would not otherwise be available to their  communities. Congress further found that it was in the public interest to  promote diversity in television programming, for example, the  programming provided by LPTV stations to foreign-language  communities, and directed FCC to establish a process to provide certain  LPTV stations with interference protection equivalent to that afforded to  full-power stations (i.e., primary status). This led to FCC\u2019s 2000 order  implementing CBPA and allowing low-power stations to apply for Class A  status, which noted LPTV stations\u2019 contribution of locally originated  programming to underserved communities and niche programming for  specific groups, and also stated that LPTV service significantly increased  the diversity of broadcast station ownership by providing first-time station  ownership opportunities for minorities and women. FCC concluded that  acting to improve the commercial viability of such LPTV stations was  consistent with FCC\u2019s fundamental goals of ensuring localism and  diversity in television broadcasting. More recently, FCC\u2019s 2009 Annual  Performance Report noted that low-power television stations are an  important source of local community information, and FCC\u2019s 2010  notice on the digital transition of low-power television stations  emphasized that FCC seeks to ensure the continued viability of low- power television stations that offer important services to specializ minority audiences, foreign-language communities, and rura l areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FCC Does Not Have Data to Evaluate whether Low- Power Service Is Meeting Goals, and May Not Understand How Its Decisions on Low-Power Television Stations Affect Communities", "paragraphs": ["Although FCC\u2019s low-power television goals\u2014meeting the needs of  underserved communities, and contributing to localism and diversity\u2014are  well documented, FCC has not collected data to evaluate the extent to  which the stations fulfill unmet needs or contribute to meeting FCC\u2019s  policy goals. FCC\u2019s decisions regarding the reallocation of broadcast  spectrum and its implementation of the digital transition of low-power  television stations will affect the continued operation of some low-power  television stations. However, FCC\u2019s ability to weigh the effects of its  decisions on low-power television stations, the communities they serve,  and FCC\u2019s goals of localism and diversity against the increasing need for  wireless broadband spectrum could be limited by a lack of data. In  addition, external data on these issues are limited; the trade association  for Class A and LPTV stations has disbanded, and several consumer  groups we contacted stated that they were not focusing on low-power  television stations. We have noted the importance of collecting and  analyzing data as a means to evaluate progress toward goals and inform  agency decisions. Specifically, our publication Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government states that management should  ensure that there are adequate means of obtaining information from  external stakeholders that may have a significant impact on the agency\u2019s  achieving its goals. In addition, our Internal Control Management and  Evaluation Tool notes the need to obtain and provide to managers any  relevant external information that may affect the achievement of the  agency\u2019s missions, goals, and objectives, particularly information related  to legislative or regulatory developments and political or economic  changes.", "FCC is not able to determine the extent to which low-power television  stations provide local programming and meet the programming needs of  underserved communities. FCC requires all full-power and Class A  stations to file children\u2019s programming reports; beyond this, FCC does not  collect data on the types of programming that full- or low-power television  stations provide. In 2008, FCC issued an order that would have required  full-power and Class A broadcasters to file a standardized form with FCC  describing the broadcaster\u2019s programming, including local programming  and programming for underserved communities. FCC noted that this  would help clarify what broadcasters are doing to serve the public interest  and allow FCC to monitor trends in the broadcasting industry. However,  this requirement was not implemented because of legal challenges, and  FCC officials told us they are working to address industry opposition. As a  result, FCC\u2019s ability to determine the overall community impact of the  stations, including whether the stations are serving underserved  communities by providing local or foreign-language programming, is  limited. Some stakeholders have suggested that FCC use the revised  programming form to collect and analyze data on how broadcasters were  serving the public interest and weigh the loss of broadcast service against  the benefits from reallocating spectrum to wireless broadband.", "FCC\u2019s lack of data may affect its ability to provide Congress with  information regarding whether additional Class A stations would help FCC  meet its broadcast localism goals. LPTV stations have not had an  opportunity to apply for Class A status since the onetime filing opportunity  in 2000. In 2008, FCC noted that it tentatively concluded that it should  allow additional qualified LPTV stations to be granted Class A status. It  stated that increasing the number of Class A stations would ensure the  existence of continued community programming and the availability of  Class A status would provide investment protection for LPTV stations  looking to make investments in the digital transition. FCC sought  comments on its statutory authority to create additional Class A stations  and how to define eligibility, but has not issued an order deciding whether  to create additional Class A stations and may need legislative guidance  from Congress on whether additional stations can apply for Class A  status after the original window of eligibility established by CBPA. It is  possible that some LPTV stations are fulfilling the requirements of Class  A stations by providing local programming without Class A protection, but  the extent to which this is the case cannot be determined without  programming data.", "As part of the 2009 digital television transition of full-power stations, FCC  did use some of the technical data it collects from low-power licensees to  create an internal document for a commissioner that identified areas in  which the only source of over-the-air broadcasting is a low-power  television station. However, FCC does not know the number of stations  that have ceased broadcasting without FCC\u2019s permission, some of whom  may be holding their license for speculative purposes. Low-power  licensees and their representatives told us that some low-power  construction permits and licenses are being obtained by \u201cspectrum  squatters\u201d that hold on to the permit or license in hope of selling it to an  interested party. FCC officials acknowledged that some licensees only  broadcast the minimal amount of time needed to maintain their license  and are simply holding the license in an attempt to sell it. They also noted  that as long as applicants comply with FCC\u2019s rules, FCC cannot act  against a station that may be obtaining a construction permit or license for  speculative reasons. Additionally, FCC\u2019s system for storing construction  permit and license applications does not automatically cancel expired  licenses and construction permits, which has led to expired licenses and  construction permits temporarily remaining in the system. FCC officials  told us that FCC keeps track of stations that report being silent, but it  does not have the resources to do the extensive field testing necessary to  identify which stations have gone silent without notifying FCC. They also  stated that FCC is working on ways to find these stations without  extensive field testing and periodically checks for expired licenses and  construction permits in order to cancel them and update their status in the  system.", "In addition to lacking data about the contributions of low-power television  stations to FCC\u2019s goals of localism and diversity, FCC has never formally  evaluated the extent to which low-power television stations actually affect  these goals. In initiating the 2010 quadrennial review of its broadcast  ownership rules, FCC does not mention low-power television stations  when discussing the policy goals of localism and diversity; however, it  did include low-power licensees as panelists on some of its ownership  workshops. Similarly, in June 2011, an FCC working group released a  white paper on the media and the information needs of communities that  described the various types of low-power television stations, but did not  assess their impact on communities and FCC\u2019s goals of localism and  diversity. FCC officials told us that they have not formally evaluated low- power television stations\u2019 impact on localism and diversity because low  power television stations are not subject to programming requirements  (with the exception of local programming requirements for Class A  stations) and are not considered in FCC\u2019s multiple ownership rules and  policies. However, given FCC\u2019s efforts to reallocate spectrum, FCC\u2019s  ability to determine the public benefit derived from spectrum allocations to  low-power broadcasters would be enhanced by information on the impact  of low-power stations on communities and FCC\u2019s goals. In addition, we  have previously identified weaknesses in FCC\u2019s collection of data on  minority- and women-owned stations, including the lack of an FCC  requirement that low-power television stations file such information.  FCC recently began collecting ownership information from Class A and  LPTV stations, with the first submission due July 8, 2010, but, according  to FCC, the response rate was low. FCC officials told us they were  sending letters to licensees in an attempt to increase the response rate  for the 2011 filing.

Since additional spectrum  capacity will be needed to accommodate future growth, transitioning low- power television stations from analog to digital would aid FCC\u2019s current  efforts to identify spectrum that could be made available for broadband  services. FCC has repeatedly noted the benefits of low-power television  stations in serving communities, such as providing programming that  would not otherwise be available, and expanding ownership opportunities  for minorities and women. However, FCC has not taken steps to collect  information that would inform its understanding of the impact of low-power  television service on communities\u2014whether these stations are reaching  underserved communities; aiding FCC\u2019s policy goals of localism and  diversity; or, as in the case of speculative licenses and those stations that  have gone silent, providing no community benefit. In addition, it is  possible that the three types of low-power television stations are affecting  communities differently\u2014for example, a translator may be the only source  of free over-the-air network television for some communities, while a  Class A station may be the only source of foreign-language  programming\u2014however, FCC does not have the data to determine if this  is the case. Lacking such information, FCC does not know the public  benefit of low-power television stations\u2019 receiving spectrum for television  broadcast. Given that spectrum is a valuable and scarce natural resource  and initiatives are under way in the federal government to identify  spectrum that can be repurposed for broadband services, a thorough  understanding of the community benefits derived from low-power station  licenses could prove very valuable. Especially as FCC makes important  decisions related to spectrum allocations, such information could enable  FCC to weigh the potential loss of low-power television service against  the benefits of reallocating spectrum to broadband services.", "With respect to Class A stations, Congress previously determined that  such stations had operated in a manner beneficial to the public good by  providing broadcasting to their communities that would not otherwise be  available, and instructed FCC to allow low-power television stations in  operation at the time of CBPA to apply for protected status. However, it is  possible that some low-power television stations currently provide  programming commensurate with that of Class A stations, but do not  have protected status because they were not in operation during the  statutorily provided onetime opportunity to apply for such status. FCC  sought comments on its statutory authority to create additional Class A  stations and how to define eligibility, but it may need legislative guidance  from Congress on this issue. Whether FCC concludes that it has statutory  authority, or needs Congress to revise CBPA first, eligibility of additional  stations to seek Class A status needs to be resolved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Communications Commission should take the following two  actions:  \uf0b7  Explore options for assessing how the three types of low-power  television stations have affected the communities they serve and have  contributed to FCC\u2019s policy goals of localism and diversity.

In particular, in response to our recommendation to explore options  for assessing how low-power television stations have affected the  communities they serve and have contributed to FCC\u2019s policy goals of  localism and diversity, FCC stated that it will ask its Federal Advisory  Committee on Diversity in Communications in the Digital Age to address  this issue. Regarding our recommendation that FCC work with Congress,  as necessary, to determine what the long-term role of Class A stations  should be, whether additional low-power television stations should be  permitted to apply for Class A status, and what criteria stations must meet  to qualify for such status, FCC stated that it plans to analyze the data  from Class A stations\u2019 children\u2019s programming reports to determine the  stations\u2019 measures to provide educational and informational children\u2019s  programming. While this is a useful first step, additional work may be  needed to provide Congress with the information it needs to make  decisions regarding whether other stations should be allowed to apply for  Class A status and what criteria such stations must meet. Overall, FCC  stated that its spectrum priorities have changed in response to a growing  demand for wireless broadband services, and it is examining the role of  low-power television stations in providing over-the-air service to rural and  underserved communities as it is considering incentive auction and  channel-sharing initiatives to free up spectrum for wireless broadband.", "FCC also commented that because of broadcasters\u2019 free speech rights,  FCC is limited in its ability to evaluate the programming choices made by  low-power television stations. FCC added that, with the exception of  Class A stations, low-power television stations operate with secondary  interference protection and are not subject to the programming or  operational obligations of full-power television stations. FCC further noted  that since many low-power television stations are translators, FCC has  not found the need to collect extensive programming data from low-power  television stations. While we understand the need to respect  broadcasters\u2019 free speech rights, we believe that FCC should collect data  to better understand the extent to which low-power television stations  address community needs and contribute to FCC\u2019s goals of localism and  diversity.
