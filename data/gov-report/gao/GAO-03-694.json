The process for determining releasability is complex. A foreign government's request is first reviewed by the military department that owns the requested weapon or technology. In cases where the request exceeds NDP's approved classification level, the military department forwards the request to the National Disclosure Policy Committee for its review. For some sensitive technologies, such as stealth, the case is also forwarded to a special committee for review. The process requires coordination among different U.S. government entities--including DOD, the military departments, the State Department, and the intelligence community--which have varying perspectives. Adding to this complexity, determinations of releasability are governed by broad guidance, which allows latitude in interpreting the unique circumstances of each proposed transfer. In determining the releasability of advanced weapons and technologies, a number of factors are considered, including how U.S. technological advantage would be affected. To protect U.S. technological advantage, safeguards--such as lowering the capability of a transferred weapon and withholding sensitive information on how the system operates--are considered for proposed transfers. However, the effectiveness of some individual safeguards may be limited. For example, one safeguard--the ability of the United States to deny spare parts to former allies--may not be effective if these countries are able to obtain spare parts through other means. While certain individual safeguards may not be as effective as desired, DOD officials said they consider various safeguards to ensure technological advantage is maintained. Information needed to assess releasability is not always complete, up-to-date, or available. For example, DOD's centralized National Disclosure Policy System database that was used to make decisions during the last 4 years only contained information for that time period. DOD has recently deployed an upgrade to the system, but has not yet determined its effectiveness. Other information, such as Central Intelligence Agency risk assessments--which provide counterintelligence information and risks involved in releasing advanced weapons to a foreign country--are often outdated or nonexistent. Finally, some intelligence information that could have a direct bearing on whether an advanced weapon or technology should be released is prepared for other purposes and is not provided to decision makers involved in releasability determinations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The heightened visibility of advanced U.S. weapons in military conflicts  over the last decade has prompted foreign countries to increasingly seek  to purchase such weaponry.

According to the Department of Defense (DOD), such  transfers can help strengthen defense coalitions and enhance  interoperability between the United States and its allies, as well as extend  production lines and lower unit costs for key weapon systems.

The act also includes a statement of  conventional arms transfer policy, which provides that sales of defense  items be consistent with U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.  The Conventional Arms Transfer Policy, a Presidential Decision Directive  last updated in 1995, provides policy for weapons transfers. In addition to  stipulating that transfer decisions be made on a case-by-case basis, the  policy has several key goals that must be considered when transferring  weapons:    Ensure U.S. military forces maintain technological advantage over their  adversaries.", "Help allies and friends deter or defend against aggression, while promoting  interoperability with U.S. forces when combined operations are required.

NDP  establishes a framework for policy decisions on proposed transfers to  foreign recipients and is key in governing the release of an advanced  weapon or technology. These decisions are made before weapons or  technologies are approved for transfer. As implemented by DOD Directive,  this policy specifies that releasability decisions must satisfy five criteria.  For example, the proposed transfer must be consistent with U.S. military  and security objectives and be protected by the foreign recipient in  substantially the same manner as the United States. The DOD Directive  also requires department officials to enter NDP case data, including  releasability decisions, into a centralized database to facilitate the  coordination and review of potential transfers of weapons.", "In November 2002, the White House announced that it had begun a  comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of U.S. defense trade  policies to identify changes needed to ensure that these policies continue  to support U.S. national security and foreign policy goals. It also aims to  assess how U.S. technological advantage can be maintained. The  assessment is expected to cover such topics as the Arms Export Control  Act and the military departments\u2019 technology release policy, as well as a  determination of the effectiveness of the Defense Trade Security  Initiatives.

Depending on the  circumstances of the request and the outcome of this initial review, the  request may be submitted to an interagency committee and other special  committees for additional review. Further, because the reviewers  represent different agencies, they bring varying perspectives to the  process and must reconcile differences to reach a unanimous decision on  each request.

Each military department has its  own review process for determining whether the weapon or technology  should be released (see fig. 1). To develop a position, the military  department receiving the request coordinates with and obtains input from  military experts in various offices and divisions within those offices. For  example, we were told that the Air Force coordinates a proposed transfer  of an Air Force fighter aircraft to a foreign government with subject matter  experts in functional offices, such as acquisition, plans, operations, and  weapons systems division. These experts, in turn, may consult with other  experts within their divisions. For instance, the weapons systems division  may coordinate with its electronic warfare staff, its radar staff, or both to  obtain input.", "Military department reviews can result in one of three outcomes:  concurrence, concurrence with limitations and conditions, or  nonconcurrence. If a consensus to approve a request cannot be reached,  the request is elevated within the military department for a final decision.  If the requested item (1) is not covered in NDP, (2) exceeds the NDP  classification level specified for a particular foreign country, or (3) does  not comply with NDP criteria, the military department may seek an  exception to NDP from the National Disclosure Policy Committee, an  interagency review forum. Timelines for military departments\u2019 reviews of  requests can vary. For example, Army officials stated that some cases can  be handled quickly while others may require a major investment of time  and resources.", "When NDPC receives a request for an exception, the Executive Secretariat  distributes the request to committee members and seeks a unanimous vote  within 10 days (see fig. 2). Each committee member coordinates a position  with various experts. For example, the Joint Staff sends the request to the  Combatant Command that has responsibility for the country requesting  the advanced weapon or technology. The Combatant Command, in turn,  coordinates the request with various units within the Command, which  may include the Scientific Advisor, plans and operations division, weapons  systems division, and intelligence division to provide input on such issues  as the impact of the transfer on the region. These units may further  coordinate with other offices within their units. A final coordinated  Command position is then provided to the Joint Staff NDPC member.", "If any NDPC member votes not to approve a request for an exception,  there is a negotiation period for no more than 20 days. During this time,  the member that has requested the exception may propose or accept  placing different or additional conditions on the request to gain unanimity.  If agreement cannot be reached, the request is elevated to the Chairman  for a decision. Members have 10 days to appeal the Chairman\u2019s decision or  it is accepted. If a committee member appeals the decision, the request is  elevated to the Deputy Secretary or Secretary of Defense. However, of the  330 exceptions reviewed over the last 4 years, only 1 had been appealed  and 2 denied. The appeal and denials covered requests for weapons and  technologies and intelligence information. In addition, 5 requests for  exceptions related to weapons and technologies were withdrawn before a  decision was reached. According to DOD officials, most exceptions are  approved with limitations and conditions.", "In addition to the military departments\u2019 reviews and the NDPC exception  process, special committee processes are set up to review requests for  sensitive technologies that may be included in a proposed transfer. For  example, if a proposed transfer includes a stealth component, the military  department submits the case to the Director of Special Programs within  the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology,  and Logistics who manages low observable/counter low observable  (LO/CLO) issues (see fig. 3). Precedent decisions, which are contained in a  database, are used to determine the releasability of the technology. Based  on the level of sensitivity of the technology involved, the case may be  elevated to the Tri-Service Committee for further review. Some  controversial or extraordinarily complex cases may require exceptions to  precedent LO/CLO policy and further elevation to the LO/CLO Executive  Committee for final decision. If needed, the Tri-Service Committee can  charter a \u201cRed Team,\u201d which, according to DOD officials, is composed of  subject matter experts, including those from industry, academia, and the  military department laboratories. The Red Team is convened to assess the  risks associated with the proposed transfer.

The State Department, concerned with U.S. foreign policy  goals, tends to focus on issues such as the proposed transfer\u2019s potential  effect on the stability of the region of the requesting country.

Specifically, decisions on the  release of advanced weapons or technologies must satisfy five broad NDP  criteria that are subject to interpretation. (See app. II for a discussion of all  five criteria and examples of information to be considered for each.) For  example, one criterion decision makers must consider is whether the  proposed transfer is consistent with U.S. military and security objectives.  In examining this criterion, decision makers must address multiple factors,  including how technological advantage would be protected if the weapon  or technology were sold or transferred. According to NDPC members, the  broad criteria allow for a certain level of flexibility that is needed in  determining whether an advanced weapon should be released to a foreign  country. Some NDPC members further pointed out that this flexibility is  especially critical in the current foreign policy environment in which many  different countries are working with the United States in the war on  terrorism."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Technological Advantage and Various Safeguards Are Considered When Determining Releasability", "paragraphs": ["One criterion NDPC must consider when determining the releasability of  advanced weapons and technologies is that the transfer must be consistent  with U.S. military and security objectives.

The effectiveness of individual  safeguards may be limited; however, a variety of safeguards may be  considered.", "In considering technological advantage, military experts said that they first  review relevant military department documents and policies to determine  if the requested weapon or technology exceeds the technology thresholds  specified for the country making the request. If the requested weapon or  technology exceeds this threshold, the experts may consult and  coordinate with military engineers, the contractor that manufactures the  weapon or technology, the system program office, and other operational  experts to incorporate appropriate safeguards\u2014typically in the form of  case-specific limitations and conditions\u2014to protect U.S. technological  advantage. These include (1) sanitized or export variants, where the  released weapon or technology has a lower operational capability or less  advanced technology than what the United States has in its inventory;       (2) anti-tamper measures, where features are built into the weapon to  prevent reverse engineering such as code encryption, and protective  coatings on internal weapon components; (3) time-phased release, where  the advanced weapon or technology is not released until the United States  has fielded a better capability; and (4) withheld information and data,  where the transfer does not include information such as software source  codes. Military experts said that program offices, in some cases, conduct  verification tests and the Defense Contract Management Agency works  with contractors to ensure that limitations and conditions are  implemented before the weapon is transferred.", "Military department officials told us that in addition to case-specific  limitations and conditions, they also consider other general safeguards to  preserve U.S. military superiority. These include (1) superior U.S. tactics  and training, where military tactics for maneuvers and operations may not  be shared with other nations; (2) control of system spare parts, where the  United States can stop providing spare parts to former allies; and   (3) countermeasure awareness, where the United States has the ability to  develop measures to defeat the released system because of its knowledge  of how the system functions.", "However, the effectiveness of certain individual safeguards used to protect  technological advantage may be limited for various reasons. For example,  a time-phased release may not be effective if the fielding of a more capable  weapon or technology is delayed and does not coincide with the  contractual delivery date of the weapon to be released to the foreign  government. As we reported in January 2003, schedule delays have been  pervasive in certain major acquisition programs. The Air Force\u2019s F/A-22,  the next generation fighter aircraft, for example, was initially expected to  be fielded in September 1995. As development proceeded, the estimated  fielding date was pushed out 8 years to September 2003. According to a  current estimate, the F/A-22 projected fielding date has slipped another      2 years to December 2005. In addition, factors outside of U.S. control can  diminish the effectiveness of certain individual safeguards. For example,  the United States may stop providing spare parts to former allies, but these  countries may obtain needed parts through other means, such as  \u201ccannibalizing\u201d parts from other weapons or obtaining parts from other  countries at a higher cost through the \u201cgrey market.\u201d Some DOD officials  told us that while certain individual safeguards may not be as effective as  desired, they consider various safeguards for each proposed transfer to  ensure technological advantage is maintained."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "More Complete, Current, or Available Information Would Better Support Determinations of Releasability", "paragraphs": ["In addition to considering technological advantage when making  releasability decisions, NDPC considers other criteria such as a foreign  government\u2019s capability to protect U.S. classified military information,  including weapons or technologies.

To obtain historical data and other information,  the military departments have relied on their own separate databases  containing information on their departments\u2019 prior requests for transfers.  Unlike the military departments, other NDPC members do not have their  own databases. For example, the State Department has relied on manual  reviews of paper files and discussions with country experts or other  officials with knowledge of prior cases\u2014assuming the files still exist and  the experts and officials still work at the State Department.

The National Disclosure  Policy System includes information such as security surveys, but it does  not include CIA risk assessments. CIA risk assessments provide  counterintelligence risk information, including the assessment of risks  involved in releasing classified material to a foreign government.

CIA risk assessments are  particularly important for exception cases because they provide an  evaluation of a country\u2019s security forces and the risk environment of a  country that will potentially receive U.S. advanced weapon systems.

Additionally, DOD stated that NDPC personnel will  identify problems with the system and bring them to the attention of the  software developers. We believe all users of the system, including  committee members and not just NDPC personnel, should participate in  the identification of technical problems to ensure that the system is  meeting user needs. Further, DOD said that developers have quickly fixed  minor software problems. We, therefore, are no longer recommending that  a firm schedule be established but rather that technical problems be  addressed as they arise.", "With regard to our recommendation on a plan for NDPC security surveys,  DOD stated that it already develops a schedule for completion of such  surveys.  Implementation of the schedule is largely dependent on  committee members volunteering to conduct the surveys. However, the  plan we envisioned in our recommendation would include not only a  schedule but also information such as the reason each security survey is  needed and the level of resources necessary to schedule and conduct the  survey. We believe the plan would provide an opportunity to develop a  business case to determine if dedicated resources are needed to complete  security surveys on a prioritized basis, instead of largely relying on  committee volunteers. We have modified our recommendation to clarify  its intent.", "We disagree that our report misleads the reader about the sufficiency of  the information available to make decisions. Committee members we  spoke with stated that information, such as more timely CIA risk  assessments and security surveys, would allow them to make more  informed decisions.

We interviewed officials in the Departments of  Defense and State, the military departments, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, three  Combatant Commands, and the intelligence community to understand  how the interagency committee process works for reviewing exceptions to  the National Disclosure Policy (NDP). We also obtained briefings on  special committee processes such as the Low Observable/Counter Low  Observable Executive Committee process. We analyzed military  department policies and procedures for reviewing requests for the transfer  of weapons and technologies and discussed the review and coordination  processes with pertinent military officials.", "To determine if U.S. technological advantage is considered and protected  in the review process, we reviewed selected weapons transfers records,  including pertinent initial country requests; military department, Joint  Staff, and other National Disclosure Policy Committee (NDPC) members\u2019  input and positions on the requests; and limitations and conditions  included in the final committee positions. We analyzed the types of  limitations and conditions used to protect technological advantage and  discussed these and their effectiveness with military department experts,  as well as Joint Staff officials. Through discussions with these officials, we  also identified other safeguards that committee members consider to  preserve U.S. military advantage. We reviewed GAO and Department of  Defense (DOD) reports related to these various safeguards and specific  limitations and conditions.", "To identify and assess the types of information used in the process, we  reviewed the NDP and DOD\u2019s and the military departments\u2019 releasability  regulations. We interviewed officials in the Executive Secretariat for the  NDPC, the military departments, Joint Staff, and State Department to  obtain their perspectives on information required for NDP exception  decisions. We also obtained a briefing and demonstration on DOD\u2019s  centralized National Disclosure Policy System database and its upgrade  and discussed the capability of this system with various users. We  analyzed data on Central Intelligence Agency risk assessments and NDPC  security surveys performed over the last 25 years. We determined the  number of assessments and surveys that were performed more than   5 years ago or were not completed for countries that had received  exceptions to NDP for potential weapons transfers during 1997 through  2002. We identified additional information that may be useful to the  National Disclosure Policy Committee and discussed this with committee  members.", "We performed our review from June 2002 through May 2003 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: National Disclosure Policy Criteria", "paragraphs": ["The National Disclosure Policy Committee (NDPC) considers five criteria  when determining the releasability of classified military information,  including weapons and technologies.

We disagree with DOD\u2019s statement that our depiction of the National  Disclosure Policy (NDP) process appears to mislead the reader about  the sufficiency of the information available to make decisions. We  accurately describe the process, but found that the information  supporting the decisions was not always complete, up-to-date, or easy  to access. We further acknowledge in the report that each request is  reviewed on a case-by-case basis. While DOD states that supporting  information must be furnished to each member of the Committee for  review, committee members we spoke with stated that information  such as more timely National Disclosure Policy Committee (NDPC)  security surveys and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) risk  assessments would facilitate the process, thus allowing members to  make more informed decisions.  2.  The National Disclosure Policy System that was used to make  decisions during the last 4 years contained data only for decisions  made during that time period. DOD indicated that this system was a  follow-on to another database containing historical data. However,  some committee members and officials told us that this older database  is not easy to use and contains only summary information. In addition,  one committee member does not have access to this database. The  report clearly states that an upgraded system has been developed.  DOD asserted that glitches and technical problems are to be expected  for a system in development. We understand that such technical  problems can occur with an upgrade. However, at the time of our  review, the system had taken over 3 years to develop, and deployment  was delayed a number of times because of technical problems and  limited input requested from users. As DOD has acknowledged, the  effectiveness of the upgrade is yet to be determined.  3.  We believe that it is too early for DOD to assert that the upgraded  system has proven to be reliable and efficient, given that it will not  formally assess the effectiveness of the system until September 2003.  DOD\u2019s response acknowledges that improvements are expected but  cannot be identified at this time. However, NDPC members told us  about capabilities they wanted included in the upgrade, such as  inclusion of CIA risk assessments. We believe that DOD should be  proactive in seeking input from users about such additional  capabilities needed for the upgraded system. We have clarified our  recommendation to indicate that this information should be obtained  from members after they have had an opportunity to use the system  and can assess the need for improvements.  4.  DOD acknowledged that as NDPC personnel identify problems with  the upgraded system, they will bring these problems to the attention of  the software developers.  However, our recommendation was directed  toward obtaining input from all NDPC members who are users of the  system, not just NDPC personnel, to ensure that user needs are met. In  addition, DOD said that developers have quickly fixed minor software  problems. We, therefore, are no longer recommending that a firm  schedule be established but rather that technical problems be  addressed as they arise.    5.  While DOD indicates that it already develops a schedule for  completion of NDPC security surveys, our recommendation is  intended to include not only a schedule but also additional  information. Specifically, we believe that a plan should also identify  surveys to be conducted and the reasons each survey is needed;  establish time frames for completing these surveys; and estimate the  resources needed to schedule and conduct these surveys. Based on  this information, DOD can develop a business case to determine if  dedicated resources, instead of committee volunteers, are needed to  ensure that surveys are completed on a prioritized basis. We have  modified our recommendation to clarify this point.", "Finally, DOD states that no known alternative analysis currently exists  that would provide information comparable to that provided through  the security surveys. However, the department has acknowledged that  the CIA risk assessments may be used as the basis for decisions when  a security survey cannot be conducted. This is the type of alternative  analysis that we are referring to in our recommendation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Anne-Marie Lasowski, Marion Gatling, John Ting, Ella Mann, Shelby S.
