During  1999, Treasury issued a report indicating that abusive shelters were a large  and growing problem, involving billions of dollars of tax reductions.Treasury was concerned that abusive shelters could ultimately undermine  voluntary compliance by eroding the integrity of the tax system.  In  response to information pointing to the rapid growth of abusive shelters,  IRS formalized a strategic initiative in fiscal year 2000 to strengthen its  capacity to deal with abusive corporate shelters.  One element of IRS\u2019s  initiative involved creating a central office within the Large and Mid-Size  Business (LMSB) Division to coordinate and guide efforts to curb the  growth of abusive shelters.", "My statement today is based on work we have done at the request of the  Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member.  In examining abusive  shelters, we focused on (1) their nature and scope, (2) IRS\u2019s strategy and  enforcement mechanisms to combat them and the performance goals and  measures IRS uses to track its major effort in that area, and (3) the  decision-making process IRS used to allocate resources to abusive shelters  and the plans it has to devote more resources to addressing abusive  shelters.

As agreed, we are  also discussing the related problem of abusive tax schemes in a report to be  released in the near future.  Abusive tax schemes are used more by  individuals than by large businesses and encompass such distortions of the  tax system as falsely describing the law (saying, for example, that the  income tax is unconstitutional), misrepresenting facts (for instance,  promoting the deduction of personal expenses as business expenses), and  using trusts or offshore bank accounts to hide income.  The boundary  between what we are calling an abusive tax shelter and an abusive scheme  is not always clear.  Organizationally, although IRS\u2019s LMSB Division has  lead responsibility for combating abusive shelters, abusive shelters are  pursued by IRS\u2019s Small Business/Self-Employed Division when they are  used by businesses with assets of less than $10 million or by high-wealth  individuals with complicated tax returns.", "My statement today will make the following points:", "By their nature, abusive shelters are varied, complex, and difficult to  detect and measure.  Abusive shelters manipulate many parts of the tax  code or regulations and may involve steps to hide the transaction within  a tax return.  In recent years, IRS has been accumulating information  about abusive shelters and the extent that they were promoted, and it  has come to believe that abusive shelters deserve substantially  increased attention.  Suffice it to say, although they do not have a  reliable measure of the size of the abusive shelter problem, Treasury and  IRS believe that tens of billions of dollars of taxes are being improperly  avoided and the potential for the proliferation of abusive shelters is  strong.  IRS continues to gather more information to better define the  scope of the problem and has several data sources, each with certain  limitations, that point to billions in tax losses.  As of September 30, 2003,  a database on shelter transactions that IRS has publicly declared to be  tax avoidance transactions suggested the potential tax loss to be about  $33 billion, the majority of which was concentrated from tax year 1993  through the present.  This database included only transactions disclosed  to or discovered by IRS.  In addition, an IRS contractor estimating  annual tax gaps resulting from abusive shelters estimated that the  annual average of foregone taxes between 1993 and 1999 could have  been as small as about $11.6 billion or as large as about $15.1 billion.  However, Treasury, IRS, the contractor, and we all have concerns about  the reliability of the contractor\u2019s estimates because of methodological  and data constraints that the contractor faced.", "The broad-based strategy reflected in IRS planning documents included  various features as well as elements of strategic planning: targeting promoters to head off the proliferation of shelters; making efforts to deter, detect, and resolve abuse; coordinating efforts throughout IRS; offering inducements to individuals and businesses to disclose their  use of questionable tax practices; and using performance indicators to measure outputs and some  outcomes and intending to continue down the path it has started and  develop long-term performance goals and measures linked to those  goals.

Investors in these abusive shelters range from large  and small corporations to wealthy individuals.  IRS approaches the tax  shelter enforcement problem from both the promoter and investor  perspectives.  IRS promoter investigations are designed to learn (1) what  abusive shelters have been promoted, if the shelters are registered, and  possibly how much they cost investors, (2) who purchased the shelters and  what tax savings the investors expect, and (3) whether promoters should  pay penalties for their activities.  IRS examines investor and other tax  returns to see if income, expenses, taxes, and credits are accurately  reported.", "In a June 2002 letter, Treasury responded to congressional questions about  whether Treasury had a comprehensive strategy for combating tax  avoidance.  In his letter to the then Ranking Member of the Committee on  Finance, then Secretary of the Treasury O\u2019Neill addressed the actions being  taken to combat abusive shelters, referring to Treasury\u2019s March 20, 2002,  enforcement proposals on the topic.  The proposals said that IRS had made  significant organizational improvements to coordinate its response to  ongoing abusive tax shelters.  Treasury, all of IRS\u2019s operating divisions, and  IRS\u2019s Office of Chief Counsel are involved in combating abusive shelter  activity.", "Within IRS, LMSB has primary responsibility for combating abusive tax  shelter activity.  LMSB\u2019s OTSA was created in February 2000 to centralize  and coordinate the IRS response nationwide.  As shown in figure 1, OTSA is  the focal point for IRS shelter activities, overseeing promoter tax shelter  registrations; taxpayer disclosures of tax shelters; hotline tip analysis and  referral; and issue coordination and interface between the Office of Chief  Counsel, Treasury, the Tax Shelter Committee, the 6700 Committee  (referring to section 6700 of the Internal Revenue Code), and external  stakeholders. The Tax Shelter Committee oversees LMSB\u2019s tax shelter  program.  The committee is composed of the Commissioner and Deputy  Commissioner of LMSB, the Director of Pre-Filing and Technical Guidance,  LMSB Division Counsel, five Industry Directors, the Director of  International, and the Directors of Field Specialists and Research and  Program Planning.  The 6700 Committee serves under the Tax Shelter  Committee and approves all LMSB tax shelter promoter activities.  The  financial services\u2019 industry director chairs this committee.  IRS\u2019s appeals  function receives and evaluates taxpayer objections to IRS examination  determinations and may agree with those determinations or reduce or  eliminate changes to tax returns resulting from them.  The Office of Chief  Counsel plays an integral role in combating shelters through summons  enforcement and targeted litigation.

Because these transactions are often  composed of many pieces located in several parts of a complex tax return,  they are essentially hidden from plain sight, which contributes to the  difficulty of determining the scope of the abusive shelter problem.  Often  lacking economic substance or a business purpose other than generating  tax benefits, abusive shelters are promoted by some tax professionals,  often in confidence, for significant fees, sometimes with the participation  of tax-indifferent parties, such as foreign or tax-exempt entities.  They may  involve unnecessary steps and flow-through entities, such as partnerships,  which make detection of these transactions more difficult.", "When a transaction has certain abusive characteristics defined by section  6111 of the Internal Revenue Code, the promoter or other tax shelter  organizer is required to register it, describing the transaction and its tax  benefits to the Secretary of the Treasury.  This registration requirement  enables Treasury and IRS to identify and evaluate questionable  transactions.  Under recently issued Treasury regulations, effective  February 28, 2003, there are six categories of transactions for which  promoters must maintain lists of investors who have entered into the  transactions, and investors must disclose the transactions into which they  have entered.  The rules are designed to allow IRS to use information from  investors to identify promoters who do not register transactions and to use  promoter registrations and investor lists to identify investors who fail to  disclose transactions.  The six categories are transactions offered under conditions of confidentiality, transactions including contractual protections to the investor, transactions resulting in specific amounts of tax losses, transactions generating a tax benefit when the underlying asset is held transactions generating differences between financial accounts and tax  accounts greater than $10 million, and \u201clisted transactions.\u201d", "A \u201clisted transaction\u201d is a transaction that is the same as or similar to one of  the types of transactions IRS has determined to be a tax avoidance  transaction.  For a transaction to be a listed transaction, IRS must issue a  notice, regulation, or other form of published guidance informing taxpayers  of the details of the transaction.  As of mid-August 2003, IRS had listed 27  kinds of abusive tax shelter transactions, a number that, as figure 2 shows,  has grown more quickly in recent years than it had grown earlier.", "Disputes between IRS and taxpayers about the abusive nature of a  transaction may be litigated.  In some, but not all, cases, the courts have  upheld the government position.  The following cases illustrate features of  abusive shelters:", "In 1993, a corporation began a company-owned life insurance (COLI)  program in which the company purchased whole-life insurance on  36,000 employees for which the company was the sole beneficiary.  The  company then borrowed money against the policies at interest rates that  averaged 11 percent and deducted the interest expense and  administrative fees from income on its tax returns.  Over 60 years, the  interest costs and administrative fees would have exceeded the cash  surrender value of the policies and benefits paid by several billion  dollars.  IRS disallowed the deductions and the case was litigated.  Despite the fact that the money the company made on this arrangement  may have been used to fund the company\u2019s benefits program, or for  other business purposes, the court found that the function of the  program itself was only to generate tax deductions.  As a result, the Tax  Court sustained the IRS disallowance of deductions and concluded that  the COLI program was a sham.The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals  affirmed the Tax Court\u2019s decision.", "A company had a sizable gain from the sale of a subsidiary and wanted  to avoid or minimize paying tax on the gain.  An investment bank  proposed forming an offshore partnership with a foreign corporation (a  tax-indifferent party) for the express purpose of sheltering the capital  gains of its corporate client.  The partnership purchased and quickly  resold notes in a contingent installment sale transaction.  The  partnership earned a large capital gain, most of which it allocated to the  foreign corporate partner.  Later, related losses were allocated to the  U.S. corporation, generating an approximate $100 million capital loss for  the investment bank\u2019s client.  The corporation used this capital loss to  shelter its U.S.-based capital gains.  Both the Tax Court and the Third  Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the transaction lacked economic  substance. The Third Circuit, in addition to requiring economic  substance, held that a transaction must have a subjective nontax  business motive to be respected for tax purposes. For this transaction,  the investment bank was to earn a fee of $2 million.  This was one of 11  such partnerships formed over a 1-year period from 1989 to 1990 by the  investment bank."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Sources Indicate That the Scope of Abusive Shelters Is in the Tens of Billions of Dollars, Though All Are Based on Limited Data", "paragraphs": ["IRS has information that suggests the scope of abusive shelters totaled tens  of billions of dollars over about a decade, but those estimates are based  on limited data.

However, the reliability of the contractor\u2019s estimates is questionable  because of methodological and data constraints the contractor faced when  developing them.", "The estimates followed a September 2001 recommendation by the Treasury  Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) that LMSB obtain a  more precise estimate of the shelter problem to lay a better foundation for  its strategy for addressing abusive shelters. In response, IRS contracted  for models to predict the likelihood of finding abusive shelters within  certain tax returns and to estimate the annual \u201ctax gap\u201d due to abusive  shelters.  Both IRS and contractor officials believe the contract results are  more useful to predict returns with abusive shelters than they are to value  the size of the abusive shelter problem.", "Nevertheless, as table 2 shows, the contractor produced estimates of the  size of the problem for each year from 1993 through 1999.  Yearly low-end  estimates ranged from $9.0 billion of foregone tax in 1993 to $14.5 billion in  1999.

IRS  conducted surveys from 1999 through 2001 that asked field managers to  identify abusive tax shelters in their open inventory of examinations-- relying on each manager\u2019s understanding of what an abusive tax shelter is.  Since survey data are included in the OTSA database, some of the same  information used by the contractor appears in the OTSA information cited  earlier.", "Treasury, IRS, the contractor, and we have concerns about the contractor  estimates.  First, it is difficult to determine whether these estimates might  be overstating or understating the true extent of the tax gap because of the  uncertainties in the underlying data and the elusive nature of the problem.  In identifying abusive shelters in the IRS surveys, field managers might  have anticipated that some abusive shelters existed where there were none  or where the assertion of abuse might not be sustained.  On the other hand,  they might not have identified all the abusive shelters in their open  inventory of examinations because their definitions of abusive shelters  might have differed from each other.  Finally, the data might not be  representative of all transactions, especially those that closed, because  survey responses were only to include open cases.", "Second, the Statistics of Income data only included U.S. corporations with  assets of over $250 million falling within the CIC program.  Many shelters  may be reflected in tax returns of smaller corporations, partnerships,  Subchapter S corporations, and wealthy individuals and were not included  in this study.  Since these transactions were not included in the contractor\u2019s  estimate, the resulting tax gap estimate is incomplete.", "Third, the estimates are based on known shelters.  They were developed  using 1990s\u2019 ideas of what constituted abusive shelters.  Since then, more  shelters have been disclosed or identified by IRS and still others are under  consideration for listing.  Since the definition of an abusive shelter can  change over time, and the data cannot reflect unknown or unidentified  shelters, the operational definition of abusive shelters was a conservative  one.", "While the last two concerns argue that the contractor\u2019s estimates  understate the true level of abusive shelters for recent years, the  contractor\u2019s estimates and other indicators of the problem\u2019s size based on  past data may also be of limited use as guides to current and future activity  for other reasons.  According to Treasury and IRS officials, the legal and  economic environment has changed since the data for this study were  developed.  First, they said, IRS has taken many administrative actions to  address abusive shelters.  For instance, it is their belief that nothing puts  more of a damper on taxpayer participation in a particular type of  transaction than IRS listing it.  Similarly, although corporate-owned life  insurance transactions may heavily influence the contractor\u2019s estimates,  legislation addressed the problem in 1996 and 1997, and therefore current  and future estimates would not reflect that problem\u2014although they could  reflect problems not identified in the period covered by the contractor\u2019s  study.  Second, court cases have largely supported IRS\u2019s assertions about  the need for business purpose requirements and about requirements for  economic substance in transactions.  Third, today\u2019s economy is not as  robust as the economy in the late 1990s, generating less profit to protect.  Finally, the publicity surrounding numerous corporate scandals may create  a chilling effect in the market for aggressive transactions. Countering these  points, however, are other opinions appearing in the press that (1) the  courts could uphold some tax shelters and (2) IRS\u2019s capacity to stem  abusive shelters is limited."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "IRS Strategy to Combat Abusive Shelters Is Broad-Based but Generally Has No Long-Term Performance Goals or Measures Linked to Goals", "paragraphs": ["IRS developed a broad-based strategy for combating abusive shelters that  included various features as well as elements of strategic planning.

(See fig. 2.)  Also designed to  deter abusive tax shelters, accuracy-related penalties aim at investors who  use abusive shelters to substantially undervalue true tax liability.  Other  penalties are for promoters who market shelters that aid and abet the  understatement of tax liability or who fail to register shelters.  IRS\u2019s  Examination Returns Control System showed IRS assessing 21 investor  penalties totaling about $73 million between July 1, 2002, and May 1, 2003,  which taxpayers had not necessarily agreed to pay.

For instance,  between May 31, 2000, and July 30, 2003, the hotline received 729 shelter- related telephone calls and e-mails, some of them leading IRS to new listed  transactions, promoters, and investors.  As another example, IRS expanded  its disclosure requirements in June 2002 to include noncorporate  taxpayers.  Finally, as evidence of increased management attention, IRS  established a new senior position reporting to the IRS Chief Counsel to  supervise staff and lead task force initiatives to more quickly identify and  deal with abusive shelters.", "Cases may be resolved at the examination level if taxpayers agree with IRS  findings.  If taxpayers do not agree, cases are resolved at the appeals level,  through litigation, or by alternative dispute resolution.", "In addition to these detection and case resolution efforts, IRS is using  Schedule K-1 data to research better methods of detecting abusive shelters  that involve multiple levels of flow-through entities. These complex  structures of related entities pose challenges in analyzing tax compliance  by creating opportunities for taxpayers to disguise noncompliance.  In the  future, IRS hopes to use advanced data analysis tools such as link analysis  and graph-based data mining to identify potential abusive shelters.  Link  analysis is the process of building networks of related entities, such as  flow-through entities and Schedule K-1 recipients, in order to expose  patterns and trends.  Graph-based data mining, a form of link analysis, is  intended to enable IRS to identify structures of known abusive shelters and  find similar patterns in the population of flow-through networks to  discover previously undisclosed potential abusive shelter transactions.

For  example, under a disclosure initiative that expired on April 23, 2002,  taxpayers who revealed shelters and their respective promoters avoided  accuracy-related penalties.  IRS\u2019s aim was to more readily identify  promoters who had not registered shelters and, through the promoters,  find taxpayers who had not disclosed their shelter participation.

For example, from October 2001 through  April 7, 2003, 17 taxpayers agreed with IRS on their respective shelter  issues in the Fast Track Issue Resolution program, resolving about  $1.6 billion in proposed adjustments to income (potentially about  $540 million in tax).  In another example, IRS announced initiatives in  October 2002 to resolve disputes related to three shelters:  COLI, basis- shifting shelters, and contingent liability shelters. In these initiatives, if  taxpayers agreed to settle their cases with IRS by a certain date, with the  last initiative closing March 5, 2003, they would pay a large percentage of  the full amount IRS disallowed.

It devised these  measures for fiscal year 2003 responding to a September 2001 TIGTA  recommendation to develop performance measures so managers could  better target problem areas, highlight successes, evaluate alternatives, and  track whether OTSA is achieving desired outcomes.  IRS is mostly tracking  outputs related to case management, such as the number of tax shelter  examinations closed and tax shelter return cycle time, and is using output  measures of IRS program activities, such as published guidance issued and  hotline contacts.  IRS is also using some measures that track tax  enforcement outcomes, namely adjustments proposed to tax returns from  disallowing abusive shelters and tax shelter penalties proposed.

For instance, the number of potential  examinations of listed transactions disclosed has grown since the inception  of OTSA, adding significantly to IRS resources required to address the  problem. Table 5 shows the number of listed transactions disclosed by  taxpayers grew from 51 to 2,182 between December 31, 2000, and  September 30, 2003, and other transactions disclosed to IRS grew from  none to 663.

At that time, IRS planned that 7 promoter investigations would be ongoing  in fiscal year 2003.  As of June 30, 2003, IRS had 98 promoter investigations  approved.  Based on early promoter investigations, an IRS official stated  that promoter investigations can take thousands of hours to develop, and  several have been litigated, each requiring a large expenditure of resources.", "LMSB has limited information on the amount of time required to examine  abusive shelter cases.  LMSB developed estimates of the amount of  examination time required for such cases based on its experience  examining various types of shelters but acknowledged that examiners can  spend hundreds or thousands of hours depending on the type of shelter  examined and the facts and circumstances of the case.  For example,  according to an LMSB official, based on personal experience, OTSA  estimated that it would take about 800 hours to examine a potentially  abusive transaction reflected in the return of a CIC corporation although  LMSB had little data to support the estimate.  During fiscal year 2003, IRS  began collecting data on examination time that it plans to use for  estimating the resources needed to address its abusive shelter workload.", "The future abusive shelter workload also could increase, at least in the  short term.  For example, as IRS learns more about the use of shelters, it  may identify and list new kinds of transactions as being abusive.  As IRS  conducts the 98 promoter investigations approved as of June 2003, more  investors are likely to be identified, and investor cases could lead to  identifying more promoters.  In addition, IRS expanded the types of  taxpayers subject to disclosure requirements to include taxpayers like  individuals, partnerships, and S corporations.  According to IRS officials,  disclosures from these types of taxpayers are first due to IRS for filing year  2003 and generally do not yet appear in the OTSA database.", "In the longer term, what happens to the abusive shelter workload is less  certain.

How  much and how soon such a drop may occur in abusive shelter cases is  uncertain.", "We have previously raised questions about IRS\u2019s ability to shift compliance  resources as planned.  We recently testified that many parties have  expressed concern about declining IRS compliance\u2014especially audit\u2014and  collection trends for their potential to undermine taxpayers\u2019 motivation to  fulfill their tax obligations.Concerned about these trends, IRS has sought  more resources, including increased staffing for compliance and  collections since fiscal year 2001.  Despite receiving requested budget  increases, staffing levels in key occupations were lower in 2002 than in  2000.  These declines occurred for reasons such as unbudgeted expenses  consuming budget increases and other operational workload increases.  Based on past experience and uncertainty regarding some expected  internal savings, fiscal year 2004 anticipated staff increases might not fully  materialize.

Although establishing performance goals and measures is inherently  difficult since the scope and nature of abusive shelters is elusive, the need  for such goals and measures is heightened because IRS is shifting large  amounts of examination staff resources to support combating abusive  shelters.  IRS\u2019s initial decisions on shifting resources might need to be  reevaluated as IRS develops better information on the size of the abusive  shelter problem and the amount of time it takes to examine abusive shelter  cases.  We encourage IRS to continue its efforts to obtain a better analytic  basis for determining the resources needed to address schemes and  shelters\u2013while providing sufficient attention to other tax compliance  areas\u2013and to develop goals and measures that it and Congress can use to  gauge IRS\u2019s progress.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.

Flow-through  entities are required to provide IRS and each partner, shareholder, or  beneficiary with a Schedule K-1 stating the individual share of net income  or loss to be reported.  These individuals are then responsible for reporting  this income or loss on their individual income tax returns and paying any  applicable tax.  According to IRS in tax year 2001, over 9 million flow- through entities reported passing through almost $1 trillion to  approximately 24 million partners, shareholders, or beneficiaries.  IRS  research efforts suggest that 6 to 15 percent of the K-1s attached to flow- through returns are currently being omitted from beneficiary, partner, and  shareholder returns.  To better detect such noncompliance, IRS began  transcribing nonelectronically submitted Schedule K-1s for tax year 2000 at  a cost of about $20 million.", "In 2001, IRS added Schedule K-1 document matching to its AUR program.  It began matching Schedule K-1 data to individual tax returns to identify  taxpayers who had underreported flow-through income and had  consequently underpaid their taxes.  IRS estimated that K-1 matching  program costs would be about $23.5 million total for both K-1 transcription  and AUR program operations and that program yield would be $36 million  in direct tax assessed.  IRS also estimated that if voluntary compliance  improved one percent due to the matching program, approximately  $1.23 billion of additional tax would be generated annually.  In the first year  of the program, IRS issued about 69,000 notices to taxpayers and assessed  about $29 million in additional taxes directly attributable to Schedule K-1  underreporting. GAO estimates that when program assessments are  compared to the costs of the program\u2019s AUR operations, the return per  dollar of the K-1 matching program was about $9.31.  If the cost of  transcribing the K-1 data is included, the return per dollar decreases to  about $1.25. Both of these assessment-to-cost ratios are substantially  lower than that for the AUR program as a whole. The AUR program  returned about $25 for every dollar spent in tax year 2000.", "IRS has also used Schedule K-1 data to determine characteristics of  potentially noncompliant taxpayer populations.  Its preliminary profiling  efforts identified over 227,000 business entities with almost $64 billion in  Schedule K-1 income for tax year 2000 that potentially did not file tax  returns.  As of September 2003, IRS had begun to discuss ways of analyzing  these cases to determine whether these businesses were required, but  failed, to file returns, or whether inaccuracies in Schedule K-1 data  produced false nonfiler leads.
