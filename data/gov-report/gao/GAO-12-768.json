Certain PPACA provisions are scheduled to take effect in 2014.

GAO examined (1) estimates of the effect of PPACA on the extent of employer-sponsored coverage; (2) factors that may contribute to the variation in estimates; and (3) how estimates of coverage vary by the types of employers and employees that may be affected, as well as other changes employers may be considering to the health benefits they offer. GAO reviewed studies published from January 1, 2009, through March 30, 2012 containing an original numerical estimate of the prevalence of employer-sponsored coverage at the national level. These included 5 microsimulation models and 19 employer surveys. Microsimulation models can systematically estimate the combined effects of multiple PPACA provisions in terms of both gains and losses of coverage; their results are based on multiple data sets and assumptions. Surveys reflect employer perspectives; they have limits as a predictive tool in part based on varied survey methodologies and respondent knowledge of PPACA."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The five studies GAO reviewed that used microsimulation models to estimate the effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) on employer-sponsored coverage generally predicted little change in prevalence in the near term, while results of employer surveys varied more widely. The five microsimulation study estimates ranged from a net decrease of 2.5 percent to a net increase of 2.7 percent in the total number of individuals with employer-sponsored coverage within the first 2 years of implementation of key PPACA provisions, affecting up to about 4 million individuals. Two of these studies also indicated that the majority of individuals losing employer-sponsored coverage would transition to other sources of coverage. In contrast to the microsimulation studies, which estimate the net effect on individuals, most employer surveys measure the percentage of employers that may drop coverage in response to PPACA. Among the 19 surveys, 16 reported estimates of employers dropping coverage for all employee types. Among these 16, 11 indicated that 10 percent or fewer employers were likely to drop coverage in the near term, but estimates ranged from 2 to 20 percent. Most surveys were of employers currently offering coverage and therefore did not also address whether other employers may begin to offer coverage in response to PPACA; however, 3 that did found that between 1 and 28 percent would begin offering coverage as a result of PPACA. Longer-term predictions of prevalence of employer-sponsored coverage were fewer and more uncertain, and four microsimulation studies estimated that from about 2 million to 6 million fewer individuals would have employer-sponsored coverage in the absence of the individual mandate compared to with the mandate.", "Differences in key assumptions and consideration of PPACA provisions likely contributed to some variation among estimates from the five microsimulation studies and the 16 employer surveys. Variation among the microsimulation studies may have stemmed from differences in assumptions about employer and employee decision making, the time frames of the estimates, and assessments of potential compliance with the individual mandate. Variation among the employer surveys may be related to differences in survey sampling techniques, the number and types of employer respondents, and the framing of survey questions. For example, some surveys used a random sampling methodology, allowing their results to be generalized across all employers, while others did not. Also, some referred to specific PPACA provisions or provided specific information about provisions to respondents, while others did not.", "Some of the 19 employer surveys indicated that PPACA may have a larger effect on small employers and certain populations and may prompt some employers to change benefit designs. For example, 4 surveys found that smaller employers were more likely than other employers to stop offering health coverage in response to PPACA, and 5 found that employers in general were more likely to drop coverage for retirees than for all employees. Nine surveys also indicated that employers are considering key changes to benefit design, some of which may result in greater employee cost for health coverage.", "GAO provided a draft of this report to two researchers with expertise in employee health benefits issues.

In 2010, 59 percent of Americans under  age 65 received health coverage through employer-sponsored group  health plans, and an additional 7 percent received coverage through  health coverage purchased directly from health insurers in the individual  market. Employers may provide coverage either by purchasing  coverage from a health insurer (fully insured plans) or by funding their  own health coverage (self-insured plans). Small employers typically offer  fully insured plans, while large employers are more likely to be self- insured. Small employers are also less likely to offer their employees  health coverage compared to large employers, citing the cost of coverage  as a key reason. Additionally, firms with more high-wage workers are  more likely to offer coverage to their employees than those with more low- wage workers. Rates of employer-sponsored health coverage have  declined in the last decade\u2014from 68 percent in 2001 to 60 percent in  2011. Most of this decline occurred by 2005 and was driven primarily by a  decline in the number of very small employers with three to nine  employees offering health coverage. In addition, employee participation in  employer-sponsored coverage has also decreased\u2014from 70 percent in  2001 to 65 percent in 2011, in part because of a decline in employee  eligibility for the coverage. Further, employees\u2019 share of the cost of  coverage is increasing faster than employers\u2019 share\u2014the employee  contribution to the average annual premium for family coverage increased  131 percent from 2001 to 2011 compared to a 108 percent increase in the  employer contribution for the same time period.", "PPACA contains a number of provisions that may affect whether  employers offer health coverage.

The models systematically estimate the combined effect of multiple  provisions in legislation, such as PPACA, based on this previous research  and empirical data. For example, with respect to PPACA, models can  provide an estimate of employer-sponsored coverage that considers both  the number of employers that may discontinue offering coverage and the  number that may begin to offer coverage. Models can also incorporate  into their analyses estimates of the number of employees who may take  up or refuse offers of such coverage. Model limitations include their  dependence upon multiple types of data from multiple sources of varying  quality and that they must rely on many assumptions. The impact of  past policy changes also may not necessarily be predictive of the impact  of future changes, and there is little information available with which to  assess the validity of their projections.analytic approaches to model behavior in response to policy changes   Studies we reviewed using other  varied in their methods, ranging from a cost-benefit comparison to an  analysis that used survey data and economic theory to predict behavior.", "Employer surveys have also been cited to illustrate the potential impact of  PPACA on employer health benefits. Unlike microsimulation models,  surveys have the advantage of reflecting the actual, current perspectives  of employers, and they can also assess how employers\u2019 behavior may be  affected by the actions of other employers of similar size and industry.  However, they have limitations as a predictive tool. For example, most  surveys relating to PPACA asked respondents about employers\u2019  likelihood of dropping coverage, rather than the likelihood of newly  offering coverage as a result of PPACA or the number of employees that  may take up or refuse such coverage. Thus, they may not illustrate the  net effect of PPACA on employer-sponsored coverage. Further, the  validity of their results may be limited by the knowledge of survey  respondents. Experts have noted that employer surveys tend to be  answered by human resource officials with varying levels of knowledge  about PPACA. In addition, researchers note that survey responses do not  require careful analysis or extensive deliberation and have no  consequences for the responders. Therefore, surveys are more limited in  their ability to systematically assess the combined effect of multiple  PPACA provisions\u2014that is, they cannot ensure that respondents consider  (or have the ability to consider) all of the relevant provisions when  deciding how to respond.

Some, such as those conducted by trade groups, were  limited to members of the surveying organization. Others were limited  to only small or only large employers, or employers within a particular  industry, or included a broader mix of small, midsize, and large  employers across all types of industries. For example, the NFIB  survey included only small employers with 50 or fewer employees,  while the majority of respondents to the HighRoads survey were from  hospitals and other health care systems. The Mercer and Willis  surveys included a wider range of employer sizes and industries.  Some surveys, such as the Benfield Research survey, included only  self-insured employers, and others, such as the McKinsey survey,  included only private sector employers.", "Framing of the survey questions: Surveys varied in the manner in  which they asked whether employers were planning to drop health  coverage in response to PPACA. For example, the Fidelity  Investments (Fidelity) survey reported whether respondents were  \u201cseriously thinking about no longer offering health care coverage,\u201d the  HR Policy Association survey asked if respondents were giving  \u201cserious consideration to discontinuing providing health benefits,\u201d and  the NFIB survey asked if employers were \u201cnot at all likely\u201d or \u201cnot too  likely\u201d to \u201chave an employee insurance plan 12 months from now.\u201d In  addition, some surveys reported specifically about active employee  health plans, while others did not distinguish between active  employees and retirees. For example, the Towers Watson survey  reported whether respondents planned to \u201creplace health care plans  for active employees working 30+ hours per week with a financial  subsidy\u201d while the GfK Custom Research North America survey  reported whether employers were \u201cvery or somewhat likely to drop  coverage\u201d without specifying whether this was for active employees or  retirees.", "Referencing of PPACA provisions: Surveys varied in their  assumptions of respondent knowledge of PPACA provisions. For  example, 11 surveys assumed a certain level of respondent  awareness of key PPACA provisions and did not specifically refer to  the provisions in the phrasing of their questions about plans to drop  coverage. However, other surveys phrased their questions in the  context of specific PPACA provisions or explicitly asked respondents  about their knowledge of the provisions. For example, the  PricewaterhouseCoopers survey asked how likely respondents were  to \u201ccover employees through state-run health insurance exchange  pools,\u201d and the Willis survey asked how likely respondents were to  \u201cdrop coverage to trigger migration of employees to state-based  exchanges.\u201d The McKinsey survey also phrased its questions about  discontinuing health coverage in the context of select PPACA  provisions and provided additional information to respondents to  inform them about the provisions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Employer Surveys Suggest That PPACA May Have a Larger Effect on Small Employers and Certain Employee Populations and Prompt Some Employers to Change Benefit Designs", "paragraphs": ["PPACA may affect certain types of employers or employers with certain  employee populations more than all employers or employees. Some  employers were considering benefit design changes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "PPACA May Affect Small Employers and Certain Types of Employees More Than Others", "paragraphs": ["Four of five surveys that examined changes in the prevalence of  employer-sponsored coverage by employer size indicated that a greater  share of small employers (from 5 to 22 percent) were considering  dropping coverage compared to large employers (from 2 to 14 percent) in  these surveys. These surveys included Fidelity (22 percent and   14 percent for small and large employers, respectively), McKinsey   (9 percent and 5 percent for small and large employers, respectively), and  Mercer (5 percent and 2 percent for small and large employers,  respectively). One survey (Willis) did not indicate any differences between  small and large employers.", "Surveys that examined changes in the prevalence of employer-sponsored  coverage for certain types of beneficiaries indicated that these individuals  could be more affected than others. Five of the nine surveys that  considered the effect on retirees indicated that a higher proportion of  employers were considering dropping coverage for retirees compared to  all employees in these surveys\u2014between 9 and 20 percent compared to  4 percent and 9 percent, respectively. For example, Mercer  indicated that 17 percent and 5 percent of employers were considering  dropping coverage for new retirees and all employees, respectively, and  Willis indicated that 9 percent and 5 percent of employers were  considering dropping coverage for retirees and all employees,  respectively. Two of the four remaining surveys  (PricewaterhouseCoopers and IFEBP) indicated no differences between  rates of employers dropping coverage for retirees and for all employees,  and the remaining two only examined the effect of PPACA on subsets of  employees, but not all employees. In addition, two surveys that examined  the effect of PPACA on spouses and dependents indicated that between  12 and 15 percent of employers were considering dropping health  coverage for spouses and dependents compared to a lower proportion for  all employees. For example, McKinsey indicated that 15 percent and   9 percent of employers were definitely considering dropping coverage for  spouses/dependents and all employees, respectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PPACA May Also Prompt Employers to Change Health Plan Benefit Design", "paragraphs": ["Several of the 19 employer surveys that we reviewed also indicated that  PPACA may prompt employers to consider key changes to benefit  designs that will generally result in greater employee cost for health  insurance.", "Increased employee cost sharing: The 9 surveys that examined  benefit design changes indicated that from 16 to 73 percent of  employers were considering increasing employees\u2019 share of the cost  of coverage, for example, through increased premiums, deductibles,  or co-payments. For example, the IFEBP survey indicated that about  40 percent of employers had increased or were planning to increase  employee premium sharing, and about 29 percent had increased or  planned on increasing in-network deductibles. Similarly, the  PricewaterhouseCoopers survey indicated that 61 percent planned to  increase employee premium sharing, and 57 percent planned to  increase employee cost sharing through other benefit design  changes.", "In addition, the 7 surveys that examined employer responses to the  high-cost excise tax effective under PPACA in 2018 indicated that  from 11 to 88 percent of employers had plans to take steps to avoid  paying the tax; in 5 of these surveys, employers planned to redesign  benefits and in 2 surveys employers had not identified specific  strategies but planned to take steps. For example, the Aon-Hewitt  survey indicated that 25 percent of employers anticipated changing  their benefits to reduce plan cost, while the Willis survey indicated that  22 percent planned to increase deductibles or co-payments to avoid  the tax.", "Use of account-based plans: The 9 surveys that examined employer  plans to offer account based plans, such as high-deductible health  plans (HDHP), consumer-directed health plans (CDHP), or health  savings accounts indicated that from 17 to 73 percent of employers  either had plans to offer such plans or saw the plans as attractive  options for providing health coverage. For example, the Benfield  Research survey indicated that about two-thirds of employers planned  to offer a CDHP by 2015, and the Towers Watson survey indicated  that 17 percent planned to start offering HDHPs in 2013 or 2014,  bringing the total share of employers with HDHPs up to 74 percent.", "Move to self-insurance: Two of the 3 surveys that examined  employers potentially becoming self-insured in response to PPACA  indicated that from 12 to 52 percent were considering doing so, and  the remaining survey indicated that 13 percent of employers reported  increasing their consideration of such a move in response to  PPACA.
