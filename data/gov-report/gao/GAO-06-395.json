It recommends that 20 percent of funds appropriated pursuant to the act be spent on prevention and requires that, starting in fiscal year 2006, 33 percent of prevention funds appropriated pursuant to the act be spent on abstinence-until-marriage. The Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) is responsible for administering PEPFAR. GAO reviewed PEPFAR prevention funds, described PEPFAR's strategy to prevent sexual HIV transmission, and examined related challenges."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal years 2004-2006, the PEPFAR prevention budget increased by almost 55 percent, from $207 million to $322 million. During this time, the prevention share of the total PEPFAR budget fell from 33 to 20 percent, consistent with the Leadership Act's recommendation that 20 percent of funds appropriated pursuant to the act should support prevention. The PEPFAR strategy for preventing sexual transmission of HIV is largely shaped by the ABC model and the abstinence-until-marriage spending requirement. In addition to adopting the ABC model, OGAC developed guidance for applying it--stating, for instance, that prevention interventions should be integrated and respond to local epidemiology and cultural norms. OGAC also established policies for applying the spending requirement for fiscal year 2006. To meet the 33 percent spending requirement, it mandated that country teams--PEPFAR officials in the field--spend half of prevention funds on sexual transmission prevention and two-thirds of those funds on abstinence/faithfulness (AB) activities. At the same time, OGAC permitted certain teams, especially those with relatively small budgets, to seek waivers from this policy to help them respond to local prevention needs. OGAC also applied the spending requirement to all PEPFAR prevention funding as a matter of policy, although it determined that, as a matter of law, it applies only to funds appropriated to the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative account. OGAC's ABC guidance and the abstinence-until-marriage spending requirement, including OGAC's policies for implementing it, have presented challenges for country teams. First, although most teams found the ABC guidance generally clear, two-thirds reported that ambiguities in some parts of the guidance led to uncertainty about implementing the model. OGAC officials told GAO that they plan to clarify the guidance. Second, although several teams told GAO that they value the ABC model and emphasize AB messages for certain populations, teams also reported that the spending requirement can limit their efforts to design prevention programs that are integrated and responsive to local prevention needs. Seventeen of 20 country teams reported that fulfilling the spending requirement, including OGAC's policies implementing it, presents challenges to their ability to respond to local prevention needs. Ten of these teams (primarily those with smaller PEPFAR budgets) received exemptions from the requirement, allowing them to dedicate less than 33 percent of prevention funds to AB activities. In general, the nonexempted teams were effectively required to spend more than 33 percent of prevention funds on AB activities; as a result, OGAC should just meet the overall 33 percent spending requirement for fiscal year 2006. However, to meet the requirement, nonexempted country teams have, in some cases, reduced or cut funding for certain prevention programs, such as programs to deliver comprehensive ABC messages to populations at risk of contracting HIV. Finally, OGAC's decision to apply the spending requirement to all PEPFAR prevention funds may further challenge teams' ability to address local prevention needs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In January 2003, citing the need \u201cto meet a severe and urgent crisis abroad,\u201d  President Bush announced his Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR),  a $15 billion, 5-year initiative to combat the global HIV/AIDS epidemic  through prevention, treatment, and care interventions. This initiative  represented a significant increase in U.S. funding for HIV/AIDS. Prior to  PEPFAR, the United States had committed to provide $5 billion to bilateral  HIV/AIDS initiatives; under PEPFAR, the total financial U.S. commitment  increased by nearly $10 billion, with $9 billion targeted to HIV/AIDS  initiatives in 15 focus countries.

Six focus country teams and some implementing partners  expressed uncertainty regarding the populations that should be  considered at-risk in accordance with the ABC guidance. Five of these  teams expressed concern that certain populations that need ABC  messages in their countries might not receive them because they do not  fit the ABC guidance definition of at-risk. For example, one team noted  that the majority of HIV infections in its country are transmitted from  one partner to another in either married or stable, cohabitating  relationships. However, this team told us that they understood the ABC  guidance on high-risk groups to be relevant only to a \u201climited epidemic\u201d  (unlike the generalized epidemic in which they were working) and that  married couples do not count as high-risk under PEPFAR.

OGAC\u2019s ABC  guidance places restrictions on activities promoting condom use, but it  does not clearly distinguish permissible and nonpermissible activities.  For example, the guidance states that condom use programs should  provide full and accurate information about correct and consistent  condom use, including how to obtain them. The guidance also places  restrictions on promoting or marketing condoms to youths; however, it  does not explain how providing condom information differs from  condom promotion or marketing. Several NGOs that receive PEPFAR  funding expressed concern to us about crossing the line between  providing information about condoms and promoting or marketing  condoms. For example, representatives of a PEPFAR-supported  organization that runs a youth camp for students (aged 15-17) told us  that condom use is addressed during camp sessions only when youths  ask specific questions. However, staff said that they feel \u201cconstrained\u201d  when they hear these questions, because they do not want to say more  than is allowed under PEPFAR guidelines. Another implementing  partner representative said that although the organization views  condom demonstrations as appropriate in some settings, it believes that  condom demonstrations, even to adults, are prohibited under PEPFAR.  OGAC\u2019s guidance also does not explain whether ABC approaches for  broader audiences in a generalized epidemic may include condom social  marketing. Although a senior OGAC official told us that broad condom  social marketing is appropriate in certain situations, five focus country  teams reported that, in their understanding, PEPFAR funds may not be  used for broad condom social marketing, even to adults in a generalized  epidemic.", "Guidance regarding mixed-age groups is absent, causing confusion  about who may receive the ABC message. The ABC guidance prohibits  PEPFAR-funded programs in schools from providing condom  information to youths younger than 15, but the guidance does not  discuss the application of this age cutoff to groups that include youths  younger and older than 15. Four focus country teams noted that the age  cutoff for providing condom information to youths presents challenges  because classrooms and out-of-school programs often include mixed- age groups. Two teams told us that, in these situations, only AB  messages are typically provided to the entire group and, as a result,  some older youths who need ABC messages may not receive them.", "OGAC officials informed us that they were aware that certain components  of the ABC guidance could be difficult to interpret.

The agencies disagreed  with our recommendation to consider whether the Leadership Act\u2019s  spending requirement should be applied solely to funds appropriated to the  GHAI account, in line with OGAC\u2019s legal determination that the  requirement applies only to these funds. First, they stated that applying the  spending requirement to only one part of the budget would harm their  efforts to use a unified budget approach. Second, they stated that the issue  is becoming less salient over time because non-GHAI funds have declined  in the focus countries. As a result of the agencies\u2019 comments, we have  clarified our recommendation to ask that they consider making this policy  change after reviewing the information they collect on the effects of the  spending requirement. We believe that this recommendation may be  particularly relevant for the five additional country teams required, absent  exemptions, to meet the spending requirement because non-GHAI funds  represent over 80 percent of their total PEPFAR prevention funding.

When OGAC receives the operational plans, it implements a  three-part review process, including a technical review, a programmatic  review, and a principals\u2019 review. At the conclusion of the reviews, OGAC  submits a notification to the relevant congressional committees, informing  them of the activities it plans to implement under PEPFAR in the current  fiscal year.

Because of the teams\u2019 varying methods for categorizing this funding, the  reported allocations for the AB and \u201cother prevention\u201d program areas are  of limited reliability.", "In our structured interviews, 10 of the 15 focus country teams noted the  difficulty of categorizing funding for certain integrated ABC programs. For  example, some officials told us that, although they do the best they can to  estimate the portion of funding for an integrated ABC program that will be  used for AB versus \u201cother prevention\u201d activities, it can be difficult to  predict in advance how much funding will be used for AB or \u201cother  prevention\u201d activities when a program provides a variety of HIV prevention  messages that may vary based on the needs of program participants.", "A review of fiscal year 2006 country operational plans indicates that, within  the sexual transmission prevention program area, country teams use  different methods for categorizing integrated programs that have ABC  components in their plans. Some country teams have categorized  integrated ABC programs entirely as \u201cother prevention,\u201d while others have  divided some or all of these programs between AB and \u201cother prevention\u201d  (with the C component categorized under \u201cother prevention\u201d and the AB  component categorized as AB). For example, one country team\u2019s fiscal year  2006 operational plan shows one of its integrated ABC programs split  between the AB and \u201cother prevention\u201d program areas but two of its  integrated ABC programs placed entirely in the \u201cother prevention\u201d program  area. Another country team placed all of its integrated ABC programs  entirely in the \u201cother prevention\u201d program area rather than split these  programs between the AB and \u201cother prevention\u201d areas.", "Our structured interviews also showed that country teams have used  different methods for categorizing funding for integrated ABC programs for  planning and reporting. Following are methods used by country teams we  interviewed:  Twelve of the 15 country teams told us that they split at least some of  their integrated ABC programs into the AB and \u201cother prevention\u201d  program areas. Most of these teams told us that they do not split all of  their integrated programs into the different prevention program.  Instead, some of these teams told us that they categorize some  integrated programs entirely in the \u201cother prevention\u201d program area,  while some also said that they had placed entirely in the AB program  area some programs that primarily focus on AB but may provide limited  information on condoms.", "The other three country teams told us that, in general, they do not split  any of their integrated ABC programs; instead, they categorize these  programs entirely in the \u201cother prevention\u201d program area. These three  teams said that, in general, they categorize only programs that include  AB components, but no C component, in the AB program area.", "Three country teams reported that they categorize some integrated ABC  programs based on the target group; for example, integrated programs  for youths may be categorized entirely in the AB program area, while  integrated programs for most-at-risk groups may be categorized entirely  in the \u201cother prevention\u201d program area.", "In addition, we found that certain broader components of sexual  transmission prevention programs that are not clearly defined as AB or  \u201cother prevention\u201d may appear in either program area. For example,  activities addressing issues such as stigma reduction, peer pressure, and  child, spouse, or substance abuse may be categorized as either AB or \u201cother  prevention,\u201d depending on the country team\u2019s judgment and factors such as  a program\u2019s focus or target population. Although these activities could be  considered AB because they address social and community norms related  to abstinence and faithfulness, they could also arguably be considered  \u201cother prevention.\u201d One country team\u2019s proposed fiscal year 2006  operational plan illustrates how the same types of broad prevention  activities may fall under AB or \u201cother prevention,\u201d depending on the  specific program. This operational plan contains one program categorized  entirely as AB that aims to strengthen the capacity of military chaplains to  provide counseling on issues including child, spouse, and substance abuse;  management of family crisis, illness, death, and trauma; and alcohol  addiction. This program also plans to develop abstinence-based literature  and toolkits for the chaplains to disseminate to military personnel and their  families and to support anti-AIDS youth clubs that provide HIV/AIDS  education on abstinence and antidiscrimination against people living with  HIV/AIDS. This country team\u2019s operational plan also contains a program  categorized entirely as \u201cother prevention\u201d that supports drama groups to  provide messages to the country\u2019s defense forces on topics including  abstinence and faithfulness; HIV counseling and testing; stigma reduction;  child and spousal abuse; and alcohol-related issues, as well as correct and  consistent use of condoms.", "Because of the varying methods used by country teams to categorize  integrated ABC prevention programs and because of the inclusion of  certain broad prevention activities (such as stigma reduction) in both AB  and \u201cother prevention,\u201d a country team\u2019s reported AB spending may not  truly reflect the amount of funding actually supporting AB activities.  Likewise, a country team\u2019s \u201cother prevention\u201d spending may not be a clear  indicator of how much funding is going to non-AB sexual prevention  activities. Some AB activities are occurring in the \u201cother prevention\u201d  program area, suggesting that country teams may be implementing more  AB activities than first appear in their operational plans. At the same time,  however, activities that can be categorized as AB or \u201cother prevention,\u201d  depending on a country team\u2019s judgment, are also occurring in the AB  program area. Overall, we consider these data to be sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of this engagement. In particular, while there are some  limitations in the reliability of these reported data, they are useful for  identifying general trends and patterns across fiscal years and program  areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Joint Comments from State, USAID, and HHS", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the joint letter from the Department  of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the  Department of Health and Human Services, dated March 21, 2006."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.", "In their letter, the agencies stated that \u201cfinancing for all methods of  prevention have increased under PEPFAR\u201d and that, \u201ceven as the  amount of funding dedicated to a program area rises, the percentage of  overall funding dedicated to it may decline.\u201d  Although PEPFAR funding  in the 15 focus countries increased substantially in all five prevention  program areas between fiscal years 2004 and 2005, figure 8 of our  report shows that funding dropped in two prevention program areas  between fiscal years 2005 and 2006. Specifically, PEPFAR funding for  \u201cother prevention\u201d in the 15 focus countries declined from $65.8 million  to $61.6 million, and blood safety funding declined from $53.3 million to  $50 million. In addition, funding for prevention of mother-to-child  transmission stayed relatively constant, with $66.3 million in fiscal year  2005 and $67.5 million in fiscal year 2006. 2. The agencies commented that our report reflects misunderstanding of  the relationship between PEPFAR programming and reporting  mechanisms, noting that \u201cit is not the case that each program must be  only AB, or only C.\u201d  Our report acknowledges that country teams have  funded integrated ABC programs through PEPFAR. We explain that  these programs are often split between the AB and \u201cother prevention\u201d  program areas for reporting purposes, but we do not suggest that each  program must be AB only or C only. Rather, we note, for example, that  once funds are designated as AB, they can be used only for AB  purposes, effectively locking teams into allocation decisions made  when their operational plans were approved. In other words, the ratio  of AB to \u201cother prevention\u201d funding within an integrated ABC program  cannot change over the course of a funding year. Eight of the 15 focus  country teams indicated that segregating AB funding from \u201cother  prevention\u201d program areas compromises the integration of their  programs. For example, it can limit their ability to shift program focus  to meet changing prevention needs. Because of this potential, one  country team chose not to split funding between AB and \u201cother  prevention\u201d for a prevention program for persons living with HIV/AIDS  that includes faithfulness messages because it could not predict the  portion of the project that should be dedicated to the faithfulness  component and did not want to lose flexibility to \u201cdo what is  appropriate.\u201d        3. The agencies stated in their letter that \u201cthe ABC guidance had been  issued approximately 2 to 5 months prior to country teams\u2019 interviews.\u201d   As we note in our report, country teams first received the draft ABC  guidance in January 2005. The final guidance, distributed to country  teams in March 2005, differed from the draft guidance only in its  discussion of human papilloma virus. We conducted an initial round of  structured interviews with the focus country teams in June and July  2005. We conducted a follow-up round of structured interviews with the  focus country teams between August 2005 and January 2006.  4. The agencies commented that \u201cit is important to note that certain  examples provided in the report to demonstrate confusion regarding  the ABC guidance are in fact clearly spelled out in the guidance. In  these cases, the issues are actually related to implementation, not the  guidance document.\u201d Our report states that both interpreting and  implementing OGAC\u2019s ABC guidance has created challenges for  country teams. For example, while the guidance clearly states that  \u201cdiscordant couples should be encouraged to use condoms consistently  and correctly,\u201d it does not stipulate whether broad condom social  marketing programs are therefore appropriate when much of a  country\u2019s population consists of discordant couples. Similarly, while the  guidance clearly states that in-school youths 14 and younger should not  receive condom-related information, it does not address the issue of  how youth groups that cross this age divide should be handled. We  recognize that guidance on a subject as complex as prevention of  sexual HIV transmission will naturally lead to questions and believe  that the agencies\u2019 commitment to continually improve their efforts to  communicate policy to the field should help resolve these questions.    5. The agencies\u2019 letter stated that they have \u201cbeen able to approve the  allocations of countries that submitted justifications without requiring  other countries to make offsetting adjustments to their proposed  prevention allocations.\u201d  However, in our structured interviews, seven  country teams that were not exempted from the abstinence-until- marriage spending requirement identified specific program constraints  related to the requirement. As we note in our report, some of these  teams commented specifically on OGAC\u2019s 50 percent and 66 percent  policies implementing the Leadership Act\u2019s requirement. For example,  one country team told us that, because of OGAC\u2019s policies, it was  required to cut funding for programs in the \u201cother prevention\u201d program  area and to shift funding from the care category in order to address a  condom shortage in that country. Another country team told us that,  because of OGAC\u2019s policies, it had been required to substantially  reduce the amount of funding it had planned to dedicate to a prevention  program for people living with HIV/AIDS.  These examples illustrate the  adjustments to prevention programming that some country teams have  had to make to offset the effects of programming decisions made by  teams exempted from the spending requirement. Further, OGAC could  not meet the Leadership Act\u2019s overall 33 percent target without  requiring that, overall, more than 33 percent of prevention funds in  nonexempted countries be spent on AB activities. 6. The agencies commented that they had asked some of the country  teams that did not submit justifications if they wanted to do so and that  they said no. We also did not ask all country teams that did not submit  justifications whether they had wanted to do so. However, one country  team told us that, although it was struggling to meet the spending  requirement, OGAC officials had made it clear that submitting a  justification was not an option.  7. The agencies stated that applying the spending requirement only to  funds appropriated to the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative (GHAI) account  would signal a step backward in the integration of U.S. government  agencies\u2019 activities. We recognize that exercising this option may entail  some trade-offs and, as a result, have modified our recommendation to  ask that the agencies consider this change after reviewing information  collected on the effects of the spending requirement.  8. The agencies also stated that applying the spending requirement solely  to funds appropriated to the GHAI account would have little impact  because non-GHAI funds account for between 1 and 2 percent of focus  country teams\u2019 budgets. We acknowledge in our conclusions that the  amount of overall PEPFAR funding not appropriated to the Global  HIV/AIDS Initiative account is relatively small. We also acknowledge  that reversing this policy would not enable OGAC to fully address the  underlying challenges that the country teams face in having to reserve a  specific percentage of their prevention funds for abstinence-until- marriage programs. However, unlike the focus country teams, which  receive very limited funding not appropriated to the GHAI account, the  five additional country teams that OGAC requires to meet the spending  requirement\u2014unless they receive exemptions\u2014receive more than 80  percent of their PEPFAR prevention funds in non-GHAI funding."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Celia Thomas (Assistant  Director), Elizabeth Singer, Elisabeth Helmer, David Dornisch, Mary  Moutsos, Reid Lowe, Kay Halpern, and Etana Finkler made key  contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
