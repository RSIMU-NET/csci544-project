Inadequate systems can pose risks to human health and the environment, including the risk of waterborne diseases. Numerous federal programs provide grants, loans, or other assistance to rural U.S. communities, including those in the border region, for drinking water and wastewater projects. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) was asked to determine (1) the amount of federal funding provided to rural U.S. communities in the border region for drinking water and wastewater systems and (2) the effectiveness of federal efforts to meet the water and wastewater needs in the region. GAO analyzed agency financial data; reviewed statutes, regulations, policies, and procedures; and interviewed federal, state, local, and private sector officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Seven federal agencies--the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps), Economic Development Administration (EDA), the Indian Health Service (IHS), and the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation)--obligated at least $1.4 billion for drinking water and wastewater projects to assist communities in the U.S.-Mexico border region from fiscal years 2000 through 2008. USDA and EPA obligated 78 percent, or about $1.1 billion, of the total $1.4 billion--with USDA obligating 37 percent, or $509 million, and EPA obligating 41 percent, or $568 million. Agencies provided assistance for a variety of drinking water and wastewater activities, such as constructing or improving treatment facilities and installing distribution lines. For example, of the $509 million total, USDA obligated about $502 million to public utilities or similar entities for construction of or improvements to water and wastewater infrastructure. It obligated over $7 million to individuals in the border region for household projects, such as repairs to indoor plumbing. Federal efforts to meet drinking water and wastewater needs in the border region have been ineffective because most federal agencies (1) have not comprehensively assessed the needs in the region, (2) lack coordinated policies and processes, and (3) in some cases have not complied with statutory requirements and agency regulations. Although federal agencies have assembled some data and conducted limited studies of drinking water and wastewater conditions in the border region, the resulting patchwork of data does not provide a comprehensive assessment of the region's needs. Without such an assessment, federal agencies cannot target resources toward the most urgent needs or provide assistance to communities that do not have the technical and financial resources to initiate a proposal for assistance. In contrast, IHS has collected data on water and wastewater conditions for each tribal reservation. As a result, the agency can select projects that target the greatest need. In addition, although some federal agencies recognize the importance of a collaborative and coordinated process to increase program effectiveness, agencies' policies and processes are generally incompatible or not collaborative with those of other agencies. For example, most federal programs require separate documentation to meet the same requirement and the agencies do not consistently coordinate in selecting projects. As a result, applicants face significant administrative burdens and project completion can be delayed. Moreover, GAO found that some agencies do not always meet the requirements stipulated in federal statutes and agency regulations concerning how they are to determine the eligibility of applicants or projects and how they are to prioritize funds. For example, USDA and HUD do not ensure that recipients' use of targeted funds intended for use in the border region complies with statutory requirements for establishing project priorities in the border region. Finally, the Corps has not established any guidance to ensure funds are targeted to those projects with the greatest need."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["A serious problem along the U.S.-Mexico border is the lack of access to  safe drinking water and sanitation systems. U.S. residents who lack safe  drinking water systems often buy and store water in outdoor tanks or  barrels for drinking and other domestic uses. This practice represents a  significant health risk because the water is often transferred or stored in  open containers and is thereby subject to contamination. In addition, some  residents rely on substandard septic systems or cesspools to dispose of  sewage because they do not have access to wastewater treatment systems.  Leaks from substandard septic systems can contaminate sources of  drinking water, such as wells, and can also leave sewage on the ground,  where residents, especially children, may be exposed to bacteria and other  pathogens. Exposure to contaminated water and wastewater may  contribute to the increased rate of waterborne diseases in this region.

Our review focused on fiscal years 2000 through 2008.", "To determine the extent of federal funding provided to rural households and  communities in the border region for drinking water and wastewater projects,  we collected and analyzed agency data on obligations provided for drinking  water and wastewater activities from those federal programs that, based on  our prior work and additional research, were the most likely to provide  assistance to the region. As stated earlier, these programs are primarily  administered by USDA, EPA, HUD, the Corps, EDA, IHS, and Reclamation.  Our review included programs that provide assistance specifically to rural  areas as well as programs that provide assistance to both rural and urban  areas. We assessed the reliability of the data we used by reviewing  information about the underlying database systems, reviewing the data to  identify outliers and inconsistent or missing values, and discussing the data  with knowledgeable agency officials. We determined that the data obtained  from these agencies were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our review.  In addition, we electronically mapped the funds provided by the federal  agencies to identify the geographic distribution of funding. To determine the  effectiveness of federal efforts to meet the drinking water and wastewater  needs of the region, we identified and reviewed existing federal assessments  of drinking water and wastewater conditions; program statutes, regulations,  policies, and procedures to solicit, accept, and prioritize applications for  those agencies with programs targeted to the border region (i.e., USDA, HUD,  EPA, and the Corps); and coordination efforts among these agencies. We also  interviewed state and local government officials, officials from water and  wastewater utilities, nonprofit officials from the region, and such private  sector representatives as urban planners and engineers. In addition, we  conducted site visits in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, in which we  observed federally funded projects and discussed with state and local officials  their experiences applying for or receiving assistance from federal agencies.  Furthermore, we attended two interagency coordination meetings in which  various federal and state agency officials discussed the status of ongoing  drinking water and wastewater projects in the border region.

Part of this population increase has  occurred in communities now commonly referred to as colonias. Initially,  colonias emerged as developers sold small plots of residential land to  individuals without providing water or wastewater infrastructure.  Residents often placed a trailer or similar structure on the land or built  their homes themselves, many starting with just one room and adding on  periodically as they were able to afford it. Numerous news articles during  the 1980s and 1990s described colonias, with one referring to colonias as  \u201cpockets of poverty\u201d with conditions similar to those generally associated  with \u201cthird-world\u201d conditions. When colonias first began to emerge, they  were often located in remote areas outside of incorporated cities where  developers sold land as residential without adhering to the ordinances and  regulations of the cities; however, more recently many local governments  have begun to classify entire cities or subdivisions within a city as  colonias.", "Since water and wastewater infrastructure were lacking when they bought  their lots and built their homes, many residents in colonias relied on on- site alternatives. For example, to obtain water, some used contaminated  wells, while others hauled and stored water in barrels or tanks. For  wastewater disposal, residents used methods such as septic tanks or  cesspools. Septic systems can treat waste safely, but they can also  contaminate drinking water with sewage and organic matter if they are not  installed and maintained properly. Effective septic systems require that the  type and amount of soil be sufficient to absorb wastewater, and that the  systems not be located too close to groundwater or surface water. In  contrast, cesspools can pose a risk of contamination because they do not  treat wastewater and are merely holes in the ground for the disposal of  sewage. Problems associated with failing septic systems are not restricted  to colonias. Rural households throughout the region can experience  difficulties maintaining proper on-site wastewater treatment. Figure 2  compares proper septic system function with improper cesspool disposal.", "In response to public health concerns in the border region caused by a  lack of clean drinking water and adequate sewage treatment, Congress  established various programs with dedicated funding. For example, in the  early 1990s, Congress established dedicated funding for water and  wastewater projects to benefit residents of colonias. These funds have  been used for a number of projects to provide colonia residents safe  drinking water and adequate sewage disposal, yet some colonias continue  to lack these basic services. Appendix II provides additional information  on the establishment of federal funding to assist colonias.", "Colonias are still found throughout the border region, though their  characteristics vary widely. Present-day colonias are communities of all  types and sizes, both incorporated and unincorporated. For example, a  colonia can be a tribal reservation, a fast-growing retirement community,  or a high-poverty subdivision. Moreover, not all colonias have the same  level of need. For example, a town in Arizona that already had water and  wastewater service was designated a colonia in 2008 because the local  water utility did not have the funds to address routine repairs, and  believed that the designation would increase its ability to receive federal  funds.

However, the agencies have long  recognized the need for improved coordination, and in 1997 these agencies  issued a joint memorandum to encourage cooperation among federal,  state, and local funding agencies.

In another example, HUD provided a utility in Hudspeth County,  Texas, over $860,000 in grant funds from 2004 to 2006 to extend water  distribution and waste collection lines for residents of a colonia. However,  as of September 2009, the distribution lines remain unused because the  utility does not have enough water to serve the additional households. T he  utility intended to use funding from USDA to construct a new well, but the  funding obligated by the agency was not enough to cover project costs.The utility has been unable to obtain the additional assistance from federal  agencies, and no additional water supply has been acquired in the 3 years  after the HUD funds were provided to construct the distribution lines,  resulting in a $900,000 investment of federal funds in distribution lines that  are not usable.

However,  we found that HUD has failed to ensure that state distribution plans reflect  that priority is given to the colonias with the greatest need. Instead, HUD  officials told us that it is up to the states to determine the needs-based gran t  priorities and the agency does not believe it has the authority to direct states on how to distribute the funds as long as it is in accordance with a  distribution plan.

The ultimate success of  providing these basic services to residents of the border region hinge several factors, of which a well-coordinated implementation approach  based on a comprehensive assessment of the region\u2019s existing water wastewater needs is key.

USDA also agreed with our report\u2019s finding that there is comprehensive federal assessment of the region\u2019s water and wastewater  systems. However, USDA questioned whether a federal level  comprehensive assessment is needed to effectively address water syst inadequacies or whether a locally based federal presence that leverages  local knowledge of local conditions might not be more effective. W agree that local knowledge of local needs is an important element that  help inform decision makers, we continue to believe that without a  comprehensive assessment of the region, federal agencies providing  assistance to the region lack necessary information on the magnitude of  the problem and on how best to prioritize and target limited resources.

These agencies were directed to establish  programs dedicated to assisting these communities. The legislative  histories of the program authorizations emphasize that the key concern  over colonias was public health impacts stemming from the lack of clean  drinking water and the inadequate disposal of sewage; for example, one  particular concern was that the inadequate systems in use, combined with  flooding conditions, would result in human waste in the roads.  Statements throughout the Congresses consistently depict colonias as  areas that lack safe drinking water and sewage disposal facilities, and the  colonias were sometimes likened to areas with \u201cthird world\u201d conditions.  ewer  Substandard housing is also mentioned, but the lack of water and s are the predominant characteristics. For example, the sponsor of the administered Colonia Set-aside explained, \u201cThese citizens do not have  sewer, they do not have sewage systems, they do not have running water,  and I think that is a travesty in America, that American citizens do not  have the basic necessities of life.\u201d Another representative, when  introducing amendments to the USDA program legislation, stated \u201chere  are hundreds of individuals that live in the colonias that will suffer from a  lack of adequate water and sanitation facilities. This situation is truly  dangerous in terms of sanitation and health hazards from the lack of  proper water and sewer systems.\u201d Finally, when the provision authorizing  the Corps\u2019 colonias assistance was added to the Water Resource and  Development Act bill, a representative explained: \u201cColonias are rural  settlements along the United States-Mexico border which lack or have  inadequate basic water and sewer facilities. All of the colonias to receive  funding under this amendment are located in the United States . . . . Most  of the inhabitants of these communities use outhouses or substandard   HUD- septic tanks for their waste disposal. A set-aside for these areas is  particularly crucial from a health standpoint. Because of substandard  water resources, contagious diseases pose a particular threat to people  living in colonias.\u201d", "The Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act, as amended, directs  USDA to provide financial assistance for water supply and waste facilities  and services to communities whose residents face significant health risks,  because the communities\u2019 residents do not have access to such facilities.  The act states that USDA must give preference to entities \u201cthat propose to  provide water supply or waste disposal services to the residents of those  rural subdivisions commonly referred to as colonias that are characterized  by substandard housing, inadequate roads and drainage, and a lack of  adequate water or waste facilities.\u201d Thus, the provision requires USDA to  give preference to water and waste projects in colonias where other  infrastructure and housing are also inadequate.", "We found that USDA has no process in place to ensure that entities  \u201cpropos to provide water supply or waste disposal services\u201d to these  colonias are given preference. USDA officials explained that the agency  considers the funding for colonias to be a set-aside, and therefore only  considers entities proposing to assist colonias for this funding. However,  in implementing the program, USDA told us it views any entity proposing  to assist an area that the relevant state or local government has designated  as a colonia as qualifying for the preference, and awards funds to them  on a first-come, first-served basis. USDA does not attempt to  independently verify whether these entities meet the threshold eligibility  requirement (that they propose to provide service to areas where most  residents lack access to adequate water or waste facilities), or that the  areas to be served meet the statutory definition of \u201ccolonia.\u201d While agency  regulations repeat the statutory requirement for threshold eligibility and  define \u201ccolonia\u201d, the agency has failed to provide any guidance  elaborating on the meaning of an \u201cadequate\u201d water or waste disposal  system, or how to identify those colonias with the statutory preference  characteristics. Despite the lack of guidance, USDA told us that it  considers as inadequate a system with any violation of the Safe Drinking  Water Act or Clean Water Act, as appropriate. Furthermore, the agency  simply accepts local designations of colonias to satisfy the regulation and  the statute.", "As a result, USDA has no assurance that entities proposing to serve  colonias with the required characteristics have received the required  preference. By allowing colonia funds to be used for projects that benefit  communities with existing infrastructure, the agency is failing to give  preference to those colonias that have the statutory characteristics and  live without basic necessities.", "Under section 916 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing  Act, the states of Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas shall each  make available, \u201cfor activities designed to meet the needs of the residents  of colonias in the State relating to water, sewage, and housing,\u201d a  specified percentage of CDBG funds they receive.

The act requires grants to be made in  accordance with a distribution plan that gives priority to colonias having  the greatest need for such assistance. In short, the act requires grants to be  made for projects meeting the needs of colonias residents, which must be  related to water, sewage, and housing, and which give priority to the  colonias with greatest need.", "With respect to the meaning of \u201ccolonia,\u201d HUD told us the agency has not  developed guidance regarding interpretation of the definition or  determination of eligible entities. HUD\u2019s sole written interpretation of the  definition, issued in a 2003 notice, asserts that all three criteria must be  met; nonetheless, HUD officials also stated that the agency allows states to  interpret the definition as requiring only one of the three criteria to be  met. Finally, HUD officials told us that as they give grants to the states  for distribution to colonias, the states are ultimately responsible f determining eligible entities; to do so, the states rely on formal  \u201cdesignation\u201d of colonias. Without guidance from HUD, states have applied  the requirement differently. For example, in California and New Mexico,  most colonias are designated as communities with substandard housing  and a lack of either potable water or adequate sewage systems. In Arizona  designations use any one of the three statutory criteria. In Texas,  designations are made for areas with substandard housing that lack either  adequate water or wastewater treatment, and which are unincorporated, a  criterion not found in the act. While interpreting colonias as those  designated by states may have been the correct interpretation of the  Cranston-Gonzalez Act until 1992, in that year Congress repealed a  provision requiring that a colonia must be designated as such by the state  to be eligible for funds. process was changed so that a colonia can be qualified for this program  without regard to a state or county action. We believe that HUD\u2019s  reliance on the states in carrying out section 916 fails to give effect to this A committee report explains that the designation  change in law. HUD officials said that the CDBG Program relies on states  to make decisions that make the most sense for the particular state, and  officials do not agree that varying interpretations by states suggest that thelack of guidance is problematic. However, officials stated that HUD will be  issuing guidance, which they say will include information on the  documentation states need to support that a colonia meets statutory requirements.", "Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, Pub. L. No. 102-550, \u00a7 810 (Oct. 28,  1992).", "HUD officials also told us that it is up to the states to determine the needs- based grant priorities. However, under the act, states must distribute the  colonia funds according to distribution plans that give priority to the  colonias in the greatest need of assistance. To do so would require a state  to at a minimum identify colonias, discuss the relative needs of colonias,  and select projects reflecting the colonias with the greatest needs.  However, we found that HUD has failed to ensure that state distribution  plans reflect priority given to the colonias with greatest need. Instead,  HUD officials do not believe the agency has the authority to direct states  on how to distribute the funds as long as it is in accordance with a  distribution plan. Without direction and oversight from HUD, states may  not be meeting the statutory requirements. While HUD officials may  believe states are identifying the colonias with the greatest needs, section  916 requires the agency to not just rely on mere belief, but take such steps  as required to ensure it is doing so.", "HUD officials also told us that the agency interprets the statute as  authorizing colonia funds to be spent on any currently eligible CDBG  activity. However, the statute expressly limits the set-aside to activities  relating to water, sewage, and housing. Lacking guidance and direction  from HUD, states have applied the requirement differently.", "Finally, HUD officials said they are required to give states \u201cmaximum  feasible deference\u201d in interpreting statutory requirements related to the  Colonia Set-aside. HUD regulations establish the maximum feasible  deference policy; however, the regulations provide for deference only to  states\u2019 interpretations of CDBG requirements under the Housing and  Community Development Act of 1974 and certain HUD regulations. The  Colonia Set-aside requirement, however, was established by section 916 of  the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act, which stands  alone and is not an amendment to the Housing and Community  Development Act of 1974. Thus, HUD\u2019s maximum feasible deference  regulation by its terms does not encompass state interpretations related to  the set-aside. Even if it were applicable, the regulation limits deference to  state interpretations that \u201care not plainly inconsistent with the Act and the  Secretary\u2019s obligation to enforce compliance with the intent of the  Congress as declared in the Act.\u201d As outlined above, HUD has not taken  steps to ensure state interpretations related to funding of set-aside  projects, such as which activities are eligible, are in accordance with law."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Corps", "paragraphs": ["The Water Resources Development Act of 1992 authorized the Corps to  provide assistance to colonias.
