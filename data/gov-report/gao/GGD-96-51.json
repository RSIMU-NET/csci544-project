On the basis of these provisions, the Postal Service participates in the Universal Postal Union (UPU). Unlike domestic rate changes, the Postal Service\u2019s rate changes for international postal services are not reviewed by the Postal Rate Commission (PRC) and the delivery of outbound international mail is not covered by the Private Express Statutes (PES). Like its foreign counterparts, the Postal Service collects and retains revenues on outbound international mail, and UPU members compensate one another for in-country delivery of foreign-origin mail. The 1970 Act has been interpreted by Postal Service officials as requiring total international mail revenues from both outbound and inbound international services to cover all of the attributable costs associated with international mail.", "For fiscal year 1994, the Postal Service reported that it received $1.6 billion from international mail services. It handled 1.1 billion pieces of outbound international mail and delivered 727 million pieces of inbound international mail.

An international postal relations office was charged with coordinating these interdepartmental efforts within the Postal Service and it continues to coordinate efforts with (1) international organizations and other countries, (2) private delivery services, and (3) other federal agencies.

Around 1980, it added Express Mail International Service (EMS) and International Surface Airlift (ISAL), which it continues to offer today. In 1986, the Postal Service added International Priority Airmail (IPA). Revenues from these three services totaled $184.1 million in fiscal year 1994 or about 14 percent of the $1.3 billion in international mail revenues from delivery services. Airmail accounted for 80 percent of the outbound international mail pieces, or $883.9 million, and 69 percent of the total revenues.

According to the Postal Service, it is required to use scheduled U.S. commercial air flights to transport its mail overseas. A combination of treaty arrangements and national postal monopolies compels the Postal Service to rely, for the most part, on foreign postal administrations for in-country mail delivery.

The Postal Service required customers to sort and bag their bulk mailings by country of destination and to transport the mailings to an international airport to qualify for the best prices. In contrast, private companies such as TNT were willing to pick up unstamped business mail at the customer\u2019s location, do some sorting, and transport the mail to the appropriate place overseas.

Postal Service officials said that its international treaties necessitated substantial international rate increases in the 1980s that hurt its competitive position. For example, the Postal Service increased its international postage rates in 1981 an average of 39 percent for all of its services. Postal Service officials said this increase was necessary largely because the UPU Congress increased the terminal dues by 267 percent during its 1979 meeting.", "Furthermore, under the 1970 Act, the Postal Service must set its rates for all classes of services to cover all direct and indirect costs attributable to each class of mail plus that portion of other Service costs reasonably assignable to each class. However, it does not unilaterally control other postal administrations\u2019 payments to the Postal Service for delivering foreign mail to U.S. destinations. According to the Postal Service, it is not fully reimbursed for delivering inbound international letter mail because these terminal dues are set below the Service\u2019s unit cost for inbound delivery. To cover the shortfall between actual inbound mail delivery costs and the related terminal dues reimbursements, the Postal Service charged its outbound customers rates sufficient to cover the processing costs for both inbound and outbound mail.", "In response to the greater competition, the Postal Service expanded its ISAL service to more countries and introduced its International Priority Airmail service in 1986. It also began new efforts with foreign postal administrations to improve delivery times. Beginning in 1988, the Postal Service changed its pricing policy to reflect the new market environment. According to the Postal Service, these changes reversed a downward volume trend for the Postal Service\u2019s international air letter mail. For example, through 1985, the basic international airmail letter rate had been set at twice the basic domestic letter rate. In 1988, however, when the domestic rate increased to 25 cents, the international airmail letter was set at 45 cents instead of 50 cents.

WPL is an expedited airmail letter service being pilot-tested for deliveries from 7 U.S. cities to Canada and 13 Western European and Pacific Rim countries. WPL is designed to be faster than the Postal Service\u2019s regular airmail and cheaper than its international express mail.

IPCS is a bulk-mailing service, with discounts that increase with each larger volume increment, targeted to these large U.S. mail-order companies sending merchandise to other countries. The Postal Service began providing IPCS for delivery to Japan in December 1994. To qualify for this service, a mailer must agree to send at least 25,000 packages over a 12-month period. IPCS base rates are lower than single-piece international rates for both airmail and express services. For example, the Postal Service\u2019s individual parcel post air rate to Japan for a 5-pound package was $37.44 in July 1995. At that time, however, the base rate was $20.14 for a 5-pound package to Japan using standard air service under IPCS. According to Postal Service officials, IPCS base rates are lower than single-piece international rates because of fundamental cost differences in acceptance, handling, and transportation of IPCS parcels. As shown in table 1, the base rates may be reduced through up to four additive discounts (for a maximum discount of almost 21 percent) depending on how many cumulative packages the customer mails to Japan through IPCS during a 12-month period.", "Postal Service officials believe that IPCS discounts are consistent with discounts offered for domestic bulk \u201cdrop-shipped\u201d parcels.

PRC rejected the Postal Service\u2019s argument that international mail estimates could be verified by reviewing domestic mail data because, among other reasons, international mail incurs costs that are not shared by domestic mail.

International mail total \u201ccost coverage\u201d (the markup over attributable costs) was 141 percent in fiscal year 1994. In comparison, domestic express mail service contributed $148 million to overhead costs, and it had a cost coverage of 128 percent in fiscal year 1994.

The Postal Service said that the increasingly commercial dimension of its services requires reconsideration of the 1970 Act and that it has recently heard views from many parties, including leaders of foreign postal administrations, on the changes needed.", "The Postal Service said it believes that to meet the needs of the American public and business community, a stronger commercial capability is important domestically but, more crucially, for its international services, for which it suspended the protection afforded by the Private Express Statutes. The Postal Service said that it established the International Business Unit not only to develop new international services but also to generate new revenues to support improvements of the international universal service network.

According to the Postal Service, the role of UPU is to connect postal administrations with universal service mandates established by national authorities in a standardized global postal delivery network. The Postal Service believes that it is inappropriate for private operators, who have no obligations under UPU agreements, to participate directly in UPU proceedings. The Postal Service added that despite the limited access to UPU, private operators have unlimited direct access to foreign postal administrations and that they would not be able to offer remail services if they did not have such access. Although we did not reach any conclusions on the need for any change in U.S. participation in UPU, we do not agree with the Postal Service\u2019s assertion that Congress, alone, has determined the scope of the U.S. mail monopoly. Rather, the Postal Service has issued several regulations implementing the statutes which (1) define a \u201cletter\u201d for the purpose of administering and enforcing the statutes, (2) exempt various items from the scope of the statutes, and (3) suspend entirely the statutes for certain letters.", "The Postal Service said that ACCA\u2019s position on terminal dues is without foundation. The Postal Service said that it supports country-specific cost-based terminal dues. For example, the Postal Service said that it helped develop and supported the cost-based terminal dues for bulk mail adopted by the 1994 UPU Congress. The Postal Service added that ACCA failed to highlight the connection between terminal dues systems that do not cover the cost of delivery and remail offered at below-cost prices because the Service believes that ACCA members have benefited from postage rates based on below-cost terminal dues.
