ESPCs are financed over time through annual cost savings from energy conservation measures (ECM) and only their initial-year costs must be recognized up front. OMB policy determined how agencies obligated ESPCs in their budgets. With partnerships, agencies sometimes used short-term leases to acquire assets constructed for the government's long-term use and benefit. As a result, budgetary decisions may favor alternatively financed assets. However, spreading costs over time enabled agencies to acquire capital that might not have been obtainable if full, up-front appropriations were required. A number of factors may cause third-party financing to be more expensive than timely, full, and up-front appropriations. For example, a higher rate of interest is incurred by using ESPCs and partnerships than if the same capital is acquired through timely, full, and up-front appropriations. For our six ESPC case studies, the government's costs of acquiring assets increased 8 to 56 percent by using ESPCs rather than timely, full, and up-front appropriations. However, officials noted that there are opportunity costs, such as foregone energy and maintenance savings, associated with delayed appropriations, but there are insufficient data to measure this effect. For ESPC and partnership case studies, agency officials said they did not specifically consider or request full up-front appropriations because they did not believe funds would be available in a timely manner and because alternative mechanisms were authorized. An evaluation of funding alternatives on a present value basis could have helped agencies determine the most appropriate way of funding capital projects. Implementation and monitoring of ESPCs is a relatively uniform process. Since partnerships take a variety of forms, their implementation and monitoring is more complex. Although third-party financing can make it easier for agencies to manage within a given amount of budget authority, it also increases the need for effective implementation and monitoring by agencies to ensure the government's interests are protected."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As you know, one of the major recommendations of the 1967 Commission  on Budget Concepts dealt with coverage of the budget.  According to the  Commission, the \u201cbudget should\u2026be comprehensive of the full range of  Federal activities.  Borderline agencies and transactions should be  included in the budget unless there are exceptionally persuasive reasons  for exclusion.\u201d  With specific regard to capital investments, the  Commission recommended strongly against a capital budget that would  spread outlays over an asset\u2019s life, noting that it would likely \u201cdistort  decisions about the allocation of resources.\u201d  We have long supported an  inclusive budget that discloses up-front the full commitments of the  government.  However, in an era of limited resources and growing mission  demands, Congress has authorized agencies to use approaches other than  full, up-front funding to finance capital acquisitions such as land  improvement projects, buildings, and equipment.  Accordingly, these  alternative financing mechanisms have been used by agencies to acquire  assets by spreading the cost over a number of years in their budgets.  Thus,  the full cost of an asset is not presented or recognized in the budget at the time the decision is made to acquire it.  As a result, resource allocation  decisions made through the budgeting process may not consider the full  financial commitment the U.S. government is making and, consequently,  assets financed through alternative approaches may be preferred over  other equally worthy projects that are competing for full funding.", "From an agency\u2019s perspective, the ability to record the acquisition costs of  a capital asset over the life of that asset can be very attractive because the  capital asset could be obtained without first having to secure sufficient  appropriations to cover the full cost of that asset.  From the agency\u2019s  standpoint, absorbing the entire cost of these relatively high-priced assets  in a single year\u2019s budget may seem prohibitively expensive, particularly in  light of the long-term benefits of the assets.  Accordingly, alternative  financing mechanisms are frequently desirable to agencies because they  make it easier for them to quickly meet mission capital demands within a  given amount of budget authority.  From a governmentwide budget  perspective, however, the situation can be different.  The costs associated  with these financing approaches may be greater than would be the case  with timely, full, and up-front budget authority due, in part, to higher  interest costs.  This is of particular concern at a time of rising budget  deficits and concern about underrecognition of long-term costs and  commitments.  Moreover, when capital costs are not fully recognized up- front, before funds are committed, important information about the full  budgetary effects may not be considered as trade-offs are made among  competing priorities.  For the purchase of any given capital equipment,  agencies receive the same program benefits regardless of the financing  approach used.", "Agencies have estimated restoration and repair needed to address the  alarming state of deterioration of many federal assets to be in the tens of  billions of dollars.  Given this estimate agencies have relied heavily on  costly leasing instead of ownership to meet new needs.  Since the budget  scorekeeping rules were established, decision makers have struggled to  address agencies\u2019 tendencies to choose operating leases instead of  ownership.  One option we have suggested be considered would be to  recognize that many operating leases are used for long-term needs and  should be treated on the same basis as purchases.  This would entail  scoring up front the payments covering the same time period used to  analyze ownership options.  We have suggested this scoring for those  leases that are perceived by all sides as long-term federal commitments so  that all options are treated equally.  Although this could be viable, there  would be implementation challenges if this were pursued, including the  need to evaluate the validity of agencies\u2019 requirements based on their long- term plans.  Finding a solution for this problem has been difficult.  While  leasing to meet long-term needs almost always results in excessive long- term costs to taxpayers and does not necessarily reflect the best approach  to capital asset management, it also provides the government opportunities  to spend more on other mission objectives.  This same problem arises for  any asset that is acquired to meet long-term needs.", "In August 2003, based on your request, we issued a report that identified  and briefly described 10 different capital financing approaches used by 1 or  more of 13 federal agencies.  Subsequently, as requested, we have  analyzed in greater detail two of the identified approaches: Energy Savings  Performance Contracts (ESPC) and public/private partnerships  (partnerships).  In particular, we determined (1) what specific attributes  of ESPCs and partnerships contributed to budget scoring decisions, (2) the  costs of financing through ESPCs and partnerships compared to the costs  of financing via timely, full, and up-front appropriations, and (3) how  ESPCs and partnerships are implemented and monitored.", "To obtain the detail necessary to respond to this request, we used a case  study approach, which does not allow us to generalize our findings across  the government.  In order to understand the budgetary treatment and  oversight of ESPCs and partnerships, we reviewed relevant legislation,  ESPC files, partnership agreements, and relevant guidance issued by  agencies and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  We selected  case studies from agencies that had awarded a large dollar volume of  ESPCs awarded under the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Federal Energy  Management Program\u2019s (FEMP) umbrella contract, had broad partnership  authority, or were discussed in our prior report.  We also interviewed staff  within the General Services Administration (GSA), the Department of  Defense (DOD), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Department  of Energy (DOE), the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and OMB to  understand the features of ESPCs and partnerships, and how the  arrangements were scored.  In addition, we spoke with representatives of  Energy Service Companies (ESCO) and UT-Battelle, agency contractors  involved in our case studies.   In total, we analyzed 11 case studies\u20146  ESPCs and 5 partnerships\u2014across 4 agencies.  Because of our focus on  budget scoring, our analysis was confined to the government\u2019s acquisition  cost and was not a cost-benefit analysis.  To analyze ESPC costs, we  reviewed the delivery orders of each of our six ESPC case studies.   Although we were able to analyze ESPC costs and savings, we were unable  to perform a similar analysis of the partnerships we reviewed because we  were unable to evaluate claims that other factors, such as lower labor costs  and fewer bureaucratic requirements available to private partners, may  have reduced costs.  All of the partnership case studies we reviewed were  executed before OMB's 2003 changes to its instructions on the budgetary  treatment of lease-purchases and leases of capital assets.  According to  OMB staff, some of these partnerships may have been scored differently  under the revised instructions.  Our work was done in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards, from September 2003  through November 2004, in Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Ga., Oak Ridge,  Tenn., and Port Hueneme, Calif.  A complete description of our objectives,  scope, and methodology can be found in appendix I.  Appendix II provides  a summary of our ESPC case studies and appendix III summarizes our  partnership case studies.  Written comments from DOD, DOE, GSA, and VA  are reproduced and addressed in appendixes IV through VII.  OMB  provided oral comments.  We have incorporated these comments as  appropriate throughout.

CBO develops estimates of the  budgetary impact of bills reported by the different congressional  committees.  For the many individual transactions done under existing  authorities (thus not requiring annual legislation), CBO\u2019s estimates play no  role in determining how much budget authority must be obligated.  However, OMB interprets the scorekeeping guidelines to determine the  costs that should be recognized and recorded as an obligation at the time  the agency signs a contract or enters into a lease.  It is not always obvious  whether a transaction or activity should be included in the budget.  Where  there is a question, OMB normally follows the recommendation of the 1967  President\u2019s Commission on Budget Concepts to be comprehensive of the  full range of federal agencies, programs, and activities.  However, under  some circumstances, it may choose not to record obligations and outlays  up front.", "Budget scorekeeping rules and OMB instructions on the budgetary  treatment of lease-purchases and leases of capital assets are published in  OMB Circular A-11.  Revised in 2003 to address lease-backs from  partnerships, among other things, these instructions consider both the  government\u2019s legal obligation and how risk is shared between the  government and the contractor for three types of leases: capital leases,  lease-purchases, and operating leases.  The instructions state that when  agencies enter into a capital lease contract or lease-purchase, budget  authority is scored in the year in which the authority is first made available  in the amount of the net present value of the government\u2019s total estimated  legal obligations over the life of the contract.   Alternatively, for operating  leases that include a cancellation clause, agencies only need budget  authority sufficient to cover the first year\u2019s lease payments, plus  cancellation costs.  Figure 1 summarizes the criteria and other guidelines  for defining an operating lease.", "While we have previously reported that up-front funding permits disclosure  of the full costs to which the government is being committed, OMB\u2019s  budget scorekeeping instructions allow costly operating leases to appear  cheaper in the short term and have encouraged an overreliance on them for  satisfying long-term needs.", "Partnerships must conform with OMB\u2019s scorekeeping instructions. The  instructions for partnerships consider the degree of private participation in  the partnership to determine its scoring.  Private participation is judged by  the level of substantial private participation and private sector risk as  evidenced by the absence of substantial government risk.  Substantial  private participation means (1) the nonfederal partner has a majority  ownership share of the partnership and its revenues, (2) the nonfederal  partner has contributed at least 20 percent of the total value of the assets  owned by the partnership, and (3) the government has not provided  indirect guarantees of the project, such as a rental agreement or a  requirement to pay higher rent if it reduces its use of space.  If government  risk is considered high and private participation not deemed substantial,  the partnership would be considered governmental for budget purposes  and its transactions would be scored.  Figure 2 presents OMB\u2019s illustrative  criteria for assessing private sector risk.", "Using ESPCs and partnerships, agencies have been allowed to spread the  costs of capital assets over several years.  Agencies sometimes used these  financing mechanisms when they believed that timely, full, and up-front  appropriations would not be made available to support capital needs.   Moreover, they believe these alternative mechanisms enabled them to  avoid costs, such as higher utility bills associated with waiting for  appropriations.

According to DOE, ESPCs  have been used as an alternative financing mechanism to finance over a  billion dollars of energy system upgrades and installations.  Federal  agencies\u2019 use of ESPCs was authorized and encouraged by both Congress  and the executive branch.  In Executive Order 13123, dated June 3, 1999,  the executive branch defined requirements for agencies to meet specific  energy reduction goals and supported the use of ESPCs to achieve them.   The Energy Policy Act of 1992 and Executive Order 13123 require federal  agencies to reduce their consumption of energy in federal buildings. The  act set a goal for the agencies of lowering their consumption per gross  square foot by 20 percent below fiscal year 1985 baseline consumption  levels by fiscal year 2000.  Executive Order 13123 requires a 30 percent  reduction from 1985 levels by the year 2005 and a 35 percent reduction by  2010.", "Under the Energy Policy Act of 1992, federal agencies had the authority to  enter into ESPCs for as long as 25 years with qualified ESCOs that purchase  and install new energy systems in federal buildings.  The ESCO assumes  much of the up-front capital costs and, in return, receives a portion (nearly  all) of the annual energy savings attributable to the improvements until the  principal and interest have been repaid.  The ESCOs guarantee the  performance of the equipment installed, within certain parameters, for the  term of the ESPC.  The agency makes the payment to the ESCO from funds  that the agency would otherwise have used to pay the higher utility costs  (which are lower because of the ECM installed by the ESCO).   Consequently, agencies argue that they will not need an increase in future  appropriations relative to the current amount of appropriations in order to  pay the ESCOs.", "Agencies other than DOD and GSA must transfer 50 percent of the energy  savings realized from energy savings performance contracts (after paying  the negotiated amount to the contractor) to the Treasury.  The remaining 50  percent saved may be retained and is available for additional energy and  water conservation projects until expended.", "According to FEMP, 18 federal agencies and departments have  implemented ESPC projects worth $1.7 billion.  Without ESPCs, agencies  would have to reassess their budget plans to accommodate investments in  ECMs and/or Congress would be asked to appropriate funds today to  finance investments to meet currently required energy consumption goals.", "Proponents of ESPCs argue that, as an alternative financing method, these  contracts help agencies overcome the problem of insufficient funding to  meet federal energy reduction goals.  Without ESPCs, agencies would need  to adjust their program plans within expected appropriation levels to make  energy efficiency improvements or possibly do nothing if the funds are  unavailable in a given year.  In this regard, proponents note that delays of  even 1 year can result in greater utility, maintenance, and other costs.   Moreover, by using ESPCs, agencies did not have to make some difficult  trade-offs between purchasing ECMs and other claims on resources.", "Critics of ESPCs, however, point out that for any given ECM the direct  purchase of more efficient energy systems would allow all future savings to  accrue to the government, rather than paying out a percentage of the  savings to private contractors.  In addition, the government incurs certain  costs in using an ESPC, such as the M&V fees paid to the contractor, that it  would not necessarily incur if the energy improvements were financed up  front with federal appropriations.  The ESCO\u2019s also pay a higher cost of  capital than the federal government.  As a result, over the long term,  financing ECMs through ESPCs is likely to be more expensive than  acquiring them through timely, full, and up-front appropriations.  Finally,  dependence on the annual budget cycle is the process by which decision  makers weigh competing federal priorities.  Permitting ESPCs to be  recorded in the budget at less than their full cost up front affects this  process, possibly resulting in lower priorities receiving funding ahead of  higher priorities.  Not addressing some difficult resource allocation  decisions is seen as an advantage to agencies.  However, long-standing  budget concepts hold that a budget should be a forum for resource  allocation decisions and that all competing claims should be compared on a  consistent basis.", "CBO and OMB disagree over the appropriate budget scoring for ESPCs.   CBO recognizes that the law enables agencies to use ESPCs to pay for  ECMs over a period of up to 25 years without an appropriation for the full  amount of the purchase price.  However, the law does not prohibit scoring  the full cost of the contract up front.  In CBO\u2019s view, the obligation to make  payments for the energy efficient equipment and the financing costs is  incurred when the government signs the ESPC.  Further, CBO believes it is  consistent with governmentwide accounting principles that the budget  reflect this commitment as new obligations at the time that an ESPC is  signed.  Accordingly, CBO scored recent ESPC legislation such that the  total (long-term) commitments to an ESCO would be counted in the budget  at the time the ESPC delivery order is signed.  In contrast, OMB recognizes  obligations, budget authority, and outlays for ESPCs on a year-to-year basis.

For example, ESPCs finance energy- efficient equipment over time by using savings in agencies' utility bills to  repay ESCOs for the up-front equipment and installation costs.  Because  the ESCOs are repaid over time, the full up-front costs of ECMs are not  reflected in the budget.  (Fig. 8 on page 55 illustrates how ESPCs affect  agencies' cash flows before, during, and after the contract term.)  With  respect to most of the partnerships we reviewed, scoring decisions were  driven by the transfer of government land from agencies to third parties.   Case study agencies sometimes leased assets in short-term increments that  third parties constructed on the transferred land specifically for the  government\u2019s use and benefit.

Moreover, the unique mission of ORNL makes it unlikely that DOE will  move its operations from the Oak Ridge site.  DOE officials stated that the  likelihood that ORNL will close during the term of the bonds is very low, so  DOE is unlikely to terminate any part of the leases.", "According to DOE officials, DOE transferred the government-owned land  on which the buildings are located to UTBDC via quitclaim deed so that  appropriations for the full, up-front costs of the three buildings were  unnecessary.  DOE later approved the facility subleases between UTBDC  and UT-Battelle, LLC.  DOE then obtained the use of the newly constructed  buildings from UT-Battelle, LLC, reimbursing UT-Battelle, LLC, for the  sublease rents.  DOE officials told us the deal was deliberately structured  with a quitclaim deed to ensure that the arrangement was scored as an  operating lease rather than a capital lease.  Because OMB allowed DOE to  record this arrangement as an operating lease, DOE needed to obligate only  the annual cost of the lease payments, rather than the full cost of the  construction.", "In another case study, VA entered into an enhanced use (EU) lease for up to  35 years with the Dekalb County Development Authority (the Authority)  to finance and construct VA\u2019s Atlanta Regional Office (VARO) building and  parking area.

Also, for ESPCs, officials told us that the government  likely incurred additional costs for the measurement and verification  (M&V) of equipment performance.

None of the partnership case studies lent themselves to this type of cost  analysis because comparable data were not available.  Some of the  partnerships did not involve cash consideration.  For others, although the  government incurred higher interest costs compared to up-front funding,  we did not evaluate claims that other factors such as lower labor costs and  fewer bureaucratic requirements might lower costs because data were not  readily available.  Thus, we were unable to judge whether partnerships  could be less expensive overall.

Agencies contract for M&V of energy savings  financed through ESPCs because they are required to show that annual  savings generated by ECMs meet or exceed annual contractor payments.   M&V of savings also acts as insurance; if actual savings fall below those  guaranteed by the contractor, the contractor may be obligated to take  corrective actions at its own expense.  Officials we spoke with said they  believed that M&V resulted in higher sustained savings but is an expense  that would not be incurred if the ECMs were acquired through timely, full,  and up-front appropriations.  Representatives from the ESCOs said that  their private sector clients do not always purchase M&V, and, if they do, it  is for a shorter period than contracts secured by the federal government.", "Table 1 presents cost comparisons using the installation and construction  price of ECMs (based on delivery order files) as a proxy estimate for timely,  full, and up-front appropriations costs.  It shows that ECMs obtained  through our six ESPC case studies might be roughly 8 to 56 percent more  expensive than they could have been for the same ECMs had they been  obtained through timely, full, and up-front appropriations.  The percentage  difference between financing through ESPCs and estimated timely, full, and  up-front appropriations is shown in the far right column.  The difference in costs between the two financing mechanisms is a function of (1) the higher  cost of capital incurred through ESPC financing and (2) the M&V costs  incurred through ESPC financing.", "The performance of ECMs installed through the use of ESPCs are  guaranteed to reduce energy use during the term of the contract so that  payments to the contractor can be made from the savings from lower utility  bills.  ESPCs contain assumptions for such things as hours of operation and  ECM efficiency which, taken together, determine estimated savings.   However, if the assumptions are incorrect and estimated savings are not  achieved, the agency is still required by contract to pay the ESCO the  agreed-upon savings specified in the ESPC.  According to agency officials,  ECMs may continue to accrue savings beyond the contract cycle as they  continue to operate more efficiently than the equipment they replace.  The  additional savings along with the savings realized during the contract cycle  may cover the entire cost of the equipment. (See app. II for additional detail  on verification of ESPC savings.)", "As shown in figure 6, for all six ESPC case studies, contract cycle energy  cost savings specified by the contractor did not fully cover total contract  cycle costs (including O&M expenses) because agencies made up-front  payments. All six of the case study ESPCs used a combination of funds  from their existing budgets and third-party financing via an ESPC to  implement packages of ECMs. The up-front payments from their existing  budgets covered the difference between total contract cycle costs and  savings.  Accordingly, the agencies reduced the amount they had to finance  through ESPCs, thereby reducing their interest payments.  In the case of  the ESPCs for the Bangor Naval Submarine Base and Navy Region  Southwest, some of these up-front payments came out of a special  appropriation provided to address energy supply shortages in the West.   With respect to the ESPCs at North Carolina, Atlanta, and Patuxent River,  funds used to pay down the principal on the ESPC had previously been  appropriated to renovate, renew, or repair old energy consuming systems.   Since implementation of the ESPC made these activities unnecessary and  may be providing benefits other than costs savings, such as maintaining an  acceptable level of service, the funds from the avoided costs were put  toward the ESPC.  According to guidance issued by DOE\u2019s Federal Energy  Management Program (FEMP), agencies are permitted to use funds  generated by these types of avoided costs to pay for ESPCs.

In these  cases, agencies sometimes incurred higher interest costs by using  partnership financing rather than timely, full, and up-front appropriations.   For example, DOE benefited from the use of a roughly $70 million private  bond offering to finance the revitalization of three buildings at ORNL.

For example, Navy  officials said that, had they not used ESPCs, Naval installations would have  had to pay higher utility bills while waiting for appropriations to finance  ECMs.  Similarly, at ORNL, one DOE official pointed out that although the  idea for three privately financed buildings was conceived at the same time  as the highest priority federally funded building, the three privately  financed buildings were completed and occupied at least a year in advance  of the one funded through appropriations.

For example, an ESCO  prepares a Detailed Energy Survey (DES), which is an investment-grade  audit that determines what ECMs will be installed as part of the ESPC.

Projected energy savings are calculated by  subtracting estimated energy use after ECMs have been installed from  baseline energy use.  According to FEMP guidance, these calculations  should be examined in detail because they are the basis for determining  whether the contractually guaranteed savings are achieved.  Nonetheless, a  number of Army Audit Agency reports issued over the last several years  stated that energy savings baselines established by the ESCOs were faulty,  resulting in overpayments to the ESCO.  For example, some baselines used  incorrect assumptions such as overstated operating hours.   Representatives from two ESCOs noted that the greater the experience of  the government team, the greater the intensity of the negotiations.   Therefore, FEMP assistance is particularly important for agencies with  relatively little ESPC experience.

The financing approaches used in many of the case studies were structured  to include features for which OMB did not require up-front budget  recognition even though they established long-term commitments of the  government.

In the case studies we reviewed, the capital assets acquired offered  benefits to the government such as energy conservation and a collocated  VA regional office and medical center.  It is not the purpose of this report to  second guess the benefits of the assets.  This report focuses only on the  budgetary process of justifying the means of acquiring and financing assets.   Even though project financing may be obtained more quickly by using  alternative financing mechanisms, these mechanisms do not disclose the  federal government\u2019s measure of long-term obligations in the budget.  As a  result, when resource allocation decisions are made, costs are not shown  on comparable bases.  This can favor capital programs financed through  these mechanisms over other programs (including capital) that include  their full costs up front in the budget.", "In our work on capital planning, we noted that leading practices include  analyzing alternative approaches to financing capital by using methods,  such as net present value analysis, to analyze relevant alternatives to  address capital needs. OMB's capital planning guidance also suggests that  agencies need to select the alternative with the most cost-effective results  over the long term, based on a present value analysis. This analysis would  include all relevant federal financing costs associated with the alternatives  and any potential savings that can be attributed to the various alternatives.", "Long-standing federal budget concepts and our own work reinforce the  principle that full accountability for budgetary decisions is best guaranteed  by recognizing the full costs of federal initiatives at the time when the  decision is made to commit federal resources.  One way to ensure that  costs of assets used for long-term commitments are appropriately  considered in the budget would be to score up front the expected payments  over the same period of time used to analyze ownership options.  This  would require going beyond the strict terms of a proposed transaction and  scoring based on the substance of the deal.  Although ensuring the validity  of agencies\u2019 long-term plans may pose implementation challenges, such as  the need to validate agencies\u2019 long-term capital requirements, such scoring  could result in a better reflection of the government\u2019s full commitment.", "In addition to potentially affecting budget decisions, our case studies  showed that funding capital projects through alternative financing  mechanisms may be more expensive to the government than funding  through appropriations because the private sector\u2019s cost of capital is  generally higher than the federal government\u2019s.  Other factors such as  additional M&V and lower labor costs also may affect the cost of  alternative financing.  Using a proxy of their cost to the government, ECMs  obtained through ESPCs we reviewed at the Navy and GSA cost between 8  and 56 percent more than the same ECMs funded through up-front  appropriations.  Also, agencies did not specifically analyze and compare all  alternatives, nor did they investigate the feasibility of purchasing ECMs in  useful segments.  Given the federal government\u2019s ability to obtain capital at  lower interest rates than private companies, officials at case study agencies  agreed that funding through timely, full, and up-front appropriations is less  expensive than third-party financing.  However, with respect to  partnerships, other factors such as lower labor and fewer bureaucratic  requirements may offset higher financing costs.  Therefore, it is uncertain  whether using partnerships is more or less expensive than using up-front  financing.  Agencies did not adjust their capital plans to accommodate  needed capital investments nor request appropriations to finance capital  projects because they did not believe sufficient appropriations would be  available in a timely manner.  Instead, they used the authorities provided to  them to finance projects over time, through third parties.  By incurring  potentially higher costs in the future to avoid making difficult trade-offs  today, agencies merely defer the trade-offs to a later date and a subsequent  Congress.  These trade-offs would lead Congress to either increase  appropriations to maintain the current level of investment or fund fewer  projects.", "Agencies are faced with requirements for energy savings and need  appropriations to implement energy conservation measures.

DOE and VA disagreed with this recommendation based on concerns that  such a rule would effectively make alternative financing unavailable to  federal agencies. While it is not our intent to discourage or eliminate  partnerships with the private sector, recognizing the full commitment up- front in the budget enhances transparency and enables decision makers to  make appropriate resource allocation choices among competing demands  that all have their full costs recorded in the budget.  GSA did not address  this recommendation in its comments.  DOE, GSA, and VA agreed at least in  part with our final recommendation, that case study agencies should  perform business case analyses to ensure the full range of funding  alternatives are analyzed when making capital financing decisions.  DOD  disagreed with this recommendation and OMB did not address it in its  comments.  Business case analyses are well accepted as a leading practice  among public and private entities and OMB requires all executive branch  agencies to prepare such analyses for major investments as part of their  budget submissions to OMB.  Therefore, we believe our recommendation is  appropriate.", "Representatives from OMB, including staff from the Office of General  Counsel, provided oral comments on our draft.  These representatives  stated that OMB \u201cmeets regularly with Congressional scorekeepers to  review the scorekeeping rules and updates A-11 guidance in order to  accurately reflect the types of transactions and obligations the government  is entering into. OMB staff stated that they would take into consideration  the findings of the report and the agencies\u2019 comments on the report,  including whether contractually guaranteed savings are equitably  considered and given due credit when evaluating ESPCs.  OMB staff also  noted that recent updates in 2003 to scorekeeping guidance related to  lease-backs from public/private partnerships may address some of the  concerns GAO noted in the draft.\u201d  OMB staff said that the new  scorekeeping guidance attempts to ensure that the substance of the entire  transaction is scored.  We have clarified in the report that OMB\u2019s  instructions were revised in 2003 and the possible effect on how case  studies were scored.", "With respect to ESPCs, OMB representatives said there is no current plan  to revisit the 1998 decision to obligate funds on an annual basis.  They said  ESPCs are treated differently from partnerships in part because of the  savings component and in part because they believe doing so would negate  the statutory authority provision permitting agencies to enter into a  multiyear contract even if funds are available only to pay for the first year  of the contract.  We recognize the statutory authority enabling agencies to  enter into ESPC multiyear contracts without funds available for the full  contract price but note that the budget does not reflect full ESPC  commitments as new obligations at the time that ESPCs are signed.  In light  of these circumstances and Congress\u2019 recent action to extend ESPC  authority through fiscal year 2006, we removed our scorekeeping  recommendation with respect to ESPCs and are now suggesting that  Congress consider requiring agencies that use ESPCs to present Congress  with an annual analysis comparing the total contract cycle costs of ESPCs  entered into during the fiscal year with estimated up-front funding costs for  the same ECMs.  Congress could use this information in evaluating whether  to further extend ESPC authority beyond its current expiration date.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation (now deleted) about  developing a new scorekeeping rule for ESPCs.  In his letter, the Principal  Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Installations and  Environment) said DOD would concur in full if the recommendation was  modified to properly consider guaranteed savings.  As we note in our  report, recognizing the full commitment up-front in the budget when the  commitment is made enables decision makers to make more informed  resource allocation choices among competing demands from equally  worthy projects that all have their full costs recorded in the budget.  DOD  stated that it did not concur with our recommendation that business case  analyses should be performed when making capital financing decisions  because such an analysis would only increase administrative costs to the  department in the absence of a viable option to directly finance energy  conservation projects.  Business case analyses are well accepted as a  leading practice among public and private entities and OMB requires all  executive agencies to prepare a business case analysis for major  investments as part of their budget submissions.  Only by doing a business  case analysis can the government ensure that it selects the best alternative  and that taxpayers\u2019 interests are protected.  Therefore, we believe our  recommendation is valid.  DOD also provided technical comments on the  draft.  DOD\u2019s complete comments and our responses are contained in  appendix IV.", "The Acting Under Secretary for Energy, Science and Environment agreed  with our recommendation that agencies should perform business case  analyses and we commend DOE for drafting a policy that will require a  business case analysis for public/private partnerships.  However, DOE  strongly disagreed with our recommendation on scoring ESPCs (now  deleted) primarily because it believes it would negate the congressional  objective of promoting energy conservation through the use of ESPCs.  It is  not the intent of this report to discourage or to eliminate energy  conservation efforts.  We do not believe that up-front funding would  necessarily lead to reduced support as long as energy conservation was  viewed as a priority within the appropriations process.  However,  recognizing the full commitment up front in the budget when the  commitment is made enhances transparency and enables decision makers  to make more informed resource allocation choices among competing  demands that all have their full costs recorded in the budget.  We believe  our recommendation that OMB require and our suggestion that Congress  consider requiring agencies to provide an annual analysis comparing total  contract cycle costs of ESPCs with estimated up-front funding costs for the  same ECMs would be an appropriate balance between budget transparency  and energy savings at this time.  DOE\u2019s complete comments and our  responses are contained in appendix V.", "Because GSA does not normally engage in public/private partnerships, its  comments were confined to ESPCs.  The GSA Administrator noted that  GSA\u2019s policy is to perform business case analyses, but that such analyses do  not always consider the full range of funding alternatives for ECMs.  An  official from GSA\u2019s Atlanta region noted that, given GSA\u2019s $6 billion  alterations and repair backlog, other financing alternatives may not be  viable.  GSA also said it has decided to revise its energy conservation  project evaluation process to include consideration of useful segments.  We  commend GSA\u2019s decision to do so.  Finally, GSA pointed out that, aside  from ancillary up-front costs that must be incurred to carry out the project,  ESCOs guarantee that project savings will be met or exceeded during the  contract term and that GSA enforces these guarantees.  Because these up- front payments are part of the costs in the delivery orders we reviewed, we  included them in our analysis of total contract cycle costs\u2014the payments  ranged between 2 and 45 percent of the total contract cycle costs.  For each  of the three GSA ESPCs we reviewed, total contract cycle costs exceeded  contract cycle savings.  GSA\u2019s written comments and our complete  response are contained in appendix VI.", "VA disagreed with our report\u2019s conclusions and recommendation to OMB.   Although our report only looked at VA partnerships, VA chose to comment  both on partnerships and ESPCs.  In the Secretary\u2019s comments, he noted  that implementation of the recommendation to develop a new  scorekeeping rule would limit, discourage, and possibly eliminate the  enhanced-use lease program, thus resulting in a loss of benefits and  services to veterans.   Again, it is not the intent of this report to discourage  or to eliminate energy conservation efforts or partnerships with the private  sector.  However, from a budgetary standpoint, recognizing the full  commitment up front in the budget when the commitment is made enables  decision makers to make more informed resource allocation choices  among competing demands.  With respect to our second recommendation  regarding the need for business case analyses, VA noted that it had a  process for this to occur for capital investments above a threshold amount.    VA\u2019s complete comments and our responses are contained in appendix VII.", "As agreed with your office, unless you release this report earlier, we will  not distribute it until 30 days from the date of the letter.

To obtain the  detail necessary to respond to this request, we used a case study approach.   Accordingly, our findings cannot be used to generalize across the  government.  We selected case study agencies based on our August 2003  report on alternative approaches to finance capital.  In total, we analyzed  11 case studies\u20146 ESPCs and 5 partnerships\u2014across 4 agencies.", "For ESPCs, we selected case studies at the General Services  Administration (GSA) and the Department of the Navy (Navy).  We chose  these two agencies because they had awarded the largest dollar volume of  delivery orders under the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) super ESPC  program.  In addition, our discussions with DOE's Federal Energy  Management Program (FEMP) officials, who administer the Super ESPC  program, indicated that the differences in the way GSA and the Navy  administer ESPCs (decentralized versus centralized, respectively) might  provide some interesting insights.  Finally, the Committee\u2019s request  specifically asked us to include a military department in our review of  ESPCs.", "For partnerships, we selected case studies at the Departments of Veterans  Affairs (VA) and Energy.  We chose VA because of its broad authority to  enter into enhanced use (EU) lease partnerships and the significant  number of EU leases that have been awarded.  We selected one case from  DOE based on the preliminary work on the Oak Ridge National Laboratory  (ORNL) partnership done for our August 2003 report.  Also, it was our  understanding that this type of transaction might be replicated at other  DOE facilities.", "The initial selection of case studies within each agency was based on   (1) project costs, (2) availability/location of data, and (3) time frame of the  project.  These criteria narrowed the number of available case studies and  we judgmentally selected cases from this pool.  We chose three ESPC  projects each from GSA and the Navy.  Also, we chose to review one  partnership case study from DOE and four from VA.  Table 2 lists the case  studies reviewed at each agency.", "Case studies were selected based on their cost and data availability.  Data  for the selected cases were in Washington, D.C., for VA cases; Atlanta,  Georgia, for GSA cases; Port Hueneme, California, for Navy cases; and Oak  Ridge, Tennessee, for the DOE case study.  We selected ESPCs for which  contracts/delivery orders were awarded no later than fiscal year 2001 so  that the respective agencies would have had opportunities to analyze  whether cost savings realized to date approximate expected savings.", "To understand the features of the selected ESPCs and partnerships, we  reviewed laws authorizing the agencies to enter into ESPCs and  partnerships, relevant GAO products, and ESPC files and partnership  agreements.  We interviewed officials and/or staff from the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) and agencies involved in the development  of the selected ESPCs and partnerships.  We interviewed officials from  FEMP in order to understand the general features of ESPCs.  In addition,  we met with officers of UT-Battelle, LLC\u2014ORNL\u2019s management and  operations (M&O) contractor\u2014to gain a better appreciation of the DOE  partnership.", "To gain an understanding of how the selected ESPCs and partnerships were  scored and the reasoning behind the scoring, we reviewed relevant  portions of OMB\u2019s Circular A-11, analyzed the terms and conditions of the  selected case studies relative to the budget scoring rules, reviewed relevant  Congressional Budget Office (CBO) scoring reports, and met with agency,  CBO, and OMB officials and staff.  All of the partnership case studies we  reviewed were executed before OMB's 2003 changes to its instructions on  the budgetary treatment of lease-purchases and leases of capital assets.   According to OMB staff, some of these partnerships may have been scored  differently under the revised instructions.", "To analyze ESPC costs, we reviewed the final delivery orders of each of our  six ESPC case studies.  Cash flow schedules associated with these delivery  orders specified the case studies' expected savings and costs, such as  principal payments, interest payments, measurement and verification  (M&V) fees, operations and maintenance (O&M) fees, and energy service  company (ESCO) mark-ups.  Using these documents, we identified costs,  on a present value (PV) basis (using A-94 guidance), that agencies would  not necessarily have incurred had they financed the asset acquisition  through timely, full, and up-front appropriations instead of ESPCs.   Although we had planned to perform a similar cost analysis of our  partnership case studies, we were unable to do so because comparable  data were not available.", "To allow us to describe how ESPCs and partnerships are implemented and  monitored, we met with OMB, GSA, VA, Department of Defense (DOD),  and FEMP officials and staff.  We also spoke with representatives of certain  ESCOs to help us understand how agencies negotiate and monitor ESPC  contracts.  Finally, we reviewed agencies\u2019 documentation of how ESPC  baselines were estimated and how actual savings would be determined.", "Written comments from DOD, DOE, GSA, and VA are included and  addressed in appendixes IV through VII.  OMB provided oral comments.   We have incorporated changes as a result of these comments throughout,  as appropriate.", "Our work was done in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards, from September 2003 through November 2004, in  Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Ga., Oak Ridge, Tenn., and Port Hueneme, Calif."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ESPC Case Studies", "paragraphs": ["The Energy Policy Act of 1992 and Executive Order 13123 require federal  agencies to reduce their consumption of energy in federal buildings. The  act set a goal for the agencies of lowering their consumption per gross  square foot by fiscal year 2000 to a level 20 percent below fiscal year 1985  baseline consumption levels.  Executive Order 13123 requires a 30 percent  reduction from 1985 levels by the year 2005 and a 35 percent reduction by  2010.  ESPCs allow federal agencies to acquire energy conservation  measures (ECM) to meet these goals and implement energy-efficiency  projects without having to request the full amount of appropriations from  the federal budget.  Under an ESPC, the ESCOs assume much of the up- front capital costs associated with the improvements.  The government  then uses a portion of annual energy-related cost savings attributable to the  improvements to repay the ESCO for its investment over time, which may  be as long as 25 years.  This means that, although the government\u2019s energy  use may drop immediately, its expenses are generally not significantly  reduced until after the ESPC is paid off (see fig. 8).  The ESCOs guarantee  the performance of the equipment, within certain parameters, for the term  of the ESPC.  Agencies frequently acquire multiple or \u201cbundled\u201d ECMs  through ESPCs so that ECMs yielding more dollar savings can subsidize  those yielding less savings.", "Within DOE, the FEMP provides assistance to agencies seeking project  financing through a number of methods, such as ESPCs.  According to  FEMP guidance, energy-related savings result from reduced energy use,  improved patterns of energy use, avoided renovation, and reduced  operations, maintenance, and repair costs.  Thus, if agencies can avoid  scheduled renovations or maintenance of older equipment by  implementing ESPCs, they may use those avoided costs to \u201cbuy-down\u201d the  ESPCs.", "To streamline the procurement process, agencies have awarded multiple- award, indefinite-delivery-indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts to a number  of ESCOs in different regions of the country.  With these multiple-award  contracts in place, federal agencies can place and implement delivery  orders against the contracts in a fraction of the time it takes to develop a  stand-alone ESPC because the competitive selection process has already  been completed and key terms of the contract, such as maximum markup  ceilings, have already been negotiated.   FEMP\u2019s IDIQ contract, known as a  super ESPC, is used by many agencies.  Figure 9 shows the distribution of  agencies using FEMP\u2019s super ESPC from fiscal years 1998 through 2003.   The bar on the right of the figure shows in more detail the 25 awards at  other agencies using FEMP\u2019s super ESPCs.", "GSA generally writes delivery orders against FEMP\u2019s super ESPC, while the  Navy writes delivery orders against a variety of IDIQ contracts, referred to  as contracting vehicles.  Figure 10 shows the distribution of Navy ESPC  awards by contract vehicle from fiscal years 1998 through 2003.", "FEMP has issued guidelines and offered training and other support to help  agencies use its Super ESPC.  A typical suite of FEMP services, costing an  estimated $30,000, includes, but is not limited to, a review of the ESCO  submittals and advice on:  detailed energy surveys (DES) and related energy baseline data;  appropriateness of (M&V) plan for proposed ECMs;   technical and economic feasibility of proposed ECMs;  pricing and financing of ECMs and post-installation services submitted  in price schedules;  issues to address during agency/ESCO negotiations;  commissioning and postinstallation M&V reports and advice on project   annual M&V reports to verify annual energy savings or issues to resolve  before resuming payments.", "GSA sometimes uses FEMP\u2019s services.  Because the Navy has a centralized  technical and contracting team that is familiar with ESPCs, it uses its own  staff rather than FEMP's contracting officers and facilitators to support  projects.  However, the Navy has used some FEMP\u2019s services, such as  reviews of initial project proposals, free of charge, and has purchased other  FEMP support in special circumstances.", "The process for selecting and implementing ESPCs varies among agencies.   GSA and the Navy generally delegate the decision of whether to finance  ECMs through full, up-front appropriations or ESPCs to regional  coordinators and installations\u2019 commanding officers, respectively.  Once  the decision to use an ESPC has been made, GSA and the Navy build  support and consensus for the project inside the agency.  FEMP guidance  also suggests agencies meet informally with prequalified ESCOs before  selecting an ESCO for the contract.  The Navy may invite vendors to  participate in oral presentations covering a range of topics, including their  qualifications and past performance with ECMs as well as their technical  approach for projects.  Based on these presentations, the local facility  makes its selection.", "After the contractor has been selected, the project team schedules an initial  meeting, referred to as a \u201ckick-off\u201d meeting, to discuss, among other things,  the scope of an initial energy survey, payback terms and restrictions, O&M  requirements, M&V approaches, and site-specific information.  The  contractor then performs a preliminary site survey, based on a building  walk-through and spot metering as well as an analysis of various data, such  as utility rate structure and energy consumption statistics.  Upon  completion of the energy audit, the contractor submits an initial proposal  that includes a summary of ECMs investigated and cost and savings  estimates.  Based on a review of this initial proposal, the agency decides  whether or not to proceed with the ESPC.  If it decides to go forward, the  agency transmits a letter confirming its intention to award the delivery  order to the ESCO (the Notice of Intent to Award) and issues a delivery  order request for proposal.  It is only after the agency issues the Notice of  Intent to Award that the ESCO\u2019s expenses may be recoverable from the  government.", "The contractor then performs a DES and submits a report that is the basis  for the project\u2019s contractually guaranteed savings, M&V, and O&M.  The  DES is the ESCO\u2019s comprehensive audit of facilities and energy systems at  the project site.  The DES augments, refines, and updates the preliminary  site survey data and provides the information needed to update the  feasibility analyses of the various ECMs under consideration for the  project. The agency\u2019s project team reviews the proposal and submits its  comments to the ESCO.  Based upon these comments, the ESCO develops  a final energy project proposal.  For projects with a cancellation ceiling in  excess of $10 million, the agency must notify Congress of the project no  later than 30 days before the task order award.  After the agency approves  the project and negotiates the price or determines the price to be fair and  reasonable, the project is awarded.", "During the project execution phase, the contractor completes the project  design and then installs the ECMs.  Title of the equipment and systems built  or installed under the delivery order is transferred from the ESCO to the  agency at the time of delivery order award, installation, or contract  closeout.  ESPCs do not involve change orders since contractors  guarantee certain levels of performance and are obligated to make changes  necessary to achieve those levels at their own expense.  However, the  agency and the contractor may modify the delivery order to, for example,  authorize the installation of additional ECMs.  Once the project has been  successfully completed and accepted by the government, payments begin.   Contractors are required to guarantee equipment performance; therefore,  some level of M&V is required to ensure guaranteed performance is  realized.  M&V is performed by the ESCO that installs the equipment.  The  level of M&V is negotiated between the government and the contractor and  must be specified in the signed delivery order.  Agency officials said that  the type of M&V employed depends on the interaction of various factors,  including climate, the people using the facilities, the facilities\u2019 mission, and  the operation of the equipment.  The contractor may also perform the O&M  for the ESPC-installed equipment.  Facilities with in-house expertise may  take on these responsibilities themselves.  As part of the DES, the ESCO  and agency negotiate a responsibility matrix specifying the O&M duties to  be performed by each party.  FEMP guidance calls for negotiating a  responsibility matrix across a comprehensive set of issues, O&M duties  being only one.", "During the term of the contract, an ECM\u2019s energy cost savings are used to  pay the ESCO.  If annual savings resulting from the ESPC exceed annual  contractor payments, agencies other than the DOD and GSA may retain 50  percent of this excess; the other 50 percent must be returned to Treasury.   GSA may deposit all of the excess savings in the Federal Buildings Fund.   As of fiscal year 2004, the Navy may retain 100 percent of its excess funds, a  change from the previous requirement to return one third of the excess  savings to Treasury while retaining the other two thirds.  The Navy is  required to use one half of the retained savings for energy reduction  projects or water conservation activities and the other half for Navy  welfare, morale, and recreation projects, among other things.  An official  responsible for the Navy\u2019s Shore Energy program said that, prior to 2004,  the Navy had not returned funds to Treasury since, to their knowledge,  there were no cases in which actual ESPC savings exceeded those  guaranteed by the contractor.  However, according to other Navy officials,  the Navy\u2019s Comptroller has not issued guidance on the return of savings to  Treasury.  Because the Navy does not maintain a central system to track  savings, it would be difficult to determine whether the actual savings  generated by an ESPC have ever exceeded guaranteed savings.  In other  words, the Navy does not know if it should have paid some portion of its  energy savings to Treasury.", "Implementing M&V strategies is required for ESPCs to verify the  achievement of guaranteed energy cost savings each year.  According to  FEMP, M&V involves three major steps:  baseline definition,  postinstallation verification, and regular-interval verification.  Annual M&V  only needs to show that the overall savings guarantee has been met, not  determine actual savings for each ECM.", "M&V methodologies are grouped into four categories and may vary  depending on the ECM installed.  When choosing among M&V  methodologies, agencies must balance the accuracy of their energy savings  estimates with the costs of verifying those estimates.  For example, where  the performance of the installed equipment is relatively certain, as is the  case for lighting retrofits, it may not be cost effective to measure actual  energy use throughout the term of the contract.  In this case,  postinstallation and baseline energy use is estimated using engineering  calculations or system models.  As long as the potential to perform is  verified, the savings are as originally claimed and do not vary over the  contract term.  Alternatively, for projects with large elements of  uncertainty, such as chillers and chiller plants, contractors might  continually measure the energy use of equipment throughout the contract.   Continuous monitoring may greatly reduce uncertainty that savings are  actually being achieved, but will also cost more than less rigorous methods  of M&V.", "M&V strategies allocate risk between the ESCO and the agency in advance.   Both ESCOs and agencies are reluctant to assume responsibility for factors  they cannot control.  For example, the ESCO generally does not assume  responsibility for risk related to operational factors, such as weather, how  many hours the equipment is used, and maintenance practices.   Alternatively, the agency typically does not assume the responsibility for  risk associated with equipment performance since the ESCO selects,  designs, and installs the equipment.", "If the actual annual savings are less than the annual guaranteed savings  amount, the ESCO must correct or resolve the situation or negotiate a  change in the contract.  For two ESPCs, an annual M&V report identified  performance problems with installed ECMs.  In these cases, the ESCOs  resolved the performance problems by either replacing or installing new  equipment.  Even without the ESPC\u2019s guarantee, the manufacturer\u2019s  warranty would have indemnified the government in at least one of these  cases.  However, according to Navy officials, without the M&V process of  ESPC, the equipment deficiencies might have gone unnoticed during the  equipment warranty period.", "The rest of this appendix contains summaries of our six case studies from  GSA and the Navy.

In  return the Trust hired Energy Systems Group as the developer to (1)  develop, design, equip, construct, operate, and maintain the Energy Center;  (2) engage in sales of energy services to third parties; (3) provide energy- related services including operating and maintaining the VA Medical  Center\u2019s systems for chilled water, electricity, steam, and its respective  distribution systems; and (4) undertake energy savings initiatives at the VA  Medical Center and other VA facilities in the area.

We do not agree that our recommendation needs to be modified to  further consider savings.  We compared acquisition costs for a given set  of ECMs.  Therefore the savings should not vary.  Regardless of how  they are financed, the same given set of ECMs acquired for the same  energy reduction projects should yield the same energy savings. 2. Only by doing a business case analysis can the government ensure that  it selects the best alternative and that taxpayers\u2019 interests are  protected. Life-cycle cost analysis is only one part of a business case  analysis, which includes economic and financial analyses such as cost- benefit and comparative alternative analyses.  We recognize that using  full, up-front appropriations to fund ECMs would likely affect some  other aspect of the budget.  It is not the intent of this report to  discourage or to eliminate energy conservation efforts or partnerships  with the private sector.  However, recognizing the full commitment up- front in the budget enhances transparency and enables decision makers  to make appropriate resource allocation choices among competing  demands that all have their full costs recorded in the budget. One of the  primary purposes of budgeting is to make resource allocation decisions  among competing claims that all have their full costs recorded in the  budget.   3. Measuring opportunity costs requires estimates of how long the delay  in obtaining ECMs would be and the cost of that delay.  To do that, GAO  would have to make an assumption about when obtaining an ECM  would be of sufficiently high priority in comparison to the other  programs for which an agency would request full funding.  Our report  does not address agencies\u2019 resource allocation decisions, but points out  that the decision to acquire ECMs through ESPCs is more expensive  than through timely, full, and up-front appropriations\u2014a point with  which agency officials agreed.  We believe that such an analysis is more  appropriately conducted by agencies as part of the business case  analysis of alternatives. 4. Given our case study approach, our report does not imply a statistical  relevance to any of our case study findings.  We selected case studies  based on their cost and data availability.  The case study result that  DOD questions is a delivery order awarded by GSA.  Because this ESPC  involved new construction, GSA noted that the result of this case would  be unique but interesting; GSA agreed with our selection of cases.  We  note DOD\u2019s comment that these ESPCs usually increase the  government\u2019s costs by 25 to 35 percent.  While this is less than the 56  percent in the GSA case study, it is not an insignificant cost differential. 5. Our report acknowledges that M&V of savings acts as a type of  insurance and that M&V strategies allocate risk between the agency  and the ESCO.  M&V is an explicit cost in ESPCs.  However, agencies  could choose to purchase M&V for ECMs financed through full, up- front appropriations if, after conducting a business case analysis, they  believed it was in the best interest of the government.  With respect to  the savings guarantee, as discussed on p. 29, ESPCs contain  assumptions that determine estimated savings.  If the assumptions are  not correct and savings are not achieved, the agency is still required to  pay the ESCO the agreed-upon savings specified in the contract.   Finally, we clarified that the M&V comparison is to estimated savings. 6. We agree that appropriations are recognized in the budget.  However,  ESPC commitments are not in fact fully recognized up front in the  budget.  OMB has scored the acquisition costs of assets acquired  through ESPCs annually, over time, even though ESPCs represent long- term commitments of the government.  For example, agencies  generally retain control of the assets acquired for the entire life of the  asset.  Also, agencies\u2019 termination liabilities for ESPCs typically  correspond to the outstanding principal balances due to the ESCOs. 7. We did not analyze the validity of DOD\u2019s claims because DOD could  provide no data supporting its claims.  For example, the Navy does not  maintain a central system to track savings.  Therefore, it could not  provide data on the amount of cost savings attributable to the use of  ESPCs.  DOD also did not provide sensitivity analysis reflecting the  opportunity costs of waiting for appropriations.  We did review the one  Oak Ridge National Laboratory cost study recommended to us,  Evaluation of Federal Energy Savings Performance Contracting\u2014 Methodology For Comparing Processes and Costs of ESPC and  Appropriations-Funded Energy Projects (March 2003).  In addition to  our own review of the study, we interviewed the authors of the study  and talked with agency officials about the study\u2019s methodology.  Based  on our analyses we found two major flaws with the study: (1) we agreed  with the study authors that the sample size was too small and was not  applicable to the entire federal sector and (2) the study compares the  costs and savings across various types of ESPCs installed in several  different federal facilities, making it difficult to compare energy savings  because the savings would depend upon too many unpredictable  factors.  Also, as discussed on pages 29 and 30, we did discuss with GSA  and Navy officials their historical funding experiences.  We note that  DOD itself (see comment 4) says that ESPCs increase the cost to the  government by 25 to 35 percent compared to timely, full, and up-front  funding. 8. Our analysis recognizes the value of the technical expertise provided by  ESCOs by assuming that detailed energy surveys would be needed and  purchased under either funding scenario.  We include the cost of this  type of service in our proxy for the amount Congress would have to  appropriate had ECMs been financed through timely, full, and up-front  appropriations.  Further, our report notes that agencies\u2019 heavy reliance  on the ESCOs to recommend, install, and perform M&V to verify results  on their recommended ECMs creates potential conflicts of interest that  require active participation and scrutiny by agencies. 9. See comment 3. 10. See comment 5. 11. This information was taken directly from a FEMP document that FEMP  provided in one of its training courses offered to agencies (Super ESPC  Agency Project Binder, July 2004).  On page 6 of the chapter entitled,  \u201cIntroduction to M&V for DOE Super ESPC Projects\u201d it says, \u201cIn the  event that the stipulated values overstate the savings or reductions in  use decrease the savings, the agency must still pay the ESCO for the  agreed-upon savings.\u201d 12. In our opinion, because large buy-downs indicate the availability of  funds in the first year of the contract, they imply there may have been  opportunities to purchase ECMs in smaller, useable segments, when  technically feasible.  However, because DOD prepared no business case  analysis to determine the viability of this alternative, it cannot be  known whether this would have been cost effective or not.  Business  case analyses are well accepted as a leading practice among public and  private entities.  OMB requires all executive branch agencies to prepare  business case analyses for major investments as part of their budget  submissions to OMB. 13. For our case studies, buy-downs did not always represent an  \u201cextremely small percentage of the overall contract.\u201d  As discussed on  page 39 of the report, three of the six case studies we reviewed  obligated and paid a significant portion of the total cost of the ECMs in  the first year of the contract.  These three case studies used one-time  savings to pay down about 7 percent, 38 percent, and 39 percent of  contract cycle costs.  We believe this shows that opportunities exist to  acquire ECMs in smaller, useful segments when technically feasible.  The other three case studies are not used to support our conclusion  because the up-front payments on these delivery orders stemmed from  federal funding unexpectedly made available to mitigate energy  shortages in California during fiscal year 2000 or because the up-front  payment was minimal.  We are not asserting that these opportunities  exist in every case but we remain of the view that they should be  explored as part of a business case analysis. 14. As stated on pages 35 and 36, we found that GSA and the Navy took an  active role in negotiating case study ESPCs to protect the government\u2019s  interest.  However, the potential for problems has been demonstrated  through numerous Army Audit Agency reports issued over the last  several years on ESPCs awarded by the Army.  These reports stated  that energy savings baselines established by the ESCOs were faulty,  resulting in overpayments to the ESCO.  Accordingly, we believe our  conclusion is both warranted and relevant."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of Energy", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO's comments on the Department of Energy's letter  dated October 25, 2004."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.

Although this report includes our  findings both on ESPCs and partnerships, our analysis of these two  financing mechanisms was prepared separately and considered the  unique circumstances of each case study. 5. Financing asset acquisition through the United States Treasury always  has a lower interest cost than third-party financing.  We looked only at  acquisitions because we recognize that if the need for an asset is short- term, the government would not need to acquire it.  Also, see comment  2. 6.", "In a constrained budget environment, agencies need to prioritize their  projects needing resources and request funds for those of the highest  priority.  The excerpt DOE cites from our 1998 Executive Guide  recognizes\u2014as we do on page 2 of this report\u2014that from an agency\u2019s  point of view the ability to record acquisition costs of a capital asset  over the life of that asset can be very attractive.  However, from the  point of view of the government as a whole, these provisions may  increase costs.  It is the Congress\u2019 role to allocate resources across  agencies.  The same paragraph cited by DOE further states, \u201csome  strategies currently exist at the federal level that allow agencies a  certain amount of flexibility in funding capital projects without a loss of  fiscal control.  These strategies include budgeting for stand-alone  stages\u2026.\u201d 7. Our report does not suggest excluding the status quo from  consideration when agencies evaluate the full range of alternatives in  business case analyses.  Our focus is on acquisition costs and whether  or not alternative financing arrangements increase or decrease the total  cost of capital acquisition.  We do not question agencies\u2019 decisions to  acquire assets and assume that the same assets would be acquired  regardless of how they are financed.   8. DOE and VA officials have stated that lower labor costs and fewer  bureaucratic requirements could make partnership financing overall  less expensive than financing through full, up-front appropriations.   Despite this assertion officials were not able to provide documentation  to support these claims.  DOE contractors did provide a cost-benefit  analyses for the financing arrangement at ORNL; however, it was  inconclusive because the analyses compared private financing versus  receiving federal appropriations over a 10-year period and did not  compare receiving full, up-front appropriations. 9. We commend DOE on drafting a policy that will require a business case  analysis for public/private partnerships. 10. As we have testified and reported in the past, we believe the budget  should reflect the full commitment of the government, considering the  substance of all underlying agreements, when third-party financing is  employed.  According to OMB staff, some of the partnerships we  reviewed may have been scored differently under the revised A-11  guidelines.  However, even given the 2003 revisions, we believe the  scorekeeping rules should continue to be refined to ensure that the full  commitment of the government is considered in the budget.  In its  comments on our draft report, OMB agreed in concept with this  recommendation and stated that reflecting the full commitment of the  government has always been its goal.", "In our conclusions, we discuss agencies\u2019 long-term capital plans as  indicative of their long-term capital requirements and as useful in  determining the substance of underlying agreements to obtain capital.   We recommend that the scorekeepers develop rules that would include  consideration of these plans.  We recognize that ensuring the validity of  such plans may pose implementation challenges such as the need to  validate agencies\u2019 long-term capital requirements. 11. The report has been changed to indicate the partnership was scored  according to OMB\u2019s interpretation. 12. We recognize that DOE did not purchase the three privately financed  buildings at ORNL.  However, the buildings were clearly constructed  for DOE\u2019s benefit and we do not believe it likely DOE would abandon  these state-of-the art buildings to reoccupy the currently dilapidated  buildings. 13. See comments 3 and 10.  We disagree with DOE about whether only the  legal commitment should be reflected in the budget or whether the  underlying substance of the deal should be reflected.   14. As discussed throughout our report, we believe up-front recognition of  the full cost enhances budget transparency.  Further, we believe the  specific standards to be incorporated in any change in scorekeeping  guidelines would most appropriately be established by the  scorekeepers.  Consideration of the substance of all underlying  agreements should be part of any specific standards, as we  recommend. 15. GAO suggests that agencies\u2019 long-term capital plans be considered in  determining the substance of the underlying agreement. 16. We fully understand that the ORNL transactions were deliberately  structured to be considered operating leases.  As is clear from DOE\u2019s  earlier comments, we simply disagree with DOE about whether only  the legal commitment should be reflected in the budget or the  underlying substance of the deal.  During our review DOE and UT- Battelle, LLC, officials reviewed and agreed with our description of the  ORNL transaction included as figure 12, \u201cPartnerships and Financing of  ORNL\u2019s Revitalization.\u201d 17. Standard and Poor\u2019s A+ bond rating analysis explicitly discussed \u201ca  strong lease revenue stream\u201d from DOE for a period up to 25 years and  that the trustee would have a valid security interest in the rent stream.\u201d    Therefore, the private sector clearly viewed this as a long-term  commitment by DOE. 18. See comment 16.  Also, neither DOE nor its contractors provided GAO  with documentation to support its assertion that reserve funds were  established by the private sector Bond Trustee to cover any shortfall in  rent beyond the 1-year period in the event of termination.  Additionally,  Standard and Poor\u2019s bond rating did not state reserve funds were  established to cover any shortfall in rent beyond the 1-year period in  the event of termination.  Rather, it cites a \u201cdebt service reserve fund  equal to one month\u2019s base rent.\u201d   19. See comments 14 and 15. 20. Our report did not seek to analyze ESPCs from a traditional  government contracts perspective.  Our report does analyze ESPCs and  partnerships from a budget scorekeeping perspective.  Also, see  comment 3. 21. Whether or not Standard and Poor\u2019s was correct in citing that DOE had  pledged a lease revenue stream as security for the payment of the  bonds, such a statement could have affected bond investors\u2019 decisions  to purchase.  Furthermore, clearly the private sector considered the  substance of the underlying agreements in making this assessment.  We  have clarified in figure 7 that the Development Corporation arranged  for the private financing which, as shown in figure 12, was secured by  Keenan Development Associates of TN, LLC, through Banc of America. 22. All of our six ESPC case studies paid more to obtain energy  conservation measures through ESPCs than they would have paid  through full, up-front appropriations.  Given FEMP\u2019s assertions that 18  federal agencies and departments have implemented ESPC projects  worth $1.7 billion, we believe that \u201cno cost to federal customers\u201d is a  misnomer.  Furthermore, agencies do acquire assets through ESPCs.   As stated in FEMP guidance, ownership of the asset usually transfers  from the ESCO to the agency when the equipment has been installed  and accepted and after initial confirmation of the guaranteed savings.   Nonetheless, given recent congressional action to extend ESPC  authority through fiscal year 2006, we have revised our draft such that  ESPCs have been deleted from the first recommendation.  Instead, we  have suggested that Congress should consider requiring agencies that  use ESPCs to present to Congress an analysis comparing total contract  cycle costs of ESPCs entered into during the fiscal year with estimated  up-front funding costs for the same ECMs.   23. Given the mandates to reduce energy consumption, we do not believe  the ability of the government to invest in needed capital improvements  would be crippled by the requirement to recognize costs up front in the  budget.  Congress can decide what constitutes priority claims on  resources.  Also see comment 3 and 22. 24. We acknowledge that waiting for funds to be appropriated may result in  opportunity costs.  However, DOE did not provide sufficient  documentation to support its assertion that waiting for appropriations  before proceeding with the ESPC process will cause serious, costly, and  irreparable harm to federal energy and infrastructure goals.  As stated  in our report, we recommend to the heads of case study agencies,  including DOE, that business case analyses be performed and that the  full range of funding alternatives be analyzed.  Such an analysis could  include the effect of not obtaining timely appropriations. 25. Our report does not state that DOE acquired any of the assets that were  the subject of the Oak Ridge transaction, nor did our analyses look at  UT-Battelle\u2019s modernization program implemented through the State of  Tennessee. Rather our report states that DOE used existing law to  structure a partnership that enabled it to obtain the long-term use of  facilities that was arranged through private financing. 26. Our report takes a broad definition of partnerships.  Also, we  specifically identified the transactions at Oak Ridge National  Laboratory as an example of a public/private partnership in our report,  Budget Issues: Alternative Approaches to Finance Federal Capital,  GAO-03-1011 (Washington, D.C.: Aug. 21, 2003), pages 5, 48, and 52-53. 27. We clarified our report to remove any implication that the 75 percent  criteria for operating leases was violated.   28. We disagree.  Our draft report states the financing approaches used in  many of the case studies were structured to include features that do not  require up-front budget recognition even though they established long- term commitments of the government.  As stated in our report, UTBDC  implemented subleases of three facilities to UT-Battelle, LLC, for DOE\u2019s  ultimate use, each with a lease term of up to 25 years.   29. According to a UT-Battelle, LLC, official, UTBDC was created for the  purpose of securing private financing.  Thus, our report does assert that  the ORNL transaction was undertaken to obtain private financing.  We  do not see this as inconsistent with DOE\u2019s comment that the  \u201ctransaction was undertaken\u2026as a means by which DOE could obtain  something of value to it\u2014the use of a new building.\u201d 30. References to DOE legal opinions in our draft are based on  documentation given to us by the DOE Chief Counsel in Oak Ridge  based on the relevance to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory  public/private partnership.  All statements in our report are within the  context of how the citations were written.  We clarified the author of  the legal opinion and the subject of the memo.   31. Our report does not say that a conflict of interest and potential for  fraud or wrongdoing existed in the Oak Ridge National Laboratory  partnership.  Rather, our report states that partnerships require  monitoring because of the complicated relationships involved.   32. Our report states we used a case study approach and notes that this  does not allow us to generalize our findings across the government.  To  analyze ESPC costs, we reviewed the delivery orders, given to us by  GSA and the Navy, for each of our six ESPC case studies.  In the course  of our audit work we reviewed the ORNL study (Oak Ridge National  Laboratory, Evaluation of Federal Energy Savings Performance  Contracting-Methodology For Comparing Processes and Costs of  ESPC and Appropriations-Funded Energy Projects, March 2003),  interviewed the authors of the study, and talked with agency officials  about the study\u2019s methodology.  Based on our analyses we found two  major flaws in the study:  (1) as agreed with the study authors the  sample size was too small and was not applicable to the entire federal  sector and (2) the study compares the costs and savings across various  types of ESPCs installed in several different federal facilities, making it  difficult to compare energy savings because the savings would depend  upon too many unpredictable factors.  Also, as discussed on page 30,  we did discuss with GSA and Navy officials their historical funding  experiences. 33. It is the executive branch\u2019s long-standing position that the levels of  internal executive branch funding requests are predecisional  deliberative documents and therefore unavailable to us. 34. We acknowledge in our report that officials we spoke with said they  believed M&V results in higher sustained savings.  In this report, we  take no position on whether M&V should be purchased, but agency  officials said that measurement and verification is an expense that  would not be incurred if the energy conservation measures were  acquired through full, up-front appropriations.  Additionally,  representatives from energy service companies said that their private  sector clients do not always purchase M&V and verification, and if they  do, it is for a shorter period than contracts secured by the government.   The lack of M&V being purchased in the private sector suggests it is  worth exploring whether the amount of M&V purchased is a necessary  expense for the government to incur whether the project is directly  funded or obtained with an ESPC. 35. We include M&V in ESPCs costs because they are a required  component of ESPCs to demonstrate that annual savings generated by  ECMs meet or exceed contract payments.  However, we exclude M&V  from our proxy estimate of the cost if the ECMs were acquired through  timely, full, and up-front appropriations because agency officials told us  that M&V is an expense that would not be incurred if the ECMs were  acquired through timely, full, and up-front appropriations.  See also  comment 34. 36. While it may be that ESPCs do not result in an increase in agencies\u2019  utility bills, the ECMs acquired by all of our six ESPC case studies were  more expensive than if ECMs had been acquired through timely, full,  up-front appropriations.  Thus, we do not consider ESPCs to be budget  neutral over the long-term. 37. Our analyses were based on data obtained from final awarded delivery  orders from case study contract files given to us by the Navy and GSA  and was reviewed as part of technical comments on the appendixes by  both the Navy and GSA. 38. It is unclear to us how DOE derived the \u201cmaximum possible percent  increase (PV) financed through ESPCs over cost if direct funded.\u201d   Using the data contained in the case studies\u2019 delivery orders, we  attempted to replicate DOE\u2019s \u201cbest case assumptions\u201d by subtracting  M&V costs out of the comparison.  We found that M&V represented a  relatively small percentage of the ESPC contract cycle costs and thus  did not significantly affect the increase in the costs attributed to ESPC  financing versus timely, full, and up-front appropriations.  For example,  in the case of the federal courthouse in Gulfport, Mississippi, removing  M&V costs from the comparison caused the percentage difference to  decline from 56 percent to 51 percent, not to 26 percent as DOE  suggests.  The 51 percent difference reflects interest costs that GSA  must pay to the ESCO over the course of the contract. 39. Funds for ESPCs are obligated on an annual basis; therefore, the  budget does not recognize the government\u2019s full long-term commitment  up front, when the decisions are made.   40. Since we used the delivery order to derive our proxy estimate, any  avoided costs that were counted as a saving in that delivery were also  counted as a saving in our proxy estimate.  Our analysis assumes  agencies acquire the same assets and avoid the same costs regardless  of funding approach.  Also, the savings from the avoided costs were  used to make up-front payments in the contracts. 41. We do not contest agencies\u2019 use of simplified assumptions in M&V  strategies.  Rather, our concern is focused on the statement contained  in FEMP\u2019s July 2004 Super ESPC Agency Project Binder.  On page 6 of  the chapter entitled, \u201cIntroduction to M&V for Super ESPC Projects\u201d it  says, \u201cIn the event that the stipulated values overstate the savings or  reductions in use decrease the savings, the agency must still pay the  ESCO for the agreed-upon savings.\u201d  It does not discuss other remedies  against the ESCO nor does DOE\u2019s comment elaborate on what these  remedies might include. 42. Our report acknowledges agencies\u2019 past experiences on page 33.  Also  see comment 32.  43. Large buy-downs indicate the availability of funds in the first year of the  contract and so imply opportunities exist to acquire ECMs in smaller,  useful segments, when technically feasible, with full, up-front  appropriations instead of through ESPCs.  Navy and GSA officials  indicated to us that they typically did not consider financing ECMs  through useful segments before deciding to use ESPCs.  Moreover, we  did not include the up-front payments made by Navy Region Southwest  or Naval Submarine Base Bangor in this statement because these  payments were made from an unexpected federal appropriation, which  will not likely occur again. 44. As stated in our draft report agencies did not request full, up-front  appropriations for the case studies reviewed in our report.  Thus, it  cannot be known how much might have been needed to develop  surveys and studies to define projects in order to request direct  appropriations.  Business case analyses are well accepted as a leading  practice among public and private entities.  OMB requires all executive  branch agencies to prepare business case analyses for major  investments as part of their budget submissions to OMB.  Also see  comment 32. 45.

While we recognize GSA\u2019s current procedures to perform life-cycle cost  analyses as part of its ESPC evaluation process, life-cycle costing is  only one aspect of a business case analysis.  Both OMB\u2019s guidance and  our Executive Guide to Leading Practices in Capital Decision- Making stress the importance of alternatives analysis as another  component of building a business case.  Such an analysis would  consider the full range of funding alternatives.  GSA does not analyze  the full range of funding alternatives and therefore has an incomplete  business case analysis. 2. We asked GSA staff in Atlanta whether GSA had requested  appropriations for any of the case study ESPC projects we reviewed  and were told that the field office had not submitted a request to  headquarters because, given the $6 billion backlog of repairs and  alterations needed, the field office considered it unlikely that such  funding would be approved.  At headquarters, GSA budget officials told  us that they do not specifically request funds up-front for ECMs  because they are financed over time through ESPCs.   3. We recognize that it is not always possible to undertake energy  conservation measures as stand-alone projects.  Accordingly, our  recommendation asks that the technical feasibility of useful segments  be considered when making capital financing decisions.  We commend  GSA\u2019s decision to revise its energy conservation project evaluation  process to include consideration of useful segments. 4. We agree that ESPC delivery orders are written to specify that project  savings meet or exceed financed costs.  However, the ancillary up-front  costs also are specifically included in the contract and thus are a part of  total contract cycle costs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO's comments on the Veterans Affair's letter dated  October 25, 2004."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. Given recent congressional action to extend ESPC authority through  fiscal year 2006, we have revised our draft to recommend that OMB  require, and suggest that Congress should consider requiring agencies  that use ESPCs to present to Congress an analysis comparing total  contract cycle costs of ESPCs entered into during the fiscal year with  estimated up-front funding costs for the same ECMs.", "We have better emphasized and clarified in the report that OMB  updated and revised its instructions in 2003 to address lease-backs  from public/private partnerships.  According to OMB staff, some of the  partnerships we reviewed may have been scored differently under the  revised guidelines.  However, we still believe the scorekeeping rules  should continue to be refined to ensure that the full commitment of the  government is considered in the budget. 2. We have added language to clarify further that our report looked at the  government\u2019s cost of acquiring assets.  Evaluating the benefits of the  assets was not one of our objectives.  We assume that the same assets  would be acquired regardless of how they are financed and thus they  would have identical benefits and operating costs.  Given our  objectives, focusing our analysis on the government\u2019s cost of financing  the assets\u2019 acquisition was the appropriate approach for this report.   Recognizing costs up front does not prohibit discussion of future  benefits when requesting appropriations.   3. The statement that ESPC commitments are not fully recognized up- front in the budget does not refer to VA\u2019s enhanced use leases.  Further,  although congressional notification is an important and valuable  process, it does not constitute recognition in the budget.   4. Our report does not state that VA or other agencies included in our  review have deliberately hidden budgetary information from Congress.   Nor do we dispute that Congress has continued to encourage VA\u2019s use  of enhanced-use leasing.  Clearly, enhanced-use leases were explicitly  authorized by law.  Rather, when these leases are structured such that  developed property is leased-back in short-term increments, OMB\u2019s  interpretation of the budget scoring rules permitted only the short-term  costs associated with these assets to be scored in the budget.  Finally,  with respect to prior requests for appropriated funds, VA officials  explained to us that while requests had been submitted for regional  offices, requests had not been submitted for the Atlanta regional office  or other case studies in our review. 5. The lease-back agreements we reviewed had features that indicated a  long-term commitment by the government.  They were structured such  that the government\u2019s legal commitment was confined to short-term  periods.  Accordingly, OMB\u2019s interpretation of the budget scorekeeping  rules required that only these short-term costs to be recognized up- front in the budget.  However, recording only the 2-year legal  commitment understates the likely longer term costs of the  government.  For example, prior to the enhanced-use lease used to  develop a collocated regional office in Atlanta, the regional office had  occupied offices in that area for over 25 years.  While it is certainly  possible that VA may choose to discontinue operations in the Atlanta  area, in our opinion reflecting zero cost beyond the 2-year legal  commitment overstates the chances of this occurring."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact person named above, Carol Henn, Maria  Edelstein, Sandra Beattie, Dewi Djunaidy, Scott Farrow, Hannah Laufe,  David Nicholson, and Adam Shapiro also made significant contributions to  this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": ["The Government Accountability Office, the audit, evaluation and  investigative arm of Congress, exists to support Congress in meeting its  constitutional responsibilities and to help improve the performance and  accountability of the federal government for the American people.
