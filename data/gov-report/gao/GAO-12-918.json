For this report, GAO assessed (1) the planned cost and schedule of the Coast Guard's portfolio of major acquisitions; (2) the steps the Coast Guard has recently taken to develop an affordable portfolio through its requirements process; and (3) the extent to which the Coast Guard is using cross-directorate teams to provide oversight and inform acquisition decisions.

The Coast Guard's approved baselines, which reflect cost and schedule estimates, indicate the estimated total acquisition cost of Coast Guard major acquisitions could be as much as $35.3 billion--an increase of approximately 41 percent over the original baselines. However, the approved baselines for 10 of 16 programs do not reflect current cost and schedule plans because programs have breached the cost or schedule estimates in those baselines, changed in scope, or do not expect to receive funding to execute baselines as planned. Furthermore, a continued mismatch between resources needed to support all approved baselines and expected funding levels has required the Coast Guard to make decisions about which programs to fund and which programs not to fund as part of its annual budget process. Both DHS and the Coast Guard have acknowledged this resource challenge, but efforts to address this challenge have not yet resulted in a clear strategy for moving forward.", "The Coast Guard has taken steps through its requirements process--a process that takes mission needs and converts them to specific capabilities--to address affordability, but additional efforts are required. For example, in an effort to consider affordability, the Coast Guard made some capability trade-offs when developing requirements for its largest acquisition, the Offshore Patrol Cutter. But whether the cutter ultimately will be affordable depends on some key assumptions in the cost estimate that are subject to change. At the fleet level, the Coast Guard completed two efforts to reassess what mix of assets it requires to meet mission needs, but neither effort used realistic fiscal constraints or considered reducing the number of assets being pursued. The mix of assets the Coast Guard is acquiring is based upon needs identified in 2005, but the Coast Guard may not be on a path to meet these needs and it has not re-examined the portfolio in light of affordability.", "The Coast Guard has established an acquisition governance framework that includes the following cross-directorate teams: the Executive Oversight Council, the Systems Integration Team, and Resource Councils. The Executive Oversight Council--composed of admirals and senior executives--is well-positioned to delegate tasks to the other teams or obtain information as needed to assist in managing acquisitions. This Council has been active in meeting to discuss individual acquisitions; however, it has not met to discuss the portfolio as a whole. Coast Guard officials told us it manages portfolio affordability through the budget process. GAO's best practices work has found that successful commercial companies assess product investments collectively from an enterprise level, rather than as independent and unrelated initiatives. The Coast Guard's current approach of relying on the annual budget process to manage portfolio affordability involves immediate trade-offs but does not provide the best environment to make decisions to develop a balanced long-term portfolio."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Commandant of the Coast Guard conduct a comprehensive portfolio review to develop revised acquisition program baselines and identify the Executive Oversight Council as the governing body to oversee acquisitions with a portfolio management approach to help ensure the Coast Guard acquires a balanced mix of assets.

Many of these  studies have primarily focused on the assets that were part of the  Deepwater program, commonly referred to by the Coast Guard as the  program of record:    In September 2003, the Coast Guard completed a performance gap  analysis that determined the Deepwater fleet would have significant  capability gaps in meeting emerging mission requirements following  the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Due to fiscal constraints,  the Coast Guard decided not to make any significant changes to the  planned Deepwater fleet, but did approve several asset capability  changes that were reflected in the 2005 Mission Need Statement,  which outlines capabilities the Coast Guard needs to meet its mission  demands.  In December 2009, the capabilities directorate completed a fleet mix  analysis which was intended to be a fundamental reassessment of the  capabilities and mix of assets the Coast Guard needs to fulfill its  Deepwater mission.   In May 2011, the capabilities directorate completed a second fleet mix  analysis which primarily assessed the rate at which the Coast Guard  could acquire the program of record within a range of cost constraints.

According to the Major  Systems Acquisition Manual, the acquisition program baseline provides a  critical reference point for measuring and reporting the status of program  implementation and revised baselines should be submitted to DHS within  90 days after reporting a breach. Coast Guard officials acknowledged that  the approved baselines do not reflect the status of many programs, but  stated the update process is lengthy and sometimes interrupted by  decisions made in the budget process each year. For example, the  National Security Cutter program office formally notified DHS of a cost  and schedule breach in November 2011 and program officials told us that  Coast Guard leadership is reviewing a draft baseline. However, officials  stated that the draft baseline may no longer be valid because it was  based on a funding profile that was changed in the fiscal year 2013-2017  capital investment plan submitted to Congress, triggering the need to  update the baseline once again. Likewise, in response to our request for current cost estimates and schedules for each program, senior resource  directorate officials told us that current estimates were not available for  release because they did not know how they would be affected by future  funding allocations.", "Without a stable funding profile, program managers will likely always be  at a disadvantage as they must frequently update baselines based on the  budget rather than having a stable budget reflecting program baselines.  Furthermore, our prior Department of Defense (DOD) work has found that  balancing investments late in the budget process often leads to additional  churn in programs, such as increased costs and schedule delays, and  encumbers efforts to meet strategic objectives. We made a  recommendation in July 2011 that the Coast Guard adopt action items  found in the acquisition directorate\u2019s October 2010 Blueprint for  Continuous Improvement (Blueprint) such as promoting stability in the  capital investment plan by measuring the percentage of projects stably  funded year to year in the plan, ensuring acquisition program baseline  alignment with the capital investment plan by measuring the percentage  of projects where the acquisition program baselines fit into the capital  investment plan, and establishing project priorities as a Coast Guard-wide  goal. By promoting stability in the capital investment plan, the Coast  Guard may be able to address the churn in the acquisition program  budgeting process and help ensure that programs receive and can plan to  a more predictable funding stream. DHS concurred, but has not yet fully  implemented this recommendation. Coast Guard officials told us that the  acquisition directorate did develop a metric to measure the percentage of  programs stably funded from year to year, which confirmed wide  fluctuations in funding for most programs from year to year. However, it is  unclear whether the Coast Guard will pursue the remaining action items.", "While Coast Guard officials acknowledged that baselines for many of its  major acquisitions do not reflect the current status of the programs, even  using the approved program baselines as of July 2012 and total program  cost for programs with no planned funding beyond fiscal year 2014, the  estimated total acquisition cost of Coast Guard major acquisitions could  be as much as $35.3 billion. This is about $10 billion more than original  baselines which totaled $25.1 billion and represents an increase of  approximately 41 percent. Figure 3 compares each major acquisition  asset\u2019s cost from the original program baseline with the latest revised  baselines that have been approved by the Coast Guard, if available. For  those programs with no planned funding beyond fiscal year 2014, figure 4  compares the original baseline with estimated total program cost based  on budget data.", "As we have previously reported, the cost increases associated with many  of these revised baselines reflect the Coast Guard\u2019s and DHS\u2019s efforts to  better understand the acquisition costs of individual assets that formerly  made up the Deepwater program, as well as provide insight into the  drivers of cost growth. For example, the Coast Guard has attributed the  more than $1 billion rise in the Fast Response Cutter\u2019s cost to a reflection  of actual contract cost from the September 2008 contract award and  costs for shore facilities and initial spare parts not included in the original  baseline. Another example of the Coast Guard gaining more insight into  the cost of individual assets is the Offshore Patrol Cutter program. The  initial Deepwater baseline included an $8 billion estimate for the Offshore  Patrol Cutter program. However, program officials stated they did not  have good data for how the lead systems integrator for the Deepwater  program generated the original estimate, and that the current estimate  approved by DHS in April 2012\u2014with a threshold of approximately $12  billion\u2014is higher likely because the original estimate was developed  before the program requirements were established. Program officials also  cited delays in the program, and the corresponding inflation associated  with those delays, as additional reasons for the cost increase. Even  though the Coast Guard used the original 2007 Deepwater Baseline  estimate of $8 billion to characterize the expected cost of the program  multiple times to Congress, it now characterizes the revised acquisition  program baseline as the initial cost estimate for the program.", "Without baselines that reflect current cost and schedule, DHS and the  Coast Guard will not have adequate information to determine if the Coast  Guard can afford other major acquisition programs that are expected to  begin within the next few years. The Coast Guard is in the early stages of  planning for several new acquisitions including icebreakers, river buoy  tenders, and a biometrics-enabled identity program. In addition, officials  at the Coast Guard\u2019s Aviation Logistics Center told us they recently  identified that the end of service life for the HH-60s and HH-65s could be  reached as early as the 2022 time frame\u2014not the 2027 time frame as  originally planned. Officials added that this will require the Coast Guard to  either buy new HH-60s and HH-65s or conduct a service life extension\u2014 previous service life extensions have been funded with acquisition dollars.  Coast Guard officials told us that additional research is being conducted  regarding the life expectancy of these helicopters, including using  forecasting models to update service life limits. Regardless, officials also  stated that the Coast Guard plans to maintain continuous operational  capability. Furthermore, we recently reported that the medium endurance  cutters may also need a service life extension program to limit operational  gaps until the Offshore Patrol Cutters are in service. Given that the  Coast Guard does not have adequate information concerning the cost of  its current portfolio, it is not well positioned to accurately assess the  affordability of these programs as requirements are developed for these  new assets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Upcoming Budget Decisions Will Likely Have Portfolio-wide Implications", "paragraphs": ["The mismatch we reported in July 2011 between resources needed to  support all approved program baselines and expected funding levels  continues to affect the Coast Guard, requiring it to make decisions about  which programs to fund and which programs not to fund as part of the  annual budget formulation process. For example, in the fiscal year 2013  budget request, the following major acquisition programs were funded at  a level lower than identified in the programs\u2019 life cycle cost estimates for  that year: Maritime Patrol Aircraft, Fast Response Cutter, HC-130J/H, and  C4ISR. Combined, the Coast Guard requested approximately $500  million less than what was identified in the life cycle cost estimates for  these programs. The funding needs for these programs have not gone  away and the Coast Guard will have to fund those activities in future fiscal  years.", "Both DHS and the Coast Guard have acknowledged this resource  challenge, but efforts to address these challenges have not resulted in a  clear strategy for moving forward. For example, in an April 2011  acquisition decision memorandum concerning Coast Guard acquisition  program breaches, DHS stated that future breaches in Coast Guard  programs would almost be inevitable as funding resources diminish. DHS  also directed the Coast Guard to develop a plan for showing program  tradeoffs that illuminates the balance between operational commitments,  recapitalization, and the realities of the capital investment plan. Following  the Coast Guard\u2019s presentation of the plan to DHS, DHS issued a second  acquisition decision memorandum in August 2011 which stated the Coast  Guard presented a global, systematic, and overarching solution to future  funding shortfalls that addressed programmatic, resource, and  operational impacts. However, a senior DHS official involved with this  review told us that the presentation only brought to light the challenges,  and did not present a solution. The briefing slides provided to us were  redacted due to the Coast Guard\u2019s belief that they contained budget  negotiation information so we were unable to reconcile whether a solution  was presented. Coast Guard officials stated they had no other examples  of a similar portfolio-wide review to address future funding shortfalls.  Without a portfolio analysis to establish long-term priorities to guide the  budget process, it will be difficult for Coast Guard to address this  mismatch of funding and understand how decisions concerning one  program affect another program.", "Some of the resource challenges in near-term years could be alleviated if  the Coast Guard executed its fiscal year 2013-2017 capital investment  plan. For example, this plan does not include funding for National Security  Cutter 7 in fiscal year 2014 or National Security Cutter 8 in fiscal year  2015, as was the plan in previous years. However, resource and  acquisition directorate officials told us that the Coast Guard continues to  support a program of record of eight National Security Cutters. A senior  Coast Guard acquisition official added that the Coast Guard has an  urgent need for the last two cutters and not buying these two ships would  require major adjustments to other acquisition plans. However, as seen in  figure 5, if the Coast Guard chooses to pursue National Security Cutter 7  in fiscal year 2014 and National Security Cutter 8 in fiscal year 2015,  there will be a significant mismatch in funding required based on life cycle  cost estimates versus expected funding levels in the fiscal year 2013- 2017 capital investment plan\u2014especially given that some of the activities  not funded in fiscal year 2013 are expected to be funded in subsequent  years.", "If National Security Cutters 7 and 8 are included in future budgets,  decision makers will likely be faced with a difficult choice: pull funds from  other high-priority federal programs to support Coast Guard acquisitions  or accept that some capabilities the Coast Guard promised will have to be  deferred to later years. However, deferring costs could lead to what is  commonly characterized as a bow-wave\u2014or an impending spike in the  requirement for additional funds\u2014unless the Coast Guard proactively  chooses to make some tradeoff decisions by re-examining requirements.", "Coast Guard acquisition officials told us that one way it is trying to  address portfolio affordability is through an update to its Major Systems  Acquisition Manual.

However, the Coast Guard has struggled to  supply its assets with the bandwidth necessary to support information- based operations. Further, as we previously reported, the Unmanned  Aerial Systems were envisioned as a key component of the Deepwater  system that would enhance surveillance capability on board the National  Security Cutter and Offshore Patrol Cutter and also from land. Congress  has appropriated over $100 million since 2003 to develop an Unmanned  Aerial System, but the Coast Guard terminated the program due to cost  increases and technical risks in June 2007. According to Coast Guard  officials, the Coast Guard established a partnership with the Navy\u2019s Fire  Scout program in October 2008 and has developed plans to install a  system that will facilitate a future demonstration of the Fire Scout on the  National Security Cutter. As an interim solution, the Coast Guard has  proposed a non-major acquisition to purchase a smaller, less capable,  and less costly unmanned aerial vehicle. In August 2012, the Coast  Guard held a technical demonstration on board the National Security  Cutter that experimented with a possible Navy solution, called the Scan  Eagle, which may satisfy the Coast Guard\u2019s need for a smaller, less  capable unmanned aerial vehicle. The Coast Guard currently has plans  for a more in-depth demonstration in fiscal year 2013.", "Due to these capability shortfalls, the Coast Guard is at risk of purchasing  a fleet that will not be able to close all of the gaps identified following the  September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks or fully conduct operations in a  presence-based manner. While the 2005 Mission Need Statement  presented a business case for the Coast Guard\u2019s future investments, the  Coast Guard has not re-examined the value of these assets in light of the  difficult affordability decisions likely to come. By continuing to pursue  some capabilities and not others without reevaluating the portfolio as a  whole, the Coast Guard is increasing the risk that it may not accomplish  the goals envisioned in 2005 and cannot ensure it is maximizing the value  of the assets it is buying."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coast Guard Took Positive Steps to Improve Requirements Development and Consider Affordability for the Offshore Patrol Cutter", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard took some steps to improve the requirements  development process for the Offshore Patrol Cutter\u2014the largest  acquisition in DHS\u2019s acquisitions portfolio and, according to officials, the  first acquisition in the Deepwater surface fleet in which the Coast Guard  had complete control over the requirements development process. The  Coast Guard undertook studies and analysis that, in part, considered the  measurability and testability as required by guidance of the following four  key performance parameters: operating range, operational sustainment  and crew, speed, and patrol endurance. For example, the range  requirement, which is the distance the cutter can travel between refueling,  is clearly stated as a minimum acceptable requirement of 8,500 nautical  miles at a constant speed of 14 knots to a maximum level of 9,500  nautical miles. Although cutters typically transit at various speeds over the  course of a patrol, the Coast Guard conducted analysis to determine that  the 14 knots speed at the minimum and maximum ranges would provide  enough days between refueling given the percentage of time that the  Coast Guard normally operates at certain speeds. By developing a  measurable range requirement, the Coast Guard helped to promote a  clear understanding of Offshore Patrol Cutter performance by potential  shipbuilders and sought to balance the cost of additional range with the  value that it provides. Furthermore, officials at the independent test  authority\u2014the Navy\u2019s Commander Operational Test and Evaluation  Force\u2014told us that they have been actively involved through the  requirements development process and many of their questions regarding  testability have been resolved.", "Two other key performance parameters\u2014seakeeping and  interoperability\u2014are not as consistent with the Coast Guard\u2019s guidelines  of measurability and testability as identified in the Major Systems  Acquisition Manual. For example the seakeeping key performance  parameter described in the requirements document states that the  Offshore Patrol Cutter shall be able to launch small boats and helicopters  in 8.2- to 13.1-foot waves. However, in the specifications document,  which is used to translate the requirements document into a level of detail  from which contractors can develop a reasonably priced proposal, the  Coast Guard states that the Offshore Patrol Cutter shall be able to launch  small boats and helicopters in no more than 10.7 foot waves while  transiting in a direction that minimizes the pitch and roll of the vessel\u2014an  important detail not specified in the requirements document. Further, the  interoperability key performance parameter states that the Coast Guard  must be able to exchange voice, video, and data with the Department of  Defense and Homeland Security agencies. However, it does not list  specific external partners or substantial details regarding the systems  required to exchange data and the types and size of these data that could  be examples of measurability and testability. This key performance  parameter does not make this distinction between parts of the military that  the Coast Guard operates with most often, such as the U.S. Navy and the  intelligence community, and simply requires interoperability with all of  DOD. Similarly, the interoperability key performance parameter does not  specify the DHS agencies for which the Coast Guard must exchange data  with, which makes this parameter difficult to test. Coast Guard\u2019s  independent testing officials agreed that this key performance parameter,  as currently written, is not testable in a meaningful way and stated that  there are ongoing efforts to improve the clarity of this requirement.", "During the requirements development process for the Offshore Patrol  Cutter, the Coast Guard also made some decisions with respect to  affordability. The following are examples where the Coast Guard made  capability trades that are expected to help lower the program\u2019s acquisition  cost:", "Speed\u2014after a series of analyses, the Coast Guard decided to  reduce the minimum acceptable speed from 25 to 22 knots thereby,  according to officials, potentially eliminating the need for two diesel  engines. According to a study completed by the Coast Guard, this  trade could reduce the acquisition cost of each cutter by $10 million.", "Stern Launch\u2014the Coast Guard removed the stern launch ramp  capability from the Offshore Patrol Cutter design. While this trade-off  may inhibit the launch and recovery of small boats in certain  conditions, such as substantial roll or side-to-side movement of the  vessel, Coast Guard officials stated that it will reduce the cost of the  cutter because a stern launch ramp requires the cutter to be heavier,  thus adding cost.", "C4ISR\u2014the Coast Guard eliminated a minimum requirement for an  integrated C4ISR system and instead is requiring a system built with  interfaces to communicate between different software programs.  According to Coast Guard officials, the Coast Guard now plans to use  a Coast Guard-developed software system\u2014Seawatch\u2014rather than  the more costly lead systems integrator-developed software system  currently installed on the National Security Cutter, even though this  system does not provide the Coast Guard with the capability to  exchange near real-time battle data with DOD assets.", "The improvements and affordability decisions that the Coast Guard has  made in its requirements development process for the Offshore Patrol  Cutter are even more evident when compared with the process for  generating requirements for its other major cutter\u2014the National Security  Cutter. Due to the nature of the lead systems integrator strategy that the  Coast Guard initially used to buy the National Security Cutter, Integrated  Coast Guard Systems developed the requirements, designed, and began  producing the National Security Cutter before the requirements document  was completed. The Coast Guard did not have an operational  requirements document at the time the Coast Guard awarded the  construction contract for the first cutter in 2004, but the Coast Guard  documented the requirements in 2006. Further, even as the third National  Security Cutter was in production, Coast Guard was refining the  requirements and, in January 2010, made the decision to clarify some key  performance parameters such as anti-terrorism/force protection and  underwater mine detection because the existing requirements were not  testable. To further remedy the lack of clear requirements, Coast Guard  officials stated that they are currently developing a second version of the  requirements document that improves the specificity and definition of  many of the National Security Cutter\u2019s requirements and will be used as  criteria during operational testing. To date, the Coast Guard has not  reduced the National Security Cutter\u2019s capability for the purpose of  affordability as it has done for the Offshore Patrol Cutter. However,  according to Coast Guard officials, there is a revised acquisition program  baseline under review which will reflect an ongoing effort to lower the  acquisition cost of the vessel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Cutter Requirements and Missions Have Similarities, but Costs Vary Greatly and Concerns Remain about Affordability", "paragraphs": ["The requirements and missions for the National Security Cutter and the  Offshore Patrol Cutter programs have similarities, but the actual cost for  one National Security Cutter compared to the estimated cost of one  Offshore Patrol Cutter varies greatly. Even though the Coast Guard took  steps to consider affordability while developing the requirements for the  Offshore Patrol Cutter, those affordability decisions do not explain the  magnitude in the difference between these two costs. Table 3 compares  the expected performance of a National Security Cutter with the  objective/threshold requirements of an Offshore Patrol Cutter, the  missions each cutter is expected to perform, and the actual/estimated  costs for each cutter.", "This comparison raises questions whether the Offshore Patrol Cutter  could be a less expensive, viable substitute for the National Security  Cutter or whether there are assumptions built into the Offshore Patrol  Cutter cost estimate, not related to requirements, which are driving the  estimated costs down. With respect to the first, DHS, motivated by  concerns about the affordability of the National Security Cutter program,  completed a Cutter Study in August 2011 which included an analysis to  examine the feasibility of varying the combination of objective\u2014or optimal  performing\u2014Offshore Patrol Cutters and National Security Cutters in the  program of record. Through this analysis, DHS found that defense  operations is a key factor in determining the quantity of National Security  Cutters needed and that the Coast Guard only needs 3.5 National  Security Cutters per year to fully satisfy the planned requirement for  defense-related missions. DHS concluded that with six National Security  Cutters the Coast Guard can meet its goals for defense operations and  mitigate some of the near-term capacity loss of the five National Security  Cutter fleet modeled in the Cutter Study. DHS Program Analysis and  Evaluation officials stated that this, in conjunction with other information,  helped to inform the decision to not include the last two National Security  Cutter hulls\u2014hulls 7 and 8\u2014in the fiscal years 2013-2017 capital  investment plan. However, the DHS Cutter Study also notes that the time  line for the two acquisitions makes a trade-off between the National  Security Cutter and the Offshore Patrol Cutter difficult since the National  Security Cutter program is in production whereas the Offshore Patrol  Cutter program is only in the design phase. Similarly, we have reported  that the Coast Guard may face an operational gap in its ability to perform  missions using major cutters due to the condition of the legacy fleet.", "With respect to the second possibility that there are assumptions built into  the Offshore Patrol Cutter cost estimate that are driving the estimated  costs down, the Coast Guard included three key assumptions in the  Offshore Patrol Cutter\u2019s life cycle cost estimate, generally not related to  the cutter\u2019s key requirements, which lower the estimated cost in  comparison to the actual cost of the National Security Cutter. These three  assumptions are:", "Learning Curve. The Coast Guard assumes that the shipyard(s) will  generally continue to reduce the labor hours required to build the  Offshore Patrol Cutter through the production of all 25 vessels. This  may prove optimistic, particularly for later ships in the class, because  the amount of additional learning per vessel\u2013or efficiencies gained  during production due to improving the manufacturing process to build  the ship in a way that requires fewer labor hours\u2013typically decreases  over time in a shipbuilding program.", "Military versus Commercial Standards. The life cycle cost estimate  assumes that certain areas of the Offshore Patrol Cutter\u2019s  construction and material would reflect an average of 55 percent  commercial standards\u2014or construction standards that are typically  used for military sealift ships that provide ocean transportation\u2014and  45 percent military standards\u2014or construction standards typically  used for Navy combat vessels. Any changes in this assumption  could have a significant effect on the cost estimate because military  standards require more sophisticated construction applications,  particularly in the areas of shock hardening and signature reduction,  to prepare a ship to survive battle. Such sensitivity could help to  explain the difference in costs between the Offshore Patrol Cutter  program and the National Security Cutter program and officials stated  that the latter program is being built to about 90 percent military  standards.", "Production Schedule. The cost estimate reflects the Coast Guard\u2019s  plan to switch from building one Offshore Patrol Cutter per year to  building two Offshore Patrol Cutters per year beginning with the fourth  and fifth vessel in the class. If the Coast Guard cannot achieve or  maintain this build rate due to budget constraints, it may choose to  stretch the schedule for the program which in turn could increase  costs.", "Coast Guard program officials generally agreed that these three variables  are important to the cost of the Offshore Patrol Cutter and are key  reasons why the Coast Guard expects one Offshore Patrol Cutter to cost  less than half of one National Security Cutter. However, these officials  recognized that the cost estimate for the Offshore Patrol Cutter is still  uncertain since the cutter has yet to be designed\u2014thus, the National  Security Cutter\u2019s actual costs are more reliable. Coast Guard program  officials also added that the cost estimate for the Offshore Patrol Cutter is  optimistic in that it assumes that the cutter will be built in accordance with  the current acquisition strategy and planned schedule. They noted that  any delays, design issues, or contract oversight problems\u2014all of which  were experienced during the purchase of the National Security Cutter\u2014 could increase the eventual price of the Offshore Patrol Cutter.", "According to the April 2012 acquisition decision memorandum, which  documents DHS\u2019s approval for the Coast Guard to move forward and  award design contracts for the Offshore Patrol Cutter, DHS Office of  Policy and the Office of the Chief Financial Officer raised concerns about  the potential for cost growth and this program crowding out other Coast  Guard programs in future austere budget years. In response to concerns  about affordability, DHS is requiring the Coast Guard to return for a  special program review\u2014one that is not required by acquisition  guidance\u2014before it awards a production contract, which is currently  planned for fiscal year 2016. DHS Program Accountability and Risk  Management officials told us that a new life cycle cost estimate is not  required if the Coast Guard can demonstrate during this meeting that the  acquisition cost and schedule in the approved acquisition program  baseline are still valid.

Our best practices work has found that successful commercial companies  assess product investments collectively from an enterprise level, rather  than as independent and unrelated initiatives, and prioritize investments  by integrating the requirements, acquisition, and budget processes. This  approach empowers leadership to make decisions about the best way to  invest resources and holds managers accountable for outcomes.  Organizations should use an integrated approach to prioritize needs and  allocate resources in accordance with strategic goals, so they can avoid  pursuing more products than they can afford and optimize return on  investment.

In the  absence of up-to-date program baselines, the Coast Guard makes  decisions about which programs to fund and which programs not to fund  as part of its annual budget process as opposed to having a stable and  meaningful long-term capital investment plan based on identified needs.  This puts Congress and the taxpayer in the position of having to commit  resources to individual programs without knowing whether they are  affordable, or achievable, within the context of the overall portfolio.  Furthermore, unplanned demands for additional funds are likely as the  Coast Guard begins to start new acquisition programs.

To determine whether these baselines reflected the current  status of the program, we reviewed breach notifications, the fiscal year  2013 President\u2019s Budget request, and interviewed officials from program  offices. We also reviewed the Coast Guard\u2019s Major Systems Acquisition  Manual to identify when programs are required to update baselines. In  comparing original costs to revised baseline costs, if a revised baseline  presents both threshold costs and objective costs, threshold costs were  used. For those programs that comprised the former Deepwater program  this methodology allows traceability to the original $24.2 billion Deepwater  baseline while also showing how much programs could now cost based  upon revised baselines. Furthermore, some programs have reported a  cost breach to the revised baseline and costs are expected to increase  beyond the threshold values. In making this comparison for those  programs with no planned funding beyond fiscal year 2014, the estimated  total program cost equals dollars appropriated to date plus planned  funding in the fiscal years 2013-2017 capital investment plan.  Further, we  analyzed the Coast Guard\u2019s fiscal years 2013-2017 expanded capital  investment plan to identify the planned annual funding levels for each  major acquisition program.

If an approved life  cycle cost estimate was not available, we used the annual funding needs  identified by the Coast Guard in the expanded capital investment plan.  We also interviewed Coast Guard officials from the acquisitions  directorate and resources directorate to discuss future funding plans as  well as to discuss the Coast Guard\u2019s plans for the National Security  Cutter program to determine how those plans could affect other  programs. We also interviewed officials from the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) Program Accountability and Risk Management  and DHS Office of Policy to discuss their oversight responsibilities for  Coast Guard programs.", "To assess the steps the Coast Guard has recently taken to develop an  affordable portfolio through its requirements process, we obtained and  analyzed Fleet Mix Analysis Phase One, Fleet Mix Analysis Phase Two,  and the DHS Cutter Study. We also relied on our past work that reviewed  Coast Guard appropriations from fiscal years 2008 through 2012 and the  President\u2019s budget request for fiscal year 2013 to analyze how fiscal  assumptions in the studies compared with past appropriations. Further,  we examined the 2005 Mission Need Statement to determine the extent  to which the capabilities being acquired matched the needs set forth in  this plan. In doing so, we traced 11 system performance capabilities  identified in the 2005 Mission Need Statement through various program  documents, including the 2007 Deepwater acquisition program baseline,  operational requirements documents, and testing documents to identify  which capabilities the Coast Guard is currently planning to acquire. In  addition to reviewing fleetwide requirements, we also reviewed the  requirements development process for the National Security Cutter and  the Offshore Patrol Cutter. We focused on these two assets as they are  the two largest cost drivers in the Coast Guard\u2019s major acquisition  portfolio. To examine the Offshore Patrol Cutter\u2019s requirements  development process, we reviewed the Coast Guard\u2019s Major Systems  Acquisition Manual and Requirements Guidance and interviewed officials  in the capabilities directorate to discuss the process and to identify key  documents and studies that guided this process. We also compared the  National Security Cutter\u2019s and Offshore Patrol Cutter\u2019s missions,  requirements, and costs to determine similarities and differences. We  used Coast Guard budget documentation to determine the cost of the fifth  National Security Cutter and then used the Offshore Patrol Cutter\u2019s life  cycle cost estimate which identified the average cost of the fourth and fifth  Offshore Patrol Cutters. We discussed the comparison between the  National Security Cutter and Offshore Patrol Cutter with DHS and Coast  Guard officials.", "To assess the extent to which Coast Guard is using cross-directorate  teams to provide oversight and inform acquisition decisions, we  interviewed officials from the acquisition and resource directorates to  identify what teams the Coast Guard has established as part of an  acquisition governance framework. We also reviewed the charters for  each of those teams. We then collected and analyzed meeting minutes  and briefing presentations for the Executive Oversight Council and  Resource Councils from calendar years 2010-2011, but we did not do the  same for the Systems Integration Team because it was just forming  during this time period. We also reviewed the acquisition directorate\u2019s  Blueprint to identify what action items had been tasked to these teams.  We interviewed senior representatives from the Executive Oversight  Council, Systems Integration Team, and chairs of the Aviation, Cutter and  C4ISR Resource Councils to understand their specific roles and  responsibilities for managing acquisition programs and informing  recapitalization decisions. We also interviewed stakeholders from the  acquisitions and resources directorates to gather their understanding of  the roles of the Executive Oversight Council, Systems Integration Team  and Resource Councils, and the nature and extent of their interaction with  these groups. Furthermore, we referred to previous GAO work on best  practices for portfolio management to identify the extent to which the  Coast Guard\u2019s framework implements this management approach.", "To support our review, we requested information and documents  pertaining to the current cost estimates and schedules for each asset in  the Coast Guard\u2019s major acquisitions portfolio, a copy of the DHS- directed briefing in which Coast Guard was to develop a plan for showing  program tradeoffs, and several sets of Executive Oversight Council  meeting minutes. The Coast Guard did not provide us current cost  estimates and schedules, the complete DHS-directed briefing, or all sets  of meeting minutes because officials stated these documents included  budget negotiation information.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2011 to September  2012 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
