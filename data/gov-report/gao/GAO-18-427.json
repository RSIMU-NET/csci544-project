For more than a decade, we have highlighted the need to re- evaluate and reprioritize what the federal government does, how it does  business, and as appropriate, who conducts its business. Although these  actions alone cannot put the U.S. government on a sustainable fiscal  path, they would improve the fiscal situation and help ensure agencies  have the capacity to address ongoing and newly emerging challenges  within available resources.", "The organizational transformation needed to improve the performance of  federal agencies is no easy task, however, and can take years to fully  implement. Reforming and reorganizing the federal government is a major  endeavor that can include refocusing, realigning, or enhancing agency  missions, as well as taking steps to improve services by identifying and  eliminating inefficiencies. Equally important is maintaining or improving  effectiveness and examining the impact of such proposed changes on  employees, stakeholders, and program customers. Our earlier work has  shown that effective government transformation initiatives: (1) require a  combination of people, processes, technologies, and other critical  success factors to achieve results; and (2) are dependent upon following  essential change management practices, such as the involvement of the  Congress, federal employees, and other key stakeholders.", "In March 2017, the President issued an executive order requiring a  comprehensive reorganization of executive branch agencies.

We also reviewed  our prior work on fragmentation, overlap, and duplication; high-risk; and  other agency longstanding management challenges. We selected those  questions that were most relevant to the agency reform efforts outlined in  OMB\u2019s guidance. A list of these related products are in appendix I.  Additionally, we met with OMB staff to discuss their role in working with  agencies on reform efforts.", "Because we drew the material in this report from prior work, we contacted  a selection of nine subject matter specialists to review the major  categories that were covered by our questions to assess that there were  no major gaps in our categories or questions and that they were  presented in the appropriate context. To identify these specialists, we considered individuals who had previously assisted us in developing key  leading practices in our work that we used to draw our questions, as well  as those that are knowledgeable in government reform, management,  and strategic human capital management issues. We shared our draft  questions with these specialists for their technical comments and views,  and incorporated their comments as appropriate.

The January 2017  presidential memo also directed OMB, in consultation with the Office of  Personnel Management (OPM), to recommend a long-term plan to  reduce the size of the federal workforce through attrition. OMB\u2019s April  2017 guidance to agencies on their reform plans lifted the federal hiring  freeze. Below is a timeline for proposed reform development and  implementation as shown in figure 1.", "According to OMB\u2019s April 2017 guidance, the agency reform plans were  intended to accomplish several objectives, including creating a lean,  accountable, more efficient government, focusing on efficiency and  effectiveness and delivering programs of highest needs to citizens, and  aligning the federal workforce to meet the needs of today and the future,  among other things.", "Each agency\u2019s proposed reform plan was to include proposals to improve  efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability in four categories: (1)  eliminate activities; (2) restructure and merge activities; (3) improve  organizational efficiency and effectiveness; and (4) workforce  management. To support these proposed reforms, OMB asked agencies  to conduct an analysis, among other things, to consider if there was a  unique federal role or whether some or all services, activities, or functions  could be better performed by another entity, such as a state, local or tribal  government or the private sector. Additionally, according to OMB\u2019s April  2017 guidance, the draft agency proposed reform plan should be aligned  with the agency strategic plan. Agency strategic plans were to be  released with the President\u2019s fiscal year 2019 budget.", "The final reforms included in the fiscal year 2019 budget also were to be  reflected in the agencies\u2019 human capital operating plans and information  technology strategic plans, based on OMB guidance we reviewed. In  March 2018, OMB released the President\u2019s Management Agenda (PMA),  which provided updated information on the status of government  reorganization efforts and is connected with these reform efforts. The  PMA also identified a set of cross-agency priority (CAP) goals, required  under the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA), to target those  areas where multiple agencies must collaborate to effect change and  report progress in a manner the public can easily track.", "In addition to the agency reform proposals, OMB was also required by the  March 2017 executive order to develop a comprehensive government- wide reform plan, including both legislative proposals and administrative  actions based on agency reform plans, OMB-coordinated crosscutting  proposals, and public input. According to a document provided by OMB  staff, OMB solicited public comments beginning in April 2017 through  June 2017 to inform the development of the government-wide reform  plan. OMB staff told us they provided these comments to the appropriate  agencies.", "The March 2018 PMA stated that, in the months ahead, the  administration plans to share additional reorganization proposals  designed to refocus programs around current and future needs.  According to OMB guidance, once the government-wide reform proposals  are finalized, it will, in coordination with the President\u2019s Management  Council, establish a way to track the progress of the reforms. To track  progress of the reforms, OMB\u2019s guidance stated that it will leverage the  federal performance planning and reporting framework originally put into  place by the Government Performance Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) and  significantly enhanced by GPRAMA, through the use of CAP goals,  agency priority goals, and Performance.gov."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Questions to Assess Agency Reforms", "paragraphs": ["Given the potential benefits and challenges developing and implementing  agency reform efforts, Congress and the executive branch need the tools  and information to help evaluate agencies\u2019 reform proposals and ensure  they are effectively implemented.

Because many current federal programs and policies  were designed decades ago to respond to trends and challenges that  existed at the time of their creation, it makes sense to periodically conduct  fundamental reviews of major programs and policy areas to ensure they  continue to meet current goals and emerging trends. It is also important to  determine the appropriate level of government, or the roles of the non- profit or private sectors, in achieving these goals.

Another key aspect of shifting federal activities to other levels  of government is how well the federal government fully considered the  potential effects reforms might have on state and local governments,  especially from a budgetary and fiscal standpoint. For example, how  should the federal government act directly, or in partnership with another  level of government or a non-profit organization, to achieve the identified  outcomes? Defining the appropriate federal role also involves examining  the federal government\u2019s relationships with key state, local, non-profit,  and private sector partners.
