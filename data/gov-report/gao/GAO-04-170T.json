It also omits an unknown number of potential long-term overstays from Mexico and Canada. Because of unresolved weaknesses in DHS's current system for tracking arrivals and departures (e.g.,noncollection of some departure forms and inability to match other departure forms to arrivals), there is no accurate list of overstays. Two new tracking initiatives are intended to address these weaknesses. NSEERS, the National Security Entry and Exit Registration System, does not cover most visitors. US-VISIT, the U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology, a more comprehensive,automated program, is being phased in. While its design and implementation face a number of challenges, evaluating US-VISIT against the weaknesses GAO identifies here would increase its potential for success. The current tracking system's weaknesses limit control options and make it difficult to monitor potential terrorists who enter the country legally. Like other illegal immigrants, overstays obtain jobs with fraudulent identity documents, including jobs at critical infrastructure locations, such as airports.

First, a visitor can overstay the  authorized period of admission set by the DHS inspector at the border  while still possessing a valid visa. (For example, a visitor with a 6- month multiple-entry visa from the Department of State might be issued  a 6-week period of admission by the DHS inspector and remain here for  7 weeks, thus overstaying.) Second, some visitors are allowed to enter  the United States without visas and to remain for specific periods of  time, which they may overstay.", "Form I-94 is the basis of the current overstay tracking system. For visitors  from most countries, the period of admission is authorized (or set) by a  DHS inspector when they enter the United States legally and fill out this  form. Each visitor is to give the top half to the inspector and to retain the  bottom half, which should be collected on his or her departure.", "When visiting the United States for business or pleasure, two major groups  are exempt from filling out an I-94 form:", "Mexicans entering the United States with a Border Crossing Card (BCC) at  the Southwestern border who intend to limit their stay to less than 72  hours and not to travel beyond a set perimeter (generally, 25 miles from  the border) and", "Canadians admitted for up to 6 months without a perimeter restriction.Thus, the majority of Canadian and Mexican visits cannot be tracked by  the current system, because the visitors have not filled out Form I-94.

However, some  terrorists may continue to slip through these border defenses. Keeping all  dangerous persons and potential terrorist-suspects from legally entering  the United States is difficult because some do not match the expected  characteristics of terrorists or suspicious persons; in addition, some may  not be required to apply for visas (that is, citizens of Canada or one of the  27 visa waiver countries).", "Watch lists have been improved somewhat since 9/11, but further  improvements are needed. For example, earlier this year we reported that  the State Department \u201cwith the help of other agencies, almost doubled the  number of names and the amount of information\u201d in its Consular Lookout  and Support System. We also reported that \u201cthe federal watch list  environment has been characterized by a proliferation of [terrorist and  watch list] systems, among which information sharing is occurring in some  cases but not in others.\u201d", "In this testimony today, we focus primarily on an overstay\u2019s illegal  presence within the United States and the potential consequences for  domestic security. Viewed in terms of individuals, the overstay process  can be summarized as aliens\u2019 (1) legally visiting the United States, which  for citizens of most nations is preceded by obtaining a passport and a visa  and requires filling out Form I-94 at the U.S. border; (2) overstaying for a  period that may range from a single day to weeks, months, or years; and, in  some cases, (3) terminating their overstay status by exiting the United  States or adjusting to legal permanent resident status (that is, obtaining a  green card). Beyond that, the overstay process can be viewed more  broadly in the context of our nation\u2019s layered defense.

A recent DHS estimate put the January 2000 resident overstay  population at 1/3 of 7 million illegal immigrants, or 2.3 million. The  method DHS used to obtain the 1/3 figure is complex and indirect, and we  plan to evaluate that estimate further. However, the 2.3 million overstay  estimate excludes specific groups, and we believe, therefore, that it  potentially understates the extent of overstaying.", "By definition, DHS\u2019s estimate of 2.3 million overstays as of January 2000  represents only a part of the total overstay problem. DHS\u2019s estimate of 7  million illegal immigrants is limited to illegals who settled and were  residing here at the time of the 2000 census. It includes only overstays  who were in the actual census count or included in corrections for  possible undercounts of illegal immigrants.", "DHS\u2019s estimate of overstays as of January 2000 is not defined to include  the following groups:  a.  Visitors filling out Form I-94 who overstay for short periods of time. Many such persons are not likely  to be included in the 2000 census, which is the starting point of DHS\u2019s  2.3 million estimate of the resident overstay population. In our ongoing  work, we will examine indicators of the magnitude, and significance, of  short-term overstaying among visitors who fill out I-94 forms.  b.

Overstays in this group are included  in DHS\u2019s estimate of 7 million illegal immigrants, but they are  categorized as illegal immigrants other than overstays. This is because  DHS used I-94 data from the early 1990s and projected these data  forward to obtain the 1/3 overstay proportion. overstay for short periods. As indicated above, many short-term  overstays are not included in the 2000 census, which is the starting  point of DHS\u2019s 2.3 million estimate of the resident overstay population.", "These groups are illustrated in figure 2.", "In part because of coverage issues, the extent of overstaying has not been  definitively measured. In addition, the accuracy of DHS\u2019s estimate of the  resident overstay population is not known with precision. Other limited  data points may help illustrate the possible magnitude.", "For this testimony, we obtained two small-sample sources of data. First,  we identified a government-sponsored survey, reported in 2002, that had  (1) sampled more than 1,000 adult green-card holders, (2) asked them  about their prior immigration status, and (3) found that more than 300  respondents self-reported prior illegal status. From the computer run we  requested, we found that of the roughly 300 former illegals, about 1/3 said  they were former overstays, with most of the remaining 2/3 reporting prior  illegal border crossing.", "Second, we obtained data from Operation Tarmac, the 2001\u201303 sweep of  airport employees who had access to sensitive areas. Although Operation  Tarmac investigators had collected information on overstaying, they did  not systematically record data for overstays versus illegal border crossers.  We requested that DHS manually review a sample of case files and identify  overstays. DHS reported to us that of 286 sampled cases in which illegal  immigrant airport workers (that is, overstays and illegal border crossers)  were arrested or scheduled for deportation, 124 workers, or about 40  percent, were overstays.", "While both the survey data and the airport data represent rough small- sample checks, they provide some additional support for concluding that  overstays are not rare."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unresolved Tracking System Weaknesses Heighten the Overstay Problem", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "I-94 Tracking System Weaknesses Limit Control Options", "paragraphs": ["One weakness in DHS\u2019s system for tracking the paper Form I-94\u2014its  limited coverage of Mexican and Canadian visitors\u2014was discussed in the  section above.

Some visitors do not fill in destination address information on  Form I-94 or they do so inadequately. A related issue that we reported in  2002 is DHS\u2019s inability to obtain updated address information during each  visitor\u2019s stay; such information could be a valuable addition to the arrival,  departure, and destination address information that is collected.", "Missing departure forms.

But for some visitors who may have actually left the United States   record of the departures.\u201d DHS acknowledges that this is still  a concern, that the situation is analogous for cruise lines, and that  noncollection is a larger problem for land exits.", "Our recent work has also drawn attention to identity fraud, demonstrating  how persons presenting fraudulent documents (bearing a name other than  their own) to DHS inspectors could enter the United States. Visitors  whose fraudulent documents pass inspection could record a name other  than their own on their I-94 form.", "In our current work, we have identified two further weaknesses in the  tracking system. One weakness is the inability to match some departure  forms back to corresponding arrival forms. DHS has suggested that when a  visitor loses the original departure form, matching is less certain because  it can no longer be based on identical numbers printed on the top and  bottom halves of the original form. The other weakness is that at land  ports (and possibly airports and seaports), the collection of departure  forms is vulnerable to manipulation\u2014in other words, visitors could make  it appear that they had left when they had not. To illustrate, on bridges  where toll collectors accept I-94 departure forms at the Southwestern  border, a person departing the United States by land could hand in  someone else\u2019s I-94 form.", "Because of these weaknesses, DHS has no accurate list of overstays to  send to consular officials or DHS inspectors. This limits DHS\u2019s ability to  consider past overstaying when issuing new visas or allowing visitors to  reenter.", "More generally, the lack of an accurate list limits prevention and  enforcement options. For example, accurate data on overstays and other  visitors might help define patterns to better differentiate visa applicants  with higher overstay risk. And without an accurate list and updated  addresses, it is not possible to identify and locate new overstays to remind  them of penalties for not departing. Such efforts fall under the category of  interior enforcement: As we previously testified, \u201chistorically . . . over five  times more resources in terms of staff and budget   border enforcement than . . .  interior enforcement.\u201d Despite large  numbers of overstays, current efforts to deport them are generally limited  to (1) criminals and smugglers, (2) employees identified as illegal at  critical infrastructure locations, and (3) persons included in special  control efforts such as the domestic registration (or \u201ccall in\u201d component)  of the NSEERS program (the National Security Entry and Exit Registration  System). DHS statisticians told us that for fiscal year 2002, the risk of  arrest for all overstays was less than 2 percent. For most other overstays  (that is, for persons not in the targeted groups), the risk of deportation is  considerably lower.", "The effect of tracking system weaknesses on overstay data is illustrated by  the inaccurate\u2014and, according to DHS, inflated\u2014lists of what it terms  \u201capparent overstays\u201d and \u201cconfirmed overstays.\u201d For fiscal year 2001  arrivals, the system yielded a list of 6.5 million \u201capparent overstays\u201d for which DHS had no departure  record that matched the arrivals and an additional list of a half million \u201cconfirmed overstays,\u201d or visits that  ended after the visitors\u2019 initial periods of admission expired (see  appendixes I and II).", "However, DHS has no way of knowing how many of the 6.5 million are real  cases of overstaying and how many are false (because some of these  visitors had, for example, departed or legally changed their status). Even  the half million \u201cconfirmed overstays\u201d are not all true cases of overstaying,  because some visitors may have legally extended their periods of  admission.", "In the past, we made a number of recommendations that directly or  indirectly address some of these system weaknesses, but these  recommendations have not been implemented or have been only partially  implemented.

But the POE effort does  not cover most visitors because it focuses on persons born in only eight  countries.

For example, this could  involve examining a sample of the passenger manifest lists of flights  with foreign destinations to determine the extent of airline compliance  and possibly developing penalties on airlines for noncompliance.  Discovery of the incidence of various causes of departure loss could  allow more precise estimation of their occurrence and development of  possible remedies.

DHS told us that it has not further studied making  overstay estimates by air arrivals. Valid estimation of overstays is  extremely difficult, given current tracking system weaknesses.  3. \t We recommended that to promote compliance with the change of  address notification requirements through publicity and enforcement  and to improve the reliability of its alien address data, the Attorney  General should direct the INS Commissioner to identify and implement  an effective means to publicize the change of address notification  requirement nationwide. INS should make sure that, as part of its  publicity effort, aliens are provided with information on how to  comply with this requirement, including where information may be  available and the location of change of address forms.
