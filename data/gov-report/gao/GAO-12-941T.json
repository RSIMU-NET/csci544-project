In 2010, we reported that DHS initially  planned to deploy more than 2,100 portal monitors to U.S. ports of entry.  Due to funding constraints and challenges in developing new  technologies, DHS is updating its portal monitor deployment plan by  reducing the number of portal monitors it planned to deploy and  increasing its reliance on portable systems. Specifically, according to  DHS officials, DHS has deployed about 1,465 of the approximately 1,537,  or 95 percent, of radiation portal monitors that it now plans to deploy; the  agency expects to complete this deployment by December 2014. As we  reported in 2011, since 2009, DHS has scanned nearly all of the  containerized cargo and conveyances entering the United States through  land borders and major seaports for nuclear and radiological materials.  However, as we reported in 2010 and 2011, DHS has made less progress  scanning: (1) railcars entering the United States from Canada and Mexico  and (2) international air cargo and commercial aviation aircraft,  passengers, and baggage.", "As we reported in 2011, according to DHS officials, since November  2009, almost all nonrail land ports of entry have been equipped with one  or more radiation portal monitors. Of the about 1,465 portal monitors  deployed, as of July 2012, 917, or about 63 percent, have been deployed  along the northern and southern borders of the lower 48 states to all but a  few nonrail ports of entry. According to DHS officials, 100 percent of all  containerized cargo, conveyances, drivers, and passengers entering the  United States through commercial lanes at land borders are scanned for  radiation, as are more than 99 percent of all personally operated vehicles  (noncommercial passenger cars and light trucks), drivers, and  passengers.", "According to DHS officials, the department scans nearly all containerized  cargo entering U.S. seaports for nuclear and radiological materials.  Specifically, of the about 1,465 portal monitors, DHS has deployed 453,  or about 31 percent, of radiation portal monitors to major American  seaports\u2013\u2013including the largest seaports accounting for the majority of  cargo. However, some smaller seaports that receive cargo may not be  equipped with portal monitors. DHS officials told us they will know how  many more portal monitors will be deployed to these smaller seaports  when the agency completes its updated deployment plan in September  2012. Furthermore, in July 2012, these officials told us that, due to  increased cargo volume at some major seaports, additional portal  monitors may be needed to avoid delays in moving cargo through larger  ports. In such cases, DHS officials told us that they are considering cost- sharing arrangements with seaport operators, whereby DHS and seaport  operators would share the cost of additional portal monitor deployments.  Under such arrangements, DHS would continue to purchase, maintain,  and operate these additional portal monitors, but the seaport operators  would share in the cost of deploying them.", "As we reported over the last 2 years, DHS has made limited progress  with regard to radiation scanning of the roughly 4,800 loaded railcars in  approximately 120 trains entering the United States each day from   Although, most  Canada and Mexico through 31 rail ports of entry.international rail crossings have radiography systems to scan the majority  of cargo, much of the scanning for nuclear and radiological materials that  takes place at these ports of entry is conducted with portable, handheld  radioactive isotope identification devices. This scanning is triggered  when, for example, anomalous readings are detected from imaging scans  of railcar contents. According to DHS officials, international rail traffic  represents one of the most difficult challenges for radiation detection  systems. Specifically, in June 2010, they told us that rail traffic poses  unique operational challenges due to the length of the trains (up to 2  miles), the distance required to stop moving trains, and the difficulties in  separating individual cars for further examination. Furthermore, DHS  officials told us that rail companies typically own the land where DHS  would need to establish stations for screening, and these companies  often resist doing things that might slow down rail traffic. Moreover, DHS  officials told us that an effective solution would require scanning of at  least some rail traffic on Mexican or Canadian soil, and they said that it  will take time to develop the close cooperation with officials in Mexico and  Canada necessary to do so. Accordingly, in 2010, DHS undertook an  International Rail Threat and Gap Study to determine the most promising  radiation detection approach. In July 2012, DHS officials said that the  agency is presently in the final stages of completing a second study  analyzing technological and operational options. DHS officials told us that  decisions about additional enhancement of radiation detection capabilities  at international rail ports of entry are pending the results of this analysis  and the department\u2019s broader consideration of the needs and priorities of  the GNDA. The second study is due to be completed in September 2012,  according to DHS officials.", "DHS has made less progress scanning air cargo and commercial aviation  for nuclear and radiological materials. As of July 2012, DHS was  scanning for nuclear and radiological materials at certain major  international airports in the United States using some portal monitors.  CBP also utilizes radioactive isotope identification devices and personal  radiation detectors to alert the agency to the presence of such materials.", "DHS officials told us in June 2010 that they were studying options for  effectively deploying portal monitors to increase their capacity to scan for  nuclear and radiological materials in international air cargo conveyed on  commercial airlines. According to these DHS officials, their experience  scanning air cargo at a few major international airports in the United  States has led them to conclude that the deployment of radiation portal  monitors is not feasible at many locations due to the lack of natural choke  points, where scanning would take place. Furthermore, these officials  stated that scanning 100 percent of air cargo would be technically and  logistically challenging and would require significant investment in  equipment, staffing, and maintenance resources. Moreover, further DHS  analysis since June 2010 has shown that there are no procedural or  operational changes that can easily overcome the logistical and resource  challenges associated with airports. Until solutions to these challenges  can be found, DHS officials told us that the scanning for radioactive  materials that occurs at airports will continue to be conducted primarily  with handheld detectors where portal monitors are not deployed.", "Similarly, DHS does not scan all commercial aviation aircraft, passengers,  or baggage for radioactive materials with portal monitors. However,  passengers are scanned for radioactive materials with radioactive isotope  identification devices when DHS is alerted to the presence of radiation by  CBP officers\u2019 personal radiation detectors, and some baggage is scanned  by radiation portal monitors at selected overseas airports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Observations from Our Past Work for DHS to Consider When Replacing Portal Monitors", "paragraphs": ["As deployed portal monitors reach the end of their expected service lives,  observations from our past work may help DHS as it considers options for  deploying new technologies as to whether to refurbish or replace them.  DHS has been procuring portal monitors for about 10 years, and DHS  officials estimate that the expected service life of many of these portal  monitors is about 10 to 20 years. Their service lives can be extended by  refurbishing their key components but doing so also requires some  additional investment. In July 2012, DNDO and CBP officials told us they  are working on a portal monitor replacement strategy that is due to be  completed in 2013. As DHS considers options to refurbish existing  systems, or replace them with new systems, observations from our past  work may help the agency make the most informed decisions, mitigate  risks, and produce expected outcomes. Specifically, we believe it is  important that DHS consider the following:", "Taking into account the overall priorities of the domestic side of the  GNDA before making investments or reinvestments in ports and  border crossings. Ports and border crossings have received most of  the investment of radiation detection technologies because these are  the areas through which a significant amount of cargo must pass, and  federal law requires certain scanning at seaports. However, as  discussed earlier, other pathways also pose risks. As we reported in  2011, any additional investment in radiation detection equipment  needs to be consistent with the highest priority needs of the domestic  side of the GNDA, including examining and balancing the needs and  risks of all smuggling pathways into the United States. In July 2012,  DHS officials told us they agreed that further investment in detecting  radiation in ports and border crossings needs to be consistent with the  overall needs of the GNDA.", "Testing new equipment rigorously prior to acquisition and deployment.", "One of the principal findings of our past work reviewing DNDO\u2019s  efforts to develop and procure the advanced spectroscopic portal\u2013\u2013a  more advanced radiation portal monitor\u2013\u2013was that initial testing was  not rigorous enough. Once the testing became more rigorous, these  portals did not perform well enough to warrant deployment, and the  program was subsequently cancelled, after DNDO had spent more  than $280 million on development and testing costs. Consistent with  our past recommendations, any investment in new equipment should  include sufficient and rigorous testing to ensure that any new selected  equipment performs well enough to meet mission needs. DNDO  officials told us that DNDO is currently working on a collaborative  effort with the radiation detection agencies of the European Union to  test the capabilities of currently available radiation detection  equipment, including portal monitors, from multiple vendors. This  testing is part of the Illicit Trafficking Radiation Assessment Program  and is not connected to any planned acquisition; instead, it will  provide performance information on a variety of radiation detection  equipment. According to DHS officials, the final report from this testing  is expected in 2013, and DNDO could use the results as part of its  basis for considering whether to replace currently deployed portal  monitors with other devices.", "Obtaining full concurrence of the end user\u2013\u2013CBP\u2013\u2013to ensure that any  new equipment meets CBP\u2019s operational needs. Our past work on the  advanced spectroscopic portal and DNDO efforts to develop a system  to use radiography to scan cargo for nuclear materials found that  DNDO did not fully understand (1) how CBP used existing radiation  detection equipment in a port environment or (2) the extent of the  space limitations in port environments.  Consistent with our past findings, decisions to rehabilitate or replace currently deployed portal  monitors need to be made with the full buy-in of CBP\u2014particularly if  the decision involves new equipment or technologies. Obtaining early  buy-in from CBP will help ensure any new equipment is consistent  with CBP\u2019s operational needs.", "Conducting a cost-benefit analysis to inform acquisition decisions. A  key part of deciding whether to refurbish or replace currently deployed  portal monitors is conducting a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis  that can be used to compare the relative costs and expected benefits  of existing versus new equipment. Consistent with our past  recommendations in 2006 on portal monitors, such an analysis should  articulate what enhanced performance could be expected of new  equipment and whether this benefit is worth its cost."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS\u2019s GNDA Strategic and Implementation Plans Address Our Past Recommendations but Do Not Yet Clearly Define Priorities", "paragraphs": ["In our past work on the GNDA, we made recommendations about the  need for a strategic plan to guide the development of the GDNA. Among  other things, in July 2008, we recommended that DHS develop an  overarching strategic plan for the GNDA that (1) clearly defines the  objectives to be accomplished, (2) identifies the roles and responsibilities  for meeting each objective, (3) identifies the funding necessary to achieve  those objectives, and (4) employs monitoring mechanisms to determine  programmatic progress and identify needed improvements. DHS agreed  with our recommendation. In January 2009, we recommended that DHS  develop a strategic plan for the domestic part of the global nuclear  detection strategy and that this plan focus on establishing time frames  and costs for addressing previously identified pathways within the  architecture\u2014land border areas between ports of entry, aviation, and  small maritime vessels. DHS did not comment on this recommendation  but noted that it aligned with DNDO\u2019s past, present, and future actions.", "DHS has taken action on these recommendations. In December 2010,  DHS issued the interagency GNDA strategic plan and in April 2012, it  issued its GNDA implementation plan for domestic aspects of the GNDA.  As we reported in July 2011, the 2010 GNDA strategic plan addresses  several aspects of our prior recommendations\u2014including defining  program objectives and assigning roles and responsibilities. However, it  did not (1) identify funding necessary to achieve plan objectives or (2)  establish monitoring mechanisms to determine progress and identify  needed improvements. DHS officials stated at that time that they intended  to include these aspects of our recommendations in an upcoming  implementation plan.", "Our review of the April 2012 GNDA implementation plan found that DHS  had made progress in both identifying funding dedicated to plan  objectives and in employing monitoring mechanisms to assess progress  in meeting plan objectives. Furthermore, the plan has established specific  milestones for completing many of DHS\u2019s activities\u2014allowing a further  assessment of whether progress is being made according to plan time  frames. In our view, these actions address the intent of our 2008  recommendations to identify necessary funding and employ monitoring  mechanisms. The plan also discusses strategies for addressing  previously identified pathways in the domestic portion of the GNDA,  including timeframes and costs for key elements of DHS\u2019 approach. While  these pathways remain an area of concern, the strategies discussed in  the plan address our 2009 recommendations and lay out an approach to  making nuclear smuggling through these pathways more difficult and thus  less likely to succeed. As DHS updates the implementation plan in the  future, providing additional details and discussion about how the strategy  will address the pathways in the domestic GNDA could better position  DHS to make decisions regarding resource allocations.", "However, in both the GNDA strategic plan and the implementation plan, it  remains difficult to identify priorities from among various components of  the domestic part of the GNDA. As we reported in July 2011, one of the  key benefits of a strategic plan is that it is a comprehensive means of  establishing priorities and using these priorities to allocate resources so   In times of tight budgets,  that the greatest needs are being addressed.allocating resources to address the highest priorities becomes even more  important. Identifying priorities would help inform DHS\u2019s decisions to  refurbish or replace portal monitors or invest in radiation detection  equipment for other potential pathways. DHS has done a comprehensive  analysis of GNDA capabilities and compared its capabilities with the  expected capabilities of adversaries who may wish to smuggle nuclear  material into the United States. This classified analysis provides data that  DHS could use as a basis to set priorities within the GNDA.", "DHS officials told us they agreed that the implementation plan did not yet  articulate specific priorities for GNDA program areas with the greatest  need for development and resources and that the DHS classified analysis  of GNDA capabilities could help inform those priorities.
