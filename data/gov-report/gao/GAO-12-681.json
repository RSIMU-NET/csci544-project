Similarly, in 2010, OMB expressed concern about  expansive federal IT projects that have taken years and have failed at  alarming rates. OMB also noted that many projects follow \u201cgrand designs\u201d  to deliver functionality in years, rather than breaking projects into more  manageable chunks and delivering functionality every few quarters.", "We recently reported on OMB\u2019s progress on these reforms in GAO, Information  Technology Reform: Progress Made; More Needs to Be Done to Complete Actions and  Measure Results, GAO-12-461 (Washington, D.C.: Apr. 26, 2012). the principal interagency forum for improving agency practices related to  the design, acquisition, development, modernization, use, sharing, and  performance of federal information resources.", "Agile software development supports the practice of shorter software  delivery. Specifically, Agile calls for the delivery of software in small, short  increments rather than in the typically long, sequential phases of a  traditional waterfall approach. More a philosophy than a methodology,  Agile emphasizes this early and continuous software delivery, as well as  using collaborative teams, and measuring progress with working  software. The Agile approach was first articulated in a 2001 document  called the Agile Manifesto, which is still used today. The manifesto has  four values: (1) individuals and interactions over processes and tools, (2)  working software over comprehensive documentation, (3) customer  collaboration over contract negotiation, and (4) responding to change  over following a plan. Appendix II provides additional information on the  Agile Manifesto and its related principles."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agile and Waterfall Approaches Differ", "paragraphs": ["The Agile approach differs in several ways from traditional waterfall  software development,of a sequence of phases. For example, the two approaches differ in (1)  the timing and scope of software development and delivery, (2) the timing  and scope of project planning, (3) project status evaluation, and (4)  collaboration.   which produces a full software product at the end", "Timing and scope of software development and delivery. In an  Agile project, working software is produced in iterations of typically  one to eight weeks in duration, each of which provides a segment of  functionality. To allow completion within the short time frame, each  iteration is relatively small in scope. For example, an iteration could  encompass a single function within a multistep process for  documenting and reporting insurance claims, such as a data entry  screen or a link to a database. Iterations combine into releases, with  the number of iterations dependent on the scope of the multistep  process. To meet the goal of delivering working software, teams  perform each of the steps of traditional software development for each  iteration. Specifically, for each iteration, the teams identify  requirements, design, and develop software to meet those  requirements, and test the resulting software to determine if it meets  the stated requirements. In contrast, waterfall development proceeds  in sequential phases of no consistent, fixed duration to produce a  complete system, such as one that addresses a comprehensive set of  steps to manage insurance claims. Such full system development  efforts can take several years. Waterfall phases typically address a  single step in the development cycle. For example, in one phase,  customer requirements for the complete product are documented,  reviewed, and handed to technical staff. One or more phases follow,  in which the technical staff develop software to meet those  requirements. In the final phase, the software is tested and reviewed  for compliance with the identified requirements.", "Timing and scope of project planning. In Agile, initial planning  regarding cost, scope, and timing is conducted at a high level.  However, these initial plans are supplemented by more specific plans  for each iteration and the overall plans can be revised to reflect  experience from completed iterations. For example, desired project  outcomes might initially be captured in a broad vision statement that  provides the basis for developing specific outcomes for an iteration.  Once an iteration has been completed, the overall plans can be  revised to reflect the completed work and any knowledge gained  during the iteration. For example, initial cost and schedule estimates  can be revised to reflect the actual cost and timing of the completed  work. In contrast, in traditional waterfall project management, this  analysis is documented in detail at the beginning of the project for the  entire scope of work. For example, significant effort may be devoted  to documenting strategies, project plans, cost and schedule  estimates, and requirements for a full system.", "Project status evaluation. In Agile, project status is primarily  evaluated based on software demonstrations. For example, iterations  typically end with a demonstration for customers and stakeholders of  the working software produced during that iteration. The  demonstration can reveal requirements that were not fully addressed  during the iteration or the discovery of new requirements. These  incomplete or newly-identified requirements are queued for possible  inclusion in later iterations. In contrast, in traditional project  management, progress is assessed based on a review of data and  documents at predetermined milestones and checkpoints. Milestones  and checkpoints can occur at the end of a phase, such as the end of  requirements definition, or at scheduled intervals, such as monthly.  The reviews typically include status reports on work done to date and  a comparison of the project\u2019s actual cost and schedule to baseline  projections. Federal IT evaluation guidance, such as our IT  Investment Management guidance and OMB IT reporting  requirements specify evaluations at key milestones, and annually,  which more closely align with traditional development methods. For  example, for major projects, OMB requires a monthly comparison of  actual and planned cost and schedule and risk status and annual  performance measures using, for example, earned value  management (EVM).", "Collaboration. Agile development emphasizes collaboration more  than traditional approaches do. For example, to coordinate the many  disciplines of an iteration, such as design and testing, customers work  frequently and closely with technical staff. Furthermore, teams are  often self-directed, meaning tasks and due dates are done within the  team and coordinated with project sponsors and stakeholders as  needed to complete the tasks. In contrast, with traditional project  management, customer and technical staff typically work separately,  and project tasks are prescribed and monitored by a project manager,  who reports to entities such as a program management office.", "See figure 1 for a depiction of Agile development compared to waterfall  development.", "There are numerous frameworks available to Agile practitioners. One  framework, called eXtreme Programming (XP), includes development  techniques. Another framework, called Scrum, defines management  processes and roles. The Scrum framework is widely used in the public  and private sector, and its terminology is often used in Agile discussions.  For example, Scrum iterations are called sprints, which are bundled into  releases. Sprint teams collaborate with minimal management direction,  often co-located in work rooms. They meet daily and post their task status  visibly, such as on wall charts.", "Other concepts commonly used by sprint teams are user stories, story  points, and backlog. User stories convey the customers\u2019 requirements. A  user story typically follows the construct of \u201cAs a <type of user> I want  <some goal> so that <some reason>.\u201d For example, \u201cAs a claims  processor, I want to check a claim payment status so that I can promptly  reply to a customer\u2019s request for payment status.\u201d Each user story is  assigned a level of effort, called story points, which are a relative unit of  measure used to communicate complexity and progress between the  business and development sides of the project. To ensure that the  product is usable at the end of every iteration, teams adhere to an  agreed-upon definition of done. This includes stakeholders defining how  completed work conforms to an organization\u2019s standards, conventions,  and guidelines. The backlog is a list of user stories to be addressed by  working software. If new requirements or defects are discovered, these  can be stored in the backlog to be addressed in future iterations.", "Progress in automating user stories is tracked daily using metrics and  tools. An example of a metric is velocity. Velocity tracks the rate of work  using the number of story points completed or expected to be completed  in an iteration. For example, if a team completed 100 story points during a  four-week iteration, the velocity for the team would be 100 story points  every four weeks. An example of a tool is a burn-down chart, which tracks  progress and the amount of work remaining for an iteration or for a  release, which is made up of multiple iterations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agile in the Private and Federal Sectors", "paragraphs": ["Agile use is reported in the private sector for small to medium sized  projects and is starting to be used for larger projects as well.

Officials at  the selected agencies identified challenges in achieving and maintaining  such commitment and collaboration from their stakeholders as follows.", "Teams had difficulty collaborating closely: Officials from three  agencies reported that teams were challenged in collaborating  because staff were used to working independently. For example, one  official reported that staff were challenged when asked to relocate to a  team room because the technical staff preferred to work alone. The  official added that some staff viewed open communication, such as  posting project status on team room wall charts, as intrusive. A  second official said that technical staff did not like constantly showing  their work to customers. The third official said that customers initially  did not want to see such development, preferring to wait for a polished  product.", "Teams had difficulty transitioning to self-directed work: Officials  at two agencies reported that staff had challenges in transitioning to  self-directed teams. In Agile, teams made up of customers and  technical staff are encouraged to create and manage their tasks  without project manager direction and to elevate issues to  stakeholders who have the authority to resolve them. Cross  functionality is also encouraged to allow teams to share tasks. One  official reported that teams used to direction from a project manager  were challenged in taking responsibility for their work and in elevating  issues they could not resolve within the team to senior officials. A  second official noted that it was a challenge to create cross-functional  teams because federal staff tend to be specialists in one functional  area. An example of this would be where a team could include  someone to represent system users, but that person may not be  familiar with the needs of all users. Specifically, a team developing an  insurance system might include someone with a background in claims  processing. However, that person may not be experienced with  payment procedures.", "Staff had difficulty committing to more timely and frequent input:  While Agile advocates frequent input and feedback from all  stakeholders, four agency officials noted challenges to commit to  meeting such input expectations. One agency official noted that  individuals were challenged to commit to keeping work products, such  as schedules, updated to reflect the status of every iteration because  they were not used to this rapid pace. A second official stated that  teams initially had difficulty maintaining the pace of an iteration  because they were used to stopping their work to address issues  rather than making a decision and moving on. A third official said that  it was challenging incorporating security requirements at the rapid  pace of the sprint.

The frequent input expected of staff involved  in projects requires a more significant time commitment than that  required for waterfall development projects that allow more sporadic  participation. For example, two officials said their agencies were  challenged dedicating staff with multiple, concurrent duties to teams  because staff could not be spared from their other duties while  participating in the Agile teams.

One official noted that implementing Agile  tools that aid in planning and reporting progress was initially a  challenge because there was a delay in buying, installing, and  learning to use these tools.", "Technical environments were difficult to establish and maintain:  Two agency officials noted that establishing and maintaining technical  environments posed challenges because Agile calls for development,  test, and operational activities to be performed concurrently.  According to one agency\u2019s officials, preparing and maintaining  synchronized hardware and software environments for these three  activities in time to support the releases was expensive to support and  logistically challenging. Furthermore, one of these officials noted that  his agency experienced a challenge running multiple concurrent  iterations because this required more complex coordination of staff  and resources.", "Agile guidance was not clear: Officials from three agencies  identified a challenge related to the lack of clear guidance for Agile  software development, particularly when agency software  development guidance reflected a waterfall approach. For example,  one official said that it was challenging to develop policy and  procedure guidance for iterative projects because they were new, and  the agency strategy aligned with the waterfall approach. As a result, it  was difficult to ensure that iterative projects could follow a standard  approach. A second official reported that deviating from waterfall- based procedural guidance to follow Agile methods made people  nervous.

One official stated that working with federal procurement  practices presents a challenge where they do not support the flexibility  required. For example, he said that federal contracts that require  onerous, waterfall-based artifacts to constantly evaluate contractor  performance are not needed in an Agile approach when the contractor  is part of the team whose performance is based on the delivery of an  iteration.

Specifically, one agency official said customers expecting a total  solution feared that the initial demonstrations of functionality provided  in the current iteration would be considered good enough, and they  would not receive further software deliveries implementing the  remainder of their requirements. At another agency, an official said  this fear contributed to customers finding it difficult to define done.  Specifically, customers were challenged in defining when each  requirement would be considered done because they were afraid that  this would be viewed as meaning all related functions were being met,  and that unmet requirements would be dropped and never  implemented.", "Teams had difficulty managing iterative requirements: Teams  provide input on prioritizing requirements, and deciding what to do  with new requirements discovered during iterations. Two agencies\u2019  officials reported challenges managing requirements. Specifically, one  official reported that customers were initially challenged to validate  and prioritize which requirements would be assigned to a release.  Using the waterfall development model, they were used to identifying  all requirements up front and not revisiting them as they were  developed. The second official said they were challenged to  accommodate new requirements within the fixed schedule for a  product release.", "Compliance reviews were difficult to execute within an iteration  time frame: Iterations may incorporate compliance reviews to ensure,  for example, that agency legal and policy requirements are being met  within the iteration. One agency official reported a challenge obtaining  compliance reviews within the short, fixed time frame of an iteration  because reviewers followed a slower waterfall schedule. Specifically,  the official said that compliance reviewers queued requests as they  arose and that the reviews could take months to perform. This caused  delays for iterations that needed such reviews within the few weeks of  the iteration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["Agile advocates evaluation of working software over the documentation  and milestone reporting typical in traditional project management.

For example, one official said federal  oversight bodies want status reports at waterfall-based milestones  rather than timely statements regarding the current state of the  project. The second official said OMB\u2019s IT investment business case  (known as the exhibit 300) and IT Dashboard, a publicly available  website that displays detailed information on federal agencies\u2019 major  IT investments, are waterfall-based. For example, the IT Dashboard  calls for monthly statistics instead of demonstrations of working  software. He also noted that it is frustrating when dashboard statistics  are flagged in red to note deviations, even when the deviation is  positive, such as being ahead of schedule and under cost.", "Traditional artifact reviews do not align with Agile: Traditional  oversight requires detailed artifacts in the beginning of a project, such  as cost estimates and strategic plans, while Agile advocates  incremental analysis. One agency official noted that requiring these  artifacts so early was challenging because it was more worthwhile to  start with a high-level cost estimate and vision to be updated as the  solution was refined through iterations, rather than spending time  estimating costs and strategies that may change.", "Traditional status tracking does not align with Agile: Officials from  three agencies noted that project status tracking in Agile does not  align with traditional status tracking methods, creating challenges. For  example, one official said that tracking the level of effort using story  points instead of the traditional estimating technique based on hours  was a challenge because team members were not used to that  estimation method, although eventually this method was embraced.  Two other agency officials said EVM was challenging to apply in an  Agile environment. Specifically, one official said that the required use  of EVM was challenging because there was no guidance on how to  adapt it to iterations. The second official found EVM challenging  because the agency was required to use it to track changes in cost,  schedule, and product scope through monthly reports, and changes  were viewed as control problems rather than as revisions to be  expected during an iteration. For example, the project\u2019s scope was  prioritized within every iteration based on the cost and schedule limits  of the iteration and release. He also noted that risk tracking in Agile  does not align with traditional risk tracking methods because issues  are addressed within an iteration rather than queued, such as in a  traditional monthly risk log.", "In addition to identifying challenges, federal officials described their efforts  to address these challenges. For example, officials said they clarify  policies to address the challenge of Agile guidance lacking clarity. To  mitigate the challenge related to customers not trusting iterative solutions,  an official said they call the iteration review a mini-critical design review.  This helps customers understand that they must declare the iteration  complete or not, known as committing to done. Another official said one  way that they addressed the challenge related to teams having difficulty  managing iterative requirements was to add an empty iteration to the end  of the release schedule to accommodate requirements discovered during  the iterations.", "In addition to the efforts at individual agencies to mitigate Agile  challenges, the Federal CIO Council has begun an effort on a related  topic. According to an official working with the Council, it is currently  drafting a document on modular development. Consistent with OMB\u2019s IT  reform efforts, the document is expected to provide guidance for agencies  seeking to use more modular development approaches, such as Agile.  However, according to the official, the draft does not specifically address  Agile effective practices. Also, in June 2012 OMB released contracting  guidance to support modular development.
