In light of these demographic trends,  policymakers have been moved to consider how the future economy can  support the large retiree population, and whether retirement income levels  will be adequate in the future. To increase their understanding about  issues related to retirement, policymakers need credible projections of the  effects of their proposals on federal spending and on future retirees\u2019  income.

In response to your request, as  agreed, we identified (1) data improvements that experts say are a priority  for the study of retirement income and wealth and (2) factors limiting  efforts to obtain the needed information.", "To address these topics, we conducted a Web based survey of nearly 200  individuals with retirement income expertise, held a daylong meeting with  a diverse group of 11 retirement income experts, and interviewed  retirement income analysts and officials of the Departments of Labor  (Labor), Commerce, and Treasury. We conducted our work between  February and December 2002 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. (For more details about our scope and  methodology, see app. I.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Forecasting future retirement income needs\u2014and how well they will be  met through current savings, pension plans, and Social Security benefits\u2014 is a challenge, in part because of the many variables involved. Although  Social Security is the primary source of income for many retirees, private  pensions and other sources of income serve as key supplements and help  retirees receive adequate income in retirement. In order to measure a  person\u2019s current income and wealth, information is needed about many  items, including the person\u2019s wage and nonwage income, home equity,  pension, and nonfinancial assets and liabilities. In addition, to project a  person\u2019s future income and wealth, researchers need information such as  a person\u2019s earnings history, whether he or she chooses to participate in the  pension plan offered by an employer, and how the person might respond  to changing incentives for saving and investing for retirement. Other  factors include whether the person chooses to accumulate savings apart  from retirement plans, how long the person remains in one job, whether  the person decides to cash out his or her retirement plan when changing  employment, level of indebtedness, and the availability of health insurance  during retirement. In addition, individuals\u2019 retirement funds depend on  employer decisions, such as what kinds of pension plans and the  availability and cost of retiree medical and long-term care insurance. To  make estimates for people in different demographic groups, not just  aggregate estimates for entire generations, analysts need to know how  these factors vary based on individuals\u2019 demographic characteristics.  Estimates of future income adequacy also rely heavily on projections of  macroeconomic factors, including estimates of future rates of inflation,  and rates of return on stocks and bonds and changes in home values.  Furthermore, retirement income data needs keep changing, in part, as a  result of trends in the pension industry and the labor force. The pension  industry provides a growing variety of pension products with different  features and legal structures. Forecasting pension income becomes more  complicated with, for example, firms\u2019 converting of traditional pension  plans into new pension hybrid products such as cash balance plans. These  plans combine features of both defined benefit and defined contribution  plans, which adds to their complexity. Changes in employment patterns,  such as the decrease in the length of time employees spend in a single job,  will also have an effect on pension income.", "The federal government collects a great deal of data pertinent to the  analysis of retirement income and wealth. Surveys of individuals and  households collected by or sponsored by the Census Bureau, the Federal  Reserve Board, BLS, and the National Institute on Aging are important  sources of information. Similarly, surveys of businesses by BLS provide  information about the pension and health care benefits firms offer their  employees. A great deal more information pertinent to the analysis of  retirement income and wealth is contained in the administrative  documents that businesses and individuals must provide to state and  federal agencies that administer governmental programs and enforce  regulations. For example, many private employers must file, on a Form  5500, annual reports concerning their employee benefit plans for the IRS,  Labor\u2019s EBSA, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC).  Many pieces of information concerning pensions and retirement savings  are also provided on forms that employers and financial institutions file  with the IRS.", "In addition to the federal government\u2019s collection of retirement income  related data, several private entities also conduct surveys that provide  useful information concerning retirement income. For example, the Health  and Retirement Study (HRS) conducted by the University of Michigan\u2019s  Institute for Social Research, is a longitudinal survey of adults over the age  of 50. The information collected includes such topics as respondents\u2019  physical and mental health, insurance coverage, financial status, family  support systems, labor market status, and retirement planning. The HRS is  supported primarily by the National Institute on Aging, with additional  funding over the years from the Social Security Administration, Labor\u2019s  EBSA, the Department of Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary  for Planning and Evaluation, and the state of Florida. Also, private benefit  consulting firms and organizations, such as the Employee Benefit  Research Institute (EBRI), conduct surveys of employers concerning  pension plans.", "Retirement income analysts currently use available retirement income and  wealth data to project future retirement income needs. For example, the  Social Security Administration has developed a forecasting model,  Modeling Income in the Near Term (MINT), to project demographic  changes, retirement income, and Social Security benefits generally for  persons born between 1931 and 1960. The Congressional Budget Office  has also developed the Congressional Budget Office Long-Term model to  study the range of possible outcomes for the balance of the Social Security  trust fund.", "In a 1997 report, the National Research Council\u2019s Panel on Retirement  Income Modeling reviewed the available sources of data on retirement  income and recommended several improvements. While the individual  recommendations covered various topics, many involved the collection of  additional information, as well as the establishment of an interagency task  force for coordination purposes. While some of the panel\u2019s  recommendations have been adopted, others have not. For example, as  the panel recommended, the federal government has continued to support  longitudinal studies. However, Labor has not acted on the panel\u2019s  recommendation that it establish an interagency task force on employer  data to plan collection of retirement income related data. In some  respects, less data are available than was the case when the report was  prepared. (See app. II for details.)", "Much of the data needed to assess retirement income and wealth are  subject to federal laws protecting the confidentiality of information  reported to the federal government. Laws limit the access to this  information. Without access, it is not possible to pull together data from  different sources to provide more complete information about individuals  or organizations. The success of data gathering efforts by federal agencies  and others relies on widespread trust that personal data will be kept  confidential, protected from disclosure, and used only for specified  purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Experts Cited Need for Better Data and Better Data Set Linkage", "paragraphs": ["Experts we consulted cited priorities for improving retirement data that fit  into two broad categories: (1) obtaining better data from employers on  employee benefits and (2) obtaining better data from individual and  household surveys by linking them with administrative data.

Retirement  income experts believed these data would allow them to more accurately  measure or project retirement income and wealth now and in the future  and estimate effects of potential retirement policy changes. Linkage of  data from different sources creates new information by providing data  about individuals matched to other data about the individuals from a  second set of records, such as administrative records on pension plans.  Analysts are able to use general data on some employer-sponsored  pension plans and data on households and individuals.

Panelists believed this  information would help analysts project future private pension benefits  and the effects of proposed policy changes. Panel members also  recommended that such pension data be obtained directly from  employers, citing the need for accuracy as an important factor.", "Inconsistencies have been found between employee and employer  provided data. One study, for example, compared employees\u2019 reports  concerning the employer-sponsored pension plans they were participating  in, or that were available to them, with the information about those  pension plans obtained directly from the employers. It found significant  discrepancies between the two sets of data, large enough for the authors  to urge a great deal of caution in using the household survey data for  reliable information about the actual characteristics of employer- sponsored pension plans. For example, among employees whose  employers reported that they were covered by a defined benefit plan, only  56 percent of the employees thought that they had such a plan. Likewise,  there seemed to be high levels of error in other basic details about pension  plans, such as the eligibility date for early retirement.", "Using employer-submitted forms as a source of information was suggested  as one way to increase the accuracy of pension data. Retirement income  experts agreed that the Form 5500 is an important source of pension  information available in government administrative records. Sponsors or  administrators of employee benefit plans subject to ERISA must file this  form annually. The Form 5500 was intended, in part, to measure  employers\u2019 compliance with both the fiduciary and funding provisions laid  out in ERISA legislation. The Form 5500 filed for pension plans contains  useful aggregate information about plans. It provides information about  the financial condition of the plan, annual amounts contributed by  participants, and the plan\u2019s income on investments. The form also provides  information on plan characteristics, such as plan type (defined benefit or  defined contribution), method of funding, and numbers of employees,  participants, and employees who are excluded from the plan for various  reasons.", "While the Form 5500 provides aggregate data about plans, it does not  contain information useful for calculating individual\u2019s contributions or  benefits. For example, it does not provide information on formulas for  calculating employer contributions to plans or for calculating retirees\u2019  benefits. In addition, it does not provide any data for pension plans  outside the reporting requirements of ERISA, such as those for  governmental employers, certain nonqualified plans for highly  compensated people, simplified employee pension (SEP)  plans, or  savings incentive match plans for employees (SIMPLE). Reporting and  processing requirements also mean that data from Form 5500 reports may  not be available to researchers for up to 3 years after the plan year. Finally,  Labor officials find frequent errors in information submitted on the  forms.", "Partly because of the limitations surrounding the Form 5500s, retirement  income experts are increasingly interested in access to the SPDs, which  are summaries of employers\u2019 pension offerings. The requirements of  ERISA call for SPDs to include specific details about employee pension  plans, including the type of pension plan, eligibility requirements, normal  retirement age, vesting and disqualification rules, sources of  contributions to the plan, and method by which the amount of the  contribution is calculated. ERISA required employers to file SPDs and  documents, called \u201csummaries of material modifications,\u201d describing  changes to the plans with Labor. These were made publicly available at  Labor\u2019s public disclosure room in Washington, D.C. The SPDs served many  purposes: (1) they were a source of information to employees about the  offerings included in their own pension plans, (2) they were a means of  informing Labor about what types of plans a company was offering so  Labor could perform monitoring and enforcement, (3) they also provided  researchers with a high level of detail on pension offerings. EBSA officials  noted, however, that the SPDs received by Labor were often out of date  and that it was costly to store them. In 1993 we agreed that Labor should  stop collecting paper copies of SPDs, and instead provide access to  electronic versions.", "Labor no longer collects SPDs and public access to them has become  much more limited in the last 5 years. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997  (P.L. 105-34) amended ERISA so that employers no longer need to file  SPDs with Labor. Instead, Labor was authorized to request SPDs from  employers as needed, and uses this authority primarily to assist plan  participants and beneficiaries in obtaining copies, though it has authority  to request them for other purposes. However, since the law, Labor no  longer requires that SPDs be filed, and SPDs prepared after the Taxpayer  Relief Act are not publicly accessible, either for the general public or for  researchers looking to model pension behavior."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tax Information Returns Are a Source of Information on Retirement Plans", "paragraphs": ["Our expert panelists noted that some of the pension details they need can  be found in the administrative data provided by employers and others to  the IRS. In addition to its collection of income tax returns, the IRS also  collects \u201cinformation\u201d returns, such as the W-2, which contain details of  employee information that provides valuable details relevant to future  retirement income, such as wages, tax-deferred retirement contributions,  lump sum distributions, rollovers, and retirement asset balances. In  discussing pension data that the IRS has access to from its tax forms,  experts from our panel reported that information from the Forms W-2,  5498, or 1099-R could provide important pension details. These forms  provide detail on the extent of investments in retirement plans, such as the  amount of contributions made to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA)  or the amount of money contributed by the employee to deferred  compensation plans.", "Form W-2 is a valuable source of pension data because it provides  information on whether the employer provides some form of qualified  retirement plan. The W-2 also includes amounts deducted from wages for  contributions to pension plans, as well as codes that provide more detail  on the different kinds of plans to which the contribution was made, such  as whether the plan is a SIMPLE, SEP, or some other kind of deferred  compensation plan. Besides giving more detailed information on deferred  compensation, the W-2 has another advantage in terms of the pension  information it provides: employers are required to submit one for every  employee. This requirement covers all workers for whom federal income  tax or Social Security tax is withheld, including those who do not earn  enough to be required to file individual income tax returns and those who  are not covered by any pension plan.", "Form 5498 is a form that financial institutions are required to file for all  participants to report all contributions and the fair market value of their  IRA accounts. It includes valuable pension information, including IRA  contributions; rollover contributions; and SEP, SIMPLE, and Roth IRA  contributions. Experts from the panel stated that the pension information  from Form 5498 could be important in tracking an individual\u2019s retirement  income balance with a specific custodial financial institution because it  provides information on the fair market value of those assets held by the  individual. While it does not give information on whether an employee  who has separated from an employer converts the IRA into another tax  protected IRA or pension account, this information should be reflected in  the employee\u2019s federal income tax return.", "Form 1099-R is another source of information for pension experts, which  could provide additional information on pension resources. Form 1099-R  is a statement filed by trustees concerning distributions to individuals  from pensions, annuities, retirement or Profit-Sharing Plans, and IRAs.  However, in many cases the form does not indicate whether the  distributions are lump-sum distributions or rollovers into IRAs or other  qualified plans.", "The IRS makes some tax information publicly available through its  Statistics of Income (SOI) program, which provides numerous tabulations  and articles from its analysis of tax return data. From a sample of Form  1040s, the SOI currently provides aggregate tabulations of information,  including taxable IRA distributions, deductible payments to an IRA,  payments to a self-employed retirement (Keogh) plan, and taxable  pensions and annuities. This information is provided as a sum total of  amounts accrued for the entire U.S. population that filed income tax  returns, and is also broken out in detail by income level. For example, for  the year 2000, the SOI provides taxable IRA distributions for about 9  million returns, with distributions totaling about $100 billion. While SOI  breaks down these totals by income brackets, the tables do not provide  other useful pension information such as pension accrual amounts by race  or ethnicity. These demographic characteristics could be added to the data  if individual tax return records were linked to the Census Bureau\u2019s  detailed household survey records.", "The SOI staff are preparing an article on retirement related data available  from the IRS and, in doing so, will make some retirement related aggregate  data, including information from Forms 5498 and W-2, publicly available  for the first time. They told us that they are considering making this  information available as a part of regular SOI releases, but they currently  have no formal plans to do so. The SOI tabulations being prepared include  the fair market value of pension plans, broken down by 10-year cohorts.

(For  characteristics of selected survey data sources, see table 3.) Eighty-one  percent of respondents assigned this as a high or highest priority. Data  linkage creates new information by matching data about individuals (using  names or taxpayer identification numbers) to a second set of records, such  as administrative records on pension plans, which provide additional  information. The linked data are then preserved as a new data set, with  personal identification information removed, that can generate new, fuller  information on the population. Linking existing sources of data can  provide detailed information with no additional respondent burden and at  a much lower cost than is associated with collecting new survey data.", "Our expert panelists made several suggestions for linking individual and  household survey data with administrative data sources to help improve  the analysis of retirement income and projections of the effects of policy  changes on future retirement income. For example, they suggested  expanding linkage between the Survey of Income and Program  Participation (SIPP) and administrative data sources. SIPP is a survey of  households conducted by the Census Bureau providing wide-ranging  demographic information, including different age cohorts, which makes it  an attractive source of information when linked to administrative records.  It provides, for example, information about benefits households receive  from government programs. One component of this survey deals with  retirement and pension plan coverage, in which several pension and  retirement related questions are asked. However, it lacks definitive  information on features of respondents\u2019 pension plans. Linking SIPP  information to administrative data sets is a powerful way to expand  information about how different groups will be covered in retirement. For  example, linked data sets can indicate the extent to which the availability  of various pension features differ for people in different age and  demographic groups. Such linkage can also indicate how much knowledge  respondents have about their pension plans and their retirement savings  options. Panelists said that linkage to SPDs, Form 5500 data, and Social  Security earnings and benefit histories would be especially valuable for  projecting retirement income for different demographic groups.", "Survey data on individuals have already been linked to administrative data  sources in order to improve retirement income data. The Census Bureau is  already linking SIPP records with administrative data related to retirement  income, including Social Security earnings and benefit records. However,  many potential linkages are hampered by lack of access to needed  administrative data. For example, the University of Michigan Institute for  Social Research has linked information gathered from HRS survey  participants to SPDs gathered either from the employers or by Labor prior  to 1997. Unfortunately, this process was made more difficult, and the  information less satisfactory, because the HRS researchers could only  obtain about 50 percent of the SPDs they were seeking, in part, because  employers chose not to provide the SPDs.

For example,  the Census Bureau collects retirement income and wealth information on  individuals and households using the Current Population Survey (CPS)  and SIPP. Labor collects data on pensions for both ERISA enforcement  purposes and to track pensions for statistical purposes. The IRS collects  data from individuals and firms for tax enforcement purposes.

Instead, agencies focus their data collection and analysis on data  needed to address their mission. For example, Labor\u2019s EBSA collects  information on compliance with ERISA regulations, including Form 5500  submissions. Although EBSA\u2019s strategic plan includes retirement income  data analysis efforts, its principal focus is on enforcement of ERISA.  Similarly, the Bureau of the Census collects retirement related information  in the SIPP and other surveys but its analysis of this information is  primarily in the context of its income and poverty measurement mission.  The SSA\u2019s MINT model uses an estimate of workers\u2019 pensions based on  SIPP data from the Census Bureau, which generally relies on survey  responses, has been criticized for using inaccurate estimates of  nonearnings income, including retirement income.

In approving agency  collection efforts, OMB must weigh the burden to the public against the  practical utility of the information to the agency. Panel members noted  that agencies were reluctant to propose additional data collection unless  they could clearly establish that the benefit outweighed the perceived  burden.

For example, laws set strict requirements to protect data  collected by the Census Bureau and to limit the use of taxpayer data.", "Implementing such laws requires federal agencies to restrict access to data  they collect. For example, the Census Bureau\u2019s data set that links the SIPP  with earnings and benefit records from SSA is not available to the public.  Protecting the confidentiality of such linked data sets is particularly  crucial because linked data sets may be more detailed or more sensitive  than the component data sets were before they were linked. Agency  officials must remove personal identifiers such as Social Security  numbers, names, and addresses. Even without these personal identifiers,  as more and more information is linked, the risks that individuals could be  identified increases.

If analysts permitted to use these data combine any other data  with the restricted data, the combined data are subject to the Title 13  protections. Analysts are not allowed to make copies of the data or  remove data from the secure data center. Before taking any of the results  of their work from the center, Census Bureau staff must review the results  to ensure that they meet the agency\u2019s requirements for confidentiality  protection. Thus, the results that can be taken out of the center are limited  to statistical results that do not disclose data for specific individuals. Also,  the external researchers must agree that the results of their work will be  available in the public domain and not maintained as proprietary  information.", "However, despite the government\u2019s efforts to protect the information they  collect from misuse, surveys of the public and Census Bureau interviewers  indicate that people are apprehensive about the government\u2019s use of  personal information. In a survey conducted both before and after (or just  prior to) the 2000 Census of Population and Housing, about half of the  respondents (51 percent before and 50 percent during) indicated they  thought the Census Bureau\u2019s promise of confidentiality could be trusted,  down from about 79 percent in 1990. A smaller, but still substantial  proportion of the workers conducting census interviews and providing  those promises to respondents also indicated a lack of trust in the Census  Bureau\u2019s assurances. A 1998 study indicated that 16.7 percent of Census  Bureau interviewers and 32.2 percent of non-Census Bureau interviewers  believed that the Bureau would give individual survey data to government  agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central  Intelligence Agency, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the  IRS. Federal law prohibits the Census Bureau from sharing information  about individuals with these agencies. Census Bureau information about  particular individuals or businesses is only available for statistical  purposes, not for law enforcement purposes.", "Public distrust of federal agencies\u2019 use of their personal information can  undermine people\u2019s willingness to participate in federal surveys,  potentially making the information collected less reliable. An article in  the Journal of Official Statistics noted that in the 1990s the rate at which  people refused to participate had risen for six surveys conducted by the  Census Bureau. For questions about types of income in the March 1999  CPS survey, for example, the percentage of respondents providing data for  particular items ranged from 33 percent to 78 percent. Low response rates  can undermine analysts\u2019 statistical projections if the individuals who  choose not to respond differ in important respects from those who provide  data. If the remaining respondents are dissimilar to the population being  surveyed, conclusions about the population may not be reliable. For  example, if those who chose not to respond have higher incomes,  estimates of the populations\u2019 income may not be reliable. Statisticians  make adjustments that can mitigate this problem, but the lower response  rates are, the more uncertainties remain.", "Federal agencies and researchers continue to explore options to maximize  data usefulness without compromising respondent privacy and  confidentiality. For example, the Census Bureau has received permission  from the IRS to link the survey records to additional items from IRS and  SSA records. In addition, the Census Bureau has recently increased the  number of its research data centers where approved analysts working on  approved projects can access confidential data.", "Researchers continue to explore statistical techniques for providing more  information from survey data sets while reducing the risks that  confidential information will be compromised. One well-known technique  for doing this, \u201ctop coding,\u201d involves reporting in data files only that an  individual respondent\u2019s income, for example, exceeds the \u201ctop code\u201d  amount, not the actual value. In this way, so many individuals are included  in the high-income group that their identities cannot be determined. More  sophisticated techniques include the use of methods to substitute artificial  records containing estimated values based on knowledge of the real data.  These simulated subjects are assigned number values selected to ensure  that relationships between important variables are preserved. This allows  people to remain anonymous to the researchers using the data. However,  pension experts state that this method can only accommodate certain  kinds of variables and, therefore, complex relationships between variables  may not be maintained.", "Recent legislation may enable the Census Bureau and BLS to link their  data on businesses for statistical purposes. In December 2002, the  Congress enacted the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical  Efficiency Act of 2002 as part of the E-Government Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-  347). This act permits designated statistical agencies to share information  concerning businesses for statistical purposes, but not information  concerning individuals or households. It authorizes three agencies\u2014the  Census Bureau, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and BLS\u2014to share data  on businesses with one another for statistical purposes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["With the proportion of retirees to workers expected to increase  dramatically over the next couple of decades, important decisions lie  ahead. Access to retirement income data needed to inform those decisions  has actually decreased in some respects, despite the recommendations of  the 1997 National Research Council\u2019s Panel on Retirement Income  Modeling. Although many sources of useful retirement income data  remain, retirement analysts we consulted cited shortcomings. They noted,  for example, that data shortcomings persist when no one federal agency is  responsible for coordinating efforts to fill retirement income data needs.", "Indeed, several such data needs could be met with information the federal  government already possesses or to which it already has access. For  example, Labor has the authority to obtain existing documents describing  the features of private pension plans. However, though it has this  authority, it gives employers in its National Compensation Survey a choice  about whether to provide them to support Labor\u2019s BLS statistical studies  of pension plans. To encourage voluntary participation in the survey,  Labor does not make them available to other agencies, outside analysts or  the general public. The Census Bureau gathers or collects information  about some general features of private pension plans through surveys of  households and individuals but has not yet had the opportunity to  corroborate and supplement this data using information from respondents\u2019  employers available through Labor. While information on pension and  individual retirement accounts is gathered through forms collected by the  IRS, the data are not regularly tabulated or linked to survey data, and thus,  are not available for the study of pensions.", "While improvements in data are essential for more reliable forecasts of  retirement income, protecting respondents\u2019 information and minimizing  the burden data collection efforts impose on firms and individuals are also  crucial. To sustain programs for compiling statistics about firms and  individuals, respondents must be able to trust that their personal  information will not be misused. Finding an appropriate balance between  providing wider access to data to support policy analysis and keeping data  secure is a persistent and evolving challenge that policymakers must  continually address. In addition, federal agencies need to consider both  the federal cost of these efforts and the financial and nonfinancial costs  imposed on respondents in comparison with the benefits expected from  improvements in data. While taking into account these cost  considerations, respondent concerns about increased reporting burden,  and agency concerns about maintaining confidentiality, the Congress, and  the Departments of Labor and the Treasury could take the next steps to  help fill some of the data needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["To facilitate plan participants\u2019, beneficiaries\u2019, and analysts\u2019 timely access  to information about employer-provided pension plans, the Congress  should consider directing the Secretary of Labor to obtain from plan  administrators electronic filings of all SPDs and summaries of material  modifications required by ERISA and make them publicly available in  electronic form."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To help provide the data needed to inform important policy decisions  concerning retirement programs, the Secretary of Labor should direct the  Bureau of Labor Statistics to prepare a plan to improve data for analyzing  retirement income and wealth in coordination with OMB, the Federal  Reserve Board, IRS, and the agencies represented in the Federal  Interagency Forum on Aging Related Statistics, including the Census  Bureau, SSA, and the National Institute on Aging.

Commerce had no  major comments on the report (see app. VI). Labor agreed on the need for  access to accurate data but did not agree with our recommendations to the  Secretary of Labor (see app. VII).", "Regarding our recommendation to collect electronic copies of SPDs,  Labor concluded that this is at odds with the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997,  which eliminated requirements that SPDs be regularly filed with Labor.  Although Labor still has authority to request SPDs, it had indicated in final  regulations concerning SPDs that it generally intended to limit the  exercise of its authority to requesting SPDs on behalf of participants and  beneficiaries. Labor also indicated that there was little public interest in  the SPDs. Although there was not substantial public demand for paper  copies of SPD\u2019s in Labor\u2019s Public Disclosure Room in Washington, D.C., in  the last decade there has been a great increase in policymakers\u2019 demand  for better data on retirement income in light of the rapid future increase in  the retiree population. Although in both 1993 and 1995 we supported  elimination of paper filing requirements, we also endorsed electronic  access to SPDs. We continue to believe that it is time to phase in a  requirement that SPDs be filed electronically. The costs involved should  be considerably less than those incurred filing and storing paper copies of  the documents. The burden imposed on plan administrators would not be  unreasonable. Labor estimated in 1998, for example, that it would cost an  average of $1.55 to provide SPDs for health benefit plans to each plan  participant, of which $1.00 was the estimated cost of materials and  postage. Cognizant of the shortcomings of many SPDs, experts we  consulted nonetheless indicated that better access to SPDs is a top priority  for improving retirement income data.  Accordingly, we changed our  recommendation to a Matter for Consideration for the Congress to direct  the Secretary of Labor to obtain from plan administrators electronic filings  of all SPDs and summaries of material modifications required by ERISA  and make them publicly available in electronic form.", "Regarding our recommendation that BLS prepare a plan to improve data  for analyzing retirement income and wealth, Labor indicated that past  efforts to coordinate improvements in retirement income data have not  been successful due to privacy concerns, and other issues. They stated  that the type of planning and coordination we envisioned usually is the  purview of OMB\u2019s Office of Statistical Policy, and that BLS could  participate in that coordination.  Furthermore, the extra demands placed  on staff would not be negligible. In our view, the need for improvements in  retirement income data warrants renewed efforts to address the priorities  identified by the experts we consulted. The recommendations of these  experts focused primarily on improved use of existing data to support  policy analysis, and not on additional data collection. We recognize OMB\u2019s  role overseeing information collection and developing policies to improve  government statistics. However, this does not preclude efforts by other  agencies to take the lead in developing plans for improvements focused on  data within specific subject areas such as retirement income. Because  OMB does not have the retirement income focus needed to coordinate in  this way, we have retained our original recommendation.  That  recommendation specifically identifies OMB as one of the agencies that  should be involved in the development of a plan, and the plan should be  developed in a manner consistent with OMB\u2019s policy.", "With respect to our recommendation regarding provision of SPDs before  new electronic filing requirements go into effect, Labor stated that the  need to protect the confidentiality of survey data may hamper wider  access to SPDs.  BLS, for example, assures respondents to its National  Compensation Survey that their identities will be kept confidential. The  Secretary\u2019s authority to request SPDs is delegated to EBSA. If BLS were to  obtain SPDs from EBSA it would have to reveal the identity of its  respondents and therefore would have to obtain their consent.  We  conclude that the need for improvements in retirement income data  warrants Labor\u2019s use of its existing authority to obtain SPDs for analysts  engaged in federally conducted or federally sponsored research.  Arrangements could be developed through which BLS and other statistical  agencies could both obtain SPDs and protect the identity of respondents.  They could, for example, request SPDs from a larger number of employers  without identifying which employers were being surveyed. This is the kind  of improved access to data that we envisioned BLS could take the lead in  identifying in coordination with other agencies.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Labor, the  Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, and the  Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service.

Out of our initial list of 326 experts, 27 declined to  participate, with the majority citing busy schedules or lack of sufficient  expertise as their reasons.

Continue support of longitudinal studies  Recommendation: Existing panel surveys of middle-aged and older  people should receive continued government support. Longitudinal data  from these surveys are essential to analyze retirement and savings  decisions and determine behavioral responses to changes in public and  private sector policies. Such analyses in turn are essential to develop  better models for forecasting the likely effects of alternative policy  proposals on retirement income security. In particular, the Health and  Retirement Study (HRS) and Asset and Home Dynamics Among the Oldest  Old (AHEAD) surveys should receive continued support. These surveys  should be refreshed periodically with new cohorts in order to offer insight  into how behavior changes over time.", "Status: As shown in table 2, the amounts of federal support for three  major longitudinal surveys have been sustained. The HRS and AHEAD  studies, which are now jointly funded, have increased after taking the  effects of inflation in account.", "The National Institute on Aging continues to fund the HRS and AHEAD  studies. Supplemental funding also comes from SSA. Both the AHEAD and  HRS studies have been refreshed with new cohorts. In 1998, interviews  began for a cohort of people born from 1924 to 1930 and a cohort of  people born from 1942 to 1947.", "The National Science Foundation continues to fund the PSID. Additional  support comes from the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute  on Child Health and Human Development, and the Departments of Health  and Human Services, Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development  (HUD), and Labor.", "Labor sponsors the National Longitudinal Survey (NLS) through BLS. The  NLS is conducted under contract with researchers at Ohio State  University, the University of Chicago, the Census Bureau and the  University of Wisconsin. In addition to Labor funding, financial support  has come from agencies including the National Institute of Child Health  and Human Development, the National Institute on Aging, the National  Institute on Drug Abuse, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and  Alcoholism, and the Departments of Defense, Justice, and Education.", "Recommendation: Panel surveys of middle-aged and older people should  experiment with methods to develop measures of families\u2019 total  expenditures and expenditures on housing and medical care. Such  consumption measures are important for projections of economic well  being in retirement.", "Status: The HRS and AHEAD surveys provide on a longitudinal basis  respondents\u2019 estimates of many categories of expenditures including  housing expenditures, total out-of-pocket medical expenditures, and total  expenditures, total expenditures relative to income, as well as information  on savings preferences. Labor\u2019s Consumer Expenditure Survey provides  cross-sectional rather than longitudinal data on many types of  expenditures, including housing expenditures, and medical expenditures,  and total expenditures and related income. The American Housing Survey,  sponsored by HUD, provides detail on housing expenditures . The  proposed American Community Survey also would provide limited detail  on housing expenditures. The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)  provides extensive data on medical expenditures.  3. Gather more data on younger people  Recommendation: Panel surveys of younger people, such as the National  Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), should include detailed  questionnaire modules on pension coverage, wealth, health status, and  retirement- and savings-related expectations. Such information is needed  to fully understand life-cycle behavior and to track the disparities in  income and wealth that are evident by middle age.", "Status: The NLSY asks about the total amount of retirement savings,  amounts contributed, and amounts withdrawn, and pension coverage. It  also provides information about assets and debt and limited information  about health (height, weight, and general evaluation of health), but not  retirement or savings expectations.", "In 1995-99 interviews, the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Women  (NLSYW) asked respondents the extent to which they agreed or disagree  with statements such as \u201cWork is the most meaningful part of life\u201d and  \u201cPeople who don\u2019t retire when they can afford to are foolish.\u201d The NLSYW  also asked respondents about the availability of a retirement or pension  plans in 1978 and in each round from 1978, 1983, through 1999. The 1991  and 1995-99 rounds of the survey included more detailed questions on  amounts in retirement plans, formula for calculating benefits for defined  benefit plans provided by current and previous employers, vesting status,  and expectations about retirement, such as expected amounts of benefits.  4. Collaborate to improve data quality and utility  Recommendation: Agencies and researchers involved in retirement  income-related panel surveys of individuals, and other surveys as  appropriate (such as the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) and the  Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP)), should collaborate  regularly in reviewing questionnaire content and data collection practices  to identify ways to improve data quality and utility. For example, the  bracketing technique used in HRS and AHEAD that has been  demonstrated to reduce nonresponse to important items should be  adopted in other surveys. Also, such surveys might include a common core  of questions on specific topics. The National Institute on Aging should  facilitate such collaborative efforts.", "Status: Federal agencies collaborate through entities such as (1) the  Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics, originally  established by the National Institute on Aging, National Center for Health  Statistics, and Census Bureau and (2) the Inter-Departmental Committee  on Employment-Related Health Insurance Surveys, headed by the BLS,  National Center for Health Statistics, and the Agency for Healthcare  Research and Quality. The Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology  and the Interagency Committee on Confidentiality and Data Access have  coordinated research on techniques such as the bracketing technique are  now widely used and researchers do collaborate on questionnaire design.  In addition, the Census Bureau and other statistical agencies seek  comments from a wide range of researchers on the content of questions  before fielding survey instruments. For example, the Interagency  Committee on the SIPP, which consists of representatives of interested  federal agencies, and the American Statistical Association\u2019s Survey  Research Methods Section SIPP Working Group, which consists of federal  and non-federal analysts, both advise the Census Bureau on that survey.  5. Establish interagency task force on employer data  Recommendation: Labor should establish an interagency task force on  employer data to specify an integrated plan for collecting retirement  income-related information. The plan should specify short-term and long- term goals that consider user needs, resource constraints, and the  problems of obtaining information from employers due to such factors as  low response rates, locating the appropriate respondents, and  confidentiality concerns. The task force should involve researchers,  private benefit consultants, and representatives of public and private  employers in its work.", "Status: According to officials at the Department\u2019s EBSA, Labor has not  made this a priority because its resources are limited.  6. Gather more data on benefit plan offerings  Recommendation: The employer data collection plan should include  short-term and long-term goals for obtaining improved information on the  distribution across employers of all benefit plan offerings (including  pensions, health insurance, disability insurance, retiree health insurance,  life insurance). Comprehensive baseline information is a priority need,  along with a plan for regular updating. Needed data elements include  benefit plan characteristics and costs, employer characteristics (e.g.,  number of employees, financial characteristics, wage structure), and  workforce characteristics (e.g., age structure) for public and private  employers and the self-employed.", "Status: Labor\u2019s BLS has increased the amount of information gathered  through its National Compensation Survey, which includes components  that had been gathered through the Employee Benefits Survey, the  Employment Cost Index survey, and the Occupational Compensation  Survey. The Employee Benefits Survey did not provide tabulations of the  estimated percentage of establishments providing specified types of  benefits, but the National Compensation Survey does. The survey includes  components for state and local government employers, medium and large  private employers, and small private employers, but not federal employers  or the self-employed. The survey provides data on number of employees,  employer and employee costs, wage structure, and the characteristics of  retirement benefit plans. It does provide data on the employer\u2019s cost of  providing defined benefit and defined contribution retirement programs. It  does not provide information on financial characteristics of plans (such as  assets and liabilities) and does not provide information on the age  structure of the workforce.", "In addition, the MEPS, sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research  and Quality, provides additional data on health insurance plans.  7. Redesign and enhance employee benefits survey.", "Recommendation: The employer data collection task force should give  priority to redesigning and enhancing existing data collection systems on  employer benefit offerings and related topics. Such systems include the  Employee Benefits Survey, which currently provides information for broad  categories of employe but not for employe, and the Form 5500 data  series, which serves regulatory purposes and currently has limited  research use. Consideration should be given to improving the Form 5500  series, including:    making the data more timely and accessible (e.g., on-line);   linking records over time to provide panel data;    merging the Form 5500 benefit plan information with the kind of employer  financial characteristics found in the Compustat database;    working to standardize the reporting for health care and disability plans, so  that they can be added to the Form 5500 database; and  finding ways to add information about benefit plan features to the database,  perhaps by abstracting analytically useful information from the narrative plan  descriptions that are filed with the Form 5500.", "Status: The Employee Benefits Survey (now part of the National  Compensation Survey) continues to provide data for categories of  employers, not categories of employees. It provides data by employer  industry group, employer employment size group, employee union status,  employee occupational group, and employer geographic location. BLS has  begun providing aggregate estimates for all private employers, rather than  only providing data separately for small private employers, and large  private employers, as it did in the past. However, the survey does not  cover federal, military, agricultural, fishing, forestry, or private household  employers.", "Data from IRS Form 5500 continues to become available well after the end  of the reporting year. (Data for 1998 or the 1998-99 reporting year became  available in 2002.) In part, this is because the IRS deadline for submitting  the forms is 7 months after the end of the reporting year. For example, for  a firm with a 1998 reporting year beginning December 15, 1998, and ending  December 14, 1999, the Form 5500 was due July 31, 2000. In addition,  Labor takes several months to review and edit the returns before making  them publicly available. Labor makes Form 5500 data files available to  researchers and policy analysts, but its Web site does not include links to  the data. A private firm provides a Web site with images of the completed  forms, but not compiled data sets. Labor does not link Form 5500 reports  by firm to facilitate longitudinal analysis. Linking these consolidated  reports of publicly held companies with Form 5500 data is difficult  because these reports can cover only parts of a company, more than one  company, or privately held companies. Some researchers have linked  these data for selected firms.", "Labor no longer requires that it receives the summary plan descriptions  regularly, and as a result the public no longer has access rights to new or  revised versions. Labor does, however, incorporate some data from these  plans in its National Compensation Survey data. This includes, for  example, information on normal retirement ages and formulas for  calculating employer contributions to pension plans.  8. Gather more data on labor demand for older workers  Recommendation: The employer data collection plan should include  short-term and long-term goals for obtaining information on labor demand  for older workers and the factors that may affect that demand. Needed  data elements include employment patterns of older workers,  compensation and benefit costs by age, and worker productivity by age.  Very little information on these topics is currently available, and some  raise difficult measurement issues. A reasonable short-term goal is to  sponsor case studies of employers that can help identify important  variables and feasible means of collecting them on a larger scale.", "Status: The Health and Retirement Study and other surveys provide much  data on employment patterns and salary and wages of older workers. Little  has been done, however, concerning compensation and benefits costs or  productivity by age.  9. Conduct longitudinal survey of employers and their workers  Recommendation: The employer data collection task force should  consider the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of a panel survey, which is  periodically refreshed that collects detailed information on employers and  their workers. Such a survey should cover the full universe, including  private for profit, nonprofit, and government employers, and the self- employed. Longitudinal data from an employer-based survey are needed to  analyze the factors that affect employer decisions about recruitment and  retention of older workers and benefit plan offerings and how these  decisions, in turn, affect workers.", "Status: Such a task force has not been formed and no survey like the one  the panel recommended has been undertaken. BLS has developed a  longitudinal database of business establishments, the \u201cLDB\u201d, based on  data from states\u2019 unemployment insurance programs, and the Census  Bureau continues to maintain a longitudinal establishment database  covering all private nonagricultural establishments. Neither of these  databases includes data on pensions or other retirement plans. The BLS  database provides data on employees\u2019 hours and wages. The Census  Bureau database also provides data on employment and wages, and  periodically includes data on employer contributions to pension plans and  health insurance. To some extent the HRS links data from individuals and  their employers on a longitudinal basis, but it tracks the individuals, not  the firms over time. The E-Government Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-347) may  facilitate collaboration between the Census Bureau and BLS and could  provide for linking National Compensation Survey (NCS) data on  retirement plans to the Census Bureau\u2019s data on business establishments.  10. Gather more data from employers of HRS/AHEAD          sample members  Recommendation: HRS and AHEAD should develop and implement a  plan for obtaining information on a continuing basis on the pension and  health insurance offerings of the employers of the HRS/AHEAD sample  members.", "Status: Data from HRS sample members\u2019 employers is available. Similar  efforts have been undertaken with other surveys, such as the National  Longitudinal Study of Mature Women.  11. Match panel survey responses and key administrative records  Recommendation: Matched files of panel survey responses and key  administrative records should be regularly produced for retirement- income-related policy analysis and projection purposes. Examples include  exact matches of survey records and Social Security earnings histories and  benefit records, Medicare and Medicaid records, and the National Death  Index. The added information in matched files is obtainable at low  marginal cost and is essential for analysis of retirement and savings  decisions and the effect of medical care use and expenditures on  retirement security.", "Status: Some matches between administrative data and panel survey data  have been achieved. HRS investigators have completed matches between  HRS and Social Security earnings and benefit record data, National Death  Index data, and Medicare records. These are available on a restricted basis  to selected researchers and policy analysts.", "The Census Bureau has matched SIPP data with Social Security earnings  records and extracts from individuals\u2019 IRS tax return data. The Census  Bureau\u2019s Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) project is  exploring options for more extensive matches between Form 5500 data  from employers and Census Bureau survey data on establishments.  Recently finalized Treasury regulations give the Census Bureau access to  specified IRS tax return records to support SIPP and LEHD data linkage  efforts.", "Also, researchers at the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI)  linked survey data to state Medicaid records in order to develop state  specific projections of Medicaid expenditures.  12. Increase researchers\u2019 access to exact match files safeguarding        confidentiality  Recommendation: Agencies should collaborate on the development and  oversight of matched data sets for individuals and employers, with input  from researchers on content. They should also vigorously explore creative  solutions for providing research access to exact match files that safeguard  the confidentiality of individual responses. Possible solutions include: (1)  developing public use files that contain summary variables derived from  the administrative records portion of the matched file (2) requiring  researchers to sign nondisclosure agreements with significant penalties for  violations; and (3) providing researchers with access to matched files on  site at secure data centers.", "Status: Access to linked data sets remains quite limited. Access to HRS  linked data for example, is typically made available via a rigorous  application process resulting in a data use agreement with the University  of Michigan. To date, none of the linked data sets are available in  encrypted public use files. However, according to HRS researchers, \u201cThe  HRS, in conjunction with several other funded projects, has established a  secure data facility to broaden access to the restricted datasets. We are  exploring ways to eventually implement a system for encrypted online  delivery of sensitive data files, as well as extend access to our restricted  data.\u201d (One such method is the further use of data centers, which provide  access to restricted information, including linked data sets, for approved  researchers working on data sets. For more information on data centers,  see page 19).  13. Fund regular evaluation of data quality  Recommendation: Budgets for retirement income-related surveys should  include sufficient resources for regular evaluation of data quality.  Evaluation methods include reinterviewing sub-samples of respondents to  measure consistency of reporting; experimentation with alternative  question wording to identify possible reporting problems; and comparing  survey estimates with administrative records to determine the  completeness and accuracy of survey reporting, taking care to adjust for  differences in definitions and other aspects of the two sources.", "Status: Several studies using the recommended methods have been  conducted, with mixed results. The Census Bureau conducted a study  comparing estimates of various types of 1990-96 incomes in SIPP and CPS  to benchmark data estimated by the Census Bureau from the personal  income estimates in the National Income and Product Accounts. The study  found disparities between the survey based Census estimates and the  administrative record based personal income estimates that could not be  explained by differences in definitions. For 1996, the aggregate wages and  salary estimate based on CPS survey data was 102 percent of the  benchmark based on administrative records and the CPS social security  and railroad retirement benefit payments data were 92 percent of the  benchmark. In contrast, the study found more substantial disparities for  several other types of income. The aggregate CPS data for property  income was 71 percent of the benchmark, and CPS data for pension  income was 77 percent of the benchmark. The study is being replicated  with data for 1999. Other studies have noted definitional and quality  differences between estimates of personal savings from the Flow of Funds  Accounts and National Income and Product Accounts. Another study  compared estimates of wealth from the SCF, PSID, and SIPP.", "The Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Tax Analysis has compared  estimates of pension plan participation and contributions with estimates  from the Census Bureau survey data. The Office of Tax Analysis linked W- 2 data with Statement of Income (SOI) data from Form 1040. The results  from this data set matched results from Census Bureau surveys, except for  low-income households. The tax records obviously don\u2019t include nonfilers,  but in addition, by design, the SOI sample includes relatively few low- income filers (in the order of 1 in 5,000 filers), but all filers in the highest  income brackets. The Census Bureau surveys such as the SIPP over  sample low income households and have much less data for the highest  income households. For most income brackets, however, the data match  quite well, according to Treasury officials.", "The Census Bureau periodically assesses the quality of CPS data by  reinterviewing a subsample of respondents, but none of the reinterviewing  has covered questions on income for at least the last 4 years, according to  the Census Bureau quality assurance staff.", "The Census Bureau has also studied the accuracy of respondent data by  matching income data in the March CPS with selected income detail on  individual IRS income tax returns and SSA earnings and benefit records. A  similar effort is underway using 1999 data.", "One of the components of the BLS\u2019s National Compensation Survey is a  program of re-interviews of a sub-sample of respondents to verify and  clarify survey data, including data on retirement plans.", "HRS investigators have compared employee responses about retirement  income to employer provided data and Social Security records and found  wide discrepancies.

While no one single survey or report collects all the pension information  panels expressed interest in, they said that some household surveys could  be linked with administrative report data from employers. Specifically,  panelists discussed the following:    The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) a household survey  conducted by the Bureau of the Census, has information on demographic  characteristics, labor force participation, and detailed information on income,  including some basic pension information. The SIPP does not gather detailed  information about the characteristics of these pensions.", "Summary Plan Descriptions (SPD), prepared by employers as required under  ERISA, provide detailed information about the characteristics of the pension  plans that they provide to their employees.  In the past, the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), which is primarily a  household survey conducted by the University of Michigan, has matched  survey data from households who permitted the Social Security  Administration to provide Social Security earnings records and benefit  records, the National Death Index, and to Medicare records for those  individuals who are Medicare eligible. HRS records also have been matched to  SPDs obtained either from Labor or from employers.", "The panelists were interested in the information available from the 1979  National Longitudinal Survey, which is sponsored by the Bureau of Labor  Statistics and gathers a wide range of information over a long time period.  Panelists felt that this information could be potentially be useful because the  participants, who initially participated as youth, are now approaching  retirement age, which would give researchers access to a lifetime of data.
