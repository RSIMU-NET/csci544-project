From fiscal years 2007 through 2011, the programs obligated at least $1.4 billion for activities that have the effect of reducing mobile source diesel emissions. The programs have varying goals and purposes; nevertheless, each program allows or requires a portion of its funding to support activities that reduce mobile source diesel emissions, such as replacing fleets of older diesel trucks or school buses with natural gas vehicles. In addition, each of the 14 programs overlaps with at least one other program in the specific activities they fund, the program goals, or the eligible recipients of funding. GAO also identified several instances of duplication where more than one program provided grant funding to the same recipient for the same type of activities. However, GAO was unable to determine whether unnecessary duplication exists because of limited information on program administrative costs, among other things. GAO did not find any gaps among the programs, such as mobile sources that are not eligible for funding.", "The effectiveness of federal funding for activities that reduce mobile source diesel emissions is unknown because agencies vary in the extent to which they have established performance measures. DOE and EPA have established performance measures for the strategic goals related to their programs that reduce mobile source diesel emissions. DOT has established such measures for two of its administrations\u0097the Federal Aviation Administration and Federal Highway Administration\u0097but has not established such measures for the Federal Transit Administration for two of the four strategic goals that link to its programs that fund diesel emissions reduction activities. Instead, agency officials said they collect information on the current condition of the nation\u0092s transit fleet, among other things, to measure the performance of its programs. As GAO has previously reported, principles of good governance indicate that agencies should establish quantifiable performance measures to demonstrate how they intend to achieve their goals and measure the extent to which they have done so. In addition, 13 of the 14 programs have purposes other than decreasing diesel emissions, and diesel reductions are a side benefit of efforts to achieve these other goals. As a result, few programs collect diesel-related performance information. Incomplete performance information may limit the ability of agencies to assess the effectiveness of their programs and activities that reduce diesel emissions.", "The programs that fund activities that reduce diesel emissions generally do not collaborate because of the differing purposes and goals of each program, according to senior DOE, DOT, and EPA officials. The officials also were sometimes unaware of other programs that fund similar activities and said that any existing collaboration was on a case-by-case basis. GAO\u0092s previous work has shown that although federal programs have been designed for different purposes, coordination among programs with related responsibilities is essential to efficiently and effectively meet national concerns.

However, exhaust from diesel engines is a more  pervasive and harmful form of air pollution than exhaust from gasoline- powered engines. Diesel exhaust contains air pollutants such as nitrogen  oxides and particulate matter, as well as other harmful substances that  affect public health and the environment. Since 1984, the Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) has implemented standards that have  progressively lowered the maximum allowable amount of certain  pollutants, including nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, from new  diesel engines by more than 98 percent. However, the most stringent  standards generally apply to diesel engines and vehicles built after 2007,  and EPA estimates that more than 20 million mobile sources of diesel  emissions built before 2007\u201413 million on-highway vehicles, 7 million  nonroad engines, and 47,000 locomotive and marine engines\u2014continue  to emit higher amounts of harmful pollutants than newer engines.", "Programs at the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of  Transportation (DOT), and EPA address mobile source diesel emissions  by funding projects that, among other things, retrofit, rebuild, or replace  existing diesel engines or vehicles; install devices that reduce idling of  diesel engines; and convert diesel engines and vehicles to use cleaner  fuels, such as natural gas or propane. The existence of these programs at  multiple agencies has raised questions about the potential for  unnecessary duplication. We have previously reported that fragmentation    and overlap among government programs can lead to such duplication. Fragmentation occurs when more than one federal agency, or more than  one organization within an agency, is involved in the same broad area of  national need. Overlap occurs when multiple agencies and programs  have similar goals, engage in similar activities or strategies to achieve  them, or target similar beneficiaries.

We then reviewed  agency documents and conducted structured interviews of agency  officials from each relevant DOE, DOT, and EPA program we identified.  We conducted interviews about the program\u2019s purpose, goals, eligible  activities, target beneficiaries, and types of funding to identify areas of  duplication, overlap, or fragmentation. We also compared the types of  eligible recipients under each program with available data on the sources  of diesel emissions to identify any gaps among the programs. In addition,  we obtained and analyzed funding data from the three agencies to  estimate the total amount of federal funding for diesel emissions reduction  projects from fiscal years 2007 through 2011. We selected this period  because, by 2007, EPA had issued emissions standards for key on-road  sources, such as heavy-duty trucks and buses, as well as a rule requiring  refiners to reduce the sulfur content of\u2014and therefore emissions from\u2014 certain diesel fuels. We reviewed documents about the underlying  databases and interviewed knowledgeable agency officials to assess the  reliability of the data for each program. We determined that the data  obtained from these agencies were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  this report. To respond to the second and third objectives, we reviewed  agency documents and conducted structured interviews with agency  officials about program goals and performance, coordination with other  programs, and assessments of diesel pollution, among other things. We  then compared these programs\u2019 efforts with best practices for federal  programs that contribute to the same outcome. To identify these best  practices, we reviewed our prior work as well as relevant statutes,  including the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 and the  Government Performance and Results Act Modernization Act of 2010.

Diesel exhaust  contains nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and numerous other harmful  chemicals. Exposure to nitrogen oxides can result in adverse respiratory  effects, and nitrogen oxides contribute to the formation of ozone, which  can cause respiratory illnesses, decreased lung function, and premature  death.

In 2008, EPA issued its most recent regulations for  new marine vessels and locomotives, which EPA expects will, by 2030,  reduce nitrogen oxide emissions from the engines of these sources by  about 80 percent and particulate matter emissions by about 90 percent  compared to previous standards.

Retrofitting existing diesel engines generally  involves the installation of emissions control devices, such as filters, on a  vehicle\u2019s tailpipe. Rebuilding components of existing diesel engines can  return engines to their original emissions levels or involve the installation  of new technology that produces lower levels of emissions. Replacing  existing diesel engines and vehicles with newer, lower emitting engines or  vehicles can lead to significant emissions reductions, but because it is a  costly option, it may be most appropriate for the oldest, most polluting  vehicles. Devices that reduce idling of diesel engines generally allow a  vehicle\u2019s heat, air conditioning, and other electrical equipment to run  without operation of the vehicle\u2019s main engine. Converting diesel vehicles  and engines to use cleaner fuels can also provide significant emissions  reductions.", "The Government Performance and Results Act, as amended, requires  agencies to prepare annual performance plans that contain, among other  things, a set of annual goals that establish the agencies\u2019 intended  performance and measures that can be used to assess progress toward  achieving those goals.

The  remaining 13 programs focus on other goals or purposes, such as  supporting energy efficiency projects or reducing petroleum use.  Nevertheless, each of these programs allows or requires a portion of its  funding to support activities that have the effect of reducing mobile source  diesel emissions. For example, authorizing legislation for DOT\u2019s  Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement program directs grant  recipients to give priority to certain activities, including retrofitting diesel  engines and vehicles. The 14 programs provide funding through one or  more mechanisms, including competitive grants, formula grants, and  loans.

According to data from DOE, DOT, and EPA,  the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided about  $870 million of this funding. The $1.4 billion amount is a lower bound  because DOT could not determine the amount of grant and loan funding  some of its programs have provided for projects that reduce mobile  source diesel emissions. According to DOT officials, the agency does not  track this information because statutory program requirements do not call  for the agency to do so. These activities that have the effect of reducing  mobile source diesel emissions include replacing fleets of older diesel  trucks or school buses with natural gas vehicles, installing particulate  matter filters on construction equipment, and replacing diesel-powered  airport luggage transporters with electric vehicles. As table 1 shows,  some of the programs that support these activities have broad purposes,  such as increasing energy efficiency in transportation, reducing petroleum  consumption, or funding public transportation projects, and other  programs have narrower purposes, such as reducing emissions at  airports, constructing ferry boats and related facilities, or promoting  alternative transportation systems in and around national parks.", "As table 2 shows, each of the 14 relevant programs overlaps with at least  one other program in the specific types of activities they fund, the  program goals, or the eligible recipients of funding. For example, 6 of the  14 programs share a broad goal of increasing energy efficiency, and local  governments are eligible to receive grants under 10 of the programs. In  addition, we found that 13 of the 14 programs fund activities that retrofit  diesel engines or vehicles, and 11 programs fund activities that reduce  diesel vehicle idling. We also identified the potential for overlap among  these 11 programs and an excise tax exemption for certain vehicle idling  reduction devices because the tax expenditure and the 11 programs all  provide incentives to use idle reduction devices to reduce diesel  emissions. Appendix III provides additional information on this and two  other tax expenditures related to diesel emissions reductions.", "We also identified several instances of duplication where more than one  program provided funding to the same recipient for the same type of  activities.

First, when different programs fund the same diesel emissions reduction  activities, it is not necessarily wasteful. For example, a transit agency  could use funds from two different programs to replace two separate  fleets of aging diesel buses. Second, grant recipients may leverage  funding from more than one program to support the full cost of diesel  emissions reduction projects. In some cases, grant recipients have used  funding from multiple agencies, in addition to local matching funds, to  support the cost of large projects that include multiple diesel emissions  reduction activities. Third, agencies were often unable to provide  information necessary to determine whether and to what extent  unnecessary duplication exists among the programs. For example,  several agencies reported that they do not track costs for administrative  functions at the program level. Without information on these costs, it is  difficult to determine whether and to what extent programs perform  duplicative administrative functions that could be consolidated to provide  grants and loans more efficiently.", "The fragmentation, overlap, and duplication among these programs  result, in part, from their legislative creation as separate programs with  different purposes that fund a wide range of activities, some of which  have the effect of reducing mobile source diesel emissions. We have  previously reported that, as the federal government has responded over  time to new needs and problems, many agencies have been given  responsibilities for addressing the same or similar national issues. Some  of this shared responsibility was intended to recognize that addressing  some issues from a national perspective would necessarily involve more  than one agency or approach. However, the resulting fragmentation,  overlap, and duplication may waste administrative resources and create  an environment in which participants are not served as efficiently and  effectively as possible.

EPA\u2019s comments can be found in  appendix V.", "In its comments, DOE questioned several of our findings but agreed with  our relevant recommendation. Specifically, DOE stated that our report  mischaracterizes the agency as having a statutory responsibility for diesel  emissions reductions. Our report does not contain such a statement.  Rather, it identifies 14 programs, including 3 DOE programs, that fund  activities with the effect of reducing diesel emissions and states that  programs with related responsibilities should coordinate their efforts. Our  report states that most of the programs we identified have other goals or  purposes and do not focus on diesel emissions reduction; nonetheless,  each of the programs does fund such activities. Our report also  recognizes the varying statutory requirements for each program and  recommends that the agencies establish a strategy for collaboration that  is consistent with their existing statutory obligations. DOE also stated that  our report mischaracterizes DOE as not collaborating with other  government agencies. Our report states that DOE collaborates with other  agencies on broad issues but does not collaborate on diesel-related  issues. In addition, DOE stated that our report mischaracterized the  agency as sharing redundant national goals with DOT and EPA. Our  report does not discuss DOE\u2019s national goals, their relationship to those  of other agencies, or whether they are redundant. Rather, our report (1)  focuses on DOE programs that fund activities that result in diesel  emissions reductions and (2) demonstrates that these programs share  similar goals with DOT and EPA programs that fund the same activities.  Specifically, each of these programs shares some goals, such as  reducing emissions, increasing energy efficiency, and reducing fuel use.  DOE also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as  appropriate. DOE\u2019s comments and our response can be found in  appendix VI.", "DOT questioned several of this report\u2019s key findings and its  recommendations. Specifically, DOT stated that we inaccurately  described the Federal Transit Administration\u2019s programs as funding diesel  emissions reduction activities. Our report identifies activities that reduce  diesel emissions, including replacing existing diesel vehicles and  installing devices that reduce idling of diesel engines, and identifies six  Federal Transit Administration programs that fund these same activities.  In addition, DOT questioned the evidence underlying our finding of  fragmentation among the federal programs within our review. DOT stated  that we identified independent programs with varying objectives that, in  some cases, include similar activities. As we reported, fragmentation  occurs when more than one federal agency, or more than one  organization within an agency, is involved in the same broad area of  national need. Further, our report does not state that fragmentation  implies small, incomplete, or broken parts strewn across government, as  DOT\u2019s comments state. Our report clearly identifies fragmentation,  overlap, and duplication among the 14 federal programs that fund diesel  emissions reduction activities. Consistent with our established definition  of fragmentation and our evidence, we stand by our finding that federal  grant and loan funding for activities that reduce diesel emissions is  fragmented across 14 programs.", "DOT also questioned our finding that the effectiveness of federal funding  for diesel emissions reduction activities is unknown. DOT stated that we  could have used available air quality data from EPA to assess the  effectiveness of the programs we reviewed. We reviewed air quality data  from EPA and determined that it was not possible to establish a causal  link between the EPA data and the programs we reviewed. Moreover,  principles of good governance indicate that agencies that use scarce  federal resources should establish quantifiable performance measures for  use in administering their programs. This is particularly important when  multiple agencies engage in the same or similar activities, even if the  activities contribute to different goals. Related to this finding, DOT  questioned why the report does not include information that the Federal  Transit Administration provided on its contribution to air quality  improvement through replacing transit buses. We reviewed this  information and found that the numbers the Federal Transit  Administration provided were based on unverified assumptions and  estimates rather than actual data on the number of diesel buses replaced.  As such, the numbers were not reliable for the purposes of our report.", "In several instances, DOT questioned our recommendation that the  Federal Transit Administration should develop quantifiable performance  measures for its environmental sustainability and economic  competitiveness strategic goals. DOT\u2019s comments on this  recommendation reflect a misinterpretation of the recommendation.  Specifically, DOT incorrectly stated that our report recommended that the  Federal Transit Administration develop quantifiable performance  measures relating to diesel emissions reductions. Neither of our  recommendations called for DOT to establish such performance  measures. Instead, we recommended that (1) the Federal Transit  Administration develop performance measures for two of its agencywide  strategic goals and (2) DOE, DOT, and EPA establish a strategy for  collaboration on diesel emissions reduction activities that, among other  things, helps the agencies develop crosscutting performance measures,  as appropriate, to assess the collective results of federal funding for  activities that reduce diesel emissions. DOT also stated that it operates in  full compliance with the Government Performance and Results Act.  Specifically, DOT said that it has established outcome-focused  performance measures that are appropriate for its programs and mission  focus. Our report does not assess DOT's compliance with the  Government Performance and Results Act. Rather, it identifies the  Federal Transit Administration's strategic goals that relate to the agency's  relevant programs and states whether the Federal Transit Administration  has developed performance measures for these goals. Our report states  that principles of good governance indicate that agencies should establish  quantifiable performance measures to demonstrate how they intend to  achieve their goals and measure the extent to which they do so. Our  report also states that Government Performance and Results Act  requirements for agencies to set goals for program performance and to  measure results can serve as leading practices for lower levels within  federal agencies. We have clarified the report language and  recommendation to state that, on the basis of these leading practices, we  recommend the Federal Transit Administration establish performance  measures for the two agency-wide strategic goals of environmental  sustainability and economic competitiveness that relate to the programs  involving diesel emissions reduction activities. The Federal Transit  Administration provided no evidence that it has established performance  measures for these strategic goals. Importantly, the agency\u2019s fiscal year  2012 budget justification that it submitted to Congress\u2014the document  that Federal Transit Administration officials said contained the agency\u2019s  goals and performance measures\u2014did not include performance  measures for its environmental sustainability and economic  competitiveness strategic goals. We continue to believe that the Federal  Transit Administration should establish performance measures for these  goals.", "Regarding our recommendation that DOE, DOT, and EPA establish a  strategy for collaboration among their programs that reduce mobile  source diesel emissions, DOT agreed that collaboration can be useful but  questioned its usefulness in this context. Specifically, DOT stated that the  report demonstrates no specific deficiency that has occurred due to the  existing level of collaboration. As our report states, DOE, DOT, and EPA  were generally unaware of other programs that fund activities that  decrease diesel emissions. Additionally, we reported that representatives  of several DOE and DOT programs were unaware of related programs  within their own agencies that fund the same underlying activities. Our  report also states that EPA officials said that enhanced collaboration  could improve the effectiveness of federal funding for activities that  reduce diesel emissions. In its comments, DOT stated that the report  does not offer evidence to support why establishing a strategy for  collaboration among entities that fund these activities should be a priority  use of federal resources. While the programs we reviewed have been  designed for different purposes, coordination among programs with  related responsibilities and that fund the same activities is essential to the  efficient and effective use of resources. Further, uncoordinated programs  can waste scarce funds and limit the overall effectiveness of federal  spending. We therefore continue to believe that our recommendation is  warranted.", "DOT also stated that the report does not effectively demonstrate that our  recommended actions will produce cost-effective investments appropriate  for DOT that do not potentially duplicate efforts elsewhere in the  government. We believe it is entirely appropriate for the Federal Transit  Administration to establish performance measures for its goals and do not  see how this would duplicate other efforts within the government. We also  continue to believe that establishing a strategy for collaboration is an  appropriate investment that would help ensure the effectiveness and  accountability of federal funding for activities that reduce diesel  emissions. As we noted, such a strategy should help agencies identify  and address any unnecessary duplication.", "Finally, DOT's comments emphasized its view that its programs focus on  their statutory mission of transit, whereas diesel emissions reduction is a  corollary benefit. Our report states that most of the programs we identified  have other goals or purposes and do not focus on diesel emissions  reduction; nonetheless, each of the programs does fund such activities.  Our report also recognizes the statutory requirements for each program  and recommends that the agencies establish a strategy for collaboration  that is consistent with existing statutory obligations.

To identify the programs that address diesel  emissions, we (1) conducted a literature review of government reports,  academic materials, legislation, transcripts, appropriations, trade and  industry articles, and other relevant publications; (2) interviewed agency  officials and relevant industry stakeholders; and (3) reviewed agency  documents, including information about activities eligible for funding. For  the literature review, we searched twenty databases and websites\u2014 Article First, Congressional Research Service, Congressional Budget  Office, Inspectors General, Policyfile, ProQuest, Worldcat, National  Technical Information Services, Wilson\u2019s Applied Science and Technical  Abstracts, and the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, among  others\u2014for materials published in the last 10 years that may identify  relevant federal grant, rebate, and loan programs. Next, we interviewed  agency and relevant third-party officials and analyzed agency documents  to determine if the programs our searches identified could provide funding  for activities that reduce diesel emissions. For this review, we identified  programs that fund activities that directly reduce diesel emissions and did  not include programs that fund activities, such as research and  development efforts, that have the potential to reduce diesel emissions in  the future. We held these interviews and conducted these searches from  June 2011 to September 2011.", "For each program we identified as reducing diesel emissions, we  conducted structured interviews of agency officials and reviewed agency  documents to determine the types of funding the program provides as  well as its purpose, goals, eligible activities, and eligible applicants. We  then compared each of these areas across the programs to identify areas  of duplication, overlap, or fragmentation. We also compared eligible  recipients under each program with available data on the sources of  diesel emissions to identify any gaps among the programs, such as  mobile sources of diesel emissions for which funding opportunities are not  available. For the duplication, overlap, and fragmentation we found, we  interviewed agency officials and relevant industry stakeholders to  determine its causes and impact.", "In addition, we obtained and analyzed funding data from the Department  of Energy (DOE), the Department of Transportation (DOT), and the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine the total amount of  federal funding for diesel emissions reduction projects from fiscal years  2007 through 2011. We selected fiscal years 2007 through 2011 as our  time period because, by 2007, EPA had issued emissions standards for  key on-road sources, such as heavy-duty trucks and buses, as well as a  rule requiring refiners to reduce the sulfur content\u2014and therefore the  emissions\u2014of certain diesel fuels. We obtained these data from DOE for  the Clean Cities, Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant, and  State Energy programs; from DOT\u2019s Federal Aviation Administration for  the Voluntary Airport Low Emissions program; from DOT\u2019s Federal  Highway Administration for the Ferry Boat and State Infrastructure Banks  programs; from DOT\u2019s Federal Transit Administration for the National  Fuel Cell Bus Technology Development and Transit Investments in  Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction programs; and from EPA for the  Diesel Emissions Reduction Act Program. However, DOT\u2019s Federal  Transit Administration was unable to provide this data for the Bus and  Bus Facilities, Clean Fuels Grant, Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality  Improvement, Transit in Parks, and Urbanized Area Formula Grants  programs. A Federal Transit Administration official said that because the  agency did not track which awards under these programs reduced diesel  emissions or diesel fuel use, it was unable to identify the amount of  funding each of these programs provided for activities that reduced diesel  emissions. The official said that the agency did not track these data  because statutory requirements do not call for such tracking. Instead, the  agency provided us access to its grants management database, from  which we estimated the amount of funding provided for diesel emissions  reduction projects for the Clean Fuels Grant, Congestion Mitigation and  Air Quality Improvement, and Transit in Parks programs, but we were  unable to estimate the amount of funding provided through the Bus and  Bus Facilities or Urbanized Area Formula Grants programs due to the  limited timeframes of our review. We reviewed documents about the  underlying databases that DOE, DOT, and EPA use to collect grant  information and interviewed knowledgeable agency officials to assess the  reliability of the data for each program. We determined that the data  obtained from these agencies were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  this report.", "In addition, the Federal Transit Administration provided estimates of the  amount that its Bus and Bus Facilities, Clean Fuels Grant, Congestion  Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement, Transit in Parks, and Urbanized  Area Formula Grants programs awarded from fiscal years 2007 through  2011 for projects that reduced diesel emissions. The agency derived  these estimates by identifying obligations made under each of these five  programs from fiscal years 2007 through 2011 for purchasing  replacement transit vehicles. However, the agency does not consistently  collect information on the fuel-type of the vehicles it replaces; rather it  collects information on the intended purchase, by fuel-type, for all  obligations made in each grant by year and program. The Federal Transit  Administration provided this information to GAO; however, this  information does not accurately reflect the amount of funding provided for  replacement vehicles that reduced diesel emissions, and we did not  include the information in this report.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed and analyzed agency  officials\u2019 responses to structured interview questions on their program  goals and performance information.

We agree that the DOE programs identified in this report fund projects  that have a secondary effect of reducing diesel emissions. As our report  states, these programs fund activities, such as retrofitting, rebuilding, or  replacing existing diesel engines or vehicles, which have the effect of  reducing diesel emissions. Our report also states that these programs  generally focus on goals or purposes that do not directly relate to  reducing diesel emissions. We did not modify our report based on this  comment.  2. Our report does not evaluate whether DOE programs have established  performance measures specific to mobile source diesel emissions  reductions. Rather, this report states that DOE has established  performance measures for the agency\u2019s strategic goals that relate to its  programs that fund diesel emissions reduction activities. We did not  modify our report based on this comment.  3. Our report recognizes that DOE, DOT, and EPA consult on broad  issues and states that the programs at these agencies that fund diesel  emissions reduction activities generally do not collaborate. We did not  review any collaboration that occurs among programs other than the 14  identified in our report or is not specifically related to diesel emissions  reductions because this was outside the scope of our review. We did not  modify our report based on this comment.  4. We disagree with DOE\u2019s statement that there is not fragmentation or  overlap among the 14 programs identified in our report. As our report  states, fragmentation occurs when more than one federal agency, or  more than one organization within an agency, is involved in the same  broad area of national need. We found that the 14 programs that fund  activities that have the effect of reducing diesel emissions are involved in  the same area of national need. Our report states that overlap occurs  when multiple agencies and programs have similar goals, engage in  similar activities or strategies to achieve them, or target similar  beneficiaries. As our report shows, each of the 14 programs shares goals,  activities, or beneficiaries with at least one other program. In addition, we  agree with DOE\u2019s statement that it does not have a quantifiable goal  associated with reducing diesel emissions. As we reported, DOE\u2019s 3  programs that fund diesel emissions reduction activities share one or  more broad goals, such as reducing emissions, increasing energy  efficiency, and reducing fuel use, with the other 11 programs that fund  these activities. We did not modify our report based on this comment.  5. We revised our report to note that DOE does not quantitatively collect  information on diesel emissions reductions. We also noted that the three  DOE programs collect some information related to diesel emissions  reductions. For example, our report states that DOE\u2019s Clean Cities  program collects information on reductions in gasoline and diesel fuel  use, and the agency\u2019s Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant  and State Energy programs estimate emissions reductions that result  from program activities. Further, we continue to believe that without  information on the results of programs\u2019 activities that reduce mobile  source emissions, the overall effectiveness of federal grant and loan  funding for activities that reduce diesel emissions cannot be determined.  6. We do not state that the secondary effect of reducing diesel emissions  is a DOE responsibility. As our report shows, each of the 3 DOE  programs we identified as funding diesel emissions reduction activities  has responsibilities related to those of the other 11 programs within our  review because they fund similar activities and have similar goals,  including increasing energy efficiency and reducing fuel use. We continue  to believe, as we state in our report, that coordination among programs  with related responsibilities is essential to efficiently and effectively meet  national concerns. Further, our report states that the DOE programs  within our review focus on purposes other than reducing diesel emissions  and lists the specific purpose for each DOE program. We did not modify  our report based on this comment.  7. We believe this report sufficiently acknowledges the impact of the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 on funding for  activities that reduce diesel emissions. Our report states that the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided $870 million of the  $1.4 billion that DOE, DOT, and EPA programs provided for activities that  reduced mobile source diesel emissions from fiscal years 2007 through  2011.
