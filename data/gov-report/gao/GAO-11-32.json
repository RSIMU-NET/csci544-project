According to VA, experts estimate that up to 20 percent of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans have experienced post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and demand for PTSD treatment is increasing. Because of the importance of research in improving the services that veterans receive, GAO was asked to report on VA's funding of PTSD research, and its processes for funding PTSD research proposals, reviewing and incorporating research outcomes into clinical practice guidelines (CPG)--tools that offer clinicians recommendations for clinical services but do not require clinicians to provide one service over another--and determining which PTSD services are required to be made available at VA facilities. To do this work, GAO obtained and summarized VA data on the funding of PTSD research from its medical and prosthetic research appropriation through its intramural research program. GAO also reviewed relevant VA documents, such as those for developing CPGs and those related to VA's 2008 Uniform Mental Health Services in VA Medical Centers and Clinics handbook (Handbook), which defines certain mental health services that must be made available at VA facilities. GAO also interviewed VA officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Based on VA data GAO obtained and summarized, GAO found that the amount of funding VA provided for intramural PTSD research increased from $9.9 million in fiscal year 2005 to $24.5 million in fiscal year 2009. From fiscal year 2005 through fiscal year 2009, intramural PTSD research funding ranged from 2.5 percent to 4.8 percent of VA's medical and prosthetic research appropriation. In addition, the number of PTSD research studies VA funded through the Merit Review Program and the Cooperative Studies Program (CSP)--VA's two primary funding mechanisms in its intramural research program--increased from 47 in fiscal year 2005 to 96 in fiscal year 2009. According to VA officials, intramural research proposals, including those on PTSD, are funded primarily according to scientific merit in both the Merit Review Program and CSP. Proposals are evaluated by a panel of reviewers and scored based on their scientific merit. Directors of VA's research and development services--offices that focus on different research areas and administer VA's intramural research program--fund proposals based on their scores, typically up to a specified percentile. The number of proposals funded may vary based on budgetary considerations and, for a small number of proposals, responsiveness to VA research priority areas. VA has a process to review and incorporate relevant research outcomes to develop CPGs for a number of topics, including PTSD. VA relies on the policies of a joint VA and Department of Defense (DOD) work group--comprised of VA and DOD officials--to ensure that systematic reviews of relevant research outcomes are conducted when issuing CPGs. In brief, a systematic review is conducted to identify the most methodologically rigorous research studies that are applicable to each clinical question contained in the CPG. A group of subject matter experts then assesses the individual research studies in order to determine the overall quality of evidence available for each particular clinical question, considers the potential benefits and harms of a clinical intervention to determine its net effect, and, based on an assessment of the overall quality of the evidence and the net effect of an intervention, develops recommendations for the CPG. According to VA officials, the decision to require that two PTSD services--cognitive processing therapy and prolonged exposure therapy--be made available at VA facilities by including them in the Handbook was based on a review of research outcomes and the availability of existing resources. Specifically, VA officials told GAO that these two services were strongly recommended in the 2004 PTSD CPG and had greater evidence supporting their effectiveness than other PTSD services. VA also told GAO that prior to the Handbook's 2008 issuance, VA had already begun investing resources in training programs for cognitive processing therapy in 2006 and prolonged exposure therapy in 2007. While VA provided some documentation regarding the decision-making process for PTSD services, VA officials explained that clinical decision-making processes are not typically expected to be documented in a formal manner. VA officials told GAO that they are currently clarifying language in the Handbook but do not plan to revise any requirements relating to PTSD services at this time. VA provided technical comments that GAO incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In addition to providing health care to about 5 million veterans each year,  the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) also funds research that focuses  on the specific health conditions that veterans may experience. One  condition that is examined in VA-funded research is post-traumatic stress  disorder (PTSD), an anxiety disorder that can occur after a person is  exposed to a life-threatening event. Veterans diagnosed with PTSD may  experience problems sleeping, maintaining relationships, and returning to  their previous civilian lives. According to VA, experts estimate that up to  20 percent of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom  veterans, up to 10 percent of Gulf War veterans, and up to 30 percent of  Vietnam War veterans have experienced PTSD. Consequently, demand for  PTSD treatment continues to grow. VA data show that from fiscal year  2004 through fiscal year 2008, the number of unique veterans receiving  treatment for PTSD increased by 60 percent from over 274,000 to over  442,000. In particular, the number of Operation Iraqi Freedom and  Operation Enduring Freedom veterans who received VA treatment for  PTSD increased from nearly 4,400 in fiscal year 2004 to over 69,000 in  fiscal year 2008.", "Veterans diagnosed with PTSD can receive a range of treatments to  manage their symptoms, including individual and group therapy and  medication. Veterans can receive PTSD treatment on an outpatient basis at  VA facilities such as medical centers, community-based outpatient clinics,  and Vet Centers. Veterans can also receive intensive treatment through  VA medical center inpatient settings for acute care needs and through  residential rehabilitation treatment programs for more prolonged  rehabilitative care.", "VA has guidance and policies in place related to PTSD services. For  example, in 2004, the joint VA/Department of Defense (DOD) Evidence- Based Practice Work Group issued a CPG for PTSD. The PTSD CPG is an  educational tool for clinicians that provides evidence-based  recommendations for PTSD services based on a review of PTSD research  outcomes. It does not require clinicians to provide one service over  another. However, in a handbook issued in 2008\u2014Uniform Mental Health  Services in VA Medical Centers and Clinics (Handbook)\u2014VA for the first  time required certain mental health services to be made available to  veterans throughout the system. For PTSD, the Handbook requires that  cognitive processing therapy or prolonged exposure therapy, two  evidence-based psychotherapies, be provided or made available at VA  facilities.", "Through its intramural research program, VA funds studies on different  topics, such as PTSD. VA intramural studies are conducted by VA  investigators\u2014that is, researchers who conduct VA research studies. VA  intramural research refers to research that is funded by and conducted  within VA. In fiscal year 2009, VA received an appropriation of $510 million  for medical and prosthetic research. This appropriation funds VA\u2019s  intramural research program, including providing funding for necessary  equipment and supplies. VA also receives three medical care  appropriations that support VA\u2019s intramural research by paying some of  the costs associated with this research, for example, the salaries of VA  investigators who are also VA clinicians. According to VA, in fiscal year  2009, VA\u2019s medical care appropriations totaled about $41 billion and VA  provided $433 million of that amount to support all research conducted at  VA facilities.", "Because of the growing demand for PTSD services and the importance of  research in improving the health care services that veterans receive, you  asked us to report on VA\u2019s funding of PTSD research, VA\u2019s processes for  reviewing PTSD research proposals, VA\u2019s incorporation of research  outcomes into clinical practice, and VA\u2019s process for determining which  PTSD services it requires VA facilities to provide or make available.

VA officials define  PTSD research as \u201cthe effort to acquire generalizable knowledge about  causes, epidemiology, susceptibility and genetics, resilience,  pathophysiology, prevention and treatment of post-traumatic stress  disorder.\u201d Based on these data, for fiscal years 2005 through 2009, we  calculated totals and trends for (1) overall intramural PTSD research  funding\u2014including PTSD research studies and other PTSD research- related funding, such as career development awards provided to junior VA  investigators to conduct PTSD studies, salaries for VA investigators who  are not VA clinicians, funding for PTSD research conducted within ORD  research centers, and PTSD research meetings, and (2) the number and  type of intramural PTSD research studies funded. According to VA, the  funding data we obtained from VA do not include funds provided to  conduct or support intramural PTSD research from VA\u2019s medical care  appropriations. Because of this, they do not necessarily represent all the  funding VA provided for PTSD research during this time. In addition, to  obtain information about how VA funds research conducted at VA, we  interviewed officials from VA\u2019s Veterans Health Administration\u2019s Office of  Finance, ORD, and Veterans Integrated Service Networks.

Reviewers on the  board are chosen based on their expertise in clinical or epidemiological  research. They typically serve 4-year terms, and ad hoc members can be  added depending on specific expertise that may be needed to review a  proposal. According to VA, as of October 2010, there were six reviewers  on the board.", "During the research proposal review process, the study team\u2014which  includes the lead researcher (referred to as the principal investigator) and  a methodologist, such as a person with expertise in biostatistics\u2014has an  interactive discussion with the board regarding the proposal.

See figure 7 for a detailed  description of the review process for CSP research proposals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: The Process for Developing VA/DOD Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines", "paragraphs": ["In 1999, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of  Defense (DOD) formed the VA/DOD Evidence-Based Practice Work Group  to issue joint VA/DOD clinical practice guidelines (CPG)\u2014tools that  provide guidance and evidence-based recommendations to clinicians  regarding the most effective interventions and services for a variety of  health care topics. To develop or update a CPG, the VA/DOD Evidence- Based Practice Work Group has a standardized process to ensure that  systematic reviews of relevant research outcomes are conducted in order  to formulate evidence-based recommendations for prevention,  assessment, and treatment services.", "To develop or update a CPG, the VA/DOD Evidence-Based Practice Work  Group identifies two clinical leaders\u2014one from VA and one from DOD\u2014 who then help identify not more than 15 to 20 other experts in the subject  area to form a \u201cguideline working group.\u201d A member of the VA/DOD  Evidence-Based Practice Work Group is also selected to be an evidence  chaperone for each CPG to ensure that conformity to prevailing standards  for conducting high-quality systematic reviews is upheld.", "To determine the scope of the CPG, the guideline working group, the  evidence chaperone, and a facilitator are responsible for identifying  clinical questions that are to be answered by a systematic review of  relevant research outcomes. According to VA officials, clinical questions  can be both broad and specific. For example, the 2004 post-traumatic  stress disorder CPG contained clinical questions regarding whether early  intervention is more effective than later intervention and whether certain  interventions, such as different psychotherapies, are more effective than  others.", "According to VA, in order to answer these clinical questions, an external  evidence center\u2014an entity that conducts systematic reviews of research  on a variety of topics\u2014is contracted to collect and review all relevant  research (including, but not limited to, VA- and DOD-sponsored research)  to assess its applicability to each clinical question under consideration  using explicit and reproducible methods. The evidence center then  focuses its review on the best available research, that is, high-quality,  methodologically rigorous studies that address health issues that impact  VA and DOD populations and consider the effectiveness as well as the  harms and benefits of the intervention at issue. According to VA officials,  the evidence center provides summaries of only the best available  research to the guideline working group for review.", "After receiving the summaries, the guideline working group reviews the  research in sequential steps using an established rating scheme developed  by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force to formulate evidence-based  recommendations. See figure 8 for an overview of the steps that the  guideline working group uses to formulate evidence-based  recommendations.", "Level of evidence. First, the guideline working group reviews the  summaries to identify the level of evidence, or the level of methodological  rigor. For example, research studies that have the highest quality are  categorized as \u201cI\u201d (indicating at least one properly done randomized  controlled trial), while research studies of the lowest quality are  categorized as \u201cIII\u201d (indicating that the research reflects the opinion of  respected authorities, descriptive studies, case reports, and expert  committees). (See table 8.)", "Overall quality of research. After determining the level of evidence of  individual research studies, the guideline working group makes a  determination regarding the overall quality of all of the research that  addresses a particular clinical question. The overall quality takes into  account the number, quality, and size of all of the individual research  studies together as well as the consistency of the results between research  outcomes to determine the collective overall strength of the research.  Based on this review, the guideline working group determines the overall  quality of the evidence to be good, fair, or poor. (See table 9.)", "Net effect of the intervention. For interventions that were supported  by studies of \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d overall quality, the guideline working group  evaluates the benefits and the potential harms to determine the net effect  of the intervention. The net effect of an intervention takes into account  the benefits of the intervention minus the harms to determine the overall  potential clinical benefit that the intervention may provide to patients. The  net effect of the intervention ranges from \u201csubstantial\u201d (meaning the  benefit substantially outweighs the harm) to \u201czero or negative\u201d (meaning it  has no impact or a negative impact on patients). (See table 10.)", "Grade of evidence-based recommendation. In the final step, the  guideline working group uses its assessment of the overall quality of the  evidence and the net effect of the intervention to grade evidence-based  recommendations.
