This is consistent with the U.N. peacekeeper's code of conduct to do no harm. This is also consistent with the U.N.'s stated opposition to discrimination against those who are HIV positive. The number of HIV-positive peacekeepers is unknown because (1) the U.N. opposes mandatory HIV testing and collects no information on infection rates and (2) countries that contribute peacekeepers either do not test or do not share test results with the U.N. The U.N. has tried to reduce the spread of HIV during peacekeeping operations, but it faces immediate and long-term challenges.

The Security Council resolution noted that an environment of  conflict and instability produces large movements of people and reduced  access to medical care, which increases the risk of HIV transmission.  The  resolution expressly encouraged member states to provide HIV prevention  training to peacekeeping personnel, including those troops who may be  HIV positive.  In January 2001, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations  expressed concern that the United Nations had not yet initiated an  adequate response to the Security Council\u2019s concerns and, in particular, the  risk of transmission between peacekeepers and civilian populations.", "Given the importance of U.N. peacekeeping efforts to U.S. foreign policy  goals and the approximately $700 million contributed to the United Nations  by the United States for these efforts in fiscal year 2001, you expressed  concern that HIV/AIDS infection could undermine the effectiveness of U.N.  peacekeeping operations. This report responds to your request that we  examine U.N. efforts to mitigate the potential impact of HIV/AIDS on its  peacekeeping missions. In this report, we (1) analyze U.N. policies and  guidance on the use and deployment of peacekeepers with HIV, (2)  examine the data available on HIV/AIDS prevalence rates among  peacekeepers, (3) assess actions the United Nations is taking to limit the  spread of HIV/AIDS among peacekeepers, and (4) examine the actions the  United Nations is taking to limit the impact of HIV/AIDS on civilians  affected by armed conflict, including groups who may come into contact  with peacekeepers.", "As part of our review, we analyzed documents and interviewed key officials  from the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the Joint United  Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, the World Health Organization, the  United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the U.N. Population Fund, and other U.N.  agencies.  We also obtained perspectives on U.N. policies and activities  from officials of the State Department and the Department of Defense.

Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) serves as the  operational arm of the U.N. Secretary General for all U.N. peacekeeping  operations and is responsible for conducting, managing, directing,  planning, and preparing those operations. DPKO is currently operating 15  peacekeeping missions, as shown in figure 1, at a budgeted cost of  approximately $2.7 billion for 2001.  As of September 2001, 88 countries  were contributing 46,957 military and civilian police personnel, and  countries are reimbursed about $1,000 per peacekeeper per month for  contributing to these missions. (See app. II for a list of the countries  contributing U.N. peacekeepers as of September 2001.)  The United States  currently contributes 732 peacekeepers and pays for 25 percent of the total  cost of peacekeeping operations. Three U.N. peacekeeping missions are in  sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 25.3 million people have HIV/AIDS.", "We recently reported that several challenges hinder the ability of the  international community to address the growing HIV/AIDS pandemic,  including limited funding for programs, cultural impediments to program  effectiveness, and weak national health care systems.  Conflicts  exacerbate these challenges because the organizations that deliver  HIV/AIDS prevention and awareness programs are unable to function  normally.  In these situations, vulnerable populations\u2013including refugees,  internally displaced persons, orphans, ex-combatants, commercial sex  workers, and war-affected local civilians\u2013face increased risk of exposure to  HIV.  Refugees, internally displaced persons, and orphans are particularly  vulnerable to HIV infection because they are at high risk of sexual violence  and exploitation and because they may use sex as a commodity to survive.  Peacekeeping missions bring peacekeepers in close proximity to these  populations.", "In resolution 1308, passed in July 2000, the U.N. Security Council  recognized that in conditions of conflict, violence, and instability there is  increased risk of exposure to HIV. Resolution 1308 encouraged U.N.  agencies to take action with member states to develop strategies to  mitigate the spread of HIV/AIDS in peacekeeping missions. In addition, the  resolution directed the Secretary General to take additional steps to  develop and provide training to peacekeepers on HIV/AIDS awareness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Department of Peacekeeping\u2019s Policy Discourages but Does Not Preclude Deployment of HIV- Positive Peacekeepers", "paragraphs": ["DPKO recommends that countries contributing to U.N. peacekeeping  operations should not send HIV-positive individuals on peacekeeping  missions for three reasons. First, medical treatment available during the  peacekeeping mission may not be adequate to meet the special  requirements of peacekeepers with HIV.  Second, peacekeepers may have  to undergo predeployment vaccinations and may be exposed to diseases  during deployment, both of which pose additional risks to their health.  Third, the presence of HIV-positive peacekeepers poses the risk of  transmission to medical personnel, fellow peacekeepers, and the civilian  population.", "DPKO officials point to the third factor as weighing heavily in their  recommendation not to deploy HIV-positive individuals.  The U.N. Code of  Conduct for Peacekeepers, although it does not address specific sexual  conduct, states that peacekeepers should do no physical, sexual, or  psychological harm.  To minimize the risk of spreading HIV to the local  population in the peacekeeping zone, DPKO officials recommend that  individuals with HIV not be sent on peacekeeping missions.", "While DPKO policy recommends against deploying individuals with HIV, its  policy also states that those who do not show clinical manifestations of  AIDS are not precluded from peacekeeping service. Therefore, DPKO  policy is consistent with the overall policy of the United Nations, which has  gone on record in several documents expressing its concern for the human  rights of individuals with HIV/AIDS and taking a stand against  discrimination against such individuals.  Specifically, the General Assembly  in a December 1991 resolution (Res. A/RES/46/203) urged U.N. member  states to avoid taking discriminatory action against individuals with HIV in  employment.  In addition, the United Nations has stated that, in general, a  public health exception to the principle of nondiscrimination, even in the  case of HIV/AIDS, is seldom a legitimate basis for restrictions on human  rights. U.N. guidelines state that mandatory testing or registration for HIV  status is not justified on public health grounds.  Finally, the U.N.\u2019s  personnel policy states that (1) the only medical criterion for recruitment is  fitness to work; (2) HIV infection does not, in itself, constitute a lack of  fitness to work; (3) there will be no HIV screening of candidates for  recruitment; and (4) there should be no obligation on the part of the  employee to inform the employer about his or her HIV/AIDS status."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The United Nations Does Not Know How Many Peacekeepers Have HIV", "paragraphs": ["The United Nations does not know how many peacekeepers have HIV/AIDS  because it opposes mandatory HIV testing before, during, or after  deployment to a peacekeeping mission and because contributing countries  either do not test or do not share test results with the United Nations.  Officials remain concerned that peacekeepers with the infection may be  deployed on peacekeeping operations, especially the approximately 14  percent of peacekeepers that come from countries with high HIV/AIDS  prevalence rates, such as Nigeria and Kenya. Even if they are not infected  before deployment, peacekeepers\u2014like other military personnel\u2014are  likely to engage in behaviors such as unsafe sexual practices that increase  the risk of contracting and spreading HIV."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The United Nations Does Not Collect Data on the HIV Status of Peacekeepers", "paragraphs": ["The United Nations opposes mandatory testing of peacekeepers for HIV  before, during, or after deployment to a peacekeeping operation. It  therefore does not know whether countries are sending HIV-positive  individuals to peacekeeping operations or how many individuals with HIV  or AIDS make up its peacekeeping forces. As a result, while the media have  reported a handful of cases of peacekeepers spreading or contracting HIV,  there is little direct information on the extent of HIV transmission in  peacekeeping operations.  (See app. III for a description of the information  available.) Furthermore, because the United Nations opposes mandatory  testing and because contributing countries retain control over their own  forces, DPKO cannot direct countries to test or keep data on HIV  prevalence among their peacekeeping forces.", "HIV testing policies vary widely among contributing countries. Some  contributing countries do not test their personnel for HIV and have no data  to share with the United Nations. For example, according to DPKO and the  Department of Defense (DOD), the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and  Nigeria, among other countries, do not screen military personnel for HIV.  Also, Zambia\u2019s military, which at one time conducted testing and screening  for HIV, is no longer financially able to do so. Together, these four countries  account for about 11 percent of current peacekeeping forces.", "Some militaries test their troops intermittently and may test peacekeepers  before, during, or after a peacekeeping operation. However, data from  these tests are not always shared with the United Nations. For example,  according to DOD, South Africa has conducted HIV testing of its rapid  deployment force used for peacekeeping operations, although it is  unknown if any of these individuals were precluded from peacekeeping  service. According to a member of the UNAIDS Steering Committee on  HIV/AIDS and Security, countries may consider this information vital to  national security because it could be considered a strategic weakness. In  addition, countries might not release this information because doing so  may jeopardize both their standing as peacekeeping contributors and the  revenue they receive in return for their participation. On the other hand, an  HIV/AIDS expert at DOD, who works closely with militaries, stated that  even those countries that test may not know the HIV/AIDS prevalence rates  of their militaries because they do not capture, store, or analyze the data  that result from the tests."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Peacekeepers Come From Countries With High HIV Prevalence Rates", "paragraphs": ["Although the United Nations does not know how many peacekeepers have  HIV, many come from countries with relatively high HIV prevalence among  the general population, leading to expectations of high prevalence among  the military, including peacekeepers. UNAIDS estimates that military  personnel are two to five times more likely than civilians to contract a  sexually transmitted infection, including HIV. In addition, according to the  National Intelligence Council, HIV prevalence in African militaries is  considerably higher than that of the general population. For example, the  Council estimates that between 10 and 20 percent of Nigeria\u2019s military is  HIV-positive, compared to a 5-percent prevalence rate for the general  population. Nigeria is the largest African contributor to U.N. peacekeeping  operations.", "More than 14 percent of peacekeepers come from countries where the  adult HIV prevalence rate is greater than 5 percent (see table 1).  According  to public health experts, prevalence levels this high make it significantly  more likely that uninfected persons in the population will be exposed to the  infection.  The higher the prevalence rate in a population, the more rapidly  the infection will spread.  The situation is most pronounced in Sierra  Leone, where 32 percent of peacekeepers originate from countries with  HIV prevalence rates greater than 5 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conditions Are Conducive to the Spread of HIV/AIDS in Peacekeeping Operations", "paragraphs": ["Peacekeepers operate in an environment where exposure to HIV is more  likely. Because peacekeepers often have money to spend, commercial sex  workers, known to have high rates of HIV infection, migrate to areas where  peacekeepers are deployed.  For example, in Ethiopia, where a U.N.  peacekeeping operation is ongoing, sex workers were found to have HIV  prevalence rates exceeding 70 percent. In addition to the presence of  commercial sex workers, peacekeeping operations are surrounded by  populations of orphans, internally displaced persons, and refugees.   According to UNAIDS, these populations may have sold sex to survive and  may have been the victims of rape or sexual violence during the conflict  preceding the peacekeeping operation.", "According to DPKO, there has been only one confirmed case of a member  of a peacekeeping mission transmitting the HIV infection.  At the same  time, there have been a number of media reports of peacekeepers  contracting HIV while on a peacekeeping mission.  However, very few have  been confirmed. According to DPKO, two Bangladeshi peacekeepers  contracted the infection in Cambodia in 1993 and one in Mozambique in  1994. In addition, a medical study in 1995 found that 10 Uruguayan  peacekeepers had contracted HIV while on a U.N. peacekeeping mission in  Cambodia.", "Despite the absence of data, U.N. and U.S. government officials have  expressed concern that peacekeepers may be transmitting or contracting  the virus during peacekeeping operations.  Surveys of military personnel  indicate that many do not practice safe sex. For example, according to the  U.N. Population Fund, a study of the Ukrainian military showed that only  10 percent of the officers surveyed practiced safe sexual behavior\u2014that is,  consistent condom use and one faithful partner\u2014while 28 percent of the  officers surveyed reported having multiple sexual partners.  In addition,  according to DOD, on a 2000 training operation in South America, about 30  percent of U.S. sailors reported having sexual contact while in ports of call,  with about 15 percent of this group saying they did not always use a  condom.  In addition, according to UNAIDS, 45 percent of Dutch  peacekeepers in Cambodia had sexual relations with commercial sex  workers or members of the local population over a 5-month period in 1993,  with approximately 11 percent of that group saying they did not always use  condoms."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.N.

The card  states that AIDS is a deadly disease caused by the HIV virus and describes  methods of protection against the disease.  The back of the card provides a  code of conduct calling for pride, respect, and consideration for law,  customs, and traditions. The card also states that peacekeepers should  limit alcohol use and avoid illegal drugs because they impair judgment and  can lead people to take risks they may not otherwise take.", "By September 2001, DPKO had distributed 15,000 HIV/AIDS awareness  cards to peacekeeping contingents in Sierra Leone.

DPKO leaves it up to contingents to include a condom  with the card. DPKO plans to distribute the HIV/AIDS awareness card to  U.N. peacekeeping operations in Ethiopia/Eritrea, Congo, East Timor, and  Kosovo.  In addition to being written in English, French, and Russian, the  card is expected to be produced in Kiswahili, Arabic, Hindi, Bengali, Urdu,  Spanish, and Portuguese.

The contributing countries are  responsible for ensuring that peacekeepers receive training before and  after deployment.", "Effective implementation of DPKO\u2019s HIV/AIDS training faces some  immediate obstacles.  First, the curriculum was developed in the United  States and does not address issues specific to some cultures. For example,  cultural practices in some parts of sub-Saharan Africa, such as social  acceptance of multiple sex partners for males and females, increase the  rates of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS.  Therefore,  according to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID),  training should be adopted to specifically address the risky behaviors  unique to peacekeepers in question.  Second, although gender issues are  broadly addressed in the train-the-trainer program, according to the U.N.  Development Fund for Women, the current HIV/AIDS training curriculum  does not adequately address gender issues necessary to sensitize  peacekeepers to respect girls and women rather than viewing them as  sexual commodities.  Third, according to UNAIDS, the training is too  technical and requires trainers to have a medical background. In addition,  HIV training competes with other training priorities, such as land mine  awareness.

DPKO relies on the commanders of each contingent to  distribute the condoms to their contingents.", "However, universal distribution of condoms to all peacekeepers faces  religious and cultural obstacles. According to DPKO, commanders from  south Asia and the Middle East object to making condoms readily available  to their uniformed forces because sex with prostitutes outside of marriage  is against their religious beliefs and would indicate tacit approval of such  behavior.
