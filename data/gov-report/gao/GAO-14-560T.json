For example, CMS has hired contractors to determine whether providers and suppliers have valid licenses and are at legitimate locations. CMS also recently contracted for fingerprint-based criminal history checks for high-risk providers and suppliers. CMS could further strengthen provider enrollment by issuing a rule to require additional provider and supplier disclosures of information and establishing core elements for provider and supplier compliance programs, as authorized by PPACA.", "Prepayment and Postpayment Claims Review : Medicare uses prepayment review to deny claims that should not be paid and postpayment review to recover improperly paid claims. GAO has found that increased use of prepayment edits could help prevent improper Medicare payments. For example, prior GAO work identified millions of dollars of payments inconsistent with selected coverage and payment policies and therefore improper. Postpayment reviews are also critical to identifying and recouping payments. GAO recommended better oversight of both the information systems analysts use to identify claims for postpayment review, in a 2011 report, and the contractors responsible for these reviews, in a 2013 report. CMS has addressed some of these recommendations.", "Addressing Identified Vulnerabilities : Having mechanisms in place to resolve vulnerabilities that could lead to improper payments is critical to effective program management and could help address fraud. However, GAO work has shown weaknesses in CMS's processes to address such vulnerabilities, placing the Medicare program and its beneficiaries at risk. For example, GAO has made multiple recommendations to CMS to remove Social Security numbers from beneficiaries' Medicare cards to help prevent identity theft, and, while HHS agreed with these recommendations, the department also reported that CMS could not proceed with the changes for a variety of reasons, including funding limitations. Thus, to date, CMS has not taken action on these recommendations.", "GAO has work underway addressing these key strategies, including assessing the potential use of electronic-card technologies to help reduce Medicare fraud. GAO is also examining the extent to which CMS's information system can prevent and detect the continued enrollment of ineligible or potentially fraudulent providers in Medicare.

We have designated Medicare as a high-risk  program since 1990, in part because we found the program\u2019s size and  complexity make it vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse. Although there  have been convictions for multimillion-dollar schemes that defrauded the  Medicare program, the extent of the problem is unknown. There are no  reliable estimates of the extent of fraud in the Medicare program or for the  health care industry as a whole. By its very nature, fraud is difficult to  detect, as those involved are engaged in intentional deception. For  example, a provider submitting a fraudulent claim may include false  documentation to substantiate a service not provided, and thus the claim  may appear valid on its face. Fraud may also involve payments made to  beneficiaries to obtain their Medicare number for fraudulent billing  purposes. Although the full extent of the problem is unknown, it is clear  that, as one of the largest programs in the federal government, the  Medicare program is vulnerable to fraud, contributing to its fiscal  problems.", "In 2013, Medicare financed health care services for approximately   51 million individuals at a cost of about $604 billion, and reported some of  the largest estimates of improper payments among federal programs\u2014 payments that either were made in an incorrect amount or should not  have been made at all. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS), the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS) that oversees Medicare, has estimated that improper payments in  the Medicare program were almost $50 billion in fiscal year 2013, about  $5 billion higher than in 2012.", "Since its inception, Medicare has been administered largely by  contractors with federal oversight and these contractors have a  responsibility to help ensure Medicare program integrity. CMS must  oversee their efforts to help ensure proper payments and address the  program\u2019s many vulnerabilities, which include service- or system-specific  weaknesses that can lead to payment errors, including those due to  fraud. If CMS suspects that providers or suppliers are billing fraudulently,  it can take action through its contractors, including suspending claims  payment, revoking billing privileges, or referring cases to law enforcement  for investigation.", "My statement today focuses on the progress made and important steps to  be taken by CMS to reduce fraud in Medicare.

CMS has also implemented other  measures intended to improve existing procedures. Specifically, to  strengthen the existing screening activities conducted by CMS  contractors, the agency added screenings of categories of provider  enrollment applications by risk level, contracted with new national  enrollment screening and site visit contractors, and began imposing  moratoria on new enrollment of certain types of providers.", "Screening Provider Enrollment Applications by Risk Level: CMS and  OIG issued a final rule in February 2011 to implement many of the  new screening procedures required by PPACA. CMS designated  three levels of risk\u2014high, moderate, and limited\u2014with different  screening procedures for categories of Medicare providers at each  level. Providers in the high-risk level are subject to the most rigorous  screening. Based in part on our work and that of OIG, CMS  designated newly enrolling home health agencies and suppliers of  durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies  (DMEPOS) as high risk, and designated other providers as lower risk  levels. Providers at all risk levels are screened to verify that they meet  specific requirements established by Medicare, such as having  current licenses or accreditation and valid Social Security numbers.  High- and moderate-risk providers are also subject to unannounced  site visits. Further, depending on the risks presented, PPACA  authorizes CMS to require fingerprint-based criminal history checks.  Last month, CMS awarded a contract that will enable the agency to  access Federal Bureau of Investigation information to help conduct  those checks of high-risk providers and suppliers. PPACA also  authorizes the posting of surety bonds for certain providers.", "CMS has indicated that the agency will continue to review the criteria  for its screening levels and will publish changes if the agency decides  to update the assignment of screening levels for categories of  Medicare providers. Doing so could become important because the  Department of Justice (DOJ) and HHS reported multiple convictions,  judgments, settlements, or exclusions against types of providers not  currently at the high-risk level, including community mental health  centers and ambulance providers. CMS\u2019s implementation of  accreditation for DMEPOS suppliers, and of a competitive bidding  program, including in geographic areas thought to have high fraud  rates, may be helping to reduce the risk of DMEPOS fraud. While  continued vigilance of DMEPOS suppliers is warranted, other types of  providers may become more problematic in the future. Specifically, in  September 2012, we found that a range of providers have been the  subjects of fraud investigations. According to 2010 data from OIG  and DOJ, over 10,000 providers that serve Medicare, Medicaid, and  Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program beneficiaries were involved in  fraud investigations, including not only home health agencies and  DMEPOS suppliers, but also physicians, hospitals, and pharmacies.In addition, the provider type constituting the largest percentage of  subjects in criminal health care fraud investigations was medical  facilities\u2014including medical centers, clinics, or practices\u2014which  constituted almost a quarter of subjects in such investigations.  DMEPOS suppliers make up a little over 16 percent of subjects.", "National Enrollment Screening and Site Visit Contractors: CMS  contracted with two new types of entities at the end of 2011 to  assume centralized responsibility for two functions that had been the  responsibility of multiple contractors. One of the new contractors is  conducting automated screenings to check that existing and newly  enrolling providers and suppliers have valid licensure, accreditation,  and a National Provider Identifier (NPI), and are not on the OIG list of  providers and suppliers excluded from participating in federal health  care programs. The second contractor conducts site visits of providers  to determine whether sites are legitimate and the providers meet  certain Medicare standards. implementation of the PPACA screening requirements, the agency  had revoked over 17,000 suspect providers\u2019 ability to bill the Medicare  program.", "Site visits for DMEPOS suppliers are to continue to be conducted by the contractor  responsible for their enrollment. In addition, CMS at times exercises its authority to  conduct a site visit or request its contractors to conduct a site visit for any Medicare  provider or supplier.", "Moratoria on Enrollment of New Providers and Suppliers in Certain  Areas: CMS suspended enrollment of new home health providers and  ambulance suppliers in certain fraud \u201chot spots\u201d and other geographic  areas. In July 2013, CMS first exercised its authority granted by  PPACA to establish temporary moratoria on enrolling new home  health agencies in Chicago and Miami, and new ambulance suppliers  in Houston. In January 2014, CMS extended its first moratoria and  added enrollment moratoria for new home health agency providers in  Fort Lauderdale, Detroit, Dallas, and Houston, and new ground  ambulance suppliers in Philadelphia. These moratoria are scheduled  to be in effect until July 2014, unless CMS extends or lifts them. CMS  officials cited areas of potential fraud risk, such as a disproportionate  number of providers and suppliers relative to beneficiaries and  extremely high utilization as rationales for suspending new  enrollments of home health providers or ground ambulance suppliers  in these areas.", "We are currently examining the ability of CMS\u2019s provider enrollment  system to prevent and detect the continued enrollment of ineligible or  potentially fraudulent providers in Medicare. Specifically, we are  assessing the process used to enroll and verify the eligibility of Medicare  providers in Medicare\u2019s Provider Enrollment, Chain, and Ownership  System (PECOS) and the extent to which CMS\u2019s controls are designed to  prevent and detect the continued enrollment of ineligible or potentially  fraudulent providers in PECOS.", "Although CMS has taken many needed actions, we and OIG have found  that CMS has not fully implemented other enrollment screening actions  authorized by PPACA. These actions could help further reduce the  enrollment of providers and suppliers intent on defrauding the Medicare  program. They include issuing a rule to implement surety bonds for  certain providers, issuing a rule on provider and supplier disclosure  requirements, and establishing the core elements for provider and  supplier compliance programs.", "Surety Bonds: PPACA authorized CMS to require a surety bond for  certain types of at-risk providers and suppliers. Surety bonds may  serve as a source for recoupment of erroneous payments. DMEPOS  suppliers are currently required to post a surety bond at the time of  enrollment. CMS reported in April 2014 that it had not scheduled for  publication a proposed rule to implement the PPACA surety bond  requirement for other types of at-risk providers and suppliers\u2014such  as home health agencies and independent diagnostic testing facilities.  In light of the moratoria that CMS has placed on enrollment of home  health agencies in fraud \u201chot spots,\u201d implementation of this rule could  help the agency address potential concerns for these at-risk providers  across the Medicare program.", "Providers and Suppliers Disclosure: CMS has not yet scheduled a  proposed rule for publication for increased disclosures of prior actions  taken against providers and suppliers enrolling or revalidating  enrollment in Medicare, as authorized by PPACA, such as whether  the provider or supplier has been subject to a payment suspension  from a federal health care program. Agency officials had indicated that developing the additional disclosure requirements has been  complicated by provider and supplier concerns about what types of  information will be collected, what CMS will do with it, and how the  privacy and security of this information will be maintained.", "Compliance Program: CMS has not established the core elements of  compliance programs for providers and suppliers, as required by  PPACA.

As claims go  through Medicare\u2019s electronic claims payment systems, they are  subjected to prepayment controls called \u201cedits,\u201d most of which are fully  automated; if a claim does not meet the criteria of the edit, it is  automatically denied. Other prepayment edits are manual; they flag a  claim for individual review by trained staff who determine whether it  should be paid. Due to the volume of claims, CMS has reported that less  than 1 percent of Medicare claims are subject to manual medical record  review by trained personnel.", "Increased use of prepayment edits could help prevent improper Medicare  payments. Our prior work found that, while use of prepayment edits saved  Medicare at least $1.76 billion in fiscal year 2010, the savings could have  been greater had prepayment edits been used more widely. Based on an analysis of a limited number of national policies and local coverage  determinations (LCD), we identified $14.7 million in payments in fiscal  year 2010 that appeared to be inconsistent with four national policies and  therefore improper. We also found more than $100 million in payments  that were inconsistent with three selected LCDs that could have been  identified using automated edits. Thus we concluded that more  widespread implementation of effective automated edits developed by  individual Medicare administrative contractors (MAC) in other MAC  jurisdictions could also result in savings to Medicare. CMS has taken  steps to improve the development of other types of prepayment edits that  are implemented nationwide, as we recommended. For example, the  agency has centralized the development and implementation of  automated edits based on a type of national policy called national  coverage determinations. CMS has also modified its processes for  identifying provider billing of services that are medically unlikely to  prevent circumvention of automated edits designed to identify an  unusually large quantity of services provided to the same patient.", "We also evaluated the implementation of CMS\u2019s Fraud Prevention  System (FPS), which uses predictive analytic technologies as required by  the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 to analyze Medicare fee-for-service  (FFS) claims on a prepayment basis. FPS identifies investigative leads for  CMS\u2019s Zone Program Integrity Contractors (ZPIC), the contractors  responsible for detecting and investigating potential fraud. Implemented in July 2011, FPS is intended to help facilitate the agency\u2019s shift from  focusing on recovering potentially fraudulent payments after they have  been made, to detecting aberrant billing patterns as quickly as possible,  with the goal of preventing these payments from being made. However, in  October 2012, we found that, while FPS generated leads for  investigators, it was not integrated with Medicare\u2019s payment-processing  system to allow the prevention of payments until suspect claims can be  determined to be valid. As of April 2014, CMS reported that while the FPS  functionality to deny claims before payment had been integrated with the  Medicare payment processing system in October 2013, the system did  not have the ability to suspend payment until suspect claims could be  investigated. In addition, while CMS directed the ZPICs to prioritize alerts  generated by the system, in our work examining the sources of new ZPIC  investigations in 2012, we found that FPS accounted for about 5 percent  of ZPIC investigations in that year. A CMS official reported last month  that ZPICs are now using FPS as a primary source of leads for fraud  investigations, though the official did not provide details on how much of  ZPICs\u2019 work is initiated through the system.", "Our prior work found that postpayment reviews are critical to identifying  and recouping overpayments. The use of national recovery audit  contractors (RAC) in the Medicare program is helping to identify  underpayments and overpayments on a postpayment basis. CMS  began the program in March 2009 for Medicare FFS. CMS reported  that, as of the end of 2013, RACs collected $816 million for fiscal year  2014. PPACA required the expansion of Medicare RACs to Parts C and  D. CMS has implemented a RAC for Part D, and CMS said it plans to  award a contract for a Part C RAC by the end of 2014. Moreover, in  February 2014, CMS announced a \u201cpause\u201d in the RAC program as the  agency makes changes to the program and starts a new procurement  process for the next round of recovery audit contracts for Medicare FFS  claims. CMS said it anticipates awarding all five of these new Medicare  FFS recovery audit contracts by the end of summer 2014.", "Other contractors help CMS investigate potentially fraudulent FFS  payments, but CMS could improve its oversight of their work. CMS  contracts with ZPICs in specific geographic zones covering the nation.  We recently found that the ZPICs reported that their actions, such as  stopping payments on suspect claims, resulted in more than   $250 million in savings to Medicare in calendar year 2012. However, CMS lacks information on the timeliness of ZPICs\u2019 actions\u2014such as the  time it takes between identifying a suspect provider and taking actions to  stop that provider from receiving potentially fraudulent Medicare  payments\u2014and would benefit from knowing whether ZPICs could save  more money by acting more quickly. Thus, in October 2013, we  recommended that CMS collect and evaluate information on the  timeliness of ZPICs\u2019 investigative and administrative actions. CMS did not  comment on our recommendation. We are currently examining the  activities of the CMS contractors, including ZPICs, that conduct  postpayment claims reviews. Our work is reviewing, among other things,  whether CMS has a strategy for coordinating these contractors\u2019  postpayment claims review activities.", "CMS has taken steps to improve use of two CMS information technology  systems that could help analysts identify fraud after claims have been  paid, but further action is needed. In 2011, we found that the Integrated  Data Repository (IDR)\u2014a central data store of Medicare and other data  needed to help CMS program integrity staff and contractors detect  improper payments of claims\u2014did not include all the data that were  planned to be incorporated by fiscal year 2010, because of technical  obstacles and delays in funding. As of March 2014, the agency had not  addressed our recommendation to develop reliable schedules to  incorporate all types of IDR data, which could lead to additional delays in  making available all of the data that are needed to support enhanced  program integrity efforts and achieve the expected financial benefits.  However, One Program Integrity (One PI)\u2014a web-based portal intended  to provide CMS staff and contractors with a single source of access to  data contained in IDR, as well as tools for analyzing those data\u2014is  operational and CMS has established plans and schedules for training all  intended One PI users, as we also recommended in 2011. However, as of  March 2014, CMS had not established deadlines for program integrity  contractors to begin using One PI, as we recommended in 2011.

CMS has indicated that it is now tracking  vulnerabilities identified from several types of contractors through a single  vulnerability tracking process, and the agency has developed some  written guidance on the process. We recently examined that process and  found that, while CMS informs MACs about vulnerabilities that could be  addressed through prepayment edits, the agency does not systematically  compile and disseminate information about effective local edits to address  such vulnerabilities. Specifically, we recommended that CMS require  MACs to share information about the underlying policies and savings  related to their most effective edits, and CMS generally agreed to do so.

In September 2013, we further  recommended that CMS (1) initiate an information technology project for  identifying, developing, and implementing changes for the removal of  Social Security numbers and (2) incorporate such a project into other  information technology initiatives. HHS concurred with our  recommendations and agreed that removing the numbers from Medicare  cards is an appropriate step toward reducing the risk of identity theft.  However, the department also said that CMS could not proceed with  changes without agreement from other agencies, such as the Social  Security Administration, and that funding was also a consideration.
