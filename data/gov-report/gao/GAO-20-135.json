In 2016, legislation required GSA to publish a single, comprehensive, and descriptive database of federal real property that would be available to the public. The database could be used for research and other potential applications. GAO was asked to study the public database. This report assesses (1) GSA's efforts to improve the reliability of FRPP's data and the public database, (2) the public database's completeness, and (3) the presentation of the data in the public database.", "GAO reviewed federal laws, documents, and data, including GSA's fiscal years 2017 and 2018 FRPP and public databases. GAO interviewed officials at GSA and from six federal agencies selected in locations with enough questionable data in the public database to analyze, among other things, and studied assets in Washington, D.C., Illinois, and New Mexico. GAO also interviewed selected stakeholders involved in federal real property management, such as real estate brokers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The General Services Administration (GSA) has worked in recent years to improve reliability of the Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP), which tracks federal real property assets. However, numerous errors in the database were carried into the public version. GSA extracted data from the FRPP's 398,000 civilian federal assets to create a public database to be used, for example, by researchers and real estate developers. However, GSA's data verification process did not address key errors. GAO found that 67 percent of the street addresses in the public database were incomplete or incorrectly formatted. For example, the database lists \u201cGreenbelt Road\u201d as the address for over 200 buildings at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, but the road stretches over 6.3 miles, thereby reducing a user's ability to locate specific buildings.", "The public database is not complete because GSA and selected agencies decided not to provide certain useful information. Specifically, GSA withheld assets' information without consulting those agencies managing the assets and allowed agencies to withhold information that is already publicly available. For example, GSA withheld the name \u201cGoddard Space Flight Center\u201d from the public database, but NASA's website lists this name and the Center's location. Unnecessarily withholding information limits the database's utility and undermines analysis.", "The public database's usefulness is further limited by how GSA presents the information. Because the database does not identify if an asset is part of a secure installation, the public does not know if assets, such as the unnamed buildings at Goddard, are accessible to the public. Unless GSA improves the public database's accuracy, completeness, and usefulness, its benefits may not be realized."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making six recommendations to GSA, including improving the accuracy of the database, consulting with agencies on assets' information withheld from the database, and improving the public database's presentation.

GSA tracks the federal government\u2019s real property assets  using a government wide database known as the Federal Real Property  Profile (FRPP) Management System, which contains data submitted  annually by agencies. We have previously reported on problems with the  reliability of the data in the FRPP, and it is one of the main reasons that  managing federal real property remains on our high-risk list. The FRPP  itself is not available to the public but does not contain any classified  national security information. The lack of publicly available data and data  quality issues have posed problems for people wanting to use the federal  real property data for various purposes, such as leasing or purchasing  space that the federal government no longer needs.", "The Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act of 2016 (FASTA) directed GSA  to release to the public a single, comprehensive, descriptive database of  federal real property. In April 2018, the then-chair of the House  Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and  Emergency Management stated that a key goal for making the data public  was to provide transparency and help hold federal agencies accountable  for reporting accurate information. In response to this act, GSA created  and released a publicly available version of the FRPP in December 2017.", "You asked that we review GSA\u2019s new public real property database.

Additionally, we reviewed GSA guidance to agencies on FRPP data  submissions for fiscal years 2016 through 2019. Further, we reviewed  prior GAO reports on federal real property. We downloaded and analyzed  data in the public database for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 (the most  recent data available since FASTA was enacted) and obtained GSA\u2019s  original FRPP data on civilian properties for this time period. To  determine the reliability of this data, we evaluated the FRPP and public  data to identify what agency data were missing per GSA\u2019s annual  guidance to agencies. We found the data sufficiently reliable for the  purpose of our reporting objectives.", "We interviewed GSA officials, as well as a non-generalizable selection of  officials from six selected agencies that are required to submit data to the  FRPP: the Department of Homeland Security (DHS); Department of  Energy (DOE); the Department of Interior (DOI); the Federal  Communications Commission (FCC); the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration (NASA); and GSA\u2019s office that submits its own  FRPP data. We selected these agencies because they were located in  areas with enough questionable FRPP data as identified by GSA to  analyze. We also interviewed a non-generalizable sample of 14  stakeholders from groups likely to use the public database, identified by  their frequent interaction with federal real property issues, among other  things, and included real estate brokers, lessors, and developers.  Specifically, we identified groups to contact from the list of participants at  a congressional roundtable discussion on the uses of the public  database and by asking officials at GSA and private-sector professionals  who specialize in federal real estate through a snowball-sampling  technique. We then used that list of potential users and search terms  related to real property data to conduct a web search for other groups that  indicated they used federal real property data and confirmed their use of  real property data.", "To assess GSA\u2019s efforts to improve the reliability of FRPP data and the  public database, we analyzed data from fiscal years 2017 and 2018 from  GSA\u2019s Validation and Verification effort, which GSA implemented to  improve the quality of FRPP. We determined how the results of this effort  carried over to the public data. We also tested the location information in  the fiscal year 2018 public data to determine the extent to which this  information was consistent with guidance for reporting inventory GSA  provided to agencies and whether the location information was user- friendly. Specifically, we determined if the data were machine-readable  (directly usable by a computer) and could be displayed in a map using  commercial off-the-shelf, geographic-information system (GIS) software.  We used the data to select and visit a non-generalizable sample of  properties from the six agencies mentioned above that were located in  proximity to our headquarters and Chicago, Illinois, field offices. We also  selected agency properties in the Los Alamos and Sandia, New Mexico,  areas because they had enough questionable data in those locations to  provide a basis for analysis. We determined if the properties\u2019  characteristics matched reported data and assessed the extent to which  these properties are accessed by the public, through direct observation or  review of agency photographs.", "To assess the completeness of the public database, we reviewed GSA  instructions to agencies and a memorandum from DHS\u2019s Interagency  Security Committee (ISC) recommending processes and criteria for  agencies to follow when determining what, if any, information to withhold  from the public database. We also reviewed selected agencies\u2019 guidance  and processes, if any, for identifying assets to withhold from the public  database. We compared the FRPP to the public database to identify data  withheld from the public database for fiscal years 2017 through 2018 to  assess how this withholding affected the completeness and usefulness of  the database and to analyze trends and consistency in selected agencies\u2019  withholding decisions. We also interviewed GSA, DHS-ISC, and selected  agency officials on internal processes for identifying what types of data  categories and specific assets they withheld from the public database.", "To assess factors that affect the usefulness of the public database, we  reviewed GSA\u2019s instructions on presenting data, specifically with regard  to how to report individual assets on secure installations that are not open  to the public. We analyzed the public database and FRPP database to  determine how agencies report assets on secure installations and how  this reporting affects the usefulness of the database. We also observed  secure federal installations in the Washington, D.C., area and in New  Mexico, to assess how the presentation of these assets in the public  database affects the usefulness of the data. These sites were among  those selected to assess GSA\u2019s efforts to improve the reliability of the  database, as described above. We interviewed GSA officials to determine  how they communicate the availability of the public database. We also  assessed GSA\u2019s website to determine how it communicates the  availability of the public database as well as three other real-property  databases as they related to the relevant provision of the Open  Government Data Act. We analyzed GSA data on the frequency with  which the public accessed the public database from December 2017  through July 2019. We also interviewed selected agency officials to  determine their views on GSA\u2019s organization of the database, such as  reporting by individual assets rather than installations. Lastly, we  interviewed the 14 third party stakeholders identified earlier to determine  their familiarity with the database and its usefulness to their work.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2018 to February  2020 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

The Public Buildings Service (PBS) acts as a landlord for the  federal government by acquiring new space for government agencies and  tracking data on the property it acquires. PBS manages and publishes  three databases that provide information to public stakeholders and  researchers on federally owned and leased properties, and on properties  eligible for disposal. Another office, the Office of Government-wide Policy  (OGP), collects, manages, and reports on all federal real-property data  through the FRPP database. OGP has managed the FRPP since its  inception in fiscal year 2005 by collecting data from federal agencies on  their real property assets. OGP is also responsible for compiling and  managing the public database required by FASTA.", "FRPP is the most comprehensive database of federal real property  holdings, containing details for about 398,000 assets (buildings,  structures, and land). It is not public, but it also does not contain any  classified national security information. FRPP data show the range of  agency assets, including single buildings in a given location or multiple  buildings located on installations, like a national park or research center.  The FRPP identifies whether buildings are on installations, but does not  identify whether buildings are public-facing or secure (and thus  inaccessible by the public).", "We have repeatedly identified reliability issues with the FRPP, and GSA  has taken actions to improve the reliability of FRPP data. Specifically, in  2016, GSA established its validation and verification (V&V) process. After  agencies submit their data annually to FRPP, GSA identifies questionable  entries (called anomalies) from 20 separate categories. Through these  categories, GSA flags assets that are very small in size, changed from  the previous year, or have unusual financial statistics, among other  things. GSA then provides an annual list of anomalies to the agencies  that entered the data. Agencies have 10 months to research each  anomaly and correct errors or validate that the data are correct. GSA has  provided instructions to agencies on how to respond to the V&V process.  GSA also requires agencies to certify accuracy of the data and  established database rules that require agencies to submit complete  information on assets. GSA officials said that it must ultimately rely on  agencies to submit correct data.", "FASTA required GSA to publish a single, comprehensive, descriptive  database of all federal real property by December 16, 2017, while  allowing it to exclude assets for reasons of national security, such as  those that are secure installations. FASTA also required the database to  be made public to the extent its release is consistent with national  security and procurement laws. GSA officials said that GSA used the  FRPP as the basis for developing the database it released to the public at  the end of 2017. GSA presents the data in two ways: as a downloadable  spreadsheet or in a searchable mapping application."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GSA\u2019s Efforts Have Not Effectively Addressed FRPP\u2019s Reliability Issues, Which Affect the Public Database", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most Street Addresses in Public Data Are Incomplete or Otherwise Unusable", "paragraphs": ["FASTA requires that the public database be machine-readable and permit  searching or sorting of data to the extent practicable. Further, GSA  guidance also calls for agencies to provide accurate and complete data.  Specifically, GSA requires agencies to include either a complete street  address or geo-coordinates for all 398,000 assets in the FRPP; for  example, GSA\u2019s FRPP data dictionary establishes the format agencies  are to use when inputting asset addresses\u2014number, street, city, zip  code. This requirement carries over to the 305,000 assets included in the  public database.", "We found that almost 214,000 of the assets in the public database  included some street address information, but most of the addresses  were incomplete or incorrectly formatted. Specifically, only approximately  70,000 (33 percent) fully met the standards. Since another 91,000 assets  did not include a street address, a computer would only be able to locate  about 23 percent of the 305,000 civilian federal assets using street  addresses in the public database (See fig. 1.) GSA officials who manage  the FRPP said that they were aware that many street addresses were not  readable and have asked agency officials to review the accuracy of  address information and correct it in future submissions. They  acknowledged, however, that their efforts were not fully successful. As  discussed later, GSA is currently taking steps to ensure that agencies  provide more complete geo-coordinates when they submit data to the  FRPP.", "For the remaining 67 percent of the assets (144,000) with some street  address information that did not fully meet the standards, we found two  types of problems\u2014incomplete addresses and addresses that were not  formatted correctly. First, more than 28,000 assets had street addresses  that were incomplete. For example, instead of having individual address  listings, we found that all 215 buildings at the Goddard Space Flight  Center had a single listing of \u201cGreenbelt Road.\u201d This road actually  stretches over 6 miles and many other buildings are located along the  road. The front gate\u2019s complete address is \u201c8800 Greenbelt Road.\u201d In  these instances, GSA officials said that its public-mapping program  selects the mid-point of the street, which in this case is over a mile from  the public entrance to the installation. (See fig. 2.) As a result, someone  using the database would not be able to determine exactly where  Goddard is.", "Second, we found about 115,000 assets had street address information  that was incorrectly formatted based on FRPP instructions. While we did  not conduct a complete analysis of all these assets, we found examples  of some of the address issues, such as:", "Extra descriptive information about the property in the address field.", "For example, \u201cN220 AG Science Bldg North U of Kentucky\u201d and  \u201cBeltsville AG Research Center, 10300 Baltimore Avenue.\u201d The data  in the address field for these two assets\u2014which belong to the  Department of Agriculture\u2014could not be directly read by a computer  or displayed on a map.", "Unrecognizable text. For example, \u201c2881 F;B Road\u201d and \u201c1-15, Exit  172, 1 Mile East.\u201d The data for these assets, which belong to the  Department of Agriculture, could not be directly read by a computer or  displayed on a map.", "GSA officials said that users may be able to interpret the individual asset  addresses in the database but that GSA\u2019s automated computer system  could not map unreadable addresses. Similarly, a private-sector user who  tried to use the public data to map federal facilities for clients said that he  was unable to map many of the assets because addresses were not  readable by his computer. As a result, he said that he excluded  incomplete or unreadable addresses from the database he created. He  noted that incomplete data would reduce clients\u2019 interest.", "We also found problems with assets for which agencies provided geo- coordinates (latitude and longitude). Specifically, GSA guidance states  that geo-coordinates must include a minimum of four decimal places. Of  the 305,000 assets included in the public database, almost 220,000  included geo-coordinates but more than half\u2014about 141,000\u2014did not  meet FRPP standards because they were not precise enough to map the  location of the assets. GSA officials noted agencies are required to  enter some type of information in the field for address or geo-coordinates,  but an \u201copen data\u201d format did not prevent agencies from reporting  information that was not strictly a street and address number.  Consequently, some agencies may have entered incorrect values for the  geo-coordinates just to complete the field. Our analysis supports this  view; few (550 of about 131,000) of the assets with both sufficiently  detailed geo-coordinates and street addresses pointed to the same  location. In addition to the open data issue described above, officials also  explained that GSA did not have a \u201cbusiness validation rule\u201d in place that  prevented agencies from inputting coordinates with less than four decimal  places.", "GSA has taken a number of actions to correct the issues with geo- coordinates that they say should help address this problem for the next  release of the public data in 2020. For example, GSA added V&V  anomaly categories for fiscal year 2018 data that identified GPS  coordinates pointing to unlikely locations, such as a location in the water,  which identified about 80,000 potential anomalies. Agencies are currently  checking these. Additionally, GSA added a feature to the fiscal year 2019  FRPP submission form that will force agencies to provide geo- coordinates that are detailed enough for their data to be accepted. GSA  officials said that they would consider taking additional steps once they  have analyzed the results of the GPS coordinate anomaly categories.", "GSA has asked agencies to review addresses for accuracy, and officials  indicated that they have discussed plans to improve this data. However,  GSA has not taken specific steps to work with agencies to ensure they  input correct street addresses in the public database in light of the \u201copen  data\u201d format. The lack of correct street addresses can affect users who  may be interested in acquiring or leasing assets or who may be interested  in installing telecommunications devices on an asset, from knowing  exactly where those assets are located. As a result, until the street  address information is complete and correctly formatted, the public may  unknowingly pursue assets that are not available or suited to their needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GSA\u2019s V&V Process Does Not Efficiently Identify Erroneous Data", "paragraphs": ["We found that while GSA has identified close to 30,000 potential errors in  the FRPP database over the first 2 years of the V&V process, agencies  confirmed only 5 percent as errors (1,291 of 28,572). Agencies validated  the remaining 27,281 anomalies as correct or left them unresolved. The  low number of errors being identified indicates that GSA\u2019s V&V process is  not efficiently identifying errors in the data, either in terms of the anomaly  categories themselves or the thresholds at which GSA flags data as an  anomaly. This situation could ultimately mean that agencies are spending  time researching correct information that was flagged as potentially  erroneous or not fully actually researching anomalies and allowing  mistakes to remain uncorrected.", "Agencies identified no anomalies as errors for five of GSA\u2019s 16 anomaly  categories in 2017, raising questions about the anomaly categories GSA  has identified. OMB guidance suggests that agencies only do extra tasks  that are justified by their cost. GSA officials who manage the V&V  process said that the high number of anomaly categories for which  agencies found no errors could reflect that the anomaly categories are  flagging correct data as anomalies or that agencies are validating data as  correct without actively checking it.", "We found examples of both. For example, we examined a selected  sample of 14 V&V data anomalies at DOE sites in New Mexico. GSA  flagged the buildings for being very small\u2014office buildings less than 400  square feet and warehouses less than 64 square feet\u2014and found that the  information in the public database was correct. Figure 3 illustrates how  such information flagged as being questionable, is actually correct  according to GSA\u2019s reporting rules for agencies, which specify data  categories, such as the types of buildings GSA considers to be  warehouses. Specifically, GSA flagged assets at DOE\u2019s Los Alamos and  Sandia National Laboratories because their square footage fell below  certain amounts. But, in reality, these assets met GSA\u2019s criteria for offices  and warehouses despite being small.", "We also found instances where an agency verified information as correct  that was incorrect. Figure 4 illustrates examples data validated as correct  that was actually erroneous. Specifically, an agency erroneously reported  water towers and antenna arrays as office buildings. Staff responsible for  managing the V&V process for their agency\u2019s assets said that they did not  always consult the personnel with the best knowledge of the assets in  resolving anomalies. Instead, they relied on their own judgment when  determining whether to forward the anomalies to asset managers to  ultimately check the data and correct any errors. This resulted in some  errors going uncorrected.", "Thresholds\u2014the points at which GSA flags data as anomalies\u2014lead to a  large number of data elements flagged, which can challenge the  resources of affected agencies. Officials at two of our selected agencies  said that the number of anomalies that the V&V process produces  annually overwhelms their ability to validate the data. The large number of  unresolved V&V anomalies appears to support this conclusion. GSA\u2019s  guidance allows agencies 10 months to validate the anomalous data, but  the number of anomalies that remain unresolved after 10 months has  risen sharply. Figure 5 shows that while agencies addressed all  anomalies in the first year, they have since struggled to keep up. As of  October 2019, 106,231 anomalies, or approximately 71 percent,  remained unresolved after 10 months.", "Officials who are responsible for resolving anomalies at two selected  agencies said that more realistic anomaly categories or thresholds could  reduce the number of anomalies and better target actual errors, an  approach that could help agencies better prioritize their resources when  researching anomalies. GSA staff who manage the FRPP said that they  brainstormed internally and used industry standards and policy initiatives  to develop anomaly categories. They also explained that they adjust  thresholds within each category. However, GSA officials said they had not  reviewed the anomaly categories or their thresholds to see if they  consistently capture incorrect data. This approach puts the stated goals of  the V&V process\u2014which are to improve data accuracy, promote data  consistency among the agencies, and enable OMB to measure data  quality improvement\u2014at risk. In the absence of better information about  the validity of categories and thresholds, the current process for V&V is  taking up limited agency resources without efficiently correcting errors in  the data."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GSA and Agencies Withheld Information That Reduces the Completeness of the Public Database", "paragraphs": ["GSA and reporting agencies decided not to provide certain useful  information from the public database in two ways, thereby reducing the  data\u2019s completeness and ultimately its utility.

FASTA authorized the withholding of information from the  public database for national security or procurement-related issues.  GSA officials who manage the FRPP said that GSA does not have the  security or intelligence expertise to issue guidance on national security  issues. As a result, they sought input from the ISC on what information to  withhold. ISC reviewed the security risks of FRPP data and provided  written recommendations in a memo to GSA in November 2017.  Specifically, ISC recommended that certain categories of data on assets  be withheld from the public database because of the security risk that  they could pose individually or in combination. ISC also recommended  that agencies use internal guidance on restricting the public release of  real property information and ISC\u2019s mission criticality criteria to  determine any individual real property assets to withhold entirely from the  public database.", "GSA implemented ISC\u2019s first recommendation by withholding 15 FRPP  data categories for all assets from the public database without consulting  the relevant agencies on this decision, considering the specific sensitivity  of these categories for all assets, or assessing the effect withholding them  would have on the database. ISC officials acknowledged that the memo  that they prepared for GSA could have been clearer as to ISC\u2019s intent that  departments and agencies should consider the recommendations in  making a final determination. According to ISC officials, they believed that  implementation would involve GSA communicating these  recommendations and leaving decisions on what to withhold to officials  within individual departments and agencies who control real property  assets.", "Specifically, the following five categories of data were among the 15  withheld by GSA: property\u2019s/installation\u2019s name,  replacement value of an asset, annual operating and maintenance costs for owned assets, annual-operating and maintenance costs for leased assets, and breakdown of annual operating and maintenance costs (e.g., utilities  costs, janitorial costs, sewage costs, etc.).", "Because GSA did not consult with agencies on this decision, the  agencies did not have an opportunity to consider whether or not the 15  data categories GSA withheld included information that is sensitive or  already publicly available. As a result, the public database is incomplete  in ways that adversely affect users and limits agencies\u2019 public  accountability for reporting accurate information. For example, identifying  assets in the public database is difficult without the property\u2019s name\u2014one  of the data categories GSA withheld\u2014especially given the insufficient  location data in the database discussed earlier. Returning to the  incomplete address example discussed earlier (NASA Goddard Space  Flight Center), the public data also do not include the property\u2019s name,  \u201cGoddard Space Flight Center,\u201d leaving users with limited information to  identify the buildings. As a result, someone using the public database  cannot identify assets on NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center campus  without using outside sources for additional information. (See table 1.)", "As discussed in the next section, we found that some of the information  from these 15 excluded data categories, such as property names, is often  already in the public sphere. For example, \u201cGoddard Space Flight Center\u201d  and its address are clearly disclosed on NASA\u2019s public website, but GSA  withheld the name for 215 NASA buildings at this address, including  Goddard\u2019s public visitors\u2019 center. Using the public database alone, a  member of the public would need to go through numerous steps to  determine if assets are part of Goddard Space Flight Center and still have  no way of being sure.

For  example, 10 of 14 stakeholders we spoke to said that financial data, such  as operating costs and annual rent, were among the most useful FRPP  data categories to their analyses of real property markets and business  opportunities.

ISC\u2019s  mission criticality criteria provide a page-long list of uses of real property  assets that warrant consideration for national security exclusion, but do  not provide other instructions for agencies to consult while making  decisions on what information to withhold. Further, OMB Circular\u2014 Management of Reporting and Data Integrity Risk also instructs agencies  to integrate a risk-based approach towards meeting reporting objectives,  an approach that requires \u201cmanagement practices that identify, assess,  respond, and report on risks.\u201d However, we found that our selected  agencies did not consistently identify internal guidance to supplement  GSA\u2019s instructions within their agencies.", "In September 2018, ISC recommended that GSA not withhold from the  public database newly added data categories that provide information  already in the public sphere. Additionally, the OPEN Government Data  Act requires OMB to foster greater sharing, dissemination, and access to  public information and issue guidance that, among other things, takes into  account the requirement that data must be disclosed if it would otherwise  be made available under a Freedom of Information Act request.

As a result, we found that some of the selected agencies  withheld asset-related information from the public database that is  available on their own public websites or from other official sources.  Withholding information that is already publicly available unnecessarily  reduces the completeness and utility of the public database that FASTA  indicated should be comprehensive. For example:", "DHS\u2019s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) withheld  buildings at five of its publicly-accessible service-processing centers  that are shown on a detention facility locator mapping system on its  own website.

This  summary-level information shields sensitive information and alerts users  that those assets are not accessible or of use to private-sector interests.  Civilian agencies\u2019 assets located on closed federal installations are similar  to those on DOD bases in that the public may have less interest in or  reason for knowing about assets that are not available to the public.  Officials from NASA and two DHS bureaus said that the installation-level  approach to reporting would be more appropriate for their circumstances  than the asset-level reporting currently applied to civilian agencies and  would likely allow them to release more information to the public.

However, according to a GSA official, the number of times users  access the public database through the GSA website doesn\u2019t necessarily  reflect the extent to which people use the data. The official explained that,  since GSA only issues the data once a year, users only need to access  and save it once for use in a given year and that GSA usually sees a  peak in users accessing the data when GSA publishes its annual update  to the database. As indicated in figure 8, there was a peak in users  accessing the database when GSA first issued the 2016 data in  December 2017, and again in March and April 2018 when GSA published  2017 data (28 and 162 times, respectively), and in June 2019 when GSA  published the 2018 data (170 times).

Through the database, the public  should be able to learn about federal assets, whether people are  conducting research or interested in potential uses such as leasing or  purchasing. Issues with the data, however, undermine these uses. GSA  has taken a number of actions to improve the accuracy of the data, such  as implementing the V&V process for identifying and correcting possible  errors. But until GSA has better processes to ensure accuracy of street  address information and identify anomalies, the public data will continue  to lack the type of database most useful to the public. Moreover, the  absence of a risk-based, consistent approach for withholding assets from  the public database or reporting assets to it further erodes its utility.  Finally, utilization of the data base is low; GSA\u2019s choices on how the  database information is presented and how users find out about and  access the public database and other real-property databases may  contribute to this lack of use.
