To complete this report, DOD tasked the military services, the Joint Staff, and the overseas combatant commands to provide information on the requirements in the mandate, including policies and procedures related to the disposal of covered waste (including certain types of hazardous waste, medical waste, and items such as tires, treated wood, and batteries) in burn pits during contingency operations. GAO found that DOD's report fully addressed four of the seven reporting requirements and partially addressed the remaining three. For example, the report addressed who is responsible for ensuring compliance with the legislative requirements, but partially addressed whether the waste categories are appropriately and clearly distinguished in surveys and assessments.", "Although DOD established guidance to meet applicable legislative requirements through the issuance of DOD Instruction 4715.19, U.S. Central Command is the only overseas geographic combatant command that has established complementary policies and procedures for implementing this guidance. The instruction applies to all the combatant commands, but it does not specify how combatant commanders will ensure compliance with requirements in the instruction. Officials from the other geographic combatant commands stated that their commands have not developed similar policies and procedures because they do not utilize burn pits and there is an absence of current contingency operations in their respective areas of responsibility. Nonetheless, while most of the overseas geographic commands may not currently be involved in contingency operations within their areas of responsibility, waste disposal would likely be required if such operations arise in the future, and the use of burn pits would be one option for disposing of waste. Establishing policies and procedures would better position these commands to implement DOD's instruction.", "The effects of exposing individuals to burn pit emissions are not well understood, and DOD has not fully assessed these health risks. DOD officials stated that there are short-term effects from being exposed to toxins from the burning of waste. However, the officials also stated that DOD does not have enough data to confirm whether direct exposure to burn pits causes long-term health issues. Although DOD and the Department of Veterans Affairs have commissioned studies to enhance their understanding of burn pit emissions, the current lack of data on emissions specific to burn pits and related individual exposures limits efforts to characterize potential long-term health impacts on servicemembers and other base personnel. A 2011 report by the Institute of Medicine outlined the data needed for assessing exposures and potential related health risks, and the Department of Veterans Affairs has established a registry to collect some information. However, DOD has not undertaken data-gathering and research efforts to specifically examine this relationship to fully understand any associated health risks."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO made three recommendations to include establishing policies and procedures and ensuring research specifically examines the relationship between direct burn pit exposure and long-term health issues.

In general, the methods employed have been left to the  discretion of base commanders and include the use of incinerators,  landfills, and open-air burn pits on or near military bases. According to  DOD officials, when making these decisions, base commanders may take  into consideration a number of factors, including the local security  situation, the number of personnel on the installation, and the amount and  type of waste generated by those personnel. As one of the options  available, burn pits help base commanders manage waste, but they also  produce smoke and harmful emissions that military and other health  professionals believe may result in acute and chronic health effects for  those exposed to the emissions.

Additionally, we reported that the military used burn pits  to dispose of waste because of their expedience, and that waste  management alternatives could decrease DOD\u2019s reliance on the use of  burn pits. We recommended that DOD implement relevant guidance  related to burn pit operations, improve its adherence to relevant guidance  on waste management, and analyze alternatives to its current practices.  DOD generally concurred with the recommendations and took actions to  address them. For example, the Army Materiel Command began focusing  on solid waste management, including burn pits, and required contractors  to segregate non-hazardous, hazardous, and recyclable materials;  establish recycling systems; and maintain all solid waste operations in  accordance with DOD guidance.", "According to DOD officials, while the Army considered alternative waste  disposal methods such as deployable, ready-made incinerators as  standard equipment to each Army unit, it ultimately decided against  issuing them due to logistical issues. Further, the use of waste disposal  alternatives other than burn pits is not always possible. For example,  DOD officials have stated that there have been times when incinerators  have not been used because of the challenges associated with obtaining  permits and visas for the personnel who were contracted to operate and  maintain them. In addition, DOD officials stated that using landfills as an  alternative waste disposal option has not always been an option because  of security concerns surrounding local landfills off base or space  constraints for landfills on base.

Numerous veterans have also filed lawsuits against a  DOD contractor alleging that the contractor mismanaged burn pit  operations at several installations in both Iraq and Afghanistan, resulting  in exposure to harmful smoke that caused these adverse health effects.  We also previously reported on the difficulty of establishing a correlation  between occupational and environmental exposures and health issues.  For example, in 2012 we found that establishing causation between an  exposure and an adverse health condition can be difficult for several  reasons, including that for many environmental exposures, there is a  latency period\u2014the time period between initial exposure to a contaminant  and the date on which an adverse health condition is diagnosed. When  there is a long latency period between an environmental exposure and an  adverse health condition, choosing between multiple causes of exposure  may be difficult.

These commands work in conjunction with the  base commander to ensure that the burn pit justification criteria are met.  The notification is then sent to the designated service component, and the  service component decides whether the notification will be further  processed. In doing so, the service component reviews the rationale,  such as the basis for the lack of alternatives, an estimate of how long  burn pits will continue to be used, or a preliminary health assessment,  and then forwards the notification to CENTCOM along with a  recommendation for approval or disapproval. Once approved by  CENTCOM, according to officials, the determination is forwarded to the  Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics  within 15 days after approval.", "The use of burn pits in the CENTCOM area of responsibility has declined  since our last report in 2010. As of June 2016, DOD officials told us that  there were no military-operated burn pits in Afghanistan and only one in  Iraq, of which Congress had been notified. According to DOD officials,  the decline in the number of burn pits from 2010 to 2016 can be attributed  to such factors as (1) using contractors for waste disposal and (2)  increased use of waste management alternatives such as landfills and  incinerators. DOD officials also acknowledged, however, that burn pits  are being used to dispose of waste in other locations that are not military- operated and that no notifications have been made in these instances  because the means of disposal are not within DOD\u2019s control.

Nonetheless, while most of the overseas  geographic commands may not currently be involved in contingency  operations within their areas of responsibility, waste disposal would likely  be required if such operations arise in the future, and the use of burn pits  would be one option for disposing of waste. Moreover, a U.S. Africa  Command official stated that while there were no known DOD-operated  burn pits in that command\u2019s area of responsibility, burn pits were being  operated by local nationals near an installation on which there were DOD  personnel.", "Moreover, DOD\u2019s guidance on burn pits in DOD Instruction 4715.19  applies to all the combatant commands, including the requirements to  make determinations in circumstances in which no alternative disposal  method for covered waste, other than in an open-air burn pit, is feasible,  and to forward those determinations to the Under Secretary of Defense  for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics. However, the instruction does  not specify how combatant commanders will ensure compliance with  requirements in the instruction, including which organizations within the  commands would be responsible for notifications, or how they would  monitor and report on the use of any burn pits. In addition, other than  requiring a solid waste management plan that addresses the use of burn  pits, the instruction does not require combatant commanders to develop  complementary policies and procedures concerning burn pits relevant to  their respective areas of responsibility. Further, according to Joint  Publication 3-0, Joint Operations, waste disposal is a consideration  throughout planning and execution, and until forces redeploy. Moreover,  according to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government,  those in key roles may further define policies through day-to-day  procedures, and these procedures may include the timing of when a  control activity occurs and any follow-up corrective actions to be  performed by competent personnel if deficiencies are identified.", "DOD officials acknowledged that limiting burn pit use for waste disposal is  important, as the relevant guidance stipulates, especially when disposing  of covered waste, because of the harmful toxins emitted in the air.  Without policies and procedures governing waste management during  contingency operations, including the use of burn pits, combatant  commanders are not well positioned to implement the requirements of  DOD Instruction 4715.19 if burn pits become necessary for disposing of  waste in a future contingency operation within their area of operation,  specifically with regard to notification procedures that are relevant  to the  conditions that exist in their respective areas of responsibility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD has not Fully Assessed the Health Risks of Burn Pits", "paragraphs": ["The impacts from exposing individuals to burn pit emissions are not well  understood, and DOD has not fully assessed these health risks.

DOD Instruction 6055.01 also instructs all DOD  components to establish procedures to ensure that risk-acceptance  decisions are documented, archived, and reevaluated on a recurring  basis. Furthermore, DOD Instruction 6055.05 requires that hazards are  identified and risk is evaluated as early as possible, including the  consideration of exposure patterns, duration, and rates. Notwithstanding  this guidance, according to DOD officials, DOD has not fully assessed the  health risks of use of burn pits.", "According to DOD officials, DOD\u2019s ability to assess these risks is limited  by a lack of adequate information on (1) the levels of exposure to burn pit  emissions and (2) the health impacts these exposures have on  individuals. With respect to information on exposure levels, DOD has not  collected data from emissions or monitored exposures from burn pits as  required by its own guidance. DOD Instruction 4715.19 requires that  plans for the use of open-air burn pits include ensuring the area is  monitored by qualified force health protection personnel for unacceptable  exposures, and CENTCOM Regulation 200-2 requires steps to be taken  to sample or monitor burn pit emissions. A DOD official stated that the  department considers open air burning and other airborne contaminant  sources when determining its monitoring strategies for the potentially  exposed population and evaluating health risks in accordance with DOD  Instructions 6490.03 and 6055.05. However, the official also stated that  DOD has not collected direct data from burn pit emissions because the  data do not represent the overall air quality to which personnel are  exposed. Additionally, CENTCOM Regulation 200-1 requires  environmental surveying to be conducted at a base if the base is  occupied or is expected to be occupied for 30 or more days, or at the  base\u2019s closure. According to DOD officials, environmental surveys are  conducted, generally once a year, and these surveys assist in identifying  both potential risks to servicemembers\u2019 health and air pollutants.  However, DOD officials stated that there are no processes in place to  specifically monitor burn pit emissions for the purposes of correlating  potential exposures. They attribute this to a lack of singular exposure to  the burn pit emissions, or emissions from any other individual item;  instead, monitoring is done for the totality of air pollutants from all sources  at the point of population exposure. An official from U.S. Africa  Command, however, stated that efforts are underway in that command\u2019s  area of responsibility to conduct an air quality study specifically because  of the use of burn pits by local nationals off the installation where DOD  personnel are housed. Given the potential use of burn pits near  installations and their potential use in future contingency operations,  establishing processes to monitor burn pit emissions for unacceptable  exposures would better position DOD and combatant commanders to  collect data that could help assess exposure to risks.", "In the absence of the collection of data to examine the effects of burn pit  exposure on servicemembers, the Department of Veterans Affairs in 2014  created the airborne hazards and open-air burn pit registry, which  allows eligible individuals to self-report exposures to airborne hazards  (such as smoke from burn pits, oil-well fires, or pollution during  deployment), as well as other exposures and health concerns. The  registry helps to monitor health conditions affecting veterans and  servicemembers, and to collect data that will assist in improving programs  to help those with deployment exposure concerns.", "With respect to the information on the health effects from exposure to  burn pit emissions, DOD officials stated that there are short-term effects  from being exposed to toxins from the burning of waste, such as eye  irritation and burning, coughing and throat irritation, breathing difficulties,  and skin itching and rashes. However, the officials also stated that DOD  does not have enough data to confirm whether direct exposure to burn  pits causes long-term health issues. Although DOD and the Department  of Veterans Affairs have commissioned studies to enhance their  understanding of airborne hazards, including burn pit emissions, the  current lack of data on emissions specific to burn pits limits DOD\u2019s ability  to fully assess potential health impacts on servicemembers and other  base personnel, such as contractors. For example, in a 2011 study that  was contracted by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Institute of  Medicine stated that it was unable to determine whether long-term health  effects are likely to result from burn pit exposure due to inadequate  evidence of an association. While the study did not determine a linkage  to long-term health effects, because of the lack of data, it did not discredit  the relationship either. Rather, it outlined a methodology of how to collect  the necessary data to determine the effects of the exposure.", "Specifically, the 2011 study outlined the feasibility and design issues for  an epidemiologic study\u2014that is, a study of the distribution and  determinants of diseases and injuries in human populations\u2014of veterans  exposed to burn pit emissions. The elements of a well-designed  epidemiologic study of the potential health effects of an environmental  exposure include identification of a relevant study population of adequate  size; comprehensive assessment of exposure; careful evaluation of  health outcomes; adequate follow-up time; reasonable methods for  controlling, confounding, and minimizing bias; and appropriate statistical  analyses. Further, the 2011 study reported that there are a variety of  methods for collecting exposure information, but the most desirable is to  measure exposures quantitatively at the individual level. Individual  exposure measurements can be obtained through personal monitoring  data or biomonitoring. However, if individual monitoring data are not  available, and they rarely are, individual exposure data may also be  estimated from modeling of exposures, self-reported surveys, interviews,  job exposure matrixes, and environmental monitoring. Further, to  determine the incidence of chronic disease, the study states that  servicemembers must be tracked from their time of deployment, over  many years. The 2011 study goes into further detail on how data can be  collected, with alternatives, and processed without biases.", "While the methodology of how to conduct an epidemiologic study is  outlined, DOD has not taken steps to conduct this type of research study,  specifically one that focuses on the direct, individual exposure to burn pit  emissions and the possible long-term health effects of such exposure.  Instead, some officials commented that there were no long-term health  effects linked to the exposures of burn pits because the 2011 study did  not acknowledge any. Conversely, Veterans Affairs officials stated that a  study aimed at establishing health effect linkages could be enabled by the  data in its airborne hazards and open-air burn pit registry, which collects  self-reported information on servicemembers\u2019 deployment location and  exposure.", "Further, in response to a mandate contained in section 201 of Public Law  112-260, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine  will convene a committee to provide recommendations on collecting,  maintaining, and monitoring information through the registry. The  committee will assess the effectiveness of the Department of Veterans  Affairs\u2019 information gathering efforts and provide recommendations for  addressing the future medical needs of the affected groups. The study will  be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 will be a review of the data  collection methods and outcomes, as well as an analysis of the self- reported veteran experience data gathered in the registry. Phase 2 will  focus on the assessment of the effectiveness of the actions taken by the  Department of Veterans Affairs and DOD and will provide  recommendations for improving the methods enacted. According to  officials, the expected release date of the report is late fall of 2016.  Considering the results of this review as well as the methodology of the  2011 Institute of Medicine study as part of an examination of the  relationship between direct, individual exposure to burn pit emissions and  long-term health effects could better position DOD to fully assess those  health risks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["For over three decades, DOD has understood that disposing of waste in  burn pits poses health hazards. In light of its experience in Iraq and  Afghanistan, CENTCOM has taken steps to reduce burn pit use in its  area of responsibility through the use of alternative methods of waste  disposal, such as incinerators. However, DOD likely cannot completely  eliminate the need for burn pits in future contingency operations. Although  CENTCOM has specific policies and procedures for burn pit operations in  its area of responsibility, other geographic commands do not, potentially  leaving them ill-prepared to plan for and to safely and effectively manage  burn pits in the event of contingency operations in their respective  geographic regions. Moreover, although DOD and the Department of  Veterans Affairs have commissioned studies to enhance their  understanding of airborne hazards during deployments, given that DOD  may have to use burn pits in future contingency operations, as allowed  under current policies, ensuring that research efforts specifically examine  the relationship between direct, individual exposure to burn pit emissions  and long-term health issues could help improve the understanding and  potentially minimize risks related to such exposure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better position combatant commanders to implement the requirements  of DOD Instruction 4715.19 if burn pits become necessary and to assist in  planning for waste disposal in future military operations, we recommend  that the Secretary of Defense direct the combatant commanders of U.S.  Africa Command, U.S. European Command, U.S. Pacific Command, and  U.S. Southern Command to establish implementation policies and  procedures for waste management. Such policies and procedures should  include, as applicable, specific organizations within each combatant  command with responsibility for ensuring compliance with relevant  policies and procedures, including burn pit notification, and, when  appropriate, monitoring and reporting on the use of burn pits.", "To better understand the long-term health effects of exposure to the  disposal of covered waste in burn pits, we recommend that the Secretary  of Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology, and Logistics to take the following two actions:", "Take steps to ensure CENTCOM and other geographic combatant  commands, as appropriate, establish processes to consistently  monitor burn pit emissions for unacceptable exposures.", "In coordination with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, specifically  examine the relationship between direct, individual, burn pit exposure  and potential long-term health-related issues.

In its response, DOD stated that it will ensure that  geographic combatant commands establish and employ processes to  consistently monitor burn pit emissions for unacceptable exposures at the  point of exposure and, if necessary, at individual sources. However, DOD  also stated that our recommendation in the draft report to sponsor  research did not acknowledge the volume of research conducted and  planned by the department and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in  collaboration with other research entities. Specifically, DOD stated in its  letter that research studies have already been completed, are ongoing, or  are planned to improve the understanding of burn pit and other ambient  exposures to long-term health outcomes, and that the studies, where  applicable, consider and incorporate the methodology outlined in the  2011 Institute of Medicine study. Additionally, DOD stated that it has  implemented an Airborne Hazards Joint Action Plan process  collaboratively with the Department of Veterans Affairs as a primary  means of identifying research needs within DOD and the Department of  Veterans Affairs to address burn pit and other ambient air exposures  during deployments.", "In our report, we acknowledge that DOD and the Department of Veterans  Affairs have commissioned studies to enhance their understanding of  airborne hazards during deployment, including burn pit emissions, many  of which are listed in the department\u2019s response to our recommendation  in the draft report. We also agree that the ongoing and planned research  studies listed in DOD\u2019s response will continue to contribute to the general  knowledge of health effects of airborne hazards during deployment.  However, during the course of our review, DOD and other officials told us  that they have not specifically examined the relationship between direct,  individual burn pit exposure and potential long-term health-related issues.  Further the research studies presented in DOD\u2019s response to our draft  recommendation do not directly make this linkage either. This current lack  of data on direct, individual exposure to burn pit emissions limits DOD\u2019s  ability to fully assess potential long-term health impacts on  servicemembers.

Specifically, the 2011 study  states that the most desirable method to measure exposures  quantitatively is at the individual level. Individual exposure measurements  can be obtained through personal monitoring data. The intent of the  recommendation in the draft report was to address this linkage.  Therefore, we have clarified our recommendation and our report and  continue to believe that research that addresses individual exposure to  burn pit emissions and the potential long-term health effects would help  provide important information to fully understand and mitigate future  health risks.", "In its general comments, the Department of Veterans Affairs noted that it  coordinates with DOD in collecting data on veterans and servicemembers  potentially exposed to burn pit emissions and other airborne exposures,  to address relevant research needs.
