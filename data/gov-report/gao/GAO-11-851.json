In May 2010, DOD issued its Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Guidance to provide a methodology for DOD components to follow to develop and implement their Financial Improvement Plans (FIPs) for achieving audit readiness. The DOD FIP is a framework for planning and tracking the steps and supporting documentation. GAO was asked to assess the FIP methodology provided in the FIAR Guidance, the development and implementation of selected components' FIPs, and DOD's monitoring and oversight of the FIP process. To do this, GAO analyzed the FIAR Guidance, reviewed two selected FIPs--Navy Civilian Pay and Air Force Military Equipment--and reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed DOD and component officials.."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The FIAR Guidance provides a reasonable methodology for DOD components to use in developing and implementing their FIPs. The Guidance details the roles and responsibilities of the DOD components, and prescribes a standard, systematic process to follow to assess processes, controls, and systems. Overall, the procedures required by the FIAR Guidance are consistent with selected procedures for conducting a financial audit, such as testing internal controls and information system controls. The Guidance also requires components to take actions to correct any deficiencies identified during testing and document the results. DOD's ability to achieve departmentwide audit readiness is highly dependent on its military components' ability to effectively develop and implement FIPs in compliance with the FIAR Guidance. The Navy and Air Force did not adequately develop and implement their respective FIPs for Civilian Pay and Military Equipment in accordance with the FIAR Guidance. GAO found similar deficiencies in both FIPs. For example, internal controls and information systems controls were not sufficiently tested or documented, and conclusions reached were not supported by the testing results. In addition, neither component had fully developed and implemented corrective action plans to address deficiencies identified during implementation of the FIPs. As a result, the FIPs did not provide sufficient support for the Navy's and Air Force's conclusions that Civilian Pay and Military Equipment were ready to be audited. DOD and its military components have assigned to senior executive committees and designated individuals appropriate oversight roles and responsibilities for their financial improvement efforts. However, neither oversight committees nor Navy and Air Force officials effectively carried out their oversight responsibilities for the two FIPs, which did not support the components' conclusions of audit readiness. However, once the components indicated audit readiness, both the DOD Office of Inspector General and the Undersecretary of Defense (Comptroller) performed reviews and concluded that the FIPs did not comply with the FIAR Guidance and did not demonstrate audit readiness. The lack of adequate oversight results in an ineffective FIP process and can impact the ability of components to meet established milestones. If the components are unable to achieve interim milestones, DOD will need to consider how these factors could affect its ability to achieve departmentwide auditability by the end of fiscal year 2017."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense take various actions to improve the development, implementation, documentation, and oversight of DOD's financial management improvement efforts.

More specifically, the Guidance  provides a standard methodology for DOD components to follow in  developing and implementing their FIPs. In September 2010, we reported  that the department needed to focus on implementing its FIAR Plan and  that the key to successful implementation would be the efforts of the DOD  military components and the quality of their individual FIPs. We also  reported that DOD would need the sustained commitment of its top  leadership, departmentwide and within its components, to address  weaknesses and produce financial management information that is  timely, reliable, and useful for managers throughout DOD.", "To assist Congress in its oversight of DOD\u2019s financial management  improvement efforts, you requested that we assess the implementation of  DOD\u2019s FIAR Plan Strategy by reviewing the military components\u2019 FIPs. In  response, our objectives were to determine whether (1) the FIAR  Guidance provided a reasonable methodology for DOD components to  develop FIPs, (2) the DOD components had adequately developed and  implemented selected FIPs in accordance with the FIAR Guidance, and  (3) DOD is adequately monitoring and overseeing the FIP process.", "To address the first objective, we analyzed the current FIAR Guidance,  issued in May 2010, using relevant criteria to determine if it provides a  reasonable methodology for achieving financial statement auditability. To  address the second objective, we selected FIPs for two assessable  units\u2014Navy Civilian Pay and Air Force Military Equipment\u2014that were  scheduled to assert audit readiness in calendar year 2010. We analyzed  the FIP documentation supporting the audit readiness assertions, such  as process flows, control assessments, and test plans and results using  the FIAR Guidance. We did not perform separate audit procedures to  assess the effectiveness of the controls or the completeness or accuracy  of the Navy civilian pay amounts or the Air Force military equipment. To  address the third objective, using relevant criteria, we analyzed  documentation, such as the FIAR Guidance, FIAR Plan Status Reports,  and committee charters, to determine if the department had assigned  monitoring and oversight responsibilities to the appropriate entities and  officials, and had properly defined their roles and responsibilities. In  addition, for all three objectives, we met with officials involved in  developing, implementing, or monitoring the components\u2019 FIP efforts to  obtain explanations and clarification as needed.", "Further details on our scope and methodology are provided in appendix I.

As noted above,  DOD has been required since 1997 to prepare and issue annual  departmentwide audited financial statements and, pursuant to various  statutes, certain DOD components, including the military departments,  are required to prepare and issue annual audited financial statements.  DOD consolidates the component financial statements to prepare its  departmentwide financial statements. As reflected in OMB requirements  and DOD policy for preparation and audit of agency financial  statements, DOD and its components must prepare their financial  statements consistent with generally accepted accounting principles  (GAAP) and establish and maintain effective internal control over  financial reporting and compliance with laws and regulations. The DOD  Office of Inspector General (OIG) is responsible for auditing the financial  statements in accordance with GAGAS, which, among other things,  requires the auditor to determine if the financial statements are fairly  presented and properly supported by the agencies\u2019 accounting records.", "DOD has undertaken a number of initiatives over the years, such as its  Financial Improvement Initiative in 2003, to improve the department\u2019s  business operations, including financial management, and achieve  unqualified (or \u201cclean\u201d) financial statement audit opinions. In 2005, the  DOD Comptroller established the DOD FIAR Directorate to manage  DOD-wide financial management improvement efforts and to integrate  those efforts with transformation activities, such as those outlined in the  department\u2019s Enterprise Transition Plan, across the department.", "The FIAR Plan, which was first prepared in 2005, is DOD\u2019s strategic plan  and management tool for guiding, monitoring, and reporting on the  department\u2019s financial management improvement efforts. As such, the  plan communicates incremental progress in addressing the department\u2019s  financial management weaknesses and achieving financial statement  auditability. The plan focuses on three goals: (1) achieve and sustain  unqualified assurance on the effectiveness of internal controls through the  implementation of sustained improvements in business processes and  controls addressing the material internal control weaknesses, (2) develop  and implement financial management systems that support effective  financial management, and (3) achieve and sustain financial statement  audit readiness.

DOD components are expected to prepare a FIP in  accordance with the FIAR Guidance for each of their assessable units.  The FIPs are intended to both guide and document financial improvement  efforts. While the name \u201cFIP\u201d indicates that it is a plan, as a component  implements that plan, it must document the steps performed and the  results of those steps, and retain that documentation within the FIP.  Therefore, a FIP includes plans for testing controls and data, and  documentation of the testing conducted, results of the testing, and any  actions taken based on the results. When a component determines that it  has completed sufficient financial improvement efforts for an assessable  unit so that it is ready for audit, the FIP documentation is used to support  the conclusion of audit readiness.", "A summary of the purpose of each DOD financial improvement document  is provided below.", "The department intends to progress toward achieving financial statement  auditability in five \u201cwaves\u201d of concerted improvement activities within  groups of end-to-end business processes, which are broken down into  discrete units, called assessable units.

However, the department  has not yet fully defined its strategy for completing waves 4 and 5, which  focus on the auditability of most of the department\u2019s financial statements  such as the Balance Sheet and the Statement of Net Cost, and significant  audit areas such as equipment valuation. The FIAR Guidance states that  an analysis of significant reporting entities relevant to waves 4 and 5 will  be included in a future version of the FIAR Guidance. For example, in  relation to wave 4, the DOD Comptroller has identified weaknesses in  DOD valuation of military equipment as an obstacle to achieving auditable  balances in DOD financial statements, and the May 2011 FIAR Status  Plan Report states that DOD plans to resolve the matter through the  deployment of new business and financial management systems, a  revised definition of military equipment, and through a change to GAAP  related to accounting for the cost of military equipment. DOD plans to  seek a change to GAAP and implement the change by September 30,  2017, but DOD has not yet prepared a detailed time line for implementing  the changes within affected assessable units (assuming that any  proposed changes to GAAP would be approved).", "The focus and scope of each wave include the following:  Wave 1\u2014Appropriations Received Audit focuses efforts on assessing  and strengthening, as necessary, internal controls and business systems  involved in the appropriations receipt and distribution process, including  funding appropriated by Congress for the current fiscal year and related  apportionment/reapportionment activity by OMB, as well as allotment and  suballotment activity within the department.", "Wave 2\u2014Statement of Budgetary Resources (SBR) Audit focuses  efforts on assessing and strengthening, as necessary, the internal  controls, processes, and business systems supporting the budgetary- related data (e.g., status of funds received, obligated, and expended)  used for management decision making and reporting, including the SBR.  In addition to fund balance with Treasury reporting and reconciliation,  significant end-to-end business processes in this wave include procure- to-pay, hire-to-retire, order-to-cash, and budget-to-report.", "Wave 3\u2014Mission-Critical Assets Existence and Completeness Audit  focuses efforts on assessing and strengthening, as necessary, internal  controls and business systems involved in ensuring that all assets  (including military equipment, general equipment, real property, inventory,  and operating materials and supplies) are recorded in the department\u2019s  accountable property systems of record, all of the reporting entities\u2019  assets are recorded in those systems of record, reporting entities have  the right (ownership) to report these assets, and the assets are  consistently categorized, summarized, and reported.", "Wave 4\u2014Full Audit Except for Legacy Asset Valuation focuses efforts  on assessing and strengthening, as necessary, internal controls,  processes, and business systems involved in the proprietary side of  budgetary transactions covered by the Statement of Budgetary  Resources effort of wave 2, including accounts receivable, revenue,  accounts payable, expenses, environmental liabilities, and other liabilities.  This wave also includes efforts to support valuation and reporting of new  asset acquisitions.", "Wave 5\u2014Full Financial Statement Audit focuses efforts on assessing  and strengthening, as necessary, processes, internal controls, and  business systems involved in supporting the valuations reported for  legacy assets once efforts to ensure controls over the valuation of new  assets acquired and the existence and completeness of all mission  assets are deemed effective on a go-forward basis.

This step-by-step methodology delineates FIP  responsibilities between the components\u2019 management and the auditors.  For each assessable unit, management\u2019s responsibilities focus on  identifying, implementing, and documenting necessary financial  management improvements during the first four phases of the FIAR  Methodology, and sustaining those improvements through the fifth phase.  For phases six and seven, after the DOD Comptroller\u2019s initial review and  approval of a FIP supporting audit readiness, the component engages an  independent auditor to first perform an examination of the FIP and if  validated, then an audit of the assessable unit and finally, the entity\u2019s  financial statements.", "After a component concludes that an assessable unit is ready for audit, a  component continues to maintain the FIP to document the validation of  audit readiness by an independent auditor and the sustainability of audit  readiness through ongoing efforts by the component.

DOD components are  required to perform both internal control and substantive testing as part of  the process to assess audit readiness. Internal control tests are  performed to obtain evidence about the achievement of specific control  objectives, while substantive tests are performed to obtain evidence on  whether amounts reported on the financial statements are reliable. Both  types of testing generally involve determining whether appropriate  supporting documentation exists and is readily available. Internal control  testing focuses on assessing the effectiveness of controls that would  prevent or detect potential misstatements in the financial statements. For  example, to test controls over operating expenses, a component would  review a sample of invoices to determine if they had been properly  approved for payment, typically indicated by a signature of an authorized  official. Substantive testing, on the other hand, is conducted to obtain  evidence on whether the amounts reported on the financial statements  are reliable. For example, to test an operating expense balance, a  component\u2019s procedures would include examining invoices to determine if  the amounts of the invoices matched the transaction amounts recorded in  the general ledger and determining if the purchased item or service was  actually received. As discussed below, a key step in testing involves  reconciling the population of transactions to be tested.", "Reconciliation of population of transactions. To conduct both internal  control and substantive testing, a sample of the data transactions is  typically selected for testing. An organization must ensure that a sample  is taken from, or represents, the complete population of transactions that  needs to be tested. According to the FIAR Guidance, to ensure the  completeness of the population, the DOD components are required to  identify the population of transactions for an assessable unit, compare the  total amount of those transactions to the amounts recorded in the general  ledger and the financial statements, and then research and resolve any  differences between the amounts prior to selecting a sample.", "Tests of information systems controls. Because most financial  information is maintained in computer systems, the controls over how  those systems operate are integral to the reliability of financial data. The  components are required to identify, document, and test both general and  application controls for key systems that process transactions. General  controls are the policies and procedures that apply to all or a large  segment of an entity\u2019s information systems and help ensure their proper  operation. The objectives of general controls include safeguarding data,  protecting application programs, and ensuring continued computer  operations in case of unexpected interruptions. For example, general  controls include logical access controls that prevent or detect  unauthorized access to sensitive data and programs that are stored,  processed, and transmitted electronically. Application controls,  sometimes referred to as business controls, are incorporated directly into  computer applications to help ensure the validity, completeness,  accuracy, and confidentiality of data during application processing and  reporting. For example, a system edit used to prevent or detect a  duplicate entry is an application control.", "Corrective action plans. The components are required to develop and  execute corrective action plans to remediate any deficiencies that indicate  that controls are not working and/or transaction amounts are not  supported. The corrective action plans should include the solutions to be  implemented to resolve the deficiencies, the identification of resources  required and committed to carry out the solutions, and the targeted  milestones and completion dates.

The Navy  did not conduct sufficient internal control and substantive testing for  civilian pay, as required by the FIAR Guidance. We found instances in  which documentation of the Navy\u2019s testing results was not included in the  FIP and other instances in which the documentation was included but did  not support the conclusion reached. For example, while the Navy  concluded that internal controls were designed and operating effectively,  the results of the control testing indicated that 9 of 17 controls tested were  ineffective. The Navy reported that its civilian pay was ready for audit  because its control environment mitigated the deficiencies of its  ineffective controls; however, it did not explain how this was  accomplished. Based on our analysis and discussions with Navy officials,  we determined the control environment did not mitigate these  deficiencies. Both the DOD Comptroller and OIG had similar comments  about the control environment. In addition, the Navy concluded that  system exception and change reports, which are computerized input and  edit controls in the form of reports, were in general operating effectively.  However, the detailed test results showed that 5 of 14 reports would not  always run properly, and that one report was in fact not running properly  as it was producing false positives and negatives (i.e., information that  was not always accurate).", "The FIP indicated that no exceptions were identified as a result of the  substantive testing performed. However, during our review of the testing  results, we identified substantive exceptions. For example, the Navy was  unable to verify the reasonableness of payroll amounts for a sample of  employees because of incomplete and missing documentation, such as  time and attendance reports and schedules with approved pay rates.  Navy officials said that they did not pursue the missing documents  because the related control test for this process had failed; therefore, they  did not believe the substantive test needed to be completed nor did they  consider the incomplete or missing documents to be substantive  exceptions. Navy officials said that they later tested payroll transactions  for another sample of employees, but did not retain the documentation  because it contained personally identifiable information (e.g., social  security numbers). The officials also said that they are performing  additional substantive testing and will include that documentation in the  revised FIP.", "In addition, there was no evidence in the FIP that control and substantive  tests were performed for personnel benefits (e.g., payments for retirement  plans and health insurance). Navy officials said that they had performed  testing of personnel benefits, but that they did not retain the  documentation as it contained personally identifiable information.  However, as stated earlier, the FIAR Guidance requires that all FIP  procedures and the results be fully documented. The officials also said  that the additional payroll testing that they are performing includes  personnel benefits, and that this will be documented in the revised FIP.", "Population of Transactions Was Not Reconciled. The Navy did not  reconcile the population of transactions for civilian pay prior to conducting  testing as required by the FIAR Guidance.", "Specifically, the Navy did not ensure that it selected samples from the  complete population of payroll transactions recorded in the Defense  Civilian Pay System (DCPS) because it did not reconcile all DCPS data  to the Navy\u2019s general ledger systems. Instead, it used a subset of the  payroll transactions to conduct a reconciliation. The Navy stated that the  transactions excluded from the reconciliation were immaterial but the  rationale and support for this conclusion was not documented in the FIP  at the time the Navy concluded that civilian pay was audit-ready. In  addition, the Navy identified discrepancies during its efforts but did not  clearly document what these discrepancies were or their resolution. For  example, the Navy documented in the FIP that there were instances of  missing data and high variances, but did not indicate the nature of these  issues or how pervasive they were, the actions taken to resolve them,  and/or whether the issues were resolved. In response to these concerns  we raised, Navy officials said that they subsequently performed a  reconciliation using more recent payroll transactions that resulted in  insignificant unreconciled discrepancies. The officials stated that they  believed these results were sufficient to ensure that a complete  population was identified and that they used this population to select a  sample of transactions and are performing detailed testing. Navy officials  said that the results of this work will be included in the revised FIP.", "In addition, the Navy documented in the FIP that it was unable to  reconcile the payroll accounts in its general ledgers to the DOD-wide  general ledger that is used to generate the components\u2019 and  department\u2019s financial statements. In their attempt to perform this  reconciliation, Navy officials noted that they were unable to extract  reliable payroll data from the DOD-wide general ledger and that the  payroll account balance in the DOD-wide general ledger was greater than  the total of the account balances in the Navy\u2019s general ledgers. As a  result, the Navy was unable to reconcile the population of payroll  transactions to the system that ultimately produces its financial  statements; in other words, it could not identify the information needed to  test the civilian pay amounts included in the financial statements. The  Navy officials stated they plan to address these issues as part of the SBR  Financial Statement Compilation and Reporting assessable unit, which  they plan to have audit-ready by the end of fiscal year 2012.", "Information Systems Controls Were Not Fully Tested. The FIAR  Guidance requires DOD components to test system controls to ensure  that they are operating as intended. However, the methodology\u2014the  Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process  (DIACAP)\u2014that the Navy used to assess information systems controls  did not address all the elements of a general controls assessment. For  example, the DIACAP did not address the periodic review of (1) users\u2019  access authorizations or privileges to ensure that they are appropriate  based on assigned roles and responsibilities, and (2) automated logs of  changes to security access authorizations to ensure that management is  aware of any unusual activity. In addition, the Navy did not review the  results of general controls assessments to ensure that the assessments  covered the overall operating environment in which the systems operated.  For example, any general control weaknesses in a mainframe or network  that were not included in the scope of the assessment could possibly  negate the effectiveness of the controls for the individual system  reviewed. Because the Navy did not include all elements of a general  controls assessment in its testing, it was unable to demonstrate the  effectiveness of the Navy\u2019s overall general control environment.", "The Navy reported in the FIP that it relied on a SAS 70 report to obtain  assurance over key payroll processing controls (i.e., application controls)  for the DCPS. However, that report identified significant weaknesses.  Specifically, it indicated that several control activities were found to be  ineffective and as a result, certain control objectives were not met for  DCPS. In the FIP, the Navy stated that the particular control activities  identified as ineffective in the SAS 70 report did not significantly affect  Navy Civilian Pay, but it did not adequately document the rationale for this  assessment. Nevertheless, we determined that several of these control  activities, and related control objectives, were significant to Navy Civilian  Pay and, as such, the Navy did not have reasonable assurance that its  personnel and payroll data were complete, accurate, and timely  processed.", "Corrective Actions Were Not Adequately Developed and  Implemented. The Navy\u2019s FIP did not include the information needed for  corrective action plans as required by the FIAR Guidance. For the most  part, the FIP did not include (1) the deficiencies to be corrected (the root  cause of the exceptions), (2) the solutions to be implemented to resolve  the identified deficiencies, (3) the resources needed to carry out those  solutions, and (4) a schedule for timely completion of corrective actions.  Navy officials stated that they are currently developing corrective action  plans; however, their first priority is to develop and implement the revised  FIP which will include evidence of audit readiness based on substantive  procedures rather than reliance on internal controls. In effect, the Navy  plans to assert audit readiness based on its testing of account balances  without addressing the identified internal control deficiencies. However,  the development and implementation of a corrective action plan to  address such deficiencies is a requisite for improving financial  management, which is one of the goals of the FIAR effort.", "FIP Status Was Not Accurately Reported. The FIAR Guidance requires  the components to report the status of Key Control Objectives (KCO) and  Key Supporting Documents (KSD) for their assessable units. However,  the status for these metrics that the Navy reported in the November 2010  FIAR Plan Status Report to demonstrate audit readiness was not  supported by the results of the Navy FIP work. For example,  \uf0b7  The Status Report indicated that 95 percent of KCOs pertaining to  Navy Civilian Pay were found to be effective; however, the Navy\u2019s  control testing results reflected mostly ineffective internal controls.  \uf0b7  The Status Report indicated that 100 percent of KSDs related to Navy  Civilian Pay (e.g., documentation evidencing the operation of an  internal control such as properly approved time and attendance  records) were found to exist. However, as discussed earlier, Navy  Civilian Pay testing results indicated that incomplete and missing  documentation was one of the more prevalent findings.", "Navy officials said that the differences we noted were due to the fact that  the KCOs and KSDs required for the FIAR Plan did not exactly match or  align with the Navy\u2019s actual work. Therefore, the Navy tried to estimate  the appropriate level of progress to report for the KCOs and KSDs listed  in the FIAR Plan based on testing that it conducted. In the May 2011  FIAR Plan, the Navy revised its reported progress for these metrics. For  example, instead of reporting that 95 percent of KCOs were effective, the  May 2011 FIAR Plan indicates that 60 percent of KCOs were effective for  Navy\u2019s civilian pay. We did not assess the accuracy of these revised  metrics."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Air Force\u2019s Military Equipment FIP Was Not Adequately Developed and Implemented", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force did not adequately develop and implement its FIP for  military equipment in accordance with the FIAR Guidance.

As a result of  these deficiencies, the FIP documentation did not support the Air Force\u2019s  December 2010 assertion that the military equipment assessable unit was  ready to be audited.", "The DOD Comptroller provided initial comments based on its review of  the FIP which indicated that it had found issues similar to those we  identified and concluded that the Air Force had not demonstrated audit  readiness for its military equipment. In addition, the DOD OIG identified  similar issues and concluded that the Air Force had not complied with the  FIAR Guidance in developing and implementing this FIP. Air Force  officials acknowledged that they had more work to do to address the  identified deficiencies and indicated that they planned to complete these  corrective actions by the end of June 2011. In July, the Air Force provided  updates on the status of several actions underway or completed but did  not provide any supporting documentation for our review. Further, these  actions did not address all of the deficiencies that we identified.", "The following paragraphs provide more details about the deficiencies we  found in the Air Force\u2019s FIP.", "Testing Was Insufficient and Did Not Support Conclusions. As  described earlier, DOD components are required to conduct both internal  control and substantive testing for each assessable unit. The Air Force  did not perform sufficient testing to support audit readiness for the  existence and completeness of various types of its military equipment.  For aircraft, the Air Force judgmentally selected five sites at which to  perform the testing but did not provide evidence that the conditions at  these five sites were representative of all Air Force locations. Selecting  sites judgmentally could be an acceptable method if the Air Force could  demonstrate that the processes and controls at the selected sites were  representative of all other locations not tested.", "For the other four categories of military equipment\u2014ICBMs, RPAs,  satellites, and pods\u2014the FIP did not include any documentation of  internal control or inventory testing for the existence and completeness of  these assets. Instead, the FIP described the routine monitoring activities  over these assets that are conducted for operational purposes. With  regard to ICBMs, Air Force officials said that the Air Force Audit Agency  will be performing inventory testing of ICBMs in fiscal year 2011.", "Population of Transactions Was Not Reconciled. The Air Force did not  reconcile the population of transactions for military equipment prior to  conducting testing as required by the FIAR Guidance. Specifically, the Air  Force did not ensure that it selected testing samples from the complete  population of transactions because it did not complete a reconciliation of  the military equipment data recorded in its accountable property systems  of record to its general ledger. When it compared the data in these  systems, it found discrepancies that it did not resolve. For example, there  was an unresolved difference of about $2 billion that was largely  attributed to differences in both the recorded costs and accumulated  depreciation of satellites. We also found that the FIP included  documentation that reported different balances for aerospace vehicles. As  shown in table 3, the Air Force reported a net book value of $89.5 billion  for its aerospace vehicles, which was about $11 billion more than the  balance used to perform the reconciliation to the general ledger. Air Force  officials said that the balance for aerospace vehicles shown in table 3 is  inaccurate and that the balance used to perform the reconciliation is likely  more reasonable; however, there was no documentation in the FIP to  support this statement. Because of the unresolved reconciling items and  the discrepancies in the balances reported for aerospace vehicles, the Air  Force does not have assurance that the testing done to determine audit  readiness covered the complete population of its military equipment.", "Information Systems Controls Were Not Fully Tested. The FIAR  Guidance requires DOD components to test system controls to ensure  that they are operating as intended. However, the FIP did not provide  support to indicate that general and application systems controls were  operating effectively for the two systems that maintain accountability for  the Air Force\u2019s military equipment. For REMIS, the FIP included  information about the Air Force\u2019s conclusions regarding the effectiveness  of specific controls. However, the FIP did not include any evidence of the  testing performed that would allow for an independent evaluation of its  work. For RAMPOD, the FIP included a list of controls to be tested, but  did not provide any conclusions or any other evidence that any testing  had been done.", "The DOD Comptroller expressed concerns similar to ours and as a result,  Air Force officials stated that they would be performing additional testing  of general and application controls. In July 2011, Air Force officials  reported that this testing was completed but they did not provide  supporting documentation for our review.", "Corrective Actions Were Not Adequately Developed and  Implemented. The Air Force had not developed corrective action plans to  address all of the exceptions identified during testing, and had not  implemented any corrective actions to address these exceptions as of  December 31, 2010, when it submitted its FIP, as required by the FIAR  Guidance. For example, in reviewing the status of the corrective actions,  we found the following:  \uf0b7  Capital Modifications\u2014The Air Force\u2019s testing determined that it did  not have the necessary controls in place to ensure that equipment  modifications were capitalized when appropriate. The Air Force\u2019s  corrective action plan had identified the nature of this deficiency, the  solution, the required resources, and targeted milestone. However,  the targeted milestone noted in the FIP was January 2011\u20141 month  after the Air Force had indicated that the assessable until was audit  ready. Air Force officials indicated that they did not expect to complete  this corrective action until December 2011.  \uf0b7  Accumulated Depreciation\u2014The Air Force\u2019s initial testing identified  discrepancies with the accumulated depreciation balance reported in  REMIS. The errors included both over- and underdepreciation of  assets, which, in some instances, resulted in accumulated  depreciation amounts in excess of the acquisition cost of the assets.  However, as of the date it indicated audit readiness, the Air Force had  not identified the cause of this problem, the solution, or a time frame  for implementation. Subsequent to indicating audit readiness, the Air  Force said that it analyzed the issue further and that it had resolved  the issue by July 2011. However, based on our review of  documentation provided, the Air Force\u2019s actions did not fully address  this weakness.  \uf0b7  REMIS ICBM Records\u2014The FIP stated that 555 complete ICBMs  were recorded in REMIS, but that only approximately 450 complete  ICBMs exist at any time. The approximately 100 remaining ICBMs  pertain to unassembled missile components which, according to the  Air Force, should be classified as operating materials and supplies  rather than military equipment. The FIP identified the solution needed  to address this deficiency and stated that it must be corrected before  military equipment can be ready for audit. However, Air Force officials  indicated that they did not expect to complete this corrective action  until the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, and that testing the  effectiveness of the corrective action would be incorporated into the  fiscal year 2012 testing efforts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FIP Monitoring and Oversight Needs Improvement", "paragraphs": ["DOD and its military components have established senior executive  committees as well as designated officials at the appropriate levels to  monitor and oversee their financial improvement efforts.

According to relevant  criteria, monitoring should be performed continually and includes  regular management and supervisory activities such as assigning  qualified people with the appropriate roles and responsibilities, carrying  out assigned oversight duties, and documenting the results of oversight  activities. We found that Navy and Air Force officials as well as oversight  committees did not effectively carry out their monitoring responsibilities  for the FIPs that we reviewed.

The  FIP Directors did not ensure that their respective FIPs provided sufficient  evidence to support the conclusions of audit readiness before providing  the FIPs to the Assistant Secretaries\u2014Financial Management and  Comptroller (FM&C) for their signature. Neither Assistant Secretary  ensured that the FIPs were sufficient before signing them to indicate audit  readiness. For example, the Air Force\u2019s FIP was signed even though the  FIP stated that the deficiency in ICBM reporting, as discussed earlier,  \u201cmust be addressed before the military equipment line item can be ready  for audit.\u201d", "In addition, committees at both the component and DOD levels did not  effectively carry out their responsibilities for FIP oversight. Minutes of the  components\u2019 senior executive committee meetings did not indicate that  these committees thoroughly reviewed the progress of the FIPs in  addressing financial management weaknesses. With respect to the FIPs  that we reviewed, the FIAR Governance Board\u2019s activities consisted  primarily of receiving status update briefings. Because neither the  individual FIP managers nor the oversight committees adequately  reviewed and monitored the FIPs, each of the assessable units we  reviewed was deemed audit-ready even though the results did not  support these conclusions.", "Once the components indicated audit readiness, both the DOD OIG and  the DOD Comptroller carried out their responsibilities for reviewing the  FIPs. The DOD OIG, which reviews FIPs concurrently with the DOD  Comptroller after a component indicates audit readiness, provided  comments to the DOD Comptroller on each of the FIPs.

The intent is for the quality assurance team to provide  detailed feedback on the FIPs before they are formally submitted for  review and validation. In addition, the DOD Comptroller developed a  series of training courses to help component personnel understand and  execute the FIAR Methodology. Officials from the DOD Comptroller\u2019s  Office said that the components need additional training and assistance  with their FIPs because they do not necessarily have staff with the  appropriate skills and qualifications to adequately carry out the  procedures required by the FIAR Guidance. We believe that the DOD  Comptroller\u2019s efforts to review the FIPs as they are being developed and  implemented, and to provide additional training and ongoing feedback,  will improve the FIPs and thus, the components\u2019 ability to demonstrate  that assessable units are audit-ready.", "When the components report the progress of their FIPs inaccurately and  submit FIPs to DOD that do not adequately support audit readiness,  DOD\u2014both the Comptroller and the OIG\u2014must use resources to review  unreliable or incomplete information, and components must then perform  rework to reach audit readiness.

As a result, both the Navy\u2019s and Air Force\u2019s conclusions of  audit readiness for civilian pay and military equipment, respectively, were  unsupported. Both the Navy and the Air Force indicated that they have  initiated additional actions to address the identified deficiencies, but they  did not provide supporting documentation for us to verify their actions. To  achieve departmentwide audit readiness, DOD leaders will need to  ensure that the components develop, implement, and document their  FIPs in compliance with the FIAR Guidance.

DOD recognized that there is room for improvement in  implementation of the FIP process by the military components as well as  in governance and management of the process.

DOD explained that the Navy and  Air Force FIPs that we reviewed were prepared before issuance of the  May 2010 FIAR Guidance and may have proceeded with a strategy that  was not sufficiently supported, but that corrective actions are underway.  As we discussed with DOD, although the FIPs we selected were initiated  prior to issuance of the final FIAR Guidance, the issues we identified are  consistent with draft FIAR Guidance as well as standard procedures for  conducting a financial statement audit that we found to be incorporated  into the final FIAR Guidance. On our recommendation related to  improving the Navy\u2019s process for reconciling transactions with its general  ledgers, DOD partially concurred, but noted that the Navy will be unable  to reconcile transaction populations until it completes its Financial  Statement Compilation Process. As we report, performing reconciliations  is key to properly testing financial statement amounts and therefore  should be done prior to asserting audit readiness.", "On our recommendation related to improving the sufficiency of the Air  Force\u2019s control and substantive testing, DOD partially concurred, but  noted that the Air Force based the extent of its testing procedures on its  assessment of the inherent risk of the asset category, stating that ICBMs  were not tested due to their limited number and extensive controls for  these assets. Although the Air Force\u2019s FIP noted that ICBMs are subject  to extensive controls, the FIP did not document those controls or any  tests conducted to validate the controls. Also, for RPAs, satellites, and  pods, no evidence of controls was provided and no testing was done.  While the FIAR Guidance allows components to use a substantive  approach (versus a controls approach) when there are a limited number  of items, it does not allow no testing if an area is significant or material.  Also as we report, the Air Force\u2019s basis for its judgmental selection of the  locations to test aircraft was inadequate since it did not demonstrate that  the processes and controls at the five selected sites were representative  of all other locations not tested. In addition to partial concurrence with this  recommendation, DOD commented it will further review this issue and  take action as appropriate.", "On our recommendation related to improving the Air Force\u2019s corrective  action plans, DOD partially concurred, but noted that when the Air Force  asserted auditability it did not believe that the issues being addressed by  corrective actions were significant control weaknesses and, therefore, the  Air Force was allowed under the FIAR Guidance to assert auditability. We  believe that the Air Force reported significant control weaknesses that  would have precluded an assertion of auditability; the FIAR Guidance  does not allow for auditability assertions when there are unresolved  material deficiencies. For example, as we report, the Air Force  documented that it was unable to reconcile its population of transactions  to its financial statements, and as a result, did not have assurance that  the testing done covered the population of military equipment. Also, the  Air Force reported errors in its depreciation amounts and that accurate  depreciation amounts were \u201cessential\u201d and Air Force military equipment  \u201cwill not be ready for audit\u201d if not corrected.
