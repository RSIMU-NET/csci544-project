Security Council created the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia to investigate and prosecute individuals responsible for these crimes. As requested, this report (1) reviews the startup challenges the Tribunal faced and (2) assesses the Tribunal\u2019s capacity to carry out its mandate; that is, whether the Tribunal has sufficient staff, facilities, and equipment needed to investigate and prosecute individuals indicted in accordance with its statute and rules of procedure and evidence.

Civilians often were the primary targets of military actions, or used as human shields, resulting in thousands of deaths. Many were driven from their homes in campaigns of terror known as \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d", "On May 25, 1993, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 827, which established the Tribunal under chapter VII of the U.N. charter (see app. II for a list of Security Council resolutions concerning the establishment of the Tribunal). This resolution set forth the Tribunal\u2019s mandate to prosecute individuals responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia since January 1, 1991. Fighting in Croatia had ended in November 1995 after the Croatian government and local Serb authorities signed an agreement on the region of Eastern Slavonia. In Bosnia hostilities were put on hold with a cease-fire among the three warring factions in October 1995. In December 1995 parties to the Bosnia conflict, including Croatia and Serbia, signed the Dayton Agreement. New incidents of violence occurred in early 1998 in Kosovo, a southern region of Serbia, that may place further demands on the Tribunal. Many international officials and observers believe that the success of the Tribunal is critically important to the overall international effort to bring peace and stability to the region.", "The Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia was the first criminal tribunal established as a subsidiary U.N. organization and had to rely on the international community to help it investigate and prosecute accused war criminals. The Tribunal lacks the capability to capture those it has indicted as possible war criminals and must rely on others to execute its orders and warrants, including their arrest and delivery to The Hague, the Netherlands. To carry out its mandate, the Tribunal also had to develop an operating structure and create a legal and judicial process that could be viewed by the international community as fair and credible.", "The Tribunal\u2019s statute established three bodies: the judicial chambers, an Office of the Prosecutor, and a Registry for common administrative support. The statute also directed these bodies to conduct investigations, issue indictments and arrest warrants, prosecute and arrange for the defense of the accused before a three-judge panel, sentence convicted persons, and hear appeals. To carry out these tasks, the Tribunal needed judges, a prosecutor, investigators, lawyers, and administrative support plus a building to work in, facilities to detain suspects, and a courtroom for proceedings before investigations could begin and individuals be arrested and prosecuted. (See app. III for more information on the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, organization, and process.)", "To ensure its decisions are viewed as credible and withstand international scrutiny, the Tribunal\u2019s rules of procedure and evidence require that the Prosecutor present enough evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt to obtain a conviction. This may require investigators to collect thousands of pages of information, analyze the military and civilian command structures of the various factions to establish command responsibility, obtain physical evidence from mass graves, and locate and interview potential eyewitnesses who are scattered throughout Europe and the rest of the world. Under its statute and rules of procedure and evidence, the Tribunal must protect the rights of the accused, including the right to counsel and to be informed of any information known to the Prosecutor that may suggest their innocence or mitigate their guilt. The Tribunal also must try the accused \u201cwithout undue delay.\u201d The maximum penalty that the Tribunal can impose is life imprisonment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tribunal Overcame Startup Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The Tribunal started its mission with few resources and staff. The U.N. General Assembly elected the 11 judges in 4 months, but more than a year was required to develop judicial rules and procedures, select a Prosecutor, acquire facilities, hire investigators, obtain a formal funding mechanism, and secure other critical resources and staff needed to conduct its work. The Tribunal encountered numerous startup problems and, as reported by the United Nations\u2019 Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), inefficiently used some of its resources. For example, in 1996 OIOS reported that up to 15 guards were hired more than 6 months before the first detainee arrived and before the construction of the detention facility was completed. Also, in March 1997, OIOS reported that the Tribunal could achieve greater efficiencies by looking into outsourcing, cost sharing, and pooling administrative functions. Nonetheless, the Tribunal has grown into a fully functioning organization. From 1993 to 1998, the Tribunal has grown from an organization with 11 judges and an approved budget of $500,000 to an approved staff level of 571 with a budget of almost $70 million."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Tribunal Efforts to Become Fully Functional", "paragraphs": ["The Tribunal needed rules of procedure and evidence, a Prosecutor, judges, investigators, lawyers, administrative support, and facilities to become a functioning international judicial body.

In mid-1994, the Netherlands, the host government for the Tribunal\u2019s activities, provided the Tribunal\u2019s premises and a courtroom and arranged the construction of a detention facility to house those in custody. The Netherlands continues to provide security for the Tribunal\u2019s facilities, judges, senior officials, accused in custody, and witnesses.", "The Tribunal also received other in-kind contributions, including equipment such as computers, vehicles, video-delay equipment, and personnel loaned by member states and nongovernmental organizations.In 1994, the United States loaned 22 personnel to the Office of the Prosecutor\u2014about 20 percent of the Tribunal\u2019s staff at the time\u2014to help the Tribunal get started. The number of loaned staff from member states has remained relatively constant at around 50 since 1995.", "During the Tribunal\u2019s first 2 years, it did not have a formal U.N. budget but instead operated with funds advanced by the Secretary General from the U.N. regular general budget with only a 6-month commitment authority. Under this condition, the Tribunal could not enter into any long-term commitments extending beyond its temporary budget authority. This also meant that since the Tribunal had no permanent funding, a formal lease for premises could not concluded until 1994, and the Tribunal could not recruit experienced staff and personnel other than on short-term contracts. Further, it could not purchase and install the technical equipment necessary to start investigations.", "After a lengthy debate, in July 1995 U.N. member states reached a compromise agreement to create a special account to finance the Tribunal. The compromise called for half of the Tribunal\u2019s budget to be funded using the U.N. regular assessment scale and half using the peacekeeping assessment scale.

As shown in table 2, since the Tribunal was established and through March 1998, the cumulative voluntary cash contributions and pledges have been about $14 million from 28 countries and organizations.", "According to State and Tribunal officials, the Tribunal has used voluntary contributions to finance critical resource needs. For example, in January 1998, the Netherlands contributed $1.7 million in in-kind contributions and the United States $1 million in in-kind contributions to construct a second, fully equipped courtroom for the Tribunal. Previously, the United Kingdom had contributed about $500,000 for the construction of another courtroom.

The Tribunal will be unable to conduct the number of investigations it planned for 1998, may be unable to begin trials without undue delay, and will continue to have a growing backlog of unread documentary evidence. Moreover, as more indictees are arrested during the year, the Tribunal\u2019s ability to continue ongoing investigations and ensure indictees are brought to trial without undue delay will be further eroded. There are major obstacles to quickly expanding the Tribunal\u2019s capabilities, including the U.N. system\u2019s complex recruitment process and a surcharge assessed to donors who make voluntary contributions.", "Although the Tribunal has no specific guidelines for determining the exact length of time after which detention is no longer lawful, the Tribunal statute requires the Tribunal to try the accused without undue delay. According to the Tribunal President and State Department officials, pretrial detention longer than 2 years could be considered undue delay, although this may vary depending on the circumstances of each case. The ability to start trials soon after indictees are brought into custody can have important political implications. For example, one of the important conditions of the U.S.-negotiated surrender of 10 Bosnian Croats in October 1997 was the U.S. commitment to support the Prosecutor\u2019s pledge to be ready to try some of the 10 accused within 3 to 5 months of their surrender (as of May 1998, trials for the 10 who surrendered had not begun). According to State Department officials, indictees are less likely to surrender if they face the prospect of months or years in custody before their trials begin."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Current Workload Exceeds Capacity", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis shows that, based on its current workload and capacity, the Tribunal will be unable to undertake the number of investigations it planned for 1998 and will take at least 3 years to complete the trials and appeals of the accused currently in custody. The Tribunal has the capacity to handle the workload that existed in the fall of 1997 when it submitted its resource request for the year. As of May 14, 1998, however, 10 more indictees had been arrested or surrendered and investigations in Kosovo had been added\u2014already exceeding the workload the Tribunal had expected for the entire year (see table 3). Moreover, only three-quarters of the new hires planned for 1998 will be in place by August 1998. As a result, the Tribunal currently does not have sufficient capacity in a number of key areas to handle its present workload.", "Although no standards exist on the appropriate number of investigators for an international criminal tribunal, the Tribunal does not have sufficient investigators to carry out its existing investigatory workload. At the time of our visit in November 1997, the Tribunal had 41 investigators, including loaned personnel, to investigate potentially thousands of serious violations of international humanitarian law, including nearly 1,000 prison camps and other places of detention, over 10,000 cases of rape and sexual assault, and 187 mass grave sites identified by the U.N. Commission of Experts.", "The Deputy Prosecutor told us that the 1998 budget would provide the Office of the Prosecutor sufficient investigators and other resources to adequately carry out its mandate for the first time, based on its planned 1998 workload. The 1998 budget authorized 72 investigators to conduct  12 fully active investigations and support 9 ongoing or pending trials. To meet these goals, the Office of the Prosecutor expected to supplement its  72 U.N.-hired investigators with up to 30 loaned staff from member states.", "However, since the budget was approved, investigators have had to support 12 ongoing or pending trials. Further, they have had to suspend six investigations and have been unable to begin an unspecified number of additional investigations (see table 4). As of April 1998, the Tribunal had 39 U.N.-hired and 13 loaned investigators from member states. None of its 10 active investigations were being carried out by a full complement of investigators, although each investigation is fully active to the extent that resources permit. In addition, it will be several months before the new U.N. staff approved in the 1998 budget will be on board, and the Tribunal\u2019s ability to use any loaned staff beyond June 1998\u2014and thus accomplish the goals it set out in the 1998 budget\u2014remains uncertain in light of the U.N. General Assembly\u2019s September 1997 resolution to largely eliminate the use of loaned staff at the United Nations. The resolution stated that loaned staff should not be used as a substitute for U.N.-hired staff necessary for the implementation of mandated programs and activities. However, the U.N. Secretary General could accept loaned personnel for (1) very specialized functions for a short period of time or (2) in cases of urgent need or expanded mandate.", "Several current Office of the Prosecutor staff, former Office of the Prosecutor staff now at the Justice and Defense Departments, and State Department officials told us the number of investigators in the 1998 budget was still far short of the total necessary to handle the scope of the Office of the Prosecutor\u2019s work. They said that to adequately carry out its mandate, the Office of the Prosecutor would require at least twice as many investigators as requested in the 1998 budget. Several noted that a single Tribunal investigation was comparable in complexity and scope to a large criminal case in the United States, even though the entire investigative resources for the Tribunal were significantly smaller than what would be applied to such a case in the United States. One Office of the Prosecutor official told us he had only 6 people on his investigative team, when  35 were required to cover the scope of its work effectively. Other Office of the Prosecutor officials told us of alleged atrocities involving hundreds of deaths that could not be investigated due to lack of investigators. In its 1998 budget request, the Office of the Prosecutor reported that as of October 1997, almost 60 percent of its investigative resources were assigned to trial teams, causing the suspension of some ongoing investigations.", "The Tribunal\u2019s investigative capacity is strained by the need to prepare cases for trial when indictees are brought into custody. For an indictment to be confirmed, the Office of the Prosecutor need only satisfy a judge that there is a prima facie case for believing that a suspect has committed a crime. However, to obtain a conviction under the Tribunal\u2019s rules of procedure and evidence, prosecutors need to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Consequently, after an indictee is detained and brought to The Hague, investigators need to conduct additional work to prepare the case for trial. The amount of additional work required to prepare for trial depends, in part, upon the extent of the evidence collected before the indictment and the amount of time that has elapsed since the indictment. Investigators may need to locate original witnesses and ensure their testimony is consistent with their original statements and investigate potential defense theories.", "In general, however, the Tribunal estimates that a seven-person prosecution team needs to be established for each pending trial, including at least two investigators who have to be pulled off ongoing investigations. Using this estimate, the Office of the Prosecutor will need 16 investigators, or 22 percent of its U.N.-hired investigators, to handle its current pending trial load, plus additional investigators to support ongoing trials. As more indictees are brought into custody, more investigators will be assigned to trial preparation, which will steadily degrade the Office of the Prosecutor\u2019s ability to carry out ongoing investigations. According to Tribunal and State Department officials, the resources required for trial preparation can be much greater for higher profile indictees. For example, these officials told us that the Office of the Prosecutor moved over half of its investigative staff from investigations to trial preparation when a Bosnian Croat general surrendered to the Tribunal in April 1996.", "The recent violent incidents and killings in Kosovo have also strained the Tribunal\u2019s investigators and highlighted the Office of the Prosecutor\u2019s limited ability to quickly respond to new situations that were not foreseen in the 1998 budget. According to a senior State Department official, the Office of the Prosecutor could not provide investigators to conduct work in Kosovo without seriously hampering ongoing investigations and trial preparations. As a result, the United States contributed over $1 million, loaned a prosecutor and an investigator to the Tribunal, and sought additional voluntary contributions and personnel from other nations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Courtrooms", "paragraphs": ["As of March 1998, the Tribunal had only one courtroom to conduct its current caseload\u20144 ongoing trials, 1 appeal, and various procedural and pretrial motions associated with 8 pending trials involving 18 defendants.To handle this caseload, the Tribunal has to rotate the use of the single courtroom between pretrial motions, ongoing trials, administrative functions of the court, and appeals. The need to handle the Tribunal\u2019s entire caseload in one courtroom is inefficient and delays the entire judicial process. For example, ongoing trials are frequently delayed by the need to hear procedural or pretrial motions associated with other cases. Such motions took up over 25 percent of available court time during 1997. The need to rotate court time between ongoing trials, motions, and appeals greatly increases the amount of time necessary to complete each ongoing trial and requires those in custody for other cases to wait for months before their trials can even begin.", "To address the need for additional courtrooms, the U.S., Dutch, British, and Canadian governments have voluntarily provided $3.3 million to finance the construction of two additional courtrooms\u2014one fully equipped to handle trials with multiple defendants, the other capable of handling pretrial motions and appeals or trials with up to two defendants.The Tribunal expects to have all three courtrooms in use by the end of June 1998; nonetheless, we estimated that it will still take over 2.6 years to finish the trials and appeals of all persons currently on trial or awaiting trial. This estimate assumes that (1) both new courtrooms will be completed on time; (2) court will be in session 240 days a year in each courtroom; and (3) there will be a sufficient number of judges, prosecutors, and support elements to fully staff all three on a full-time basis. As of May 1998, the Tribunal had prepared, but not submitted, a request to the United Nations to hire additional support staff to run each courtroom."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Judges", "paragraphs": ["The Tribunal\u2019s ability to try its growing caseload in a timely manner is limited by the lack of judges. The Tribunal\u2019s statute sets the total number of judges for the Tribunal at 11. The rules of procedure and evidence require that a panel of three judges hear each case, except that a judge who confirms an indictment cannot later sit on the panel that tries the accused. In addition, the five members of the appeals chamber cannot include a judge who confirmed an indictment or sat on a trial involving the indictee who brings the appeal. If every convicted indictee appeals his conviction and sentence, which has been the case thus far, each indictee will require nine different judges. This did not pose a problem when the Tribunal only had one trial going at a time. Now, with four trials and one appeal underway and eight more trials pending, the Tribunal\u2019s ability to assign judges to cover the growing caseload has been strained to capacity. For example, as of March 1998, one judge was assigned six different cases, creating serious scheduling problems.", "No matter how many courtrooms, investigators, attorneys, and translators or how much support it has, under the Tribunal\u2019s current judicial rules and procedures it can conduct no more than 3 trials at the same time with  11 judges. However, this would mean the appeals chamber could not be constituted at the same time. Our analysis of this best-case scenario showed that the chambers could complete five trials a year, assuming court is in session 240 days a year, and each trial takes 130 court days(including pretrial motions and appeals). However, the Tribunal will have only two trial chambers. This will enable the Tribunal to conduct no more than two simultaneous trials without hindering appeals proceedings. Therefore, under the same assumptions, it will only be able to complete three trials per year. At that rate, it will take more than 3 years to clear the current caseload.", "To handle its planned caseload for 1998, the Tribunal assumed its  11 judges would have dramatically increased workloads. For 1998, it assumed the chambers would handle more than twice as many trials; issue twice as many motions, orders, and warrants; and keep court in session 240 days\u2014a 41-percent increase over 1997. However, as of March 1998, the number of pending trials already exceeds what was planned for the year. The President of the Tribunal told us she was concerned about the judges\u2019 ability to handle their growing workload, noting the draining nature of the subject, the unprecedented nature of the legal issues involved, and the requirement to create and revise the rules of procedure and evidence. In her view, the Tribunal needs at least a reserve of judges who can cover trials if the need arises. Since the number of judges for the Tribunal was established by the U.N. Security Council, the Security Council would have to approve an increase in the number of judges.", "In light of these concerns, in February 1998 the President of the Tribunal asked the Security Council to authorize four more judges. This would allow the creation of a third trial chamber and provide greater flexibility to assign judges to trial and appeal chambers as needed. On May 13, 1998, the Security Council passed a resolution authorizing three additional judges for the Tribunal.", "In addition, the appeals chamber also hears and decides appeals that come from the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. A State Department official told us that five judges will have to travel to Africa to hear and decide on two pending appeals sometime later in 1998. This has the potential to further disrupt the Tribunal\u2019s ability to handle its current caseload, although we were unable to quantify the impact of this requirement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information Backlog", "paragraphs": ["The Tribunal has collected an immense amount of evidence and information on war crimes in the former Yugoslavia. By the end of 1997, the Tribunal\u2019s documents showed it had obtained nearly 1.5 million pages of documents, 12,000 photographs, 1,500 videos, and 47 cubic yards of physical evidence. However, the Tribunal has been unable to translate, process, analyze, and use this information throughout the organization. By the end of 1997, less than half of this information had been indexed, summarized, and entered into Tribunal computer information systems\u2014leaving an information backlog of over 800,000 pages of documents, about 9,000 photographs, and so much unviewed videotape we estimated it would take one person over 2 years to watch.", "Sustaining such a huge information backlog means the Tribunal is unaware of all the evidence it has obtained. Evidence vital to ongoing or planned investigations may be sitting in boxes, unread or unviewed. Not only may the Prosecutor\u2019s ability to construct a case be limited, but also evidence of potential benefit to the defense may not be known at the time of a trial. Under Tribunal rules of procedure and evidence, the Prosecutor is required to disclose to the defense any evidence it is aware of that may suggest the innocence or mitigate the guilt of an accused or affect the credibility of prosecution evidence. Although Tribunal officials told us that the most important evidence and information already had been processed into the system, some staff were concerned that exculpatory evidence might not be discovered until after a trial was completed.", "The Tribunal has a computer database with summary information on all documents obtained to date, which investigators and attorneys use to get a general idea of the information on hand. Defense teams use information extracted from this database in preparing cases for their clients. In early 1997, the Tribunal estimated it had about 560,000 pages of documents collected by its investigators waiting to be indexed, summarized, and entered into this system. To help clear this backlog, the Dutch government provided $2 million to fund a team of 20 staff to index and summarize these documents. The Tribunal anticipates that the Dutch-funded project will have entered summaries of all this information into the Tribunal\u2019s computer system by June 1998.", "While this project has been addressing the backlog that existed in early 1997, the Tribunal receives new information at the rate of 20,000 pages of documents a month, which it has been unable to process. The Office of the Prosecutor refers to this additional information backlog as its \u201cfrontlog.\u201d We estimate that, as of April 1998, it amounted to about 260,000 pages of documents. The Office of the Prosecutor expects that the additional resources provided in the 1998 budget will allow it to eliminate this new backlog at a rate of between 14,000 to 18,000 pages per month. However, with these new resources devoted to eliminating this new backlog, it is unclear how the Office of the Prosecutor will be able to process the additional 20,000 pages of documents obtained each month. In addition, over 600,000 pages of archived and other documents obtained from other organizations have never been processed into the system. The Office of the Prosecutor also has no capability to process nearly 500,000 pages of documents it expects to receive during 1998 from the archives of the U.N. Peace Forces. In January 1998, the Deputy Prosecutor concluded that the Office of the Prosecutor\u2019s inability to process these collections will create additional backlogs.", "After being summarized, selected documents critical to ongoing investigations or trials are fully translated, scanned, and entered into a more complex database that shows links between documents, persons, and organizations. These links are critical for developing chain of command and command authority portions of indictments. As of January 1998, about 60,000 pages of documents were waiting to be entered into this system. According to the Office of the Prosecutor, a project funded by the International Committee of the Red Cross will help eliminate half of this backlog by the end of June 1998 and could entirely eliminate the backlog by the end of October 1998 if additional funding is secured. The Office of the Prosecutor also estimates that when 1998 approved staff levels are reached, the Tribunal believes it will have enough resources on hand to keep up with the 1,500 pages of new information coming in from investigators every month for entry into the more complex database. However, the Office of the Prosecutor will not have enough staff to be able to enter new information obtained from other sources.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, the Prosecutor said that our report could raise concerns that the information backlog may cause a miscarriage of justice. While deploring the lack of available resources for backlog processing, the Prosecutor said that she and her staff take all possible initiatives to ensure that the Tribunal\u2019s ability to deliver justice is not harmed and does not believe that the backlog has tainted the Tribunal\u2019s process. In addition, the Prosecutor noted that the Tribunal\u2019s rules of procedure and evidence allow for the review of judgments in the event new information is discovered after trials are completed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Additional Arrests Could Overwhelm the Tribunal", "paragraphs": ["With the Tribunal\u2019s May 8, 1998, announcement that it was withdrawing indictments for 14 individuals, there are currently 32 known indicted persons still at large and an unknown number of persons whose indictments are under seal (see app. IV for the status of publicly indicted individuals). A series of recent events has made it more likely that there will be significant increases in the Tribunal\u2019s future workload before the end of 1998. First, international military forces in the region have begun detaining individuals indicted by the Tribunal, including those listed in public and sealed indictments. Since June 1997, international military forces in Bosnia and Croatia have detained seven indictees and killed another who resisted apprehension. North Atlantic Treaty Organization officials have said that Stabilization Force (SFOR) troops in Bosnia will continue to detain individuals indicted by the Tribunal that they encounter during the course of their normal duties if the tactical situation permits.Second, in January 1998, the National Assembly of Republika Srpska elected a new, moderate Prime Minister, Milorad Dodik, who announced that his government would strictly implement the Dayton Agreement, including cooperating with the Tribunal to the extent permitted by the Republika Srpska constitution.", "Our analysis suggests that an increase in the number of indictees in custody during the year will overwhelm the Tribunal\u2019s ability to conduct ongoing investigations and handle trial preparations with its 1998 resource level. If arrests and surrenders continue throughout 1998, the Tribunal would likely have to close down ongoing investigations, transfer investigators to trial preparation, and seek significant additional donor support\u2014particularly if high-profile indictees such as Radovan Karadzic or a large number of lesser indictees are taken into custody.", "An increase in the number of indictees in custody will create other problems for the Tribunal. It will have to find additional space and guards to keep them in custody. In April 1998, the number of indictees in custody (26) exceeded the capacity of the Tribunal\u2019s detention facility (24). In response, the Dutch government agreed to provide the Tribunal additional detention capacity. As required by the statute, indigent indictees also have the right to free defense counsel. According to a senior State Department official, an increase in the number of those in custody would seriously strain the existing capabilities of the two-person staff in the defense counsel unit, which arranges for and provides support to defense attorneys, and the Tribunal could require additional funding to expand this unit. An increase in the number of indictees preparing for trial also would place a heavy burden on the Office of the Prosecutor\u2019s computer support staff. Under Tribunal rules, the prosecutor must provide defense counsel access to all information relevant to the indictees. For example, Tribunal figures showed that discovery searches for the first three trials took between 117 and 200 days. Officials in the information and evidence section told us that these searches placed such a great strain on the computer system that other users were unable to print documents without a 30- to 40-minute delay.", "The impact of an increase in the number of indictees in custody on the prosecution would depend on the number of indictments (and thus roughly the number of pending trials) in which the indictees were included. In the Tribunal\u2019s 1998 budget request, the Office of the Prosecutor said it required two attorneys, one legal officer, and one case manager for each pending trial. However, the Tribunal\u2019s 1998 budget request only provides for two trial preparation teams. The Office of the Prosecutor also told us that on average it had to transfer two investigators from ongoing investigations to assist in trial preparations per indictment. Tribunal and State Department officials said that, depending on the number of additional pending trials, the need to transfer additional investigators to trial preparation would significantly disrupt ongoing investigations. Without additional staff, courtrooms, and judges, the indictees would have to wait for the Tribunal to dispose of its current trial caseload\u2014a likely 3-year project with current resources\u2014before their trials begin. Finally, U.S. officials said that, if more investigators and attorneys were added to deal with the influx, the Tribunal also would require greater overall administrative help in such critical areas as translation and victim and witness support."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges to Increasing Capacity", "paragraphs": ["We noted that there are several administrative barriers that could inhibit efforts to quickly increase the Tribunal\u2019s capacity. For example, the Tribunal must comply with U.N. rules for recruitment. According to State, U.N., and Tribunal officials, the complex U.N. process for locating, selecting, and placing new staff in The Hague can take many months. Recruitment for U.N. positions must include global notification, screening for necessary skills, and compliance with geographic and gender diversity requirements. In an effort to speed this process, the U.N. Secretariat has granted the Tribunal nearly complete control over recruitment. Nonetheless, the Registry, which provides administrative support for the Tribunal, told us it expected it would take about 3 months from the time a position vacancy is posted before new staff are actually in place at The Hague. However, State and Tribunal officials who have had experience with this process told us that it actually takes 6 to 12 months to identify candidates and bring him or her on board."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Surcharge", "paragraphs": ["Another barrier is the United Nations\u2019 surcharge on voluntary contributions. Voluntary contributions to U.N. programs administered and managed by the U.N. Secretariat, such as the Tribunal, are charged a 13-percent overhead surcharge for cash and in-kind contributions, such as loaned personnel. According to the U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Management, a 1980 U.N. General Assembly resolution does not allow the United Nations to use funds from its regular budget to support the costs incurred by voluntary contributions from member states. U.N. officials told us that the surcharge is necessary to recoup the administrative costs involved in supporting the equipment and staff contributed by member states, although in commenting on this report, the United Nations said that the surcharge can be waived if a contribution does not involve additional costs to the United Nations.", "The surcharge can deter potential donors. For example, because of the surcharge, the United States significantly reduced the number of U.S. loaned staff from 22 in 1994 to 7 in March 1998. The Defense Department has never agreed to pay the surcharge and, as a result, in December 1996, removed the staff it had loaned to the Tribunal. Defense Department officials likened the surcharge to paying tax on a gift, and the Department will not loan staff to the Tribunal unless the United Nations drops the fee or the State Department pays the 13-percent U.N. surcharge. The Federal Bureau of Investigation also refused a December 1997 Tribunal request to loan investigators to the Tribunal until the State Department agreed to pay the surcharge or the United Nations agreed not to impose it. These interagency negotiations delayed the delivery of U.S.-loaned staff to the Tribunal by several months. According to a senior State Department official, in March 1998 the U.N. Secretary General and the Secretary of State discussed this issue. The official said that the Secretary General indicated his agreement with the U.S. position and would address the issue. The State Department took this to mean that the United States would no longer be billed for the voluntary contribution surcharge. In commenting on this report, the U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Management clarified the Secretary General\u2019s comments during the meeting, and said that the Secretary General did not announce a change in the United Nations\u2019 policy on the surcharge, but only indicated that adjustments might be possible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Loaned Staff", "paragraphs": ["The use of loaned staff at the United Nations has also been a controversial issue for a number of years. In September 1997, the General Assembly passed a resolution calling on the Secretary General to phase out at the earliest possible date the use of most loaned personnel at the United Nations. U.N. documents show that developing countries in particular dislike the practice because, in part, they see it as damaging potential employment opportunities for their nationals. They also see the practice as a means for the wealthy countries to influence the United Nations unfairly, according to these documents and a former U.S. official.", "As of February 1998, 9 governments and 3 nongovernmental organizations had loaned about 50 personnel to the Tribunal, including 5 from the United States, primarily prosecutors from the Department of Justice. The Tribunal is expected to gain additional loaned personnel from U.N. member states for the first 6 months of 1998 to help the Tribunal handle its increasing workload, until new staff hired with funds from the 1998 budget are brought on board. Although there are provisions for continued use of a limited number of specialized positions that cannot be filled through the U.N. recruitment system, the Tribunal\u2019s 1998 budget assumed that its entire complement of loaned staff would be gone by the end of the year. In commenting on this report, the Registrar said that, in accordance with the instructions of the General Assembly and the Secretary General, the Tribunal is taking steps to phase out virtually all of its loaned personnel by the end of June 1998. However, according to State Department officials, the Secretary General told the Secretary of State in a March 1998 meeting that he would find a way to address the issue of restrictions on the continued use of staff loaned to the Tribunal. State Department officials told us that as of May 4, 1998, the United States had sent two additional loaned personnel to the Tribunal and plans to send at least eight more.", "If the use of loaned staff is discontinued, the Tribunal would lose vital expertise in areas such as investigations and forensics that are needed to conduct the Tribunal\u2019s work, according to Tribunal and U.S. officials. Discontinuing the use of loaned personnel also would remove an important tool the Tribunal has used in the past to obtain skilled personnel for key positions quickly. U.S. officials told us that loaned staff are the best way for the Tribunal to quickly obtain the highly skilled personnel necessary to handle its complex investigations and prosecutions. For example, the Tribunal\u2019s ability to rapidly send investigators to Kosovo will rely on loaned staff from the United States and other countries. In addition, three out of four of the attorneys that prosecuted the first trial at the Tribunal were loaned staff. According to U.S. officials, as a result of the Secretary of State\u2019s discussions with the U.N. Secretary General, the Tribunal would be allowed to continue to use loaned personnel.

As part of its 1998 budget request, the Tribunal developed 113 indicators such as number of ongoing trials and number of courtrooms to measure its workload, establish goals, and judge performance. We used some of these indicators to measure the Tribunal\u2019s current and future workload.

However, the Security Council resolutions that established the Tribunal, its statute, and its rules of procedure and evidence provide a series of requirements for the Tribunal and its judicial process. For example, each trial must be heard by three judges and the accused have the right to be informed of any evidence known to the Prosecutor that may suggest their innocence or mitigate their guilt and to be tried without undue delay. We performed our assessment by determining whether the Tribunal had sufficient capacity in key areas to be able to comply with these criteria.", "The ability to ensure that trials begin without undue delay is particularly important. However, the Tribunal has no specific guideline for determining the exact length of time which constitutes undue delay. In a September 1996 decision, a Tribunal trial chamber found that applying the \u201cwithout undue delay\u201d standard depends on individual circumstances and cited seven factors enumerated by the European Commission of Human Rights that should be considered when making that determination. These factors include the seriousness of the offense, the difficulties in conducting the investigation, and the impact of detention on the indictee. In that decision, the Tribunal ruled that a detainee\u2019s 4-month detention before the start of his trial could not, in the circumstances of that case, be considered undue delay. The Tribunal President and State Department officials generally considered that pretrial detention longer than 2 years could be considered undue delay, although this may vary depending on the circumstances of the case.", "To examine the relationship between capacity and workload, we used estimates the Tribunal had developed on the number of people or amount of time necessary to carry out key tasks based on its past experience. For example, the Tribunal assumed each trial would require 100 court days and that one person could index between 14,000 to 18,000 pages of information per month (see table I.2). The Tribunal used these estimates to justify its request for funds. As such, the Tribunal\u2019s 1998 budget request represents its best judgment on what it needed to accomplish its performance goals for the year. We used these estimates to calculate the number of staff or length of time necessary to handle the Tribunal\u2019s current and potential workload.", "In assessing the number of investigators, we used the Tribunal\u2019s estimates of the number of investigations it planned to undertake as the criteria for measuring whether it had enough investigators. Our ability to analyze the number of investigators was further limited because we did not have access to specific information on the relationship between the number of investigations and the number of investigators. Nonetheless, we contrasted the number of investigators the Tribunal has with the number it thought necessary to carry out the 12 investigations it planned for 1998. We also calculated the number of investigators that would have to be pulled off investigations to assist in trial preparation based on information we received from the Office of the Prosecutor.", "To calculate how long it would take the Tribunal to complete its current caseload based on the number of courtrooms, we applied the Tribunal\u2019s standard estimates of 20 days necessary for pretrial motions, 100 days for the trial, and 10 days for the appeals to determine the total number of trial days. We assumed that all verdicts would be appealed. We also used the Tribunal\u2019s 1998 budget estimates of the number of days (1) court was in session during 1997 and (2) the Tribunal plans to have court in session in 1998. This allowed us to estimate the total number of courtroom days per year and the total length of time necessary to complete the current caseload.", "The courtroom analysis assumed that there will be enough judges and other staff to allow the operation of three courtrooms. With its current  11 judges, the Tribunal can have no more than three trials going at the same time, due to the requirement in the Tribunal\u2019s statute that three judges need to hear each trial. However, in practice, the Tribunal can only hear two trials at the same time without jeopardizing its ability to constitute an appeals chamber, since it has only two trial chambers. Using the Tribunal\u2019s estimate of being in session 240 days a year, we assumed that the court could handle 480 trial days a year. If each trial takes 130 days, the Tribunal could complete about 3.7 trials per year.", "Our analysis of the size of the Tribunal\u2019s information backlog and its ability to eliminate it was based on the 1998 budget request and supplementary information we obtained from the Office of the Prosecutor. Based on this information, we calculated that the Tribunal has nearly 1.5 million pages of information. We then estimated the size of the Tribunal\u2019s backlog based on its estimates of how quickly staff could summarize and index documents, enter documents into the detailed database, and scan photos into the document database. We also calculated the number of hours of unviewed videotape based on estimates we obtained from the Tribunal.

It is possible for the Tribunal to hold three trials at the same time, although this would mean the appeals chamber could not be simultaneously constituted. We modified the text to clarify this point. As such, our analysis used the best-case scenario of holding three trials at a time; an approach we believe to be conservative. 4. We calculated the figure of 800,000 pages in the document backlog from information obtained from the Office of the Prosecutor. 5. We acknowledge the Tribunal\u2019s comment, however, our report does not express an opinion on the United States\u2019 position regarding the surcharge. 6. As explained in our Objectives, Scope, and Methodology (app. I), we did not assess the Tribunal\u2019s administrative functions, or the efficiency and effectiveness with which it used its resources because to have done so would have required complete access to U.N. internal documents on these matters. The United Nations does not make such documents available to us. 7. We reviewed past performance reports for the Tribunal and found that they did not provide the level of detail necessary to perform a review of the Tribunal\u2019s capacity. 8. As we noted in our Objectives, Scope, and Methodology, there are uncertainties in attempting to estimate the potential future trial workload for the Tribunal. The number of future trials is a function of when accused are arrested or surrender, the extent to which they are tried in groups, and the uncertainties involved in estimating how long pretrial motions, trials, and appeals will take. To estimate workload, our analysis used the Tribunal\u2019s historic trends and track record on these factors. 9. We agree that in this instance the accused would not face any additional delay. Although our analysis indicates that the Tribunal may be unable to begin trials without undue delay, this does not mean that accused war criminals should avoid surrendering."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments From the U.N.

The issues of loaned personnel and the 13-percent surcharge are matters of disagreement between the United States and the United Nations. We have presented the factual basis for our comments as contained in the available documentary evidence, including cables and memos from the Departments of State, Defense, and Justice; General Assembly resolutions; and reports from the Secretary General. We modified our report to better reflect the information contained in these documents, specifically that the mandate from the United Nations to discontinue the use of loaned staff came from a General Assembly resolution. 3. We did not reprint this attachment to the Under-Secretary\u2019s comments. The attachment is available as U.N. document A/51/688. 4. The issue of what was discussed and agreed to at the meeting between the Secretary of State and the Secretary General is a matter for the State Department and the United Nations to resolve. Since we did not attend the meeting, and written documentation of the meeting was not available, information in our report is based on the recollection of State Department officials who attended the meeting. We also discussed this matter with a U.N. official who attended the meeting and attempted to clarify the report to reflect the United Nations\u2019 view. 5. Evidence we obtained, as discussed in the report, shows that potential donors have been deterred from loaning personnel to the Tribunal because of the surcharge. For example, officials from the Departments of Defense and Justice specifically told us that they would only loan personnel if the surcharge is not applied. 6. We have modified the text to incorporate this comment. 7. This indicator appears in paragraph 25 of the Tribunal\u2019s budget request. 8. Our analysis assumed that all 11 judges would remain in The Hague. Having to relocate five judges to Rwanda to hear appeals will decrease the number of judges available to hear trials in The Hague, and thus potentially increase the amount of time necessary to handle the caseload.
