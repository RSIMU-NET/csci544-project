While many significant, positive steps were taken, GAO also found issues limiting the extent to which cost, schedule, and system performance can be tracked. Stabilizing the new acquisition approach, improving execution and increasing transparency are key steps for DOD. Asset Delivery: In 2010, MDA was able to meet or exceed its delivery goals for several MDA activities, such as missile defense upgrades to Aegis ships. However, the agency was unable to meet all of its goals for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, a system used to defend against targets in their last phases of flight. Transparency and Accountability: MDA finalized a new process in which detailed baselines were set for several missile defense systems. As a result of the new process, its 2010 progress report to the Congress is more comprehensive than it was in 2009. Although the information in MDA's progress reports to the Congress increased, GAO found its unit and life-cycle cost baselines had unexplained inconsistencies and documentation for six baselines had insufficient evidence to be a high-quality cost estimate. As a result, GAO could not evaluate cost progress. European Phased Adaptive Approach for Missile Defense: The September 2009 shift in focus for European missile defense represents a significant change in U.S. policy and a substantial investment for DOD. However, DOD has not fully implemented a management process that synchronizes European missile defense acquisition activities and ensures transparency and accountability. Without key management and oversight processes, there is a limited basis for oversight, and there is a risk that key components will start production before demonstrating system performance. In the past, similar deficiencies in missile defense acquisition oversight have led to rework, cost increases, delays, and doubts about delivered capabilities. Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD): While the GMD system---which is primarily designed to engage longer-range targets in the midcourse range of flight--has demonstrated a limited capability, DOD has not yet determined the system's full capabilities and limitations. In January and December 2010, GMD experienced two flight test failures. In addition, GMD is just beginning to take actions necessary to sustain the capability through 2032. Targets Acquisition, Testing, and Performance: MDA made a targets acquisition decision in 2010 in response to a target failure. This decision was not consistent with its 2009 acquisition plan which envisioned competitive contract awards that would reduce reliance on its prime contractor. The cost of this action remains unknown. Also, as in previous years, failures and delays in testing have continued to delay validation of models and simulations used to assess BMDS performance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes 10 recommendations for MDA to strengthen its resource, schedule and test baselines, facilitate baseline reviews, and further improve transparency and accountability. GAO is also making a recommendation to improve MDA's ability to carry out its test plan. In response, DOD fully concurred with 7 recommendations. It partially concurred with 3, contending that its current actions are sufficient and that the test recommendation is also not affordable. GAO continues to believe that additional action is needed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Missile Defense Agency\u2019s (MDA) mission is to develop an integrated  and layered Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to defend the United  States, its deployed forces, allies, and friends. In order to meet this  mission, MDA is developing a highly complex system of systems\u2014land,  sea-, and space-based sensors, interceptors and battle management. Since  its initiation in 2002, MDA has been given a significant amount of flexibility  in executing the development and fielding of the BMDS. To enable MDA to  field and enhance a missile defense system quickly, the Secretary of  Defense in 2002 delayed the entry of the BMDS program into the  Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) traditional acquisition process until a  mature capability was ready to be handed over to a military service for  production and operation. To meet a presidential directive to deliver an  initial capability by 2004, the program has concurrently developed and  fielded assets. While this approach helped MDA rapidly deploy an initial  capability, it has also meant that MDA has fielded some assets whose  capability is uncertain. Moreover, we have reported that MDA\u2019s approach  has limited transparency and accountability for DOD\u2019s largest single  acquisition program\u2014spending from approximately $7 billion to $9.5  billion per year. More specifically, there has been limited understanding  about baseline costs, schedules, requirements, and system effectiveness.", "Last year, we reported that MDA was in the process of transitioning to new  leadership, a new acquisition strategy, a new test strategy, and a shift in  emphasis toward early intercept capabilities. Given the breadth and scope  of these changes, we concluded that the agency had an opportunity to  chart a course that enables transparency and accountability while  retaining its desired flexibility, and it appeared that MDA was committed  to doing so. Importantly, the Director of MDA had begun new initiatives in  accordance with guiding principles of DOD\u2019s acquisition policies, which  already embrace knowledge-based practices and sound management  controls. The Director of MDA intended to apply these new policies to  each element or appropriate portions of the elements, as is currently done  across DOD, in order to provide a better foundation for Congress and  others to assess progress and hold senior leadership accountable for  outcomes.", "Since 2002, Congress has directed GAO to assess MDA\u2019s annual fiscal year  cost, schedule, testing, and performance progress in developing the  BMDS. We have delivered assessments of MDA\u2019s progress covering fiscal  years 2003 through 2009 and are currently mandated to continue our  assessments through fiscal year 2013. According to this mandate, we are  required to assess MDA\u2019s fiscal year progress against the annual goals it is  required to report to Congress each February in the BMDS Accountability  Report (BAR). This year\u2019s report specifically assesses MDA\u2019s progress in  (1) delivering missile defense assets as scheduled (2) improving  accountability and transparency over the past year (3) implementing the  European Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) (4) implementing changes to  the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) program (5) implementing  the targets revised acquisition strategy identified in 2009, and (6) testing  the BMDS and developing its modeling and simulations to assess  performance.", "To assess all six areas of MDA\u2019s progress, we examined the  accomplishments of nine BMDS elements and supporting efforts that MDA  is currently developing and fielding: the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense  (Aegis BMD); Aegis Ashore; BMDS Sensors; Command, Control, Battle  Management, and Communications (C2BMC); GMD; Precision Tracking  and Surveillance System (PTSS); Space Tracking and Surveillance System  (STSS); Targets and Countermeasures; and Terminal High Altitude Area  Defense (THAAD). We reviewed individual element responses to GAO data  collection instruments, which detailed key accomplishments for fiscal year  2010. The results of these reviews are presented in detail in appendixes to  this report and are also integrated as appropriate in our findings related to  progress in delivering assets and implementing new initiatives. We also  sought to examine MDA\u2019s Baseline Execution Reviews of each element\u2019s  progress, but were unable to assess the supporting backup materials as  they were not made available to us until February 2011\u2014the very end of  the audit.", "To assess whether MDA elements delivered assets as scheduled, we  examined the 2009 BAR and compared it to the 2010 version, looking for  similarities and differences between the two. We also reviewed responses  to GAO data collection instruments, which detailed key accomplishments  for fiscal year 2010, including some asset deliveries, as well as any delayed  asset deliveries   To follow up on the progress MDA made to improve transparency and  accountability, we reviewed pertinent DOD policies to compare MDA\u2019s  current level of accountability with that of other DOD programs. We also  assessed the cost, schedule, and test baselines included in the 2010 BAR.  In addition, we held discussions with officials in MDA\u2019s Operations  Directorate to discuss the new phased adaptive approach. Lastly, we met  with officials in MDA\u2019s Acquisition Directorate to discuss how the agency  is establishing and managing against its internal baselines.", "For our assessment regarding the implementation of the management  process to synchronize acquisitions for the European PAA, we synthesized  management and oversight principles from the Office of Management and  Budget, DOD, MDA, and GAO best acquisition practices for large  acquisition efforts similar to European PAA. We then compared European  PAA acquisition efforts to these principles. We also reviewed DOD and  MDA documentation related to European PAA. We also requested the  European PAA cost estimate that was completed in fall of 2009. However,  we did not receive the cost estimate until February 2011\u2014the very end of  our audit\u2014and therefore we could not assess it for this report. We met  with MDA and Office of the Secretary of Defense officials. We visited the  U.S. European Command and U.S. Strategic Command. We met with  officials from MDA directorates and element program offices as well as  the Offices of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics and visited  contractor facilities.", "In addition, we are including the acquisition-related parts of our final  analysis performed in response to a congressional mandate that we review  a DOD assessment and plan related to the GMD system, that included  issues related to acquisition, sustainment and refurbishment. For DOD\u2019s  Assessment and Plan for the GMD program, we reviewed the reports  provided by DOD; analyzed sustainment, refurbishment and test plans and  program schedules; and assessed budget documents and program reviews.  We interviewed officials from MDA, U.S. Strategic Command, U.S.  Northern Command, and the Army.", "To assess BMDS testing and target development progress, we reviewed  technical baselines in the BAR, MDA\u2019s Integrated Master Test Plans, the  target business case analysis, target contracts, and other documents  related to target planning and acquisitions. We also interviewed officials  within program offices and within MDA functional directorates, such as  the Directorates for Engineering and Testing. In addition, we discussed the  elements\u2019 test programs and test results with the BMDS Operational Test  Agency and DOD\u2019s Office of the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation.  We held discussions with the BMDS Operational Test Agency to follow up  on BMDS models and simulations. Our scope and methodology for each of  the six objectives is discussed further in appendix XIV.", "As we agreed to with your staff, we do not include an analysis of MDA\u2019s  earned value management (EVM) reporting this year. In prior years, in the  absence of full cost baselines for elements, we assessed the EVM progress  of individual contracts. We issued our findings on MDA\u2019s EVM progress  during fiscal year 2009 in July 2010 and found data reliability issues with 2  of the 14 contracts. Because of these issues with the GMD and Targets  and Countermeasures programs\u2019 EVM data, we were unable to report cost  progress for these two contracts which amounted to half of the total  budgeted contract costs for MDA prime contracts we reviewed. We plan to  assess EVM data on MDA prime contracts in the future once MDA has had  time to address our recommendations to improve data reliability. In our  July report, MDA stated that it intended to take a key step in addressing  our recommendations by conducting a major review of the GMD  program\u2019s EVM data by the end of September 2010. Because MDA  provided documentation of its actions at the end of our audit\u2014in February  2011\u2014 leaving no time for review, we will assess whether the steps MDA  has taken sufficiently address GMD's data reliability issues in next year's  report.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2010 to March 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Since ballistic missiles have  different ranges, speeds, sizes, and performance characteristics, MDA is  employing an integrated and layered architecture to provide multiple  opportunities to destroy ballistic missiles before they can reach their  targets. The system\u2019s architecture includes space-based and airborne  sensors as well as ground- and sea-based radars; ground- and sea-based  interceptor missiles; and a command and control, battle management, and  communications system to provide the warfighter with the necessary  communication links to the sensors and interceptor missiles.", "A typical engagement scenario to defend against an intercontinental  ballistic missile would occur as follows:   Infrared sensors aboard early-warning satellites detect the hot plume  of a missile launch and alert the command authority of a possible  attack.", "Upon receiving the alert, land- or sea-based radars are directed to  track the various objects released from the missile and, if so designed,  to identify the warhead from among spent rocket motors, decoys, and  debris.", "When the trajectory of the missile\u2019s warhead has been adequately  established, an interceptor\u2014consisting of a kill vehicle mounted atop a  booster\u2014is launched to engage the threat. The interceptor boosts  itself toward a predicted intercept point and releases the kill vehicle.    The kill vehicle uses its onboard sensors and divert thrusters to  detect, identify, and steer itself into the warhead. With a combined  closing speed of up to 10 kilometers per second (22,000 miles per  hour), the warhead is destroyed above the atmosphere through a \u201chit  to kill\u201d collision with the kill vehicle.    Some interceptors use sensors to steer themselves into the inbound  ballistic missile. Inside the atmosphere, these systems kill the ballistic  missile using a range of mechanisms such as direct collision between  the missile and the inbound ballistic missile or killing it with the  combined effects of a blast fragmentation warhead (heat, pressure,  and grains/shrapnel) in cases where a direct hit does not occur.", "Table 1 provides a brief description of nine BMDS elements and  supporting efforts currently under development by MDA."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acquisition Strategy for Missile Defense", "paragraphs": ["MDA has employed varied strategies to acquire and deploy missile defense  systems. From its inception in 2002 through 2007, MDA developed missile  defense capability in biennial increments, known as blocks. These 2-year  blocks were each built on preceding blocks and enhanced the  development and capability of the BMDS. However, there was little  visibility into baseline costs and schedules associated with systems that  comprised the blocks or how the blocks addressed particular threats. In  response to recommendations from GAO, in December 2007, MDA  announced a new block structure that was intended to improve the  program\u2019s transparency, accountability, and oversight. The new blocks  were not based on biennial time periods, but instead focused on fielding  capabilities that address particular threats. Because the new block  structure was not aligned to regular time periods, multiple blocks were  under way concurrently. The capabilities-based five-block approach  included several positive changes, including the commitment by DOD to  establish total acquisition costs and unit costs for selected block assets,  including in a block only those elements or components of elements that  would be fielded during the block and abandoning the practice of  deferring work from one block to another.", "MDA was still transitioning to this new capabilities-based block approach  when the MDA Director terminated it in June 2009\u2014a year and a half after  it was created. According to MDA, the agency terminated the capability- based block structure to address congressional concerns. The agency then  began to manage the BMDS as a single integrated program but planned to  report on cost, schedule, and performance issues by each element within  the program. At the time of our 2010 report, MDA was in the process of  determining how it would implement changes to its acquisition  management strategy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Shift in Approach to European Missile Defense", "paragraphs": ["Another significant change that took place in 2009 was the new  administration\u2019s shift in its approach to European missile defense. DOD  altered its approach to European defense, which originally focused on  ground-based interceptors (GBI) from the GMD element and a large fixed  radar as well as transportable X-Band radars, in order to provide defenses  against long-range threats to the United States and short-, medium-, and  intermediate-range Iranian threats to Europe. The new European PAA  consists primarily of Aegis BMD sea-based and land-based systems and  interceptors, as well as various sensors to be deployed over time as the  various capabilities are matured. According to DOD, this new approach  offers a number of improvements over the previous architecture, such as  providing missile defenses sooner with greater flexibility to meet evolving  threats, providing more opportunities to involve close allies, and delivering  greater capability to defend against a large number of threat missiles. In  essence, the new policy marks a fundamental change from an emphasis on  a global integrated system to a policy that bundles capability and tailors it  for different regions\u2014the PAA\u2014with the European PAA being the first of  these regional approaches.

It is  projected that each successive phase will deliver additional capability with  respect to both threat missile range and raid size.", "Table 2 outlines the plans and estimated delivery timeframes associated  with each European PAA phase.", "However, many aspects of the European PAA have not yet been  determined. DOD has thus far committed to using two land-based Aegis  Ashore facilities and at least one Army Navy/ Transportable Radar  Surveillance\u2014Model 2 (AN/TPY-2) radar. Additionally, each European  PAA phase could have as many as three Aegis BMD ship patrol areas, but  DOD has not yet committed to a specific number of ships or SM-3  interceptors for each phase.

Instead the program reported average unit costs  and, separately, recurring costs without defining these costs or  explaining their purpose the BAR.

We did not assess  those estimates further because they did not support the BAR baselines.  For the remaining 6, we found that the documentation that MDA provided  contained insufficient evidence to meet the characteristics of a high- quality cost estimate. Specifically, the estimates were not comprehensive,  lacked documentation, were not completely accurate, or were not  sufficiently credible. See figure 1 for the results of our review of the 6  estimates.", "The 6 estimates were not fully comprehensive because in some cases they  did not provide enough detail to enable us to determine if all government  and contractor costs had been included, or, in other cases, did not include  the historical data necessary to back up given assumptions. The estimates  were not well documented in some cases because the estimates lacked  documentation necessary to recreate the estimate, or, in some instances,  did not provide enough information on how cost factors were derived.  None of the estimates met the standards for accuracy because, in some  cases the estimates did not provide a confidence level making it  impossible to determine if the estimate was unbiased and based on most  likely costs, did not provide access to the detailed calculations used in the  estimate, or discrepancies existed on costs among several of the  documents provided. Finally, costs associated with the estimates lacked  credibility because none of the 6 estimates performed a cost sensitivity  analysis, provided evidence that cost driver cross checks were performed,  or completed independent cost estimates.", "As discussed above, one of the criteria for a credible cost estimate is  having an independent cost assessment. Other DOD major defense  acquisition programs are required to perform an independent cost  estimate before advancing through major milestones. Because of the  flexibilities granted in 2002, MDA is not required to obtain independent  cost estimates for its programs, and has not otherwise required their  programs to do so. The Office of the Director for Cost Assessment and  Program Evaluation (CAPE) has performed independent cost estimates for  the Aegis BMD program as well as portions of other MDA programs in the  past including the STSS and GMD programs. More recently, the CAPE  performed an independent cost estimate of THAAD procurement costs.  MDA has committed to work with the CAPE to develop cost estimates for  other MDA elements in the future. MDA\u2019s plans to work with the CAPE to  develop cost estimates for more MDA elements will contribute to the  credibility of its estimates.", "Although MDA established life cycle cost baselines as part of its resource  baseline for the first time in fiscal year 2010, cost progress cannot be  independently evaluated until MDA reports baselines that are supported  by reliable, high-quality cost estimates and addresses the issues noted in  appendix II."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Schedule Baseline", "paragraphs": ["The schedule baseline, as presented in the 2010 BAR, is a timeline for key  product development milestones and tasks, such as key decision points  and product deliveries.

In addition,  some schedule baselines also include scheduled flight and ground test  information, as well as fielding and field support events. For example, the  GMD schedule baseline shows fielding and field support deliveries, such  as hardware deliveries, which includes new and refurbished GBI  deliveries; facilities, such as silo construction; and software upgrades.  However, the amount and type of information presented varies from  element to element.", "While the amount of information presented is a significant improvement  over that in the 2009 BAR, we found that the asset delivery schedule  reported in the 2010 BAR was not comparable to the asset delivery  schedule in the 2009 BAR. The 2009 BAR included a comprehensive list of  planned asset deliveries, as well as schedule delays and accelerations.  However, the 2010 BAR did not include a comprehensive list of planned  asset deliveries nor did it report variances against the delivery plans it set  in 2009. As a result, we could not track and analyze the timing and number  of asset deliveries using the BAR. Instead, we had to request detailed  information from each program element. The lack of variance reporting on  asset deliveries from 2009 to 2010, coupled with the absence of planned  asset deliveries limits the usefulness of the BAR for oversight."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Test Baseline", "paragraphs": ["MDA\u2019s 2010 BAR includes a schedule of major flight tests, ground tests,  key modeling and simulation events and the primary goals associated with  those tests and events. The test events found in the BAR are further  detailed and explained in MDA\u2019s test baseline known as the Integrated  Master Test Plan (IMTP). The IMTP is the management tool that MDA uses  to establish and document test requirements for the BMDS test program.  We reported last year that MDA extensively revised the IMTP to address  concerns that the plan was not effective for management and oversight  because it was revised frequently, only extended through the following  fiscal year and was not well integrated with other key aspects of testing  such as target acquisitions. While the new IMTP still represents a  significant improvement in test planning and transparency for MDA,  frequent revisions to the test baseline due to test failures and/or target  availability, hinders external oversight of MDA\u2019s test baseline and the  funding allocated for testing.", "More specifically, the revised IMTP extended the test baseline through  2015 and better laid out MDA\u2019s test plan by establishing and documenting  the test requirements for the BMDS with specific focus on collecting the  data needed for verification, validation, and accreditation of the BMDS  models and simulations. Also, under the new plan, each test was designed  to test certain criteria, so that, according to MDA test officials, a failed test  did not necessarily require alteration to the IMTP.", "Despite the agency\u2019s effort to revamp its test plans, MDA\u2019s test plan  remains success-oriented. For example, MDA officials told us that they do  not plan for test failures when developing the test schedule and that there  is no flexibility to absorb test failures. Despite experiencing several  failures in recent years and conducting several retests, the agency does not  build in contingencies for retests in its test plans. Moreover, according to  program officials, there are no risk reduction flights planned for newly  developed targets and MDA does not budget for extra flight test  interceptors. Accordingly, having a sufficient schedule and funding margin  to account for actual recent experience remains key to a more successful  and stable test program.", "Because the IMTP is success-oriented, any problems encountered with the  plan necessitates a change in the plan and frequent changes to those plans  make it difficult to maintain effective oversight of MDA\u2019s test program  using the test baselines reported in the BAR. For example two intercept  tests that were planned for the THAAD program in fiscal year 2010 did not  take place because of a target failure in a previous flight test.  Additionally, MDA had to alter GMD\u2019s planned flight test schedule for  fiscal years 2010 and 2011 in order to conduct a retest of a prior test\u2014 FTG-06\u2014that failed January 2010. According to the Director, Operational  Test and Evaluation, this retest will likely delay the previous flight test  program by at least 6 months. Also, MDA canceled an additional future  flight test in order to conduct the retest, thereby reducing the amount of  intercept data that will be collected.", "These frequent changes make it more difficult to track testing progress  and system performance. Moreover, it is unclear what happens to funding  planned for tests within a certain fiscal year when the test is canceled or  moved to a subsequent fiscal year. Each year, as part of its budget request,  MDA justifies its flight test funding request based on a planned set of  specific tests. However, because MDA is unable to execute its test plan as  presented in the BAR and the budget and does not identify test cost  variances in the BAR or the budget, the connection between the  justification for funds and the actual execution is broken. For example,  MDA requested funding for a GMD flight test\u2014FTG-09. According to the  fiscal year 2010 budget request, this test was scheduled to be conducted in  fiscal year 2011 as a salvo test. However, because of the noted failure in  FTG-06, this test was canceled. Consequently, reviewing budget  documents and the BAR does not enable us to determine how much was  spent on the FTG-09 test prior to its deletion. Until MDA establishes or  reports a test baseline that is both relatively stable and synchronized with  other key BMDS management documents, such as the budget, as well as  identifies test cost variances, decision-makers will continue to make  decisions based on unstable data that are not effective for oversight or  useful for timely decisions.", "Lastly, as in prior years, target availability also continued to affect MDA\u2019s  test plans in fiscal year 2010. Since 2006, we have reported that target  availability has delayed and prompted modifications to planned test  objectives. This trend continued in 2010. For example, because of target  availability, five tests scheduled for fiscal year 2010 were canceled  because of a moratorium on air launches of targets. Additionally, target  shortfalls have contributed to delays in flight tests, reduced the number of  flight tests, and altered test objectives. According to MDA officials, targets  were the main driver of the revisions of the test schedule in the latest  IMTP.

In December 2010, we  issued a correspondence on acquisition management and near-term  development risks related to the European PAA.

With  respect to acquisition management for the European PAA, our December  2010 report found that DOD has not fully implemented a management  process that synchronizes European PAA acquisition activities and  ensures transparency and accountability. At the time of our review, DOD  had made progress in acquisition planning for technology development  and systems engineering and testing and partial progress in defining  requirements and identifying stakeholders but had not yet developed a  European PAA acquisition decision schedule or an overall European PAA  investment cost. We found that the limited visibility into the costs and  schedule for the European PAA and the lack of some key acquisition  management processes reflect the oversight challenges with the  acquisition of missile defense capabilities that we have previously  reported. The consequences of these issues have included limited means  of independently assessing progress and a limited basis for oversight and  the department entering into production before fully demonstrating  system performance, leading to rework, cost increases, delays, and  uncertainties about delivered capabilities. We concluded that for the  European PAA, the flexibility desired by DOD is not incompatible with  appropriate visibility into key aspects of acquisition management. As DOD  proceeds with the European PAA acquisition activities, it is important for  Congress and the President to have assurance that the European PAA  policy is working as intended and that acquisition activities are cost- effective.", "In response to our December 2010 report, DOD stated that it disagreed  with GAO\u2019s approach to assess the European PAA as what it termed a  \u201cnear-distinct\u201d element of the BMDS, rather than DOD\u2019s decision to  employ the department\u2019s existing processes. As we have consistently  reported, the department\u2019s existing processes for developing and acquiring  missile defense have transparency and accountability issues that limit  oversight and preclude assessing overall progress and limit opportunities  for constructive action to put programs in a better position to succeed.  The principles we used to assess the European PAA are embedded in the  department\u2019s acquisition guidance as well as the Office of Management  and Budget\u2019s guidance for capital programming across federal agencies,  particularly as it relates to bringing together and synchronizing multiple  development efforts. Although we understand that the European PAA is a  policy approach, not an acquisition program, it nonetheless represents an  arrangement of significant investments, it requires a high degree of  coordination and technical integration, and the progress implementing the  European PAA continues to be of congressional interest.

According to the  Ballistic Missile Defense Review, over the past few years, MDA  accelerated development of the homeland defense by simultaneously  developing and fielding assets. This step was taken largely in order to  facilitate the deployment of GBIs in time to coincide with the expected  deployment of intercontinental ballistic missiles by North Korea. That  projected intercontinental ballistic missile deployment has not yet  occurred and consequently, DOD concluded that it is unnecessary to  continue to accept the same level of programmatic risk in the GMD  program going forward. Rather, the department plans to focus homeland  defense on maintaining the current level of capability and developing  future, proven capabilities to enhance homeland defense should a new  threat emerge while still maintaining current GMD capabilities.", "We were mandated by the Congress in 2009 to examine a DOD assessment  and plan related to the GMD system, that included issues related to  acquisition, sustainment and refurbishment. We found that while the GMD  system has demonstrated a limited capability, DOD has not yet determined  the system\u2019s full capabilities and limitations. According to the Director of  Operational Test and Evaluation\u2019s fiscal year 2010 assessment, ground  tests support characterization of GMD performance and test results  suggest that GMD provides a capability to defend the United States against  limited, uncomplicated, long-range ballistic missile threats. However, lack  of sufficient data for comprehensive model and simulation validation and  accreditation continues to preclude a full performance evaluation of GMD.  Even though GMD continued to further develop its capability in fiscal year  2010, the GMD program has been unable to successfully achieve all of its  testing objectives since 2005. Testing shortfalls continued in fiscal year  2010 when GMD failed to achieve an intercept during Flight Test Ground- based Interceptor (FTG)-06. As we previously reported, FTG-06 was  planned as the first test of GMD\u2019s enhanced version of the kill vehicle  called the Capability Enhancement II (CE-II). Additionally, we noted that  MDA stated that the CE-II interceptors would not be declared operational  until the satisfactory completion of FTG-06. As a result of the failure in  FTG-06, MDA inserted FTG-06a, which also failed to achieve an intercept  in December 2010.", "Despite testing delays, shortfalls, and failures, MDA has continued to  deliver assets. For example, neither the Capability Enhancement I (CE-I)  or CE-II Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) has verified its capability  against countermeasures\u2014a capability it expected to demonstrate for the  CE-I in 2008. Failures in both the target and the interceptors over several  years have prevented collecting this information. Moreover, the CE-II EKV  has not successfully intercepted a target. Despite these shortfalls all CE-I  EKVs have been delivered and the manufacturing and emplacements of  the CE-II EKV continued in 2010. According to the Director, MDA, based  on the issues that arose in FTG-06a, he directed the agency to stop taking  deliveries of any more completed CE-II EKVs. MDA officials stated that the  agency is allowing the contractor to continue to work on those  components of the EKV that would not be factors in the FTG-06a flight test  anomaly in order to keep the production line moving and to allow a rapid  recovery of deliveries once the failure investigation team determines likely  cause or causes and develops either design changes or mitigations.

This plan  was undertaken in response to GAO findings regarding cost, schedule and  performance problems with the previous targets acquisition approach.", "MDA conducted a business case analysis in order to identify a new  acquisition plan that could address these problems. This new approach  was to seek separate, competitive contract awards for different classes of  targets, allowing MDA to benefit from greater opportunities for  competition and reducing the role of the prime contractor. In fiscal year  2010, as part of this strategy, MDA issued two solicitations: one for  medium-range targets, and another for intermediate-range targets.  However, the agency canceled the solicitation for medium-range targets  after receiving proposals. According to MDA officials, the proposals  received were more expensive than anticipated. MDA officials cited  higher-than-expected costs for the proposals received on the medium- range solicitation as the primary reason it was canceled, but the  information they provided did not show detailed analysis of the effect of  the cancellation on the cost and schedule assumptions of the business  case. The cost effects of this change remain unknown. According to  targets program officials, they may issue a new competitive solicitation for  medium-range targets, but they have not yet done so. MDA also issued a  draft solicitation for intercontinental-range targets in September 2010, but  canceled the solicitation in February 2011 before it was finalized.", "Separately, MDA also issued a new undefinitized contract action in the  second quarter of fiscal year 2010, which asked the incumbent prime  contractor to build five new medium-range air-launched targets. MDA  officials stated that this action was in response to the target failure in the  FTT-11 flight test, and was not related to the cancellation of the medium- range solicitation. Undefinitized contract actions authorize contractors to  begin work before reaching a final agreement on contract terms. The  current \u201cnot-to-exceed\u201d level for the contract action is $496 million. MDA  has allowed this undefinitized contract action to continue for an extended  period\u2014over 290 days as of January 2011. According to MDA officials,  the delay in definitization is due to changes in its requirements for the  targets, and they anticipate definitization in July 2011, by which time the  contract action will have remained undefinitized for about 450 days. The  extended use of undefinitized contract actions has previously been  identified by GAO and others as risky for the government. Because  contracting officers normally reimburse contractors for all allowable costs  they incur before definitization, contractors bear less risk and have little  incentive to control costs during this period. The government also risks  incurring unnecessary costs as requirements may change before the  contract is definitized. According to MDA officials, acquiring these new  medium-range air-launched targets through an undefinitized action was  necessary in order to meet the testing schedule. Documentation provided  by the agency showed only limited analysis prior to the decision to award  the undefinitized contract action. Officials recognized that this approach  would add to the cost of targets compared to the Air Force contract  vehicle they had previously used, but because the action remains  undefinitized, the agency does not yet know the final price of these targets.

Such an end-to- end system-level simulation brings together the capabilities of various  element models in order to analyze how the BMDS integrated and fielded  radars, communication systems, and interceptors perform during  scenarios. To work effectively, these models and simulations need to be  anchored to data from ground and flight tests and validated by  independent evaluators\u2014the BMDS Operational Test Agency (OTA)\u2014in  order to have confidence in their results. Moreover, the system-level  simulation itself is expected to change over time as additional models  become available to represent the evolving BMDS configuration.

The agency was able to conduct several BMDS  element tests that generated data needed to accredit models and  simulations as well as assess performance for individual BMDS elements.  For example, in June 2010 during a GMD booster verification test, C2BMC  was able to collect data for accreditation of its models and simulations  while demonstrating command and control of a key BMDS radar. In  addition, in August 2010, MDA and the BMDS OTA conducted a ground  test referred to as Ground Test Integrated-04b (GTI-04b), to demonstrate  functionality, interoperability, and performance of the BMDS and to  characterize BMDS element capabilities. According to the Director of  Operational Test and Evaluation, this test provided the most accurate  representation to date of the BMDS including GMD for characterization of  performance as well as insight into GMD functionality, interoperability,  and performance within the BMDS. Test results suggested that GMD  provides a capability to defend the United States against limited long- range ballistic missiles with uncomplicated, emerging threat reentry  vehicles.", "While some individual BMDS elements\u2019 models and simulations provided  insight into their interoperability and performance within the BMDS,  BMDS OTA officials told us that current BMDS system-level modeling and  infrastructure are inadequate to assess the overall performance of the  BMDS. BMDS OTA officials told us that the current IMTP focuses on data  needed to accredit element-level models, but it does not address system- level integrated performance. In an August 2009 memorandum to MDA, the  BMDS OTA and the Joint Functional Component Command for Integrated  Missile Defense, referred to as the Warfighter, identified testing  requirements that are needed to assess BMDS performance. More  importantly, in this memorandum both the BMDS OTA and the Warfighter  alerted MDA that there were a number of system-level model,  infrastructure, and stimuli limitations that adversely affected the OTA\u2019s  ability to assess BMDS performance. The Warfighter and the BMDS OTA  require testing to reflect realistic representations of strategic and  regional/theater defense designs with the full complement of fielded  BMDS assets. The BMDS OTA and the Warfighter noted that as the BMDS  matures and fielded assets increase, modeling and simulation capabilities  and laboratory representations of BMDS assets must keep pace to  maintain operational realism. However, they stated that current laboratory  and model and simulation limitations prevent full asset representation and  fail to test the loading that would occur on the communication links as  well as the complexity of a full regional/theater conflict on command and  control nodes.

In doing so, MDA Cost Estimating and Analysis  Directorate plans to form a cost assessment group to formally assess each  cost estimate to ensure they are well documented, comprehensive,  accurate, and credible. DOD also fully concurred with our  recommendation to report the cost effects of its test changes in either the  BAR or budget justification documentation, stating that MDA will provide  the cost effects as part of the individual program resource baselines  starting in the 2012 BAR.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of  Defense direct MDA to include all sunk costs in all of its cost estimates  and baselines. DOD stated that MDA will continue to report sunk costs in  most of its acquisition programs except targets, where it will continue to  report unit costs in the same manner as the 2010 and 2011 BARs.  According to DOD, because each target is inherently a test article and no  two are identical, there are always variable non-recurring costs associated  with each article. Also, due to the extensive reuse of previous strategic  missile components in the targets program, including all sunk costs does  not reflect MDA program costs accurately. Accordingly, MDA will use the  costs incurred/planned during the future years defense plan to calculate  unit costs. These unit costs will not include any sunk costs. We continue to  believe that all costs, including all sunk costs incurred for individual target  efforts, should be reported to the maximum extent possible, regardless of  the agency or service that originally incurred those costs. To the extent  that a sunk cost, such as the original cost of previous strategic missile  components, can not be calculated, that fact should be explained when the  costs are reported. Moreover, DOD\u2019s method of reporting and baselining  target unit costs will not reflect even MDA program costs accurately  because it excludes MDA-incurred sunk costs. Excluding these costs,  which can run into the hundreds of millions of dollars, precludes  understanding of the full investment required to develop and procure  targets, as well as limiting insight into developmental progress. In addition,  the incomplete costs reported will be changed every two years because, as  DOD noted, MDA uses only the costs for the future years defense plan to  calculate the target unit cost baselines. The future years defense plan  covers a six year period of time, but changes every two years to a new six  year period of time. Calculating unit costs this way provides neither the  full cost nor the full quantities of targets as it removes any costs or  quantities prior to fiscal year 2010. We therefore continue to believe that  including these costs will aid departmental and congressional decision  makers as they make difficult choices of where to invest limited resources.", "DOD also partially concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary  of Defense direct MDA to report, in its annual reports on acquisition  baselines, variances in quantities of assets by fiscal year that are or were  to be delivered each fiscal year and the reasons for these differences. DOD  stated that a change in an asset quantity in a fiscal year may drive a  reportable BMDS schedule variance and noted that any changes in asset  quantities would also be reflected in unit costs and in the technical  baseline. In a separate response, DOD stated that in meeting new statutory  requirements, MDA will report a comprehensive list of actual versus  planned assets that are or will be delivered each fiscal year. MDA, in its  2009 BAR, included a comprehensive list of actual versus planned  quantities of assets that were to be delivered each fiscal year as its  schedule baseline, identified the criteria for reporting schedule variances,  and also planned to provide the rationale for any variances. MDA is now  statutorily required to establish an acquisition baseline for each element  that includes a comprehensive schedule, including delivery and fielding  schedules. In addition, because DOD has stated that they will include  actual versus planned quantities when meeting annual baseline reporting  requirements, we continue to believe that additionally reporting the  rationale for these variances, as MDA had previously committed to, would  benefit departmental and congressional decision makers as they meet  their obligations to manage and oversee this effort.", "DOD also partially concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary  of Defense direct MDA to include sufficient schedule and resource margin,  including spare test assets and targets, based on recent test experience  and forecasted testing demands. DOD responded that maintaining  cost/schedule margins and additional targets is not cost effective. Instead,  DOD stated that MDA will conduct an event-oriented test and acquisition  decision-based program and update the test plan frequently to reflect the  status of test execution. In addition, DOD noted that MDA will use a  \u201crolling spare\u201d approach to targets. We remain concerned about MDA\u2019s  inability to successfully execute those plans. MDA changed its approach to  testing 2 years ago, after struggling for years to successfully execute the  test plan, instituting a more rigorous planning effort. However, despite  increased attention to defining and resourcing its test plan, it has been  unable to stabilize and execute the plan successfully.  Without a change in  its approach, MDA is almost certain to continue to set and reset test plans  that are immediately unexecutable soon after they are reset. This  approach incurs significant hidden or unplanned costs as testing is  delayed and test plans are restructured. As we testified February 25, 2009,  the success of MDA\u2019s test planning hinges on properly resourcing the tests  with sufficient time, funding and reliable targets. Our current  recommendation, based on the experience of the last 2 years, is designed  to help stabilize the test plan and reduce the frequency and effort required  to reset the test plan while gathering the knowledge MDA has decided it  needs as efficiently as possible. Until MDA adds sufficient cost and  schedule margin, including additional interceptors and targets, it will  continue to achieve less testing, at a greater cost than planned. We  therefore continue to believe that the department and Congress would  benefit if test plans incorporate reasonable cost and schedule margins.", "Lastly, DOD identified 35 \u201cfactual errors\" in its technical comments.  However, upon review we found that 7 of the 35 were not errors of fact,  but rather different conclusions; 6 we determined were errors in DOD's  official comments, 12 required additional substantiation that was not  provided or were material previously requested but could not be assessed  during this review because the extensive delay left no time for analysis;  and lastly 10 we determined were actual errors of facts and we therefore  made the appropriate changes in those cases.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense and to the  Director of MDA.

MDA presented unit cost baselines for specific assets of each element as  well as baselines for cost components of the element including  development, production and deployment, and military construction costs.  As a result, there can be multiple baselines for each element. MDA  expressed the majority of its unit costs as program acquisition unit cost  (PAUC) or average procurement unit cost (APUC). The APUC is the total  procurement funds divided by the fielded quantity, and was included as  part of MDA\u2019s unit cost baselines for the first time in the 2009 BAR. The  PAUC is the total cost for the development and procurement of the  acquisition program divided by the total quantity, and was included for  most of the elements for the first time in the 2010 BAR in response to GAO  recommendations. MDA\u2019s 2010 BAR also presented, for the first time, a  baseline for portions of, and in some cases all, life cycle costs based on life  cycle cost estimates for several BMDS components.", "Other major defense acquisition programs are required by statute to  describe program goals in an acquisition program baseline that, as  implemented by the Department of Defense (DOD), has been approved by  a higher-level DOD official prior to the program\u2019s initiation. The baseline,  derived from the best estimates of cost, schedule, and performance  requirements, provides decision makers with the program\u2019s total cost for  an increment of work, unit costs for assets to be delivered, the date that an  initial operational capability will be fielded, and the weapon\u2019s intended  performance parameters. The baseline, according to DOD acquisition  guidance, includes cost parameters that should reflect realistic cost  estimates of the total program and/or increment, and should contain cost  parameters for major elements of program life-cycle cost. The elements of  a program\u2019s life-cycle cost include research, development, test, and  evaluation; production and deployment; military construction; operation  and sustainment; and disposal costs. Once approved, major defense  acquisition programs are required to measure their program against the  baseline. The threshold application of these laws and policies related to  baselines are typically triggered by a program\u2019s entry into engineering and  manufacturing development (formerly system development and  demonstration)\u2014a phase in the DOD acquisition cycle during which the  weapon system is designed and then demonstrated in tests.

For example, MDA presented \u201clife  cycle costs\u201d in several resource baselines but it was unclear in the BAR  whether these costs cover the full range of cost categories or cost  components normally included in a life cycle cost estimate. In addition,  although MDA presented baselines for some of the costs, and, in other  cases, all of the costs included in its life cycle costs, program officials told  us that they mistakenly baselined operation and sustainment costs in the  2010 BAR and intend to remove those baselines in the 2011 BAR. Officials  also told us that they do not plan to report variances in future BARs for  any of the remaining development and production costs that are baselined.  The operation and sustainment costs that MDA did report in the BAR were  incomplete and unclear because, except in one case, they did not include  the costs borne by the services and there was no explanation in the BAR  for these exclusions. The resource baselines also included many  inconsistencies that were unexplained in the BAR. For example, MDA did  not report unit cost variances that could have been reported and MDA  presented alternate versions of unit costs without explaining how these  unit costs were constructed. There also appeared to be instances of  underestimating life cycle costs when we compared the time-phased  estimate to the life cycle cost baseline. It was unclear why these  inconsistencies existed for the life cycle cost baselines because MDA did  not explain in the BAR how any portions of the life cycle costs were  baselined.", "Although MDA termed one section of its resource baseline \u201clife cycle  costs,\u201d the use of the term is misleading because in some cases the  reported totals appeared to only partially reflect all the main life cycle cost  categories. These categories normally include research and development,  production and deployment, operation and sustainment, and disposal  costs. Life cycle should be thought of as a \u201ccradle to grave\u201d approach to  managing a program throughout its useful life. This usually entails  identifying all cost elements that pertain to the program from initial  concept all the way through operations, support, and disposal. For some  of the elements, not all of these cost categories were identifiable in the  figures reported and as a result it appears that the totals reported were  mislabeled as life cycle costs. Specifically, it appeared that the Aegis  Ashore and future Aegis BMD ship software upgrades elements may not  have included operation and sustainment costs. It also appeared that none  of the 12 baselines reported disposal costs. No explanation was given in  the BAR for the exclusion of either of these cost categories or why the  term life cycle cost is appropriate for what was reported.", "In another instance, the information reported in three of the four Targets  and Countermeasures resource baselines was not complete because sunk  costs were excluded from the life cycle cost baselines. The short-range  ballistic missile effort excluded more than $400 million in sunk costs from  its baseline, to leave less than 43 percent of its total estimated costs  baselined. The intermediate-range ballistic missile effort also removed  more than $900 million in sunk costs from its baselined development  costs, choosing to baseline less than half of the total estimated costs. MDA  did note in the BAR that costs beyond fiscal year 2015 were excluded from  the Targets and Countermeasures baselines because the quantities of  targets were uncertain in the years beyond 2015. The BAR, however, does  not inform the reader that the sunk costs were excluded nor does it  explain why MDA decided to exclude them. Agency officials told us that  sunk costs were excluded from the development baseline because sunk  costs did not fit the definition of average unit cost for the targets.  However, this response still does not explain why these costs were  excluded from the life cycle cost baselines. Excluding these costs in the  baseline means that the full costs through 2015 for these efforts are  underestimated and, therefore, are not transparent to decision makers  external to the agency.", "MDA officials told us that they mistakenly reported operation and  sustainment costs as baselined for several elements and stated that they  do not intend to report variances for the remaining baselined portions of  life cycle costs, despite indications in the 2010 resource baselines that  variances would be reported in the future. For the current THAAD  capability configuration and the Aegis BMD SM-3 Block IB missiles and  associated software upgrades for shipsets, agency officials said that  reporting the operation and sustainment costs associated with these  elements as a baseline was an error. Although the agency intends to  continue to report operation and sustainment costs, they do not consider  those costs baselined and will not report them as part of the baseline in  the future. Choosing not to baseline these costs, in some cases, removes a  large portion of costs from the total cost baseline MDA is reporting. See  table 6 for details on the operation and sustainment costs as a percentage  of total costs MDA will not baseline in the future.", "Further, the operation and sustainment costs that MDA reported in the  BAR were incomplete and unclear because, except in one case, they did  not include the costs borne by the services and there was no explanation  in the BAR for these exclusions. By excluding the services\u2019 portion of  these costs, the operation and sustainment costs reported in the BAR for  four out of five of the elements\u2019 efforts are underestimated since they only  include those costs that MDA will be responsible for paying. Only the  operation and sustainment costs reported for the two capability deliveries  for the SBX Radar included both the costs borne by MDA and the service.", "The BAR does not explain these differences or exclusions in reporting its  operation and sustainment costs.", "In addition, MDA officials stated that although MDA will continue to  report development, production and deployment, and military  construction costs as baselined, none of these baselines will report  variances. They stated that the resource baselines are represented solely  by unit cost baselines\u2014not by any baselines for life cycle costs. Officials  told us that there is no technical reason that prevents MDA from reporting  variances for development, production and deployment, or military  construction costs. It is also unclear why the agency will not report  baselines and variances for operation and sustainment costs. Reporting  variances is important because deviations from the baseline plan give  management at all levels information about where corrective actions are  needed to bring the program back on track. While variances are often  perceived as something bad, they provide valuable insight into program  risk and its causes and can empower management to make decisions  about how to best handle risks.", "Although MDA presented APUC unit costs in its 2009 BAR, it only reported  on six of the ten APUCs presented in last year\u2019s BAR. In addition, it did not  present variances for any of these unit costs or explain why these  variances were not provided. Of these six, MDA could have reported  variances on three according to the agency\u2019s own definition of a  variance\u2014a cost increase of 10 percent or more when compared to the  original resource baseline for a BMDS product. In the case of the THAAD  fire control, the unit cost increased by more than 20 percent. According to  MDA, the agency did not report on APUC unit costs for four of the assets  presenting APUCs in the 2009 BAR because it considered these programs  to be complete and the 2009 BAR to be a final report. However, one of the  four assets not reporting an APUC in the 2010 BAR is the Aegis BMD SM-3  Block IA missile for which, during fiscal year 2010, the agency delivered an  additional 26 missiles. It is unclear why the agency did not provide an  updated APUC for this asset in the 2010 BAR since it was not complete  before fiscal year 2010. In addition, the 2010 BAR did not explain MDA\u2019s  decision to stop reporting these four assets. MDA officials also stated that  no variances were reported because the agency considers the 2010 BAR  resource baselines to be the first established unit cost baselines. However,  the agency first reported APUC costs in 2009, and the 2009 BAR explicitly  refers to these as \u201cunit cost baselines.\u201d Further, the 2009 BAR states that  the agency would report any variances to these APUC baselines in the  2010 BAR. See table 7 for a comparison of the 2009 BAR APUC unit costs  to the 2010 BAR APUC unit costs and associated unreported variances.", "MDA was also unclear and inconsistent in how it reported target unit costs  and did not define or explain these inconsistencies in the BAR. While MDA  reported APUC and PAUC for most of its unit cost baselines, it chose to  instead report average unit costs for its 4 Targets and Countermeasures  program efforts presented in the BAR\u2014short-range, medium-range,  intermediate-range, and intercontinental ballistic missile targets. It also  separately reported the non-recurring costs to develop these targets. There  was no explanation in the BAR as to how the targets\u2019 average unit costs  were constructed or why the targets required a different reporting method  from the rest of the BMDS element assets. MDA officials told us that since  Targets and Countermeasures is procuring targets and is not a  developmental acquisition program, that reporting APUC and PAUC was  not the best method for reporting unit costs for targets. However, MDA is  investing significant amounts to develop the targets it needs. MDA  reported in the 2010 BAR that it is planning to invest $2.4 billion to develop  and procure targets between fiscal years 2010 and 2015.", "By reporting only the average unit costs for targets, which officials told us  was the same as the average recurring costs, MDA is not reporting the full  unit costs to develop and procure targets.  In analyzing the information in  the 2010 BAR, we determined that in only 4 of the 12 separate target unit  costs reported did the BAR provide enough information to calculate PAUC  costs. For example, while MDA reported that the new extended medium  range ballistic missile average unit cost was $29 million, if it had included  all reported development costs, it could have reported a PAUC of $60  million for these targets. In addition, the planned new intermediate range  ballistic missile reported an average unit cost of $40 million, but had it  included all reported development costs, it could have reported a PAUC of  $109 million. For 8 of the 12 targets presenting average unit costs,  including the LV-2 intermediate range target, insufficient information was  presented in the BAR to calculate a PAUC.", "The 2010 BAR\u2019s life cycle cost baselines also lacked clarity and  consistency in how some costs were accounted for, giving the appearance  that some of the baselines were underestimated. MDA presented both a  time-phased estimate in then-year dollars and a life cycle cost baseline in  base year dollars, without providing any details in the BAR on how these  costs were converted. For example, sunk costs presented in the time- phased estimates were sometimes converted to base year dollars in the life  cycle cost baseline and other times not converted. Four of the life cycle  costs baselines contained sunk costs that were not converted. Not  converting these costs to base year dollars means these costs were  underestimated in the life cycle cost baseline. However, it is not possible  to assess by how much these costs are underestimated since, in some  cases, life cycle cost estimates did not include details on the span of years  included in sunk costs. Without knowing which years are covered or being  able to account for the costs per year, we were unable to verify the  estimates for sunk costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Life Cycle Cost Baselines Are Not Based on High-Quality Cost Estimates", "paragraphs": ["We assessed MDA\u2019s life cycle cost estimates using the GAO Cost  Estimating and Assessment Guide that is based on best practices in cost  estimating and which identifies key criteria for establishing high quality  cost estimates.

Of the remaining 6 life cycle cost estimates, none  fully met the 4 characteristics of high-quality cost estimates as established  by the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide.", "According to the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, the cost  estimate is part of a total systems analysis and is a critical element in any  acquisition process to help decision makers evaluate resource  requirements at milestones and other important decision points. Cost  estimates establish and defend budgets and drive affordability analysis.  The guide identifies 12 steps necessary for developing a high-quality cost  estimate. According to the guide, documentation is a pervasive  requirement throughout the 12 steps needed to establish a reliable cost  estimate. The detailed documentation called for in the guide addresses the  purpose of the estimate, the program background and system description,  its schedule, the scope of the estimate (in terms of time and what is and is  not included), the ground rules and assumptions, all data sources,  estimating methodology and rationale, the results of the risk analysis, and  a conclusion about whether the cost estimate is reasonable. A cost  estimate is much more than just a single number. It is a compilation of  many lower-level cost element estimates that span several years, based on  the program schedule. Therefore, a good cost estimate\u2014while taking the  form of a single number\u2014is supported by detailed documentation that  describes how it was derived and how the expected funding will be spent  in order to achieve a given objective. This documentation should include  enough detail that a cost analyst unfamiliar with the program could  recreate it quickly with the same result.", "Our research has identified a number of best practices that are the basis of  effective program cost estimating and should result in reliable and valid  cost estimates that management and key decision makers can use for  making informed decisions. These four characteristics of a high-quality  and reliable cost estimate are comprehensive, well documented, accurate,  and credible. A cost estimate is considered:    Comprehensive: when it accounts for all possible costs associated with  a project, details all cost-influencing ground rules and assumptions, is  technically reasonable, is structured in sufficient detail to ensure that  costs are neither omitted nor double-counted, and the estimating  teams\u2019 composition is commensurate with the assignment;    Well-documented: when supporting documentation for the estimate is  accompanied by a narrative explaining the process, sources, and  methods used to create the estimate and contains the underlying data  used to develop the estimate;    Accurate: when the estimate is not overly conservative or too  optimistic and is based on an assessment of the costs most likely to be  incurred; and    Credible: when the estimate has been cross-checked with independent  cost estimates, the level of confidence associated with the point  estimate has been identified, and a sensitivity analysis has been  conducted\u2014that is, the project has examined the effect of changing  one assumption related to each project activity while holding all other  variables constant in order to identify which variable most affects the  cost estimate.", "Although MDA cost officials stated that MDA followed the GAO Cost  Estimating and Assessment Guide for building cost estimates and  baselines, the documentation that MDA provided for the 6 life cycle cost  estimates contained insufficient evidence to meet the characteristics of a  high-quality cost estimate. In our analysis, we used ratings to describe how  much of the criteria the documentation met toward being comprehensive,  well-documented, accurate, and credible. The ratings we used were as  follows: \u201cMet\u201d means that the program provided documentation that  satisfied the criterion; \u201cSubstantially met\u201d means that the program  provided the majority of the documentation to satisfy the criterion;  \u201cPartially met\u201d means that the program provided documentation satisfying  part of the criterion; \u201cMinimally met\u201d means that the program provided  documentation satisfying a minor part of the criterion; and \u201cNot met\u201d  means that the program did not provide documentation that satisfied the  criterion. See figure 2 for the results of our review of the 6 estimates.", "The 6 estimates were not fully comprehensive because they did not  provide enough detail to enable us to determine if all government and  contractor costs had been included, and it was unclear if the cost estimate  was derived from a detailed work breakdown structure allowing us to  check if all of the life cycle costs were fully accounted for. In addition, 4 of  the estimates did not include the historical data necessary to back up  given assumptions. The estimates were not well documented in 5 cases  because the estimates lacked documentation necessary to be able to  recreate the estimates, and further did not include an electronic cost  model to provide the information necessary to understand how each  estimate was created. The remaining estimate was not considered well  documented because, in some instances, it did not provide enough  information on how cost factors were derived, and cited methodology but  did not include the backup analysis to support it. None of the estimates  met the standards for accuracy. For example, four of the estimates did not  provide a confidence level in the estimate making it impossible to  determine if the estimate was unbiased and based on most likely costs, did  not provide access to the detailed calculations used in the estimate, or did  not provide the historical data to allow us to check the reliability of the  sources or how data is verified for accuracy. The other two cost estimates  lacked accuracy because discrepancies existed on costs among several of  the documents provided or the costs did not match the summary estimates  reported in the BAR. Finally, costs associated with the estimates lacked  credibility because none of the six estimates performed a cost sensitivity  analysis, provided evidence that cost driver cross checks were performed,  or completed independent cost estimates. In addition, MDA performed a  cost and risk uncertainty analysis on only one of the six estimates, without  which the estimate lacks the level of confidence associated with achieving  the cost estimate.", "As discussed above, one of the criteria for a credible cost estimate is  having an independent cost assessment. Other DOD major defense  acquisition programs are required to perform an independent cost  estimate before advancing through major milestones. Because of the  flexibilities granted in 2002, MDA is not required to obtain independent  cost estimates for its programs, and has not otherwise required their  programs to do so. The Office of the Director for Cost Assessment and  Program Evaluation (CAPE) has performed independent cost estimates for  the Aegis BMD program as well as portions of other MDA programs in the  past including the STSS and GMD programs. More recently, the CAPE  performed an independent cost estimate of THAAD procurement costs.  MDA has committed to work with the CAPE to develop cost estimates for  other MDA elements in the future.

The TDACS issues relate to the operational  suitability and expected lifetime of the interceptor. The first intercept  flight test, FTM-16, was moved into the third quarter fiscal year 2011 to  allow time to investigate and resolve the issues. FTM-16 is critical to  demonstrating the interceptor performance, as well as being required to  certify the Aegis combat system. According to the Director, MDA, the  flight test was rescheduled to allow time to complete qualification tests.  Design verification and qualification tests validate component  performance, reliability and producibility. MDA has since determined the  root cause of the TDACS problem and identified two design  improvements. However, due to continuing delays redesigned TDACS  components will not be included in the interceptor manufactured for FTM- 16; instead, it will be manufactured using a new process control to  partially mitigate the issue. Further, MDA has since decided to conduct the  flight test in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 without completing the  qualification tests as originally planned. The TDACS qualifications and  verifications leading up to the FTM-16 intercept test will be limited to the  environmental conditions expected during the FTM-16 event.

Since 2004, we have  continually reported that GMD has experienced difficulty in conducting its  annual flight test plan, a difficulty that continued in 2010 as well.   According to MDA\u2019s fiscal year 2010 budget request, the GMD program  expected to conduct two tests utilizing its two-stage booster in fiscal year  2010. However, the program modified this plan to include one intercept  test (FTG-06) that utilized the enhanced kill vehicle known as the CE-II  EKV and one booster verification test for the two-stage design. As we  previously reported, FTG-06 was important because it was planned as the  first intercept test of this version of the EKV, and because it was  designed to demonstrate a long-flight time for the GBI and GMD\u2019s  capability against countermeasures. MDA officials told us that they will  not add the CE-II EKV to the operational baseline until after the successful  completion of an intercept test. One such test, FTG-06, was conducted in  January 2010, but was unsuccessful: the CE-II EKV failed to achieve an  intercept of the target.

For example, as we previously reported, MDA projected, prior to FTG-06,  that the test would cost over $236 million while the Defense Contract  Management Agency estimated that the cost was likely to exceed $310  million. These costs were likely understated because they did not include  all of the cost increases of delaying the test first to September 2009, nor  did they include any cost increases of further delaying the test to fiscal  year 2010 or for investigating the failure. Additionally, as noted above  because FTG-06 failed MDA inserted FTG-06a which was structured to  capture the same objectives.  It is therefore likely that the cost to conduct  the FTG-06a test was similarly expensive.", "It should be noted that although the program failed to successfully  complete its intercept tests in fiscal year 2010, MDA was able to conduct a  non-intercept flight test of its two-stage GBI (designated BVT-01) in June  2010.

First, delays in validating capability results in a reduce level  of knowledge needed to inform GMD models. Second the production and  fielding of the CE-II EKVs has gotten ahead of testing. Currently, even  though the CE-II has failed both intercept attempts, 12 of the 23 CE-II GBIs  have already been delivered. Additionally, according to the March 2010  plan, all CE-IIs under contract are expected to be delivered prior to fully  validating its capability. Third, GMD\u2019s current flight test plan assumes  success and any flight test failures could require difficult decisions, such  as a reduction in planned developmental flight tests or the use of an  interceptor designated as an operational spares or for stockpile reliability  testing. For example, FTG-09, a salvo test planned for fiscal year 2011, was  canceled in order to re-conduct FTG-06. Although the flight test objectives  were moved to FTG-06a and FTG-08, this removes an opportunity to  collect performance data needed to develop GMD models and to assess  the capability of the EKV. Additionally, as we previously reported, the  repetition of intercept-related objectives is important to build confidence  in the intercept capability. Consequently, the delays in validating  capability results in a reduced level of knowledge needed to inform the  GMD program leaving a significant amount of data still needing to be  gathered to fully assess GMD capability.

In addition, we met with  officials in the Targets and Countermeasures Program Office to obtain  information on the target acquisition strategy including plans for cost,  schedule, and testing as well as to discuss the progress, challenges, and  lessons learned during fiscal year 2010 testing. We also interviewed  officials within program offices and within MDA functional directorates,  such as the Directorates for Engineering and Testing.

In our July report, MDA stated that it intended  to  take a key step in addressing our recommendations by conducting a major review of the GMD program\u2019s EVM data by the end of September 2010.  Because MDA provided documentation of its actions at the end of our  audit\u2014in February 2011\u2014leaving no time for review, we will assess  whether the steps MDA has taken sufficiently address GMD's data  reliability issues in n ext year's report.", "As noted above, during the course this audit, we experienced significant  delays in obtaining information from MDA. During the audit, MDA did not  always provide GAO staff with expeditious access to requested documents  and articles of information, which delayed some audit analysis and  contributed to extra staff hours. Notwithstanding these delays, we were  able to obtain the information needed to satisfy our objectives in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  However, we were not given access until Late February 2011 to the  September 2009 European Phased Adaptive Approach cost estimate, the  backup material for the Baseline Execution Reviews, or the actions MDA  took to respond to our previous recommendations on Earned Value  Management. As a result, we were unable to assess this material as part of  this year's annual review. We intend to review this material as part of our  next mandated annual assessment. subcontractor providing medium-range targets. We also met with Coleman  Aerospace officials in Orlando, Florida to discuss their work on short- range targets and the actions they are taking in response to a December  2009 target failure. We met with Lockheed Martin official in Troy, Alabama  to discuss their role in developing THAAD interceptors.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2010 to March 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, David Best, Assistant Director;  LaTonya Miller; Ivy H\u00fcbler; Teague Lyons; Steven Stern; Gwyneth  Woolwine; Meredith Allen Kimmett; Brian Tittle; Letisha Antone; Kenneth  E.
