The United States helps finance these organizations' operating expenses through assessed contributions (fees) that are based in part on the size of the U.S. economy relative to those of other members. The Reform Act required State to submit a strategy identifying, among other things, a path toward the adoption of reforms to the OAS's assessed quota structure to ensure that no member will pay more than 50 percent of OAS assessed contributions. In addition, the United States also provides the OAS, PAHO, and IICA with project-specific voluntary contributions.", "GAO was asked to review U.S. financial contributions to these four organizations. In this report, GAO (1) determines the amounts and percentages of U.S. contributions assessed by these organizations and voluntary contributions paid to them in calendar years 2014 to 2016, and (2) describes State's efforts to comply with the Reform Act's requirements regarding a strategy for reform of the assessed quota structure of the OAS. GAO analyzed documents and interviewed officials from State, the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the four organizations.

During this time, the annual U.S. percentages (or quotas) of these organizations' assessed contributions have remained about the same. The United States also provided voluntary contributions to three of these organizations, as shown in the table.", "In response to a requirement in the Organization of American States Revitalization and Reform Act of 2013 (Reform Act), the Department of State (State) submitted to Congress a strategy that included working with OAS member states toward ensuring that the OAS would not assess any single member state a quota of more than 50 percent of all OAS assessed contributions. State officials told GAO that reaching member state agreement on assessed quota reform by 2018 will be difficult, although not impossible. State officials informed GAO that State continues to implement a strategy that includes engaging with other OAS member states, such as Canada and Mexico, to explore assessed quota reform options. For example, State officials have consulted with their counterparts from Mexico to review the OAS's assessed quota structure and to consult on alternatives that would adjust all member states' quotas so that no member state's quota exceeds 50 percent of the OAS's assessed contributions. According to State and OAS officials, obstacles to assessed quota reform include tensions among member states. For example, State officials noted that Venezuela's contentious political relationship with the OAS has hindered progress on various reforms, including assessed quota reform. State officials explained that some member states' failure to fully pay assessed contributions from previous years and smaller member states' reluctance to increase their annual assessed contributions have also impeded assessed quota reform efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United States engages with other countries in the Western  Hemisphere through its membership in inter-American organizations that,  among other things, promote democracy, security, health care,  agricultural development, and scientific exchange.

Venezuela has expressed publically its unwillingness to pay its  assessed contributions, according to State officials. Additionally, as of  November 2016, the OAS projected that five member states would be  more than $17 million in arrears on their assessed contributions to the  OAS by the end of 2016. Brazil\u2014the OAS\u2019s second largest  contributor\u2014and Venezuela had not fully paid their assessed  contributions for 2015 and 2016, which accounted for approximately  99 percent of the more than $17 million in arrears that member states  owed the OAS. State officials told us that the large amounts owed by  a few member states had contributed to smaller OAS member states\u2019  reluctance to increase their annual assessed quotas to ensure that no  member state provides more than 50 percent by 2018. According to  State officials, the United States repeatedly urged the Brazilian  government to pay its arrears and 2016 contribution as soon as  possible.
