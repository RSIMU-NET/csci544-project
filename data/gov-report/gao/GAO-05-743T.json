At this Committee\u2019s recent hearing on  the tax-exempt sector as a whole,  I emphasized the importance of  reviewing this sector, drawing parallels to our agency\u2019s call to reexamine  all major federal policies and programs in light of 21st century challenges.   Provisions granting federally recognized tax-exempt status and associated  policies have been layered on one another to respond to challenges at the  time, but they need to be reviewed and revised to reflect 21st century  changes and challenges.  On a broad scale, a comprehensive  reexamination could help address whether exempt entities are providing  services and benefits to the public commensurate with their favored tax  status, whether the current number and nature of exemptions continue to  make sense, whether the conditions and restrictions on the activities of  tax-exempt entities remain relevant, and whether the framework for  ensuring that exempt entities adhere to the requirements attendant to their  status is satisfactory.", "There are a number of issues that merit reexamination, including whether  nonprofit hospitals perform sufficiently different services of benefit to the  public to justify their tax exemption.  To examine these hospitals\u2019 tax- exempt status, we must look back several decades.  Before 1969, the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) required hospitals to provide charity care  to qualify for tax-exempt status.  Since then, however, IRS has not  specifically required such care for a hospital to be exempt from federal  taxation and have access to tax-exempt bond financing and charitable  donations, as long as the hospital provides benefits to the community in  other ways.  Community benefits include such services as the provision of  health education and screening services to specific vulnerable populations  within a community, as well as activities that benefit the greater public  good, such as education for medical professionals and medical research.   Nonprofit hospitals may also be exempt under state law from state and  local taxes.", "Seeking a better understanding of the benefits provided by nonprofit  hospitals, this Committee requested that we examine whether nonprofit  hospitals provide levels of uncompensated care\u2014care provided to a  patient that a hospital is not reimbursed for\u2014and other community  benefits that are different from other hospitals.  My remarks today will  focus on our examination, for selected states, of (1) the provision of  uncompensated care by state and local government-owned, nonprofit, and  for-profit hospitals and (2) hospitals\u2019 reporting of other community  benefits.", "To examine the provision of uncompensated care by the three hospital  ownership groups, we analyzed cost data from two perspectives, namely  each hospital group\u2019s percentage of (1) total uncompensated care costs in  a state and (2) patient operating expenses devoted to uncompensated  care. We obtained 2003 data from five states\u2014California, Florida, Georgia,  Indiana, and Texas. Hospitals in these states include 46 percent of the  nation\u2019s for-profit hospitals and more than a quarter of all hospitals in the  three ownership groups. We selected these states because they  represented geographically diverse areas; had a number of hospitals in  each ownership group sufficient to make comparisons; and collected  hospital-specific uncompensated care data, which not all states maintain.  We compared each hospital ownership group\u2019s provision of  uncompensated care by examining each group\u2019s uncompensated care  costs as a percentage of its total patient operating expenses. Our measure  of uncompensated care includes the cost of charity care as well as bad  debt and deducts any payments made by or on behalf of individual  patients. We limited our analysis of uncompensated care to nonfederal,  short-term, acute care general hospitals. In doing our work, we tested the  reliability of the state data and determined they were adequate for our  purposes. To examine hospitals\u2019 provision of community benefits other  than uncompensated care, we reviewed 21 hospital or hospital systems\u2019  reports and Web sites for information about such benefits. These reports  and Web sites covered nonprofit, for-profit, and government hospitals in  the five states. We also examined laws in the five states regarding  community benefit requirements for nonprofit hospitals, reviewed the  literature, and interviewed state officials and state hospital association  representatives. In addition, we interviewed officials from the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the American Hospital Association,  and the Federation of American Hospitals. We conducted our work from  February 2005 through May 2005 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. (See app. I for more detail on our scope  and methodology.)", "In summary, the cost burden of providing uncompensated care varied  among the three hospital groups, but the burden was generally  concentrated in a small number of hospitals. In four of the five states,  government hospitals, as a group, devoted substantially larger shares of  their patient operating expenses to uncompensated care than did  nonprofit and for-profit hospitals. The nonprofit hospitals\u2019 uncompensated  care costs, as a percentage of patient operating expenses, were higher on  average than those of the for-profit hospitals in four of the five states, but  the differences were generally not as great as the differences between the  government hospitals and both these groups. Further, the burden of  uncompensated care costs was not evenly distributed within each hospital  group but instead was concentrated in a small number of hospitals. For  example, in California\u2019s nonprofit hospital group, the top quarter of  hospitals, ranked by uncompensated care as a percentage of patient  operating expenses, averaged 7.2 percent devoted to uncompensated care  compared with an average of 1.4 percent for hospitals in the bottom  quarter.", "Regardless of ownership status, the hospitals we reviewed reported  providing a wide range of other community benefits, from health  education to clinic services specifically for the community\u2019s indigent  population.

In addition, the 1969 ruling identified other  factors that might support a hospital\u2019s tax-exempt status, such as having a  governance board composed of community members and using surplus  revenue to improve facilities, patient care, medical training, education, and  research.", "Nonprofit hospitals may also receive exemptions from state and local  income, property, and sales taxes, which, in some cases, are of greater  value than the federal income tax exemption.

Specifically, the five states reviewed require  all hospitals to report financial data, including data on the cost of charity  care they provide. However, as shown in table 6, California, Indiana, and  Texas also have statutory requirements for nonprofit hospitals to develop  plans for meeting their communities\u2019 health needs and to report annually  on the types and value of the community benefits they provide.

California has no form for annual  community benefit reports but requires that hospitals classify the services  provided into broad, statutorily defined categories, including cash and in- kind donations to public health programs, efforts to contain health care  costs and enhance access, and services that help maintain a person\u2019s  health.", "According to state officials or state hospital association representatives in  the five states we reviewed, for-profit and government hospitals are not  required to report on the community benefits they provide outside of the  requirements to report financial data, including data on the cost of charity  care they provide.

The  Congress mandated this adjustment in 1986 to address the concern that  hospitals that serve such patients have higher Medicare costs per case  because they have higher overhead and labor costs and their patients are  in poorer health with more complications and secondary diagnoses.  Hospitals qualify for the Medicare DSH adjustment based on their low- income patient share. The low-income patient share is computed as the  percentage of a hospital\u2019s Medicare inpatient days attributable to patients  that are eligible for both Medicare part A and Supplemental Security  Income plus the percentage of total inpatient days attributable to patients  eligible for Medicaid, but not Medicare part A. For hospitals that qualify  for a DSH adjustment, their actual adjustment is based on several factors,  including the number of acute care beds, number of patient days for low-  income patients, and location (rural or urban). See table 8 for Medicare  DSH payments in 2003 to the hospitals in the selected states we analyzed.", "Medicaid DSH: The Medicaid statute requires that states make DSH  adjustments to the payment rates of certain hospitals treating large  numbers of low-income and Medicaid patients. The Medicaid DSH  adjustment was established by the Congress in 1981 and establishes broad  guidelines for hospital eligibility to receive Medicaid DSH and for the  methods used to compute the amount of payment. States have discretion  in designating DSH hospitals and calculating adjustments for them. States  also vary in terms of program rules and resource levels as well as the  degree to which they target payments to different types of hospitals.", "Medicaid DSH is the largest source of financial support for hospital  uncompensated care and is funded jointly by the states and the federal  government. State approaches to financing the state portion of Medicaid  DSH include obtaining funds from hospitals through provider taxes or  intergovernmental transfers in order to establish the state\u2019s contribution  required to obtain the federal match for Medicaid DSH funding. Therefore,  it is not always possible to determine what portion of Medicaid DSH  payments to individual hospitals is the net additional payment to the  hospital.", "Medicare bad debt reimbursement: Medicare partially reimburses acute  care hospitals for bad debts resulting from Medicare beneficiaries\u2019  nonpayment of deductibles and copayments after providers have made  reasonable efforts to collect unpaid amounts. If a hospital can document  that a Medicare patient is indigent, the hospital can then forgo collection  efforts from the patient. Medicare pays hospitals 70 percent of their  reimbursable bad debts, except critical access hospitals, for which it pays  100 percent of their reimbursable bad debts. See table 9 for total Medicare  bad debt reimbursements in 2003 to the hospitals in the selected states we  analyzed.", "Other state sources: Other state sources of payment to hospitals for  uncompensated or unreimbursed care vary widely, and may include  special revenues such as tobacco settlement funds, uncompensated care  pools that are funded by provider contributions, and payment programs  targeted at certain services such as emergency services. For example,  Massachusetts has used a portion of the state\u2019s tobacco settlement fund to  help cover uncompensated care costs.", "This is a work of the U.S. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the  United States.
