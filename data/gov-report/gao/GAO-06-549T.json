Since passage of the 2000 Older Americans Act Amendments (OAA), SCSEP has also increasingly focused on promoting economic self-sufficiency through placement in unsubsidized employment.

Older Americans  are expected to represent a growing share of the population and have a  longer life expectancy than previous generations.  Many older adults may  choose to remain in the workforce or need to continue working for  financial reasons.  Furthermore, the number of older adults living in  poverty is expected to increase significantly.   By 2008, the U.S. Census  Bureau estimates that 6.7 million persons aged 55 and older will be below  the poverty level, a 22 percent increase over the number living in poverty  in 2000.  This number is expected to jump to 9 million by 2015.", "SCSEP is the only federal employment and training program targeted to  low-income older adults.  Originally authorized in 1965 by Title V of OAA,  SCSEP is administered by the Department of Labor (Labor) to promote  part-time community service activities for unemployed, low-income  individuals 55 years and older who have poor employment prospects.   Under the OAA Amendments, the program has evolved from being  primarily focused on community service to a program that increasingly  emphasizes economic self-sufficiency through unsubsidized employment.   The amendments also made other changes to SCSEP including revising the  funding distribution formula and establishing a performance  accountability system.  Furthermore, in anticipation of the upcoming  reauthorization of Title V of OAA, the administration has proposed  additional changes to SCSEP.  In fiscal year 2005, Congress appropriated  approximately $439 million for SCSEP that Labor distributed to 69  grantees: 13 national grantees (consisting of 12 national nonprofit  organizations and 1 federal agency) and 56 state and territorial agencies.   These funds support about 61,000 SCSEP positions, through which  approximately 100,000 participants are served each year. The grantees  typically place older workers in part-time community service positions,  such as nurse\u2019s aides, teacher aides, librarians, clerical workers, and day  care assistants, so that these older workers can gain on-the-job experience  and prepare for unsubsidized employment.", "My testimony today will address (1) changes in the distribution of SCSEP  funds to national and state grantees as a result of the OAA Amendments,  (2) the progress that Labor has made in implementing an enhanced  performance accountability system, and (3) the challenges that national  and state grantees face in managing SCSEP.", "In summary, our work shows that the OAA Amendments have had little  effect on the distribution of funds between national and state grantees,  with the national grantees continuing to receive approximately 78 percent  of the funding and state grantees about 22 percent.

However, the  distribution of funding and positions among national grantees has changed  substantially as a result of an open competition that Labor held in 2002.   Further, although the amendments were passed in 2000, Labor has yet to  fully establish a performance accountability system.  For example,  program year 2005\u2014which ends on June 30, 2006\u2014is the first year for  which grantees will be held accountable for their performance, and the  final Internet-based version of Labor\u2019s data collection system is not yet  online.

The competition\u2014the first of its kind in SCSEP\u2019s  history\u2014yielded 68 applications.

Based on these scores, Labor  ranked each applicant, deemed that 13 applicants scored in a competitive  range making them eligible to receive grant awards, and allotted positions  by county to grantees on a winner-takes-all basis.  Specifically, the highest  ranked applicant received all the positions it requested, and each  subsequent applicant received all positions not previously claimed by a  higher-ranked applicant.  All 13 competitive applicants were eventually  awarded positions.  The competition produced 4 new national grantees,  increasing the total number from 10 to 13.  One incumbent grantee, the  National Urban League, was not awarded a grant to continue  administering SCSEP.  The competition also resulted in a significant  reshuffling of funds and positions among incumbent grantees.

A grantee  satisfies its overall performance goal if it attains an average score across  the four measures of at least 80 percent of the target goals.  Thus, a  grantee could meet its performance requirements by attaining less than 80  percent of some goals but more than 80 percent of the others.  For  example, Labor\u2019s data show that one state achieved 47 percent of its  placement goal but performed well enough on the other measures to  receive an average score well above the 80 percent threshold for  satisfactory performance.  According to Labor, grantees varied in their  ability to meet goals for individual measures during the transitional period  of program year 2004.  (See app. III for a listing of the program year 2004  results compared to the performance goals for each grantee.)  However,  Labor officials said that most grantees managed to meet the 80 percent  threshold for their overall performance goal. (See appendix IV for results  for each of the grantees.)   They also stated that, based on Labor\u2019s  assessment of data from the first 2 quarters of the current year, most  grantees appear to be on track for meeting their performance goals for  program year 2005.", "Sanctions for poor performance are similar for state and national grantees  and will begin after the first year of not meeting the 80 percent threshold  for overall performance.  If performance does not improve, sanctions will  increase in severity after the second and third consecutive years.  After the  first year of poor performance, a grantee must submit a corrective action  plan within 160 days of the end of the program year.  In addition, Labor  will provide the grantee with technical assistance to help correct the  problem.  A second consecutive year of failing to meet performance goals  will generate a competition for 25 percent of the grantee\u2019s funds for the  following program year.  If a grantee continues to perform poorly for a  third year, another competition will result for the remaining amount of the  grantee\u2019s funding.  Furthermore, in addition to meeting their own goals,  national grantees must meet the performance goals of each state in which  they administer the program.  If they fail to meet the state\u2019s goals, Labor  will require a corrective action plan after the first year of poor  performance and may take other appropriate actions, including  transferring responsibility for the project to other grantees.  National or  state grantees that fall short of one performance target but otherwise meet  their aggregate goals will not be subject to sanction; Labor will instead  provide them with technical assistance related to that performance issue.", "In addition, Labor requires grantees to report on the customer satisfaction  of participants, host agencies, and employers by surveying each group.   While poor performance on this measure will result in technical assistance  rather than sanctions, Labor officials told us that to date customer  satisfaction has been very high.  Grantees must also report the number of  community service hours participants contribute, but Labor officials told  us that they have struggled to create a measurable indicator for  community service and do not plan to sanction performance in this area.", "SCSEP grantees must also collect data to support several common  measures as part of a governmentwide initiative to provide comparable  performance information across federal programs with similar goals and  operations.  For job training and employment programs serving adults, the  three common measures include entered employment, retention, and  average earnings.  Thus, between the SCSEP measures and the common  measures, grantees must collect and report on data for nine different  performance measures. The SCSEP placement and retention measures  overlap somewhat with the common measures for entered employment  and retention, although the SCSEP measures, as defined by the OAA  Amendments, are computed differently. (See table 4.)  Specifically, the  SCSEP placement measure is calculated relative to each grantee\u2019s number  of authorized positions, while the common measure for entered  employment is based on the number of participants who exit the program.   Likewise, the SCSEP retention measure evaluates employment 6 months  after placement, while the common measure for retention assesses a  participant\u2019s employment in both the second and third quarters after exit.", "Grantees are not subject to sanction for performance on the common  measures, which the Office of Management and Budget will use to  evaluate the overall effectiveness of SCSEP.

In addition, Labor changed its previous  policy of allowing low-income older adults who work part-time to enroll in  SCSEP, and revised the time period for which income is calculated.

In the  preamble to its April 2004 regulations, Labor set forth its intent to use the  income categories collected in the CPS as the SCSEP definition of income  for determining program eligibility.  After receiving feedback from  grantees, Labor decided to exclude certain forms of income.  For example,  Labor excluded disability benefits\u2014except SSDI\u2014 as well as  supplementary security income, workers\u2019 compensation, public assistance,  child support, and several other sources of income. Most national and  state grantees we surveyed expressed concern with the revised income  criteria.  For example, one national grantee told us that including SSDI is  especially onerous because individuals receiving SSDI are among the  hardest to serve.  A state grantee stated that SSDI should not be included  in determining program eligibility because other disability benefits were  not included in calculating income eligibility.

Labor noted that more uniformity  with respect to the types of income used to determine program eligibility,  such as Social Security benefits versus earned income, would increase  public confidence that these programs were being administered in a  consistent and equitable manner.", "Most national and state grantees surveyed were also concerned with  Labor\u2019s policy change requiring applicants to be unemployed at time of  application.  Labor officials stated that the Office of the Solicitor took a  strict interpretation of the OAA Amendments and determined that  applicants must be unemployed at the time of application to be eligible for  SCSEP.  Labor officials noted that this interpretation was consistent with  the department\u2019s philosophy that SCSEP should be targeted to those most  in need of the program\u2019s intensive services.  Prior to the OAA  Amendments, Labor permitted applicants who held part-time jobs and met  other eligibility criteria to be eligible for SCSEP services.  The OAA  amendments retained the language contained in the statement of purpose  from the authorizing legislation that the program was to provide services  to unemployed low income adults 55 years and older.  The amendments  further defined eligible individuals as those individuals who are 55 years  and older and have income not more than 125 percent of the poverty  guidelines, but did not refer to employment status.  Grantees told us that  the requirement that applicants be unemployed prevented some low- income older workers from receiving SCSEP services.  For example, a  state grantee noted that older workers who may work only 4 hours per  week have very low incomes but are not eligible for program services  because they are not unemployed.  Another state grantee noted that many  older workers who are not eligible for social security benefits often work  part-time, and thus would not be eligible under the employment test, but  would otherwise still meet the income eligibility criteria.", "Many grantees were also concerned that Labor revised the period on  which income is calculated. Prior to Labor\u2019s regulations issued in 2004,  grantees had the option of calculating income using either the includable  income for the 12 months preceding application or annualizing the  includable income for the 6 months preceding application, that is doubling  the 6-month income to calculate an annual income.  Labor now requires  grantees to annualize an applicant\u2019s income using the 6 months prior to  application. Labor officials told us that changing the period on which  income is calculated was intended to simplify the process and to reflect  the most current income information.  However, a national grantee and  two state grantees noted in their survey responses that annualizing 6  months of income could distort income for those who only had earnings  during that 6-month period.  For example, a state grantee noted that many  older individuals in their state work during the planting and harvesting  seasons but are unemployed for the remainder of the year.   They noted  that doubling the individual\u2019s 6-month income made many of these  seasonal workers ineligible for SCSEP.  Conversely, doubling 6-month  earnings to calculate annual income can have the unintended consequence  of including some individuals who would not otherwise be eligible for the  program if a 12-month period was applied."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Challenges That Grantees Face", "paragraphs": ["National and state grantees surveyed also identified other issues that  presented major challenges to managing the SCSEP program.  The  majority of both national and state grantees identified several issues in the  survey as being great or very great challenges, in particular coordinating  SCSEP activities with WIA services, obtaining intensive services and  training at one-stop centers, implementing Labor\u2019s new data collection  system, and meeting performance measures (see fig. 2).", "Although the OAA amendments sought to strengthen coordination  between SCSEP and WIA, national and state grantees surveyed identified  the coordination of SCSEP activities with WIA services and obtaining  intensive services and training at one-stops as major challenges.   For  example, several national and state grantees responded that many WIA  providers are hesitant to provide intensive services or training to SCSEP  participants because WIA providers are concerned that enrolling older  adults would negatively affect their performance measures.  Older adults  who receive intensive services or training from WIA providers are  included in the computation of WIA performance measures.  Another state  grantee stated that while coordination with one-stops for core services is  very good, access to training is very difficult.  We heard a similar theme  among states we visited.  For example, one state grantee we visited said  that WIA is so performance-driven that few SCSEP participants are able to  access intensive and training services under WIA.", "The reported lack of coordination between SCSEP and WIA is especially  relevant in light of the administration\u2019s proposal to increase the age of  SCSEP eligibility from 55 to 65, with limited exceptions for those between  the ages of 55 and 64.  Labor believes that WIA, not SCSEP, should be the  primary program for older adults age 55 to 64.  However, we have  previously reported that WIA has built in disincentives that discourage the  providing of in-depth services, such as training, to older adults.  We noted  that the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau data suggest  that older workers are 50 percent more likely  to work part-time and less  likely to become re-employed after being laid off than younger workers.   These characteristics may negatively affect outcomes on certain WIA  performance measures, and, as a result, create a barrier to enrolling older  workers into WIA intensive services and training.", "While most of the 13 national and 52 state grantees surveyed also reported  challenges with Labor\u2019s new data collection system, they noted that the  agency provided helpful assistance with system implementation.  Several  national and state grantees stated that implementation of the data system  was both time and labor-intensive.   In particular, one state grantee told us  that Labor rolled out the data collection system prematurely, resulting in a  loss of productivity at the grantee and subgrantee level.  Despite these  concerns, most grantees indicated that they received training or technical  assistance for the system from Labor or its contractors.  Moreover, while  several national and state grantees provided positive comments about  Labor\u2019s assistance, with respect to staff responsiveness, others were less  than satisfied and indicated the need for more assistance.", "All of the national grantees and most of the state grantees that cited  meeting performance measures as a great or very great challenge in the  survey indicated that the program eligibility changes had the greatest  effect on the ability to meet the performance measure dealing with SCSEP  service level. A number of state grantees mentioned that the greater  difficulty in recruiting SCSEP participants translated into difficulty  meeting the service level performance measure.  Another of the state  grantees that we visited said that the service level measure would present  the greatest challenge because the income guidelines were too restrictive.   According to Labor data, 7 of the 13 national grantees and 21 of the 52  state grantees did not meet their service level goals for program year 2004.   Labor officials noted that some of the grantees who were concerned with  low enrollments may not perform sufficient outreach or marketing."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["The aging of the baby boom generation presents serious challenges for the  nation\u2019s workforce investment system.  The expected increase in the  number of low-income older adults means that, more and more, older  Americans will have to continue working in order to have sufficient  income.  Older adults often have difficulty re-entering the labor force and  may rely on federal employment and training programs to help them find  employment, with SCSEP being the only federal employment and training  program targeted exclusively to low-income older adults. While Labor has  made progress implementing the OAA Amendments\u2014particularly in terms  of increasing the program\u2019s focus on unsubsidized employment\u2014 challenges remain. More specifically, while Labor has taken steps to  establish an enhanced performance accountability system, as of March  2006 the system has still not been fully implemented. The delay in  implementing this system means that program year 2005 is the first year  that grantees will be held accountable for poor performance.  In this  respect, given the upcoming reauthorization of the OAA, only limited data  will be available to assess SCSEP performance.  In addition, while Labor\u2019s  changes to the eligibility criteria seem to have resulted in SCSEP funds  being more targeted to those it believes are most in need of program  services, one aspect of how this targeting was operationalized may have  produced mixed outcomes. In particular, the requirement for grantees to  double an applicant\u2019s income from the most recent 6-month period could  have the unintended result of excluding some individuals with very low  incomes from the program while including others with much higher  incomes, depending on when the work was performed. Those who are  excluded from participation in SCSEP may turn to other employment and  training programs such as WIA.  However, given the problems older adults  often experience in obtaining in-depth services such as training, it is  unclear whether the existing workforce system is able to provide the type  and level of services this population may need.  Thus, while the OAA  amendments were designed to enhance employment and training  opportunities for older adults, we believe that Labor has not done enough  to address unresolved issues concerning coordination between SCSEP and  WIA, and helping older adults obtain intensive and training services at one- stop centers.", "Mr. Chairman, this completes my prepared statement.
