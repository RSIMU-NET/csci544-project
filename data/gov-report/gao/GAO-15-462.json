As a result, total carryover grew to about $1 billion at the end of fiscal year 2014. In fiscal year 2014, the FRCs' actual adjusted carryover amount was under the allowable amount because the FRCs received a new waiver that reduced the adjusted carryover below the allowable amount. The FRCs did not present the purpose and amount of the waiver in their budget to Congress. Having complete information in the budget is needed to help policymakers make informed decisions.", "The FRCs budgeted the carryover amount to be under the allowable amount in 10 out of the 11 fiscal years GAO reviewed. In fiscal year 2004, the budgeted amount was greater than the allowable amount by $40 million. In 10 of the 11 years, the actual carryover information was greater than the budgeted carryover information by a low of $30 million in fiscal year 2010 to a high of $285 million in fiscal year 2007. According to Navy officials, these differences can be attributed to uncertainty in overseas contingency operations orders or changing customer requirements after budget preparations. Although the Navy has efforts ongoing to address these two issues in the future, GAO found that the Navy's guidance does not require trend analysis. Such analysis could help ensure more accurate estimates.", "GAO identified four key drivers for large FRC carryover balances in fiscal years 2013 and 2014: (1) orders for work scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter carried over into the next fiscal year; (2) work on F/A-18 Hornet aircraft required structural repair and the FRCs had limited engineers and artisans, support equipment, and facilities to perform the work; (3) work on crash-damaged aircraft was difficult to predict and required nonstandard repairs that necessitated long lead time for parts to perform the work; and (4) the unavailability of parts to perform work. The Navy is taking several actions, such as hiring engineers and artisans to perform F/A-18 Hornet work."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD improve the budgeting for carryover by reporting the purpose and amount of waivers in FRC budgets and augmenting Navy guidance to include trend data on actual orders in developing budget estimates.

These FRCs  repair aircraft, engines, and components; manufacture parts and  assemblies; provide engineering services for developing hardware design  changes; and furnish technical and other services on maintenance and  logistics problems. From fiscal year 2004 through fiscal year 2014, the  amount of new orders received to perform this work ranged from $1.7  billion to $2.3 billion. In fiscal year 2014, the Navy reported that in-house  work performed at the three FRCs included the repair of 419 aircraft,  1,622 aircraft engines, and 34,280 inventory items. Work completed at  the FRCs ensures that deployed and next-to-deploy units have the battle- ready items needed to train and fight in current and future military  operations.", "When Navy FRC work has been ordered and funded (obligated) by  customers (such as the military services) but has not been completed at  the end of a fiscal year, it is referred to as carryover. The Department of  Defense (DOD) has established a formula based on new orders received  from customers for determining the amount of carryover allowed at the  end of each fiscal year as defined by the DOD Financial Management  Regulation. The congressional defense committees have recognized that  some carryover is appropriate to facilitate a smooth flow of work during  the transition from one fiscal year to the next. However, past  congressional defense committee reports have raised concerns that the  level of carryover in military service working capital funds may be more  than is needed. Too much carryover could result in the working capital  fund receiving funds from customers in one fiscal year but not performing  the work until well into the next fiscal year or years. Further, excessive  amounts of carryover may result in future appropriations or budget  requests being subject to reductions by DOD and the congressional  defense committees during the budget review process. For example,  according to the explanatory statement accompanying DOD\u2019s fiscal year  2013 appropriations, congressional conferees agreed to reduce Army,  Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps fiscal year 2013 operation and  maintenance appropriations by a total of $332.3 million because of  concerns about excess carryover.", "You asked us to review issues related to Navy FRC carryover.

We  analyzed carryover since fiscal year 2004 because prior to fiscal year  2004, DOD had a different policy for determining the allowable amount of  carryover. We met with responsible officials from Navy headquarters and  the FRCs to determine the reasons for variances between (1) actual  carryover and the allowable amount of carryover and (2) budgeted and  actual carryover. We also met with these officials to discuss actions the  Navy was taking to improve budgeting and management of carryover,  including the reduction of carryover amounts. Further, we identified and  analyzed any adjustments made by the Navy that increased the allowable  carryover amounts or reduced the amount of carryover. We reviewed  DOD\u2019s guidance for exceptions to the carryover policy and discussed any  exceptions with officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense (Comptroller), Navy headquarters, and the FRCs to obtain  explanations for the exceptions.", "To address the third objective, we met with responsible officials from  Navy headquarters and the FRCs to identify contributing factors that led  to carryover. We focused on fiscal year 2013 and 2014 carryover  balances to identify current issues contributing to carryover. We also  performed walk-throughs of the three FRCs\u2019 depot maintenance  operations to observe the work being performed and discussed with  officials the causes for workload carrying over from one fiscal year to the  next. Further, to corroborate the information provided by FRC officials, we  obtained and analyzed 60 customer orders to repair, among other things,  aircraft, engines, and components (30 orders each for fiscal years 2013  and 2014) that had the largest dollar amount of carryover. Carryover  amounts associated with these orders represented 38 percent and 33  percent of the FRCs\u2019 total carryover for fiscal years 2013 and 2014,  respectively.

Too little carryover could result in inefficient use of  resources with some personnel not having work to perform at the  beginning of the fiscal year. On the other hand, too much carryover could  result in the working capital fund receiving funds from customers in one  fiscal year but not performing the work until well into the next fiscal year  or years.

For  example, customer orders financed with a specific appropriation total  $100. If the outlay rate for this appropriation is 60 percent, then the  working capital fund activity group is allowed to carry over $40 (i.e., $100  -  = $40). The DOD carryover policy further provides  that the work on the current fiscal year\u2019s orders is expected to be  completed by the end of the following fiscal year. For example, for an  order accepted in fiscal year 2014, the work is expected to be completed  at the end of fiscal year 2015.", "For orders funded with procurement appropriations, the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) implemented a change to the  DOD Financial Management Regulation to require the second year  published outlay rate be used to calculate the allowable carryover  amount. This change became effective for the fiscal year 2015 budget  which affected the fiscal year 2013 actual calculation for allowable  carryover. For example, for a procurement-funded order accepted in fiscal  year 2014, the work is expected to be completed at the end of fiscal year  2016. DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation also provides that (1)  nonfederal orders, non-DOD orders, foreign military sales, work related to  base realignment and closure, and work in progress are to be excluded  from the carryover calculation; (2) exceptions to the carryover policy  approved by the Director for Revolving Fund, Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), are to be excluded from the carryover  calculation; and (3) the reported actual carryover after applying these  exclusions and exceptions (which is referred to as actual adjusted  carryover in this report) is then compared to the amount of allowable  carryover that was calculated using the above-described outlay rate  method to determine whether the actual carryover amount is over or  under the allowable carryover amount.", "To the extent that actual adjusted carryover exceeds the allowable  carryover, DOD and the congressional defense committees may reduce  future budgets. According to the DOD Financial Management Regulation,  this carryover policy allows for an analytical-based approach that holds  working capital fund activities to the same outlay standard as the general  fund and allows for meaningful budget execution analysis. Requests for  exceptions to the carryover policy (referred to as waivers for the purposes  of this report) must be submitted by the military services to the Director  for Revolving Funds, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller), separate from the budget documents.

Analyzing  trends in budgeted to actual carryover data could be useful in assessing  the reliability of budgeted data and developing more reliable budget  estimates, but we found that the Naval Air Systems Command budget  guidance does not require such analysis. Navy officials agreed that the  guidance does not require the FRCs to develop trend data on actual  orders. If the FRCs compared budgeted and actual orders for individual  customers and identified variances, they could identify individual  customers that consistently underestimate budgeted orders. The FRCs  could then discuss the reliability of the estimates with these customers  and make adjustments as necessary.

Without sufficient carryover,  FRC officials stated that the FRCs could not (1) ensure that enough  funded work would be available to continue operations into the next fiscal  year and (2) retain the appropriate number of personnel with sufficient  skill sets to perform depot maintenance work. Adequate carryover is  particularly important when DOD operates under a continuing resolution,  which results in FRC customers not receiving their full-year appropriations  at the beginning of the fiscal year. This, in turn, may cause the FRCs to  operate for several months into the next fiscal year relying mostly on  funded work from prior year orders to continue operations because of the  limitations on the amount of new orders customers may place with the  FRCs at the beginning of the fiscal year in light of budget uncertainties.  Carryover provides the FRCs the continuity of funded workload necessary  to maintain operations from one year to the next. The following example  shows how work started in the last quarter of the fiscal year results in  work carrying over into the following fiscal year.", "In July 2013, FRC Southeast accepted an order totaling $26.5 million to  repair 160 engine modules for the F414 engine, which is used in the F/A- 18 Super Hornet. The order was amended in August 2013 to increase  quantities to 197 engine modules and increase funding to $32.4 million.  According to FRC Southeast officials, the work on an engine module  should take from 16 to 67 days, depending on which engine module is  being repaired. Because of the number of engine modules to be repaired  and the repair time necessary per module, FRC Southeast did not have  sufficient time to complete the work on this order in fiscal year 2013 and  thus carried over $28.3 million of the $32.4 million into fiscal year 2014.  All work was completed on this order in May 2014."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Work on High Flight Hour F/A-18 Hornet Aircraft Contributed to Carryover", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of 60 orders (and related amendments) for fiscal years 2013  and 2014 determined that work on high flight hour F/A-18 Hornet aircraft  contributed to carryover on 9 orders. One of the primary workloads at  FRC Southwest and FRC Southeast is the F/A-18 Hornet. The first  aircraft was manufactured in the late 1970s and became operational in  the early 1980s. As an aircraft ages, it incurs additional inspections and  structural repairs when required. One of those additional inspections  occurs when an aircraft reaches 8,000 flight hours. The high flight hour  aircraft inspections and repairs contributed to carryover because (1)  structural repairs generally require more time to complete than  nonstructural repairs and (2) work on the high flight hour aircraft delayed  work on other F/A-18 aircraft because there were not enough FRC  engineers and artisans, support equipment, and facilities. Figures 2 and 3  are photographs of work on high flight hour F/A-18 Hornet aircraft being  performed at an FRC.", "When the FRCs receive high flight hour F/A-18 Hornet aircraft for  inspection and, if necessary, for structural repairs, the FRCs perform a  detailed inspection of the aircraft to identify structural weaknesses, such  as metal fatigue and cracks in the aircraft, and determine what needs to  be repaired. Next, the FRCs prepare a request for engineering  information to obtain engineering support to develop repair solutions for  the damaged areas of the aircraft. Structural repairs needed to fix the  aircraft are nonstandard repairs that must be designed and approved by  FRC engineers. According to FRC engineers and engineering information  documents we reviewed, it may take as long as a year or more for an  engineer to determine and document the step-by-step instructions  needed to repair the aircraft. During this time, the FRCs order the  required parts from the DOD supply system to repair the aircraft. If the  parts are not in DOD\u2019s supply system, the FRCs either manufacture them  or order them from a contractor. The length of time to determine what  needs to be repaired, design a repair solution, and obtain or manufacture  the parts needed to make the repairs contributed to carryover on the  orders. The following two examples describe work performed on high  flight hour F/A-18 Hornet aircraft that contributed to carryover.", "In October 2012, FRC Southwest accepted an order totaling $1.8  million to perform inspections and repairs on 5 high flight hour F/A-18  Hornet aircraft. This order was amended 14 times in fiscal year 2013  to increase the number of aircraft to 21 and increase funding to $8.0  million. FRC Southwest did not complete work on any aircraft on this  order in fiscal year 2013 because FRC Southwest was already  working on other high flight hour aircraft from prior year orders. As a  result, FRC Southwest carried over $6.3 million on this order into  fiscal year 2014. In fiscal year 2014, the order was amended twice,  the number of aircraft was reduced from 21 aircraft to 20 aircraft, and  the funding was reduced to $7.6 million. The work completion date  was extended into fiscal year 2015. As of the end of fiscal year 2014,  FRC Southwest carried over $3.7 million on this order into fiscal year  2015 and still needed to complete work on 18 of the 20 high flight  hour aircraft.", "FRC Southwest officials informed us that orders for high flight hour  work from prior fiscal years delayed work on the fiscal year 2013 high  flight hour order. For example, 15 high flight hour F/A-18 Hornet  aircraft on fiscal years 2011 and 2012 orders required replacement of  two structural components in the back section of the aircraft. To  design the supporting step-by-step instructions for the removal and  replacement of the structural components, 18 months and 5,100 work  hours of nonrecurring engineering was required. The actual  replacement of the structural components on each aircraft by FRC  Southwest machinists, sheet metal workers, electricians, and  mechanics required approximately 2,500 labor hours to complete.  During the replacement procedure, the F/A-18 Hornets were placed in  holding fixtures to stabilize the aircraft. Replacement of the structural  components took about 16 to 18 weeks. FRC Southwest only had a  limited number of personnel, holding fixtures, and available facilities  (floor space) that could be used for this type of work. This delayed  work on the fiscal year 2013 high flight hour order and work on other  F/A-18 orders at FRC Southwest in fiscal years 2013 and 2014.", "In fiscal year 2013, FRC Southeast accepted an order totaling $17  million with amendments to perform modifications to 14 F/A-18 Hornet  aircraft. FRC Southeast did not complete work on any aircraft from  this order in fiscal year 2013 because of the number of high flight hour  aircraft already in process for repair. Because of engineering issues  related to the high flight hour aircraft, FRC Southeast carried over  $16.9 million on this order into fiscal year 2014.", "According to FRC Southeast officials and our review of order  documentation, 6 of the 14 F/A-18 Hornet aircraft on this order are  high flight hour aircraft. According to FRC Southeast officials, the  major constraint in the repair process is the limited number of  engineers FRC Southeast has to perform the tasks associated with  repairing high flight hour aircraft. This limits the number of all F/A-18  Hornet aircraft\u2014including non-high flight hour aircraft\u2014that can be  worked on and completed in a timely manner. Non-high flight hour  aircraft are affected since these aircraft cannot move through the  process because of the time spent working on high flight hour aircraft.  This decrease in production has led to an increase in the number of  aircraft in process at the end of the fiscal year and contributed to  carryover. Because of the engineering constraint associated with high  flight hour aircraft, FRC Southeast was only able to complete work on  1 F/A-18 Hornet aircraft on this fiscal year 2013 order and carried over  $16.1 million on this order into fiscal year 2015.", "To show the magnitude of carryover associated with the F/A-18 Hornet  program, we obtained and analyzed carryover associated with that  program for fiscal years 2011 through 2014. Table 5 provides information  on the dollar amounts of carryover and the number of months of carryover  for work on the F/A-18 Hornet at FRC Southeast and FRC Southwest.", "As shown in table 5, the total months of carryover for F/A-18 Hornet  aircraft work increased from 15 months to 25 months from fiscal year  2011 to fiscal year 2014. Because of the large dollar amount and number  of months of carryover associated with F/A-18 Hornet aircraft, we  obtained and analyzed production documentation for all F/A-18 Hornet  aircraft and high flight hour F/A-18 Hornet aircraft from fiscal years 2010  through 2014. Table 6 provides information on the number of high flight  hour and total F/A-18 Hornet aircraft for FRC Southeast and Southwest  that were (1) accepted for repair, (2) in process at fiscal year-end, and (3)  completed at the end of the fiscal year for fiscal years 2010 through 2014.", "As shown in table 6, our analysis identified the following information  related to the F/A-18 Hornet workload.", "The number of high flight hour F/A-18 Hornet aircraft accepted for  repair was more than the number of high flight hour F/A-18 Hornet  aircraft completed in each of the 5 fiscal years. As a result, the  number of high flight hour F/A-18 Hornet aircraft in process steadily  increased from 14 at the end of fiscal year 2010 to 92 at the end of  fiscal year 2014.", "The number of total F/A-18 Hornet aircraft accepted for repair was  more than the number of F/A-18 Hornet aircraft completed each year,  except for fiscal year 2014. As a result, the number of total F/A-18  Hornet aircraft in process increased from 84 at the end of fiscal year  2010 to 190 at the end of fiscal year 2013 and then slightly decreased  to 184 at the end of fiscal year 2014. According to FRC Southwest  officials, the reason for the improvement in fiscal year 2014 was that  FRC Southwest focused on completing non-high flight hour aircraft  during the last part of the fiscal year.", "FRC officials acknowledged that they need to increase production for the  F/A-18 Hornet aircraft and have taken the following actions to do so. First,  FRC Southeast has implemented and FRC Southwest was in the process  of implementing critical chain project management. A central tenet of  critical chain project management is to limit work in process on the F/A-18  Hornet aircraft to the capacity of whatever constraints may be in place.  FRC Southeast identified a lack of engineers as the constraint and 17 to  20 as the optimum number of aircraft to be worked on at one time. As a  result, FRC Southeast stopped work on several aircraft and placed these  aircraft in a work-stop (frozen) category to enable production and  engineering to focus on the 17 to 20 aircraft. FRC Southeast officials  informed us that to increase production, it hired 20 engineers in fiscal  year 2014 and plans to hire 15 engineers and 20 to 25 artisans in fiscal  year 2015. Similarly, FRC Southwest identified a lack of artisans and  engineers as the constraint and 43 as the optimum number of aircraft to  be worked on at one time. FRC Southwest officials informed us that it  hired 5 engineers and 29 artisans in fiscal year 2014 and plans to hire 28  engineers and 66 artisans in fiscal year 2015. In addition, FRC Southwest  is renovating a hangar to provide additional work space for the work flow  of the F/A-18 Hornet.", "Furthermore, the Navy is developing a comprehensive service life  extension program for the F/A-18 Hornet to extend its useful life beyond  8,000 flight hours. Modifications to the aircraft resulting from the service  life extension program are expected to extend the airworthiness of F/A-18  Hornet aircraft to 10,000 flight hours. According to Navy officials,  engineering for the F/A-18 Hornet service life extension program is  expected to be completed in 2017, and final modifications to the aircraft  are expected to be ready for implementation in 2019."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Repair of Crash-Damaged Aircraft Contributed to Carryover", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of 60 orders (and related amendments) for fiscal years 2013  and 2014 determined that 10 orders involved crash-damaged aircraft. For  crash-damaged aircraft, the requirements to repair the aircraft are largely  unknown prior to inspection, and the repair solutions are based on the  damage and therefore unique to each aircraft. Our discussions with Navy  FRC officials and a review of supporting documentation found that in  fiscal years 2013 and 2014, the Navy FRCs had $82.8 million for 27  aircraft and $81.1 million for 32 aircraft, respectively, in carryover on  orders to repair crash-damaged aircraft. These crash-damaged aircraft  incurred damage from incidents that included midair collisions, fire/heat  damage, combat damage, accidents causing wing and fuselage cracks,  and arresting/landing gear mishaps. Figures 4 and 5 are photographs of  collision or fire damage on F/A-18 Super Hornet aircraft.", "When crash-damaged aircraft arrive at the FRCs for repair, the FRCs  inspect the aircraft for damage and determine what needs to be repaired.  Similar to when repairs are identified on high flight hour F/A-18 Hornet  aircraft, the FRCs require engineering support to develop repair solutions  for the damaged areas of the aircraft. As engineering develops the repair  solutions, the FRCs order the required parts from the DOD supply  system, or if the parts are not in DOD\u2019s supply system, the FRCs  manufacture the parts or order them from a contractor. In some cases,  the FRCs manufacture parts based on the unique damage to the aircraft  and the parts needed to repair the damage. Once the repair solutions are  determined and parts are obtained, the FRCs can repair the aircraft. The  entire process can take 2 or more years to complete, depending on what  needs to be repaired on the aircraft. The following are two carryover  examples of crash-damaged aircraft orders on the F/A-18 Super Hornets  at FRC Southwest.", "In August 2011, FRC Southwest accepted an order totaling $24  million to repair damage on one F/A-18 Hornet aircraft and two F/A-18  Super Hornet aircraft. This order was amended four times from  January 2013 through January 2014 to decrease the funding to $22.0  million, remove the F/A-18 Hornet aircraft, and extend the work  completion date into fiscal year 2015 for the two F/A-18 Super Hornet  aircraft. Because of delays in receiving the parts to repair the aircraft  and to complete the engineering services needed to determine the  individual tasks to repair the aircraft, FRC Southwest carried over  $21.7 million on this $22.0 million order into fiscal year 2014.", "One of the F/A-18 Super Hornet aircraft experienced a landing gear  brake fire causing substantial damage to its center fuselage, main  landing gear, and right inner wing panel and was awaiting wing skins  from the manufacturer. No repair parts were available from an  alternate source, and FRC Southwest has no capability to  manufacture the parts. The other F/A-18 Super Hornet aircraft  experienced an engine fire causing substantial damage and rendering  the aircraft unable to fly. This aircraft was being analyzed by FRC  Southwest to determine what needed to be repaired and to develop a  repair solution. Furthermore, for both of these aircraft, engineering  and logistics support will be needed to research and identify the parts  needed to accomplish the repairs to the structure of the aircraft.  Finally, repairs on the aircraft are expected to be further delayed  because FRC Southwest does not have a sufficient number of  qualified artisans to perform the work on the aircraft and available  floor space to begin the repairs. Consequently, as of the end of fiscal  year 2014, the carryover was $21.5 million on this $22 million order  initially accepted in August 2011.", "In July 2011, FRC Southwest accepted an order totaling $18.7 million  to perform special rework on one F/A-18 Super Hornet aircraft that  was involved in a midair collision with another Navy aircraft. This  order was amended five times from July 2011 through January 2014  to increase the funding to $20.8 million and to extend the work  completion date into fiscal year 2015. This aircraft had substantial  damage to its airframe, wings, and flight control surfaces, rendering  the aircraft unable to fly. As a result, this aircraft is being used as a  prototype for a replacement of the center fuselage section on an F/A- 18 Super Hornet. In order for FRC Southwest to make this repair it will  need (1) a Super Hornet alignment fixture that holds the aircraft during  the repair process and (2) engineering and logistics support services  to research and identify the parts needed to accomplish the repairs to  the structure of the aircraft. Consequently, as of the end of fiscal year  2014\u2014more than 3 years after the order was accepted\u2014carryover  was $18.2 million on this $20.8 million order."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Parts Needed to Perform Work Were Not Readily Available and Contributed to Carryover", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of 60 FRC orders (and related amendments) for fiscal years  2013 and 2014 determined that parts shortages contributed to carryover  on 12 orders. Parts were not available to perform the work because the  DOD supply system did not maintain sufficient parts in the right mix to  meet demand because of inaccurate forecasts of parts needed to perform  the work. Without the DOD supply system maintaining the right mix and  sufficient quantities of spare parts, the FRCs cannot complete their  funded workload timely and efficiently. In order to obtain parts from the  DOD supply system, the FRCs order them through the Defense Logistics  Agency (DLA). However, if DLA is unable to provide the parts, the FRCs  may use other methods to obtain the parts, such as obtaining parts from  other assets (e.g., aircraft or engines), manufacturing the parts, or  obtaining the parts through use of their local procurement authority. If the  FRCs manufacture the parts, they must have the raw material to perform  the work and obtain the specifications of the parts to be made. While  these methods allow work to continue, obtaining the needed parts this  way is inefficient.", "Most of the parts shortages that we identified were for component work  performed at FRC East, which is largely responsible for repairing  components used on end items in military equipment, such as the H-53  helicopter. Our analysis of FRC East orders for fiscal years 2013 and  2014 determined that FRC East had problems obtaining parts to repair  components used on the H-53 helicopter and on various engines.  Specifically, work at FRC East was discontinued on 845 and 1,074  components at the end of fiscal years 2013 and 2014, respectively. In  these instances, the items were packed in storage boxes or containers  and sent to a warehouse until the needed parts were obtained. Once  parts were obtained, the items were sent back to the production area for  repair. According to FRC East officials and our analysis of FRC East parts  shortage data, the average length of time that an item was maintained in  the warehouse because work was discontinued because of lack of parts  was 147 days and 148 days in fiscal years 2013 and 2014, respectively.  Table 7 shows the aging schedule of the items for which work was  discontinued because of lack of parts at FRC East as of September 2014.", "The following example illustrates how parts shortages contributed to  carryover. In fiscal year 2013, FRC East accepted an order with  amendments totaling $84.4 million to repair 4,087 components for the H- 53 helicopter. FRC East began work on the components in October 2012.  According to officials and our review of FRC East production data, work  was not completed on 641 components at the end of fiscal year 2013  because FRC East could not obtain parts to perform the work. Some of  the parts that FRC East could not obtain were spur gears, sleeve  assemblies, and piston assemblies. Because of these parts shortages,  work was delayed, and FRC East carried over $35.9 million into fiscal  year 2014. During fiscal year 2014, FRC East continued work on the  order, but it did not complete the work on 197 components by the end of  the fiscal year because it still could not obtain the parts needed to perform  the work. Because of these parts shortages, FRC East carried over $10.5  million on this fiscal year 2013 order into fiscal year 2015.", "To address these parts shortages and their effect on carryover, the FRCs  have taken action to improve their parts management process.  Specifically, the FRCs, in collaboration with DLA, implemented the  Inventory Management and Stock Positioning system. This inventory  system integrates DLA and Navy supply systems to allow for increased  visibility of inventory items by both the FRCs and DLA and streamlines  direct material ordering to DLA to provide parts to the FRCs when  needed. The Inventory Management and Stock Positioning system was  implemented at FRC Southwest in June 2013, FRC Southeast in October  2013, and FRC East in April 2014. It is too soon to determine whether  carryover associated with parts shortages will be reduced as a result of  the recent implementation of this system because it can take up to 18  months or more to obtain long lead time inventory items.", "According to FRC and DLA officials, the key information required under  the Inventory Management and Stock Positioning system is the gross  demand plan, which provides eight quarters of data on the parts needed  at the FRCs. The new system is intended to improve forecasting of parts  needed to perform work. In order for the gross demand plan to accurately  forecast demand for parts, the bill of materials (parts needed to repair end  items) and replacement factors need to be accurate. FRC officials stated  that they perform validations of parts requirements against the bill of  materials and verifications of replacement factors to ensure the gross  demand plan is accurate. To maintain the accuracy of the gross demand  plan, the FRCs validate the bill of materials and replacement factors on a  continuing basis."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Our review found that for the period from fiscal year 2004 through fiscal  year 2014, the FRCs\u2019 adjusted carryover was over the allowable amount  in all years but fiscal year 2014.

This occurred because the  DOD Financial Management Regulation did not include specific  requirements for the waiver information to be included in the budgets  submitted to Congress. Without consistent and complete reporting of  waiver information, policymakers do not have complete information for  making informed budget decisions. Furthermore, budget estimates were  generally less than actual carryover because the FRCs underestimated  new orders to be received from customers. While the Navy has taken  action to include all orders, including orders funded for overseas  contingency operations in its budgets, its budget guidance does not  require the FRCs to develop trend data on actual orders that could be  used in developing more reliable budget estimates.
