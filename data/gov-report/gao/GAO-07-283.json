World oil production has been running at near capacity to meet demand, pushing prices upward. Concerns about meeting increasing demand with finite resources have renewed interest in an old question: How long can the oil supply expand before reaching a maximum level of production--a peak--from which it can only decline? GAO (1) examined when oil production could peak, (2) assessed the potential for transportation technologies to mitigate the consequences of a peak in oil production, and (3) examined federal agency efforts that could reduce uncertainty about the timing of a peak or mitigate the consequences. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed studies, convened an expert panel, and consulted agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Most studies estimate that oil production will peak sometime between now and 2040. This range of estimates is wide because the timing of the peak depends on multiple, uncertain factors that will help determine how quickly the oil remaining in the ground is used, including the amount of oil still in the ground; how much of that oil can ultimately be produced given technological, cost, and environmental challenges as well as potentially unfavorable political and investment conditions in some countries where oil is located; and future global demand for oil. Demand for oil will, in turn, be influenced by global economic growth and may be affected by government policies on the environment and climate change and consumer choices about conservation. In the United States, alternative fuels and transportation technologies face challenges that could impede their ability to mitigate the consequences of a peak and decline in oil production, unless sufficient time and effort are brought to bear. For example, although corn ethanol production is technically feasible, it is more expensive to produce than gasoline and will require costly investments in infrastructure, such as pipelines and storage tanks, before it can become widely available as a primary fuel. Key alternative technologies currently supply the equivalent of only about 1 percent of U.S. consumption of petroleum products, and the Department of Energy (DOE) projects that even by 2015, they could displace only the equivalent of 4 percent of projected U.S. annual consumption. In such circumstances, an imminent peak and sharp decline in oil production could cause a worldwide recession. If the peak is delayed, however, these technologies have a greater potential to mitigate the consequences. DOE projects that the technologies could displace up to 34 percent of U.S. consumption in the 2025 through 2030 time frame, if the challenges are met. The level of effort dedicated to overcoming challenges will depend in part on sustained high oil prices to encourage sufficient investment in and demand for alternatives. Federal agency efforts that could reduce uncertainty about the timing of peak oil production or mitigate its consequences are spread across multiple agencies and are generally not focused explicitly on peak oil. Federally sponsored studies have expressed concern over the potential for a peak, and agency officials have identified actions that could be taken to address this issue. For example, DOE and United States Geological Survey officials said uncertainty about the peak's timing could be reduced through better information about worldwide demand and supply, and agency officials said they could step up efforts to promote alternative fuels and transportation technologies. However, there is no coordinated federal strategy for reducing uncertainty about the peak's timing or mitigating its consequences."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["U.S. consumers paid $38 billion more for gasoline in the first 6 months of  2006 than they paid in the same period of 2005, and $57 billion more than  they paid in the same period of 2004, in large part because of rising oil  prices, which reached a 24-year high in 2006 when adjusted for inflation.  Oil is a global commodity, and its price is determined mainly by the  balance between world demand and supply. Since 1983, world  consumption of petroleum products has grown fairly steadily. The  Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Energy Information Administration (EIA)  states in a 2006 report that world consumption of petroleum had reached  84 million barrels per day in 2005. EIA also projects that world oil  consumption will continue to grow and will reach 118 million barrels per  day in 2030. About 43 percent of this growth in oil consumption will come  from the non-Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development  Asian countries, including China and India, but the United States will  remain the world\u2019s largest oil consumer. In 2005, the United States  accounted for just under 25 percent of world oil consumption. World oil  production has been running at near capacity in recent years to meet  rising consumption, putting upward pressure on oil prices. The potential  for disruptions in key oil-producing regions of the world, such as the  Middle East, and the yearly threat of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico have  also exerted upward pressure on oil prices. These conditions have  renewed interest in a long-standing question: Will oil supply continue to  expand to meet growing demand, or will we soon reach a maximum  possible level of production\u2014a peak\u2014beyond which oil supply can only  decline?", "Historically, U.S. oil production peaked around 1970 at close to 10 million  barrels per day and has been generally declining ever since, to about 5  million barrels per day in 2005. While recent discoveries raise the prospect  of some increases in U.S. oil production, significant reductions in world oil  production could still have important consequences for the nation\u2019s  welfare. The United States imported about 66 percent of its oil and  petroleum products in 2005, and the U.S. economy\u2014particularly the  transportation sector\u2014depends heavily on oil. Overall, transportation  accounts for approximately 65 percent of U.S. oil consumption. New  technologies have been introduced that displace some oil consumption  within the sector, but oil consumption for transportation has continued to  increase in recent years. According to a 2005 report prepared for DOE,  without timely preparation, a reduction in world oil production could  cause transportation fuel shortages that would translate into significant  economic hardship.", "The U.S. government addresses or examines world oil supply in several  ways. For example, DOE is responsible for promoting the nation\u2019s energy  security through reliable and affordable energy, including oil. DOE  supports development of technologies for producing and using oil and for  making alternative fuels, such as ethanol or hydrogen. The department  also publishes statistics on energy production and consumption through  EIA. In addition, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), within the  Department of the Interior (Interior), assesses the amount of oil  throughout the world. The United States also is a member of the  International Energy Agency (IEA), an organization of 26 member  countries whose objectives include coping with disruptions in the oil  supply and providing information on the international oil market, among  other things.", "In this context, we (1) examined when oil production could peak, (2)  assessed the potential for transportation technologies to mitigate the  consequences of a peak and decline in oil production, and (3) examined  federal agency efforts that could reduce uncertainty about the timing of  peak oil production or mitigate the consequences.", "In conducting our work, we identified and reviewed key studies on when  oil production will peak. We reviewed estimates of the amount of oil  throughout the world and the amount of oil held by national oil  companies, and we analyzed forecasts of political and investment risks in  oil-producing regions. To assess the potential for transportation  technologies in the United States to mitigate the consequences of a peak  and decline in oil production, we examined options to develop alternative  fuels and technologies to reduce energy consumption in the transportation  sector. In particular, we focused on technologies that would affect  automobiles and light trucks. We consulted with experts to devise a list of  key technologies in these areas and then reviewed DOE programs and  activities related to developing these technologies. We did not attempt to  comprehensively list all technologies or to conduct a governmentwide  review of all programs, and we limited our scope to what federal  government officials know about the status of these technologies in the  United States. We did not conduct a global assessment of transportation  technologies. We reviewed numerous studies on the relationship between  oil and the global economy and, in particular, on the experiences of past  oil price shocks. To identify federal government activities that could  address peak oil production issues, we spoke with officials at DOE and  USGS, and gathered information on federal programs and policies that  could affect uncertainty about the timing of peak oil production and the  development of alternative transportation technologies. To gain further  insights into the federal role and other issues surrounding peak oil  production, we convened an expert panel in conjunction with the National  Academy of Sciences. These experts commented on the potential  economic consequences of a transition away from conventional oil,  factors that could affect the severity of the consequences, and what the  federal role should be, among other things. A more detailed description of  the scope and methodology of our review is presented in appendix I.

But the total amount of oil underground is finite, and, therefore,  production will one day reach a peak and then begin to decline. Such a  peak may be involuntary if supply is unable to keep up with growing  demand. Alternatively, a production peak could be brought about by  voluntary reductions in oil consumption before physical limits to  continued supply growth kick in. Not surprisingly, concerns have arisen in  recent years about the relationship between (1) the growing consumption  of oil and the availability of oil reserves and (2) the impact of potentially  dwindling supplies and rising prices on the world\u2019s economy and social  welfare. Following a peak in world oil production, the rate of production  would eventually decrease and, necessarily, so would the rate of  consumption of oil.", "Oil can be found and produced from a variety of sources. To date, world  oil production has come almost exclusively from what are considered to  be \u201cconventional sources\u201d of oil. While there is no universally agreed-upon  definition of what is meant by conventional sources, IEA states that  conventional sources can be produced using today\u2019s mainstream  technologies, compared with \u201cnonconventional sources\u201d that require more  complex or more expensive technologies to extract, such as oil sands and  oil shale. Distinguishing between conventional and nonconventional oil  sources is important because the additional cost and technological  challenges surrounding production of nonconventional sources make  these resources more uncertain. However, this distinction is further  complicated because what is considered to be a mainstream technology  can change over time. For example, offshore oil deposits were considered  to be a nonconventional source 50 years ago; however, today they are  considered conventional. For the purpose of this report, and consistent  with IEA\u2019s classification, we define nonconventional sources as including  oil sands, heavy oil deposits, and oil shale. Some oil is being produced  from these nonconventional sources today. For example, in 2005 Canada  produced about 1.6 million barrels per day of oil from oil sands, and  Venezuelan production of extra-heavy oil for 2005 was projected to be  about 600,000 barrels per day. Currently, however, production from these  sources is very small compared with total world oil production."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Oil Production Has Peaked in the United States and Most Other Countries Outside the Middle East", "paragraphs": ["According to IEA, most countries outside the Middle East have reached  their peak in conventional oil production, or will do so in the near future.

However, this increase will end about 2016, and then U.S. production will  continue to decline. Given these projections, it is clear that future  increases in U.S. demand for oil will need to be fulfilled through increases  in production in the rest of the world. Increasing production in other  countries has to date been able to more than make up for declining U.S.  production and has resulted in increasing world production.

Following the record oil prices associated with the Iranian  Revolution in 1979-80 and with the start of the Iran-Iraq war in 1980, there  was a drop in total world oil consumption, from about 63 million barrels  per day in 1980 to 59 million barrels per day in 1983. Since then, however,  world consumption of petroleum products has increased, totaling about 84  million barrels per day in 2005. In the United States, consumption of  petroleum products increased an average of 1.65 percent annually from  1983 to 2004, and averaged 20.6 million barrels per day in 2005,  representing about one-quarter of all world consumption.

Figure 4 shows that world oil prices in  nominal terms\u2014unadjusted for inflation\u2014are higher than at any time  since 1950, although when adjusted for inflation, the high prices of 2006  are still lower than were reached in the 1979-80 price run-up following the  Iranian Revolution and the beginning of the Iran-Iraq war.", "All else being equal, oil consumption is inversely correlated with oil price,  with higher oil prices inducing consumers to reduce their oil  consumption. Specifically, increases in crude oil prices are reflected in  the prices of products made from crude oil, including gasoline, diesel,  home heating oil, and petrochemicals. The extent to which consumers are  willing and able to reduce their consumption of oil in response to price  increases depends on the cost of switching to activities and lifestyles that  use less oil. Because there are more options available in the longer term,  consumers respond more to changes in oil prices in the longer term than  in the shorter term. For example, in the short term, consumers can reduce  oil consumption by driving less or more slowly, but in the longer term,  consumers can still take those actions, but can also buy more fuel-efficient  automobiles or even move closer to where they work and thereby further  reduce their oil consumption.", "Supply and demand, in turn, affect the type of oil that is produced.  Conventional oil that is less expensive to extract using lower-cost drilling  techniques will be produced when oil prices are lower. Conversely, oil that  is expensive to produce because of the higher cost technologies involved  may not be economical to produce at low oil prices. Producers are  unlikely to turn to these more expensive oil sources unless oil prices are  sustained at a high enough level to make such an enterprise profitable.  Given the importance of oil in the world\u2019s energy portfolio, as cheaper oil  reserves are exhausted in the future, nations will need to make the  transition to more and more expensive and difficult-to-access sources of  oil to meet energy demands.

Estimates of how much oil remains in  the ground are highly uncertain because much of these data are self- reported and unverified by independent auditors; many parts of the world  have yet to be fully explored for oil; and there is no comprehensive  assessment of oil reserves from nonconventional sources. This uncertainty  surrounding estimates of oil resources in the ground comprises the  uncertainty surrounding estimates of proven reserves as well as  uncertainty surrounding expected increases in these reserves and  estimated future oil discoveries.", "Oil and Gas Journal and World Oil, two primary sources of proven  reserves estimates, compile data on proven reserves from national and  private company sources. Some of this information is publicly available  from oil companies that are subject to public reporting requirements\u2014for  example, information provided by companies that are publicly traded on  U.S. stock exchanges that are subject to the filing requirements of U.S.  federal securities laws. Information filed pursuant to these laws is subject  to liability standards, and, therefore, there is a strong incentive for these  companies to make sure their disclosures are complete and accurate. On  the other hand, companies that are not subject to these federal securities  laws, including companies wholly owned by various OPEC countries  where the majority of reserves are located, are not subject to these filing  requirements and their related liability standards. Some experts believe  OPEC estimates of proven reserves to be inflated. For example, OPEC  estimates increased sharply in the 1980s, corresponding to a change in  OPEC\u2019s quota rules that linked a member country\u2019s production quota in  part to its remaining proven reserves. In addition, many OPEC countries\u2019  reported reserves remained relatively unchanged during the 1990s, even as  they continued high levels of oil production. For example, IEA reports that  reserves estimates in Kuwait were unchanged from 1991 to 2002, even  though the country produced more than 8 billion barrels of oil over that  period and did not make any important new oil discoveries. At a 2005  National Academy of Sciences workshop on peak oil, OPEC defended its  reserves estimates as accurate. The potential unreliability of OPEC\u2019s self- reported data is particularly problematic with respect to predicting the  timing of a peak because OPEC holds most of the world\u2019s current  estimated proven oil reserves. On the basis of Oil and Gas Journal  estimates as of January 2006, we found that of the approximately 1.1  trillion barrels of proven oil reserves worldwide, about 80 percent are  located in the OPEC countries, compared with about 2 percent in the  United States. Figure 6 shows this estimate in more detail.", "USGS, another primary source of reported estimates, provides oil  resources estimates, which are different from proved reserves estimates.  Oil resources estimates are significantly higher because they estimate the  world\u2019s total oil resource base, rather than just what is now proven to be  economically producible. USGS estimates of the resource base include  past production and current reserves as well as the potential for future  increases in current conventional oil reserves\u2014often referred to as  reserves growth\u2014and the amount of estimated conventional oil that has  the potential to be added to these reserves. Estimates of reserves growth  and those resources that have the potential to be added to oil reserves are  important in determining when oil production may peak. However,  estimating these potential future reserves is complicated by the fact that  many regions of the world have not been fully explored and, as a result,  there is limited information. For example, in its 2000 assessment, USGS  provides a mean estimate of 732 billion barrels that have the potential to  be added as newly discovered conventional oil, with as much as 25 percent  from the Arctic\u2014including Greenland, Northern Canada, and the Russian  portion of the Barents Sea. However, relatively little exploration has been  done in this region, and there are large portions of the world where the  potential for oil production exists, but where exploration has not been  done. According to USGS, there is less uncertainty in regions where wells  have been drilled, but even in the United States, one of the areas that has  seen the greatest exploration, some areas have not been fully explored, as  illustrated by the recent discovery of a potentially large oil field in the Gulf  of Mexico.", "Limited information on oil-producing regions worldwide also leads USGS  to base its estimate of reserves growth on how reserves estimates have  grown in the United States. However, some experts criticize this  methodology; they believe such an estimate may be too high because the  U.S. experience overestimates increases in future worldwide reserves. In  contrast, EIA believes the USGS estimate may be too low. In 2005, USGS  released a study showing that its prediction of reserves growth has been in  line with the world\u2019s experience from 1996 to 2003. Given such  controversy, uncertainty remains about this key element of estimating the  amount of oil in the ground. In 2000, USGS\u2019 most recent full assessment of  the world\u2019s key oil regions, the agency provided a range of estimates of  remaining world conventional oil resources. The mean of this range was at  about 2.3 trillion barrels comprising about 890 billion barrels in current  reserves and 1.4 trillion barrels that have the potential to be added to oil  reserves in the future.", "Further contributing to the uncertainty of the timing of a peak is the lack  of a comprehensive assessment of oil from nonconventional sources. For  example, the three key sources of oil estimates\u2014Oil and Gas Journal,  World Oil, and USGS\u2014do not generally include oil from nonconventional  sources. This is an important issue because oil from nonconventional  sources is thought to exist in large quantities. For example, IEA believes  that oil from nonconventional sources\u2014composed primarily of Canadian  oil sands, extra-heavy oil deposits in Venezuela, and oil shale in the United  States\u2014could account for as much as 7 trillion barrels of oil, which could  greatly delay the onset of a peak in production. However, IEA also points  out that the amount of this nonconventional oil that will eventually be  produced is highly uncertain, which is a result of the challenges facing this  production. Despite this uncertainty, USGS experts noted that Canadian  oil sands and Venezuelan extra-heavy oil production are under way now  and also suggested that proven reserves from these sources will be  growing considerably in the immediate future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Uncertainty Remains about How Much Oil Can Be Produced from Proven Reserves, Hard-to-Reach Locations, and Nonconventional Sources", "paragraphs": ["It is also difficult to project the timing of a peak in oil production because  technological, cost, and environmental challenges make it unclear how  much oil can ultimately be recovered from (1) proven reserves, (2) hard- to-reach locations, and (3) nonconventional sources.", "To increase the recovery rate from oil reserves, companies turn to  enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technologies, which DOE reports has the  potential to increase recovery rates from 30 to 50 percent in many  locations. These technologies include injecting steam or heated water;  gases, such as carbon dioxide; or chemicals into the reservoir to stimulate  oil flow and allow for increased recovery. Opportunities for EOR have  been most aggressively pursued in the United States, EOR technologies  currently contribute approximately 12 percent to U.S. production, and  carbon dioxide EOR alone is projected to have the potential to provide at  least 2 million barrels per day by 2020. However, technological advances,  such as better seismic and fluid-monitoring techniques for reservoirs  during an EOR injection, may be required to make these techniques more  cost-effective. Furthermore, EOR technologies are much costlier than the  conventional production methods used for the vast majority of oil  produced. Costs are higher because of the capital cost of equipment and  operating costs, including the production, transportation, and injection of  agents into existing fields and the additional energy costs of performing  these tasks. Finally, EOR technologies have the potential to create  environmental concerns associated with the additional energy required to  conduct an EOR injection and the greenhouse gas emissions associated  with producing that energy, although EIA has stated that these  environmental costs may be less than those imposed by producing oil in  previously undeveloped areas. Even if sustained high oil prices make EOR  technologies cost-effective for an oil company, these challenges and costs  may deter their widespread use.", "The timing of peak oil is also difficult to estimate because new sources of  oil could be increasingly more remote and costly to exploit, including  offshore production of oil in deepwater and ultra-deepwater. Worldwide,  industry analysts report that deepwater (depths of 1,000 to 5,000 feet) and  ultra-deepwater (5,000 to 10,000 feet) drilling efforts are concentrated  offshore in Africa, Latin America, and North America, and capital  expenditures for these efforts are expected to grow through at least 2011.  In the United States, deepwater and ultra-deepwater drilling, primarily in  the Gulf of Mexico, could reach 2.2 million barrels per day in 2016,  according to EIA estimates. However, accessing and producing oil from  these locations present several challenges. At deepwater depths,  penetrating the earth and efficiently operating drilling equipment is  difficult because of the extreme pressure and temperature. In addition,  these conditions can compromise the endurance and reliability of  operating equipment. Operating costs for deepwater rigs are 3.0 to 4.5  times more than operating costs for typical shallow water rigs. Capital  costs, including platforms and underwater pipeline infrastructures, are  also greater. Finally, deepwater and ultra-deepwater drilling efforts  generally face similar environmental concerns as shallow water drilling  efforts, although some deepwater operations may pose greater  environmental concerns to sensitive deepwater ecosystems.", "It is unclear how much oil can be recovered from nonconventional  sources. Recovery from these sources could delay a peak in oil production  or slow the rate of decline in production after a peak. Expert sources  disagree concerning the significance of the role these nonconventional  sources will play in the future. DOE officials we spoke with emphasized  the belief that nonconventional oil will play a significant role in the very  near future as conventional oil production is unable to meet the increasing  demand for oil. However, IEA estimates of oil production have  conventional oil continuing to comprise almost all of production through  2030.

In 2005, worldwide production of oil sands,  largely from Alberta, contributed approximately 1.6 million barrels of oil  per day, and production is projected to grow to as much as 3.5 million  barrels per day by 2030. Oil sand deposits are also located domestically in  Alabama, Alaska, California, Texas, and Utah. Production from oil sands,  however, presents significant environmental challenges. The production  process uses large amounts of natural gas, which generates greenhouse  gases when burned.

For  example, according to a news account, crude oil output in Iraq dropped  from 3.0 million barrels per day before the 1990 gulf war to about 2.0  million barrels per day in 2006, and a labor strike in the Venezuelan oil  sector led to a drop in exports to the United States of 1.2 million barrels.  Although these were isolated and temporary oil supply disruptions, if  enough similar events occurred with sufficient frequency, the overall  impact could constrain production capacity, thus making it impossible for  supply to expand along with demand for oil.

However, Congress has enacted moratoriums on drilling  and exploration in this area to protect coastlines from unintended oil  spills.

The important role  foreign investment plays in oil production is illustrated in Kazakhstan,  where the National Commission on Energy Policy found that opening the  energy sector to foreign investment in the early 1990s led to a doubling in  oil production between 1998 and 2002. In addition, we found that direct  foreign investment in Venezuela was strongly correlated with oil  production in that country, and that when foreign investment declined  between 2001 and 2004, oil production also declined. Industry officials  told us that lack of technical expertise could lead to less sophisticated  drilling techniques that actually reduce the ability to recover oil in more  complex reservoirs. For example, according to industry officials, some  Russian wells have difficulties with high water cut\u2014that is, a high ratio of  water to oil\u2014making oil difficult to get out of the ground at current prices.  This water cut problem stems from not using technically advanced  methods when the wells were initially drilled.

This effort should include improving the information available to estimate  the amount of oil, conventional and nonconventional, remaining in the  world as well as the future production and consumption of this oil, while  extending the time horizon of the government\u2019s projections and analysis.", "Assess alternative technologies in light of predictions about the timing of  peak oil production and periodically advise Congress on likely cost- effective areas where the government could assist the private sector with  development and adoption of such technologies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided the Departments of Energy and the Interior with a draft of  this report for their review and comment.", "DOE generally agreed with our message and recommendations and made  several clarifying and technical comments, which we addressed in the  body of the report as appropriate. Appendix V contains a reproduction of  DOE\u2019s letter and our detailed response to their comments. Specifically,  DOE commented that the draft report did not make a distinction between  a peak in conventional versus a peak in total (conventional and  nonconventional) oil. We agree that we have not made this distinction, in  part because the numerous studies of peak oil that we reviewed did not  always make such a distinction. Furthermore, we do not believe a clear  distinction between these two peak concepts is possible, in part because  the definition of what is conventional oil versus nonconventional oil is not  universally agreed on. However, the information we have reported  regarding uncertainty about the timing of a peak applies to either peak oil  concept.", "DOE also commented that our use of certain technical phrases, including  the distinction between heavy and extra-heavy oils and the distinction  between oil consumption and demand, may be confusing to some readers,  and we have made changes to the text to avoid such confusion. DOE  commented that the draft report wrongly attributed environmental  concerns to the use of enhanced oil recovery techniques, stating that the  environmental community prefers such techniques on existing oil fields to  exploration and development of new fields. We do not disagree that the  environmental costs of these techniques may be smaller than for other  activities and we have added text to express DOE\u2019s views on this matter.  However, our point in listing the cost and environmental challenges of  enhanced oil recovery techniques is that increasing oil production in the  future could be more costly and more environmentally damaging than  production of conventional oil, using primary production methods. For  this reason we disagree with DOE\u2019s comment that we should remove the  references to environmental challenges.", "Finally, DOE pointed out that the draft report was primarily focused on  transportation technologies that are used to power autonomous vehicles,  and they stated that a broader set of technologies that could displace oil  should be considered. We agree with their characterization of the draft  report. We chose transportation technologies because transportation  accounts for such a large part of U.S. oil consumption and because DOE  and other agencies have numerous programs and activities dealing with  technologies to displace oil in the transportation sector. We also agree that  a broader set of technologies should be considered in the long run as  potential ways to mitigate the consequences of a peak in oil production.  We encourage DOE and other agencies to fully explore the options to  displace oil as they implement our recommendations to develop a strategy  to reduce the uncertainty surrounding the timing of a peak in oil  production and advise Congress on cost-effective ways to mitigate the  consequences.", "Interior generally agreed with our message and recommendations in the  draft report and made clarifying and technical comments, which we  addressed in the body of the report as appropriate. Appendix VI contains a  reproduction of Interior\u2019s letter and our detailed response to its  comments. Specifically, Interior emphasized that it has a major role to play  in estimating global oil resources, and that this effort should be made in  conjunction with the efforts of DOE. We agree and encourage DOE to  work in conjunction with Interior and other key agencies in establishing a  strategy to coordinate and prioritize federal agency efforts to reduce the  uncertainty surrounding the timing of a peak and to advise Congress on  how best to mitigate consequences. Interior also commented that  mitigating the consequences of a peak is outside their purview. We agree,  and, in this report, we focus on examples of work that Interior could  undertake to assist in reducing the uncertainty surrounding the estimates  of global oil resources.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution of it until 30 days from  the report date.

We limited our review to those studies that were published and  excluded white papers or unpublished research. For studies that we cited  in this report, we reviewed their estimate of the timing, methodology, and  assumptions about the resource base to ensure that we properly  represented the validity and reliability of their results and conclusions. We  also consulted with federal government agencies and oil companies, as  well as academic and research organizations, to identify the uncertainties  associated with the timing of a peak.", "As part of our examination of the timing of peak oil production, we  assessed other factors that could affect oil exploration and production.  Specifically, we examined the challenges facing future technologies that  could enhance the global production of oil, including technologies for  increasing recovery from conventional reserves as well as technologies for  producing nonconventional oil. To examine these technologies, we met  with experts at the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) National Energy  Technology Laboratory, and synthesized information provided by these  experts.", "In addition, we examined political and investment risks associated with  global oil exploration and production using Global Insight\u2019s Global Risk  Service. For each country, Global Insight\u2019s country risk analyst estimates  the subjective probability of 15 discrete events for political risk, and 22  discrete events for investment risk in the upstream oil and gas sectors. The  probability is estimated for the next 5 years. Senior analysts then meet to  review the scores to ensure cross-country consistency. The summary  score is derived by weighting different groups of factors and then  summing across the groups. For political risk, external and internal  political risks are the two groups of factors. For investment risk in the oil  and gas sectors, the factors are: investment/maintenance risk, input risk,  production risk, sales risk, and revenue/repatriation risk. We compared  political and investment risk with Oil and Gas Journal oil reserves  estimates. Oil and Gas Journal reserves estimates are limited by the fact  that they are not independently verified by the publishers and are based on  surveys filled out by the countries. Because most countries do not reassess  annually, some estimates in this survey do not change each year. We  divided the countries into risk categories of low, medium, and high on the  basis of quartiles and natural break points in the data. To obtain the  percentage of reserves held by public companies and by national oil  companies, we used the Petroleum Intelligence Weekly list of top 50  companies worldwide. The Petroleum Intelligence Weekly data are limited  by reliance on company reports and other information sources provided  by companies and the generation of estimates for those companies that do  not release regular or complete reports. Estimates were created for most  of the state-owned oil companies in figure 9 of this report. The limitations  of these data reflect the uncertainty in estimates of the amount of oil in the  ground, and our report does not rely on precise estimates of oil reserves  but rather on the uncertainty about the amount of oil throughout the world  and the challenges to exploration and production of oil. Therefore, we  found these data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report.  We also spoke with officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission  and with DOE as well as experts in academia and industry. In addition, we  reviewed documents from the Department of the Interior and the  International Energy Agency (IEA).", "To assess the potential for transportation technologies to mitigate the  consequences of a peak and decline in oil production, we examined  options to develop alternative fuels and technologies to reduce energy  consumption in the transportation sector. In particular, we focused on  technologies that would affect automobiles and light trucks. We consulted  with experts to devise a list of key technologies in these areas and then  reviewed DOE programs and activities related to developing these  technologies. To assess alternative fuels and advanced vehicle  technologies, we met with various experts at DOE, including  representatives from the National Energy Technology Laboratory and the  National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and reviewed information  provided by officials from various offices at DOE. In addition, we spoke  with officials from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the  Department of Transportation regarding the development of these  technologies in the United States. We did not attempt to comprehensively  list all technologies or to conduct a governmentwide review of all  programs, and we limited our scope to what government officials at key  federal agencies know about the status of these technologies in the United  States. In addition, we did not conduct a global assessment of  transportation technologies. We reviewed numerous studies on the  relationship between oil and the global economy and, in particular, on the  experiences of past oil price shocks.", "To identify federal government activities that could address peak oil  production issues, we spoke with officials at DOE and the United States  Geological Survey (USGS), and gathered information on federal programs  and policies that could affect uncertainty about the timing of peak oil  production and the development of alternative transportation  technologies. To gain further insights into the federal role and other issues  surrounding peak oil production, we convened an expert panel in  Washington, D.C., in conjunction with the National Research Council of  the National Academy of Sciences. On May 5, 2006, these experts  commented on the potential economic consequences of a transition away  from conventional oil; factors that could affect the severity of the  consequences; and what the federal role should be in preparing for or  mitigating the consequences, among other things.

Although these technologies have been available in some form  since the 1920s, and coal GTL was used heavily by the German military  during World War II, GTL technologies are not widely used today.  Currently, there is no commercial production of biomass GTL and the only  commercial production of coal GTL occurs in South Africa, where the  Sasol Corporation currently produces 150,000 barrels of fuel from coal per  day.

Increasing the efficiency of the internal  combustion engine, specifically advanced diesel engines, is considered a  first step toward other engine technologies. For example, researchers are  working to improve the emissions profile of advanced diesel engines  through techniques such as low-temperature combustion, which would  enable the engine to burn more cleanly so that emissions control at the  tailpipe is less burdensome. Another set of technologies are hybrid electric  and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Hybrid vehicles use a battery  alongside the internal combustion engine to facilitate the capture of  braking energy as well as to provide propulsion, while plug-in hybrids use  a different battery and can be powered by battery alone for an extended  period. Researchers are examining how to build longer-lasting and less- expensive batteries for hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles. Finally, a range  of ongoing work is attempting to improve the efficiency of conventional  vehicles. For example, lightweight materials have the potential to improve  efficiency by reducing vehicle weight. Oil consumption can also be cut by  reducing the rolling resistance of tires, increasing the efficiency of  transmission technologies that move the energy from the engine to the  tires, and improving how power is managed within the vehicle.", "Advanced diesel engines.

We agree that we have not defined a peak as either a peak in  conventional or total oil\u2014conventional plus nonconventional. In the  course of our study, we found that experts conducting the timing of  peak oil studies also do not agree on a single peak concept. Different  studies by these experts use different estimates for oil remaining and,  as a result, implicitly have different concepts of a peak\u2014a  conventional versus a total oil peak. We have added language to the  report to clarify this point. The lack of agreement on a peak concept  mirrors the disagreement about the very definition of conventional oil  versus nonconventional oil. The distinction regarding what portion of  heavy oil is conventional is debated by experts. For example, USGS  would consider the heavy oil produced in California as conventional  oil, while IEA would not\u2014the latter considers all heavy (and extra- heavy) oil to be nonconventional. For the purposes of this report, we  have adopted IEA\u2019s definition of nonconventional oil, which includes  all heavy oil.  2.  We agree that the use of heavy and extra-heavy oil may be confusing in  sections of this report, and we have implemented some of the  suggestions that DOE provided in their technical comments.  3.  With regard to the inclusion of some ethanol in petroleum  consumption as reported on page 1 of the report, we asked EIA staff to  identify how much of such nonpetroleum liquids are in the figure. They  told us that just under one-third of 1 percent of the world petroleum  consumption data they report is comprised of ethanol, and we noted  this in a footnote on page 1 of the report. We decided to continue to  call it petroleum consumption, rather than \u201cliquids consumption\u201d as  suggested by DOE because the former is what EIA calls it and because  the nonpetroleum component is so small.  4.  We agree that our language regarding the use of oil consumption and  oil demand is confusing in some sections of the report. Overall, the  report makes the point that, all other things equal, the faster the world  consumes oil, the sooner we will use up the oil and reach a peak. The  report also makes the point that future demand for oil, which depends  on many factors, including world economic growth, will determine just  how fast we consume oil. We have made some changes to the text to  clarify when we are talking about consumption of oil and when we are  talking about the demand for oil.  5.  We do not disagree that the environmental costs of EOR are lower  than for some of the other technologies examined, and we did not try  to rank the environmental costs of all the alternatives we examined.  However, we believe that these costs are relevant for assessing the  potential impacts of producing more of our oil using such  technologies. Therefore, we left that discussion in the report but added  language attributing DOE\u2019s views on this.  6.  We agree with DOE\u2019s assessment that there is a broader range of  transportation technologies besides those used to power autonomous  vehicles. We chose to focus on the technologies that experts currently  believe have the most potential for reducing oil consumption in the  light-duty vehicle sector, which accounts for 60 percent of the  transportation sector\u2019s consumption of petroleum-based energy.
