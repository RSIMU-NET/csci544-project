Based on extensive analysis of records obtained from Bank of America, GAO found that DOD spent almost $124 million on about 68,000 premium class related tickets--primarily business class--during fiscal years 2001 and 2002. Each premium class ticket costs the government up to thousands of dollars more than a comparable coach class ticket. GAO's work also indicated that civilian supervisors, managers, and executives and senior military officers accounted for almost 50 percent of the premium class transactions, and for 27 of the 28 most frequent premium class travelers. GAO considers travel by high-ranking officials to be a sensitive payment area because of its susceptibility to abuse. Breakdowns in key internal controls resulted in a significant level of improper premium class travel. GAO estimated that 72 percent of DOD's fiscal year 2001 and 2002 premium class travel was not properly authorized, and 73 percent was not properly justified. Further, DOD did not have accurate and complete data on the extent of premium class travel and performed little or no monitoring of this travel. In regard to the control environment, GAO found that DOD (1) issued policies that were inconsistent with General Service Administration governmentwide travel regulations, (2) did not require military services to issue and update premium class policies to implement DOD's travel regulations consistently, and (3) did not issue guidance on how to document the authorization and justification of premium class travel. As a result of GAO's audit, DOD has begun updating its travel regulations to more clearly state when premium class travel can be authorized and to emphasize that it must only be used when exceptional circumstances warrant the additional cost."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report is a continuation of our series of reports on the Department of  Defense\u2019s (DOD) management of its various credit card programs. In fiscal  years 2002 and 2003, we issued a series of testimonies and reportsaddressing problems that the Army, Navy, and Air Force had in managing  individually billed travel card accounts. These testimonies and reports  showed high delinquency rates and significant potential fraud and abuse  related to DOD\u2019s travel program. Due to these concerns, you asked us to  audit controls over the other major form of payment used by DOD for  travel expenses\u2014centrally billed accounts. Our audits in these areas  provide examples of DOD\u2019s long-standing financial management problems,  which are pervasive, complex, and deeply rooted in virtually all business  operations throughout the department. Such problems led us in 1995 to put  DOD financial management on our list of high-risk areas\u2014areas that are highly vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse\u2014in the federal government, a  designation that continues today.", "The centrally billed accounts are used by most DOD services and units to  purchase transportation services such as airline and train tickets, facilitate  group travel, and pay for other travel-related expenses, while the  individually billed accounts are used by individual travelers for lodging,  rental cars, and other travel expenses. For fiscal years 2001 and 2002, DOD  travelers incurred $7.1 billion in expenses on the centrally billed and  individually billed travel card accounts, with about $2.8 billion related to  the use of centrally billed accounts. This report addresses the first part of  your request related to controls over premium class travel charged to  centrally billed accounts. Federal travel regulations define premium class  travel as any class of accommodation above coach class, that is, first or  business class. We plan to report to you separately on the results of our  overall audit of the controls over the centrally billed account travel  program.", "Because DOD disburses funds directly to Bank of America under a  governmentwide travel card contract for charges made to the centrally  billed accounts, the use of these accounts for improper transportation, in  particular the more expensive premium class travel, results in direct  increased cost to the government. Governmentwide General Services  Administration (GSA) regulations and internal DOD regulations state that  travelers must use coach class accommodations for official business air  travel\u2014both domestic and international\u2014except when a traveler is  specifically authorized to use premium class. The regulations also state  that travelers on official government travel must exercise the same  standard of care in incurring expenses that a prudent person would  exercise if traveling on personal business. Premium class flights are not  something travelers are entitled to simply because certain conditions exist.  Rather, GSA and DOD require that, when possible, travelers plan their  travel in advance to avoid the necessity for premium class travel.", "As you requested, the objective of our audit was to assess the adequacy of  internal controls over the authorization and issuance of fiscal years 2001  and 2002 premium class tickets charged to DOD\u2019s centrally billed travel  accounts. Specifically, we (1) identified the extent to which DOD uses the  centrally billed travel accounts to purchase premium class travel,  (2) determined if DOD\u2019s key internal control activities operated effectively  and provided reasonable assurance that premium class travel was  purchased appropriately and identified examples of control breakdowns,  and (3) assessed DOD\u2019s oversight and monitoring of the use of premium  travel and key elements of the control environment.", "To meet our objectives, we (1) extracted premium class transactions from  Bank of America databases of charges made to DOD\u2019s centrally billed  accounts for fiscal years 2001 and 2002, (2) reviewed federal laws and  regulations and DOD policies and procedures on premium class travel, and  (3) interviewed DOD officials on processes and procedures in place to  authorize and justify premium class travel. We tested a statistical sample of  premium class travel transactions and conducted other audit work to  evaluate the design and implementation of key internal control procedures  and activities. We used data mining to identify additional instances of  improper premium class travel based on the frequency and dollar amount  of premium class travel.

The  Federal Travel Regulation (FTR), issued by GSA, implements statutory and  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requirements and policies for  travel by federal civilian employees and others authorized to travel at  government expense, including guidelines governing the use of premium  class travel. The purpose of the FTR is to ensure that official travel is  conducted responsibly and at a minimal administrative expense. Pursuant  to various statutes, DOD issued the Joint Federal Travel Regulations  (JFTR), which applies to uniformed service members, and the Joint Travel  Regulations (JTR), which applies to DOD civilian personnel. The DOD  travel regulation for military personnel mirrors the GSA regulation, and  DOD travel regulations for civilian personnel are subject to GSA\u2019s travel  regulation. In addition, each military service has issued implementing  guidelines that, to varying degrees, provide additional guidance on when  premium class travel is authorized.", "GSA and DOD regulations authorize the use of premium class travel under  specific circumstances. The JTR and the JFTR limit the authority to  authorize first class travel to the Secretary of Defense, his or her deputy, or  other officials as designated by the Secretary of Defense. However, while  both the JTR and JFTR provide that the authority to authorize first class  travel may be delegated and re-delegated, the regulations specify that the  authority must be delegated to \u201cas high an administrative level as  practicable to ensure adequate consideration and review of the  circumstances necessitating the first class accommodations.\u201d Further  guidance is found in a DOD directive on transportation and traffic  management, which specifically states that the secretaries within their  military services and secretariats are the authorizing authorities for first  class travel. The service secretaries may re-delegate authorizing authority  for first class travel to under secretaries, service chiefs or their vice and/or  deputy chiefs of staff, and four-star major commanders or their three-star  vice and/or deputy commanders, but authorizing authority may not be  delegated to anyone other than these officials. DOD regulations also  require that authorization for premium class accommodations be made in  advance of the actual travel unless extenuating circumstances or  emergency situations make advance authorization impossible. Specifically,  the JTR and JFTR state that first class accommodation is authorized only  when at least one of the following conditions exists: coach class airline accommodations or premium class other than first  class airline accommodations are not reasonably available; the traveler is so handicapped or otherwise physically impaired that  other accommodations cannot be used, and such condition is  substantiated by competent medical authority; or exceptional security circumstances require such travel.", "The JTR and JFTR allow the transportation officer, in conjunction with the  official who issued the travel order, to approve premium class travel other  than first class. In accordance with the FTR, DOD restricts premium class  travel to the following eight circumstances: regularly scheduled flights between origin and destination provide only  premium class accommodations, and this is certified on the travel  voucher; coach class is not available in time to accomplish the purpose of the  official travel, which is so urgent it cannot be postponed; premium class travel is necessary to accommodate the traveler\u2019s  disability or other physical impairment, and the condition is  substantiated in writing by competent medical authority; premium class travel is needed for security purposes or because  exceptional circumstances make its use essential to the successful  performance of the mission; coach class accommodations on authorized/approved foreign carriers  do not provide adequate sanitation or meet health standards; premium class accommodations would result in overall savings to the  government because of subsistence costs, overtime, or lost productive  time that would be incurred while awaiting coach class  accommodations; transportation is paid in full by a nonfederal source; or travel is to or from a destination outside the continental United States,  and the scheduled flight time (including stopovers) is in excess of 14  hours. However, a rest stop is prohibited when travel is authorized by  premium class accommodations.", "Both GSA and DOD regulations allow a traveler to upgrade to premium  class other than first class travel at personal expense, through redemption  of frequent traveler benefits. GSA also identified agency mission as one of  the criteria for premium class travel.

Although we were able to report this aggregate information, we were  unable to obtain any breakdowns of the data, such as the amount of  premium class travel by military service or the amount of premium class  travel used for domestic versus overseas flights. As discussed later in this  report, because DOD does not obtain or maintain management information  on premium class travel, it cannot monitor its proper use, identify trends,  or determine alternate, less expensive means of transportation.", "As shown in table 1, the total dollar amount DOD spent on travel that  included at least one leg of premium class airfare was about $57 million in  fiscal year 2001 and about $67 million in fiscal year 2002. First class travel  accounted for 2.4 percent of the total dollars spent for premium class travel  for the 2 fiscal years, while business class accounted for the remaining 97.6  percent.", "DOD\u2019s premium class air travel accounts for a very small percentage of  DOD travel overall. It represents 1 percent of total DOD airline  transactions and 5 percent of total DOD dollars spent on airline travel  charged to the centrally billed accounts. However, to put the amount that  DOD spends on premium class travel in perspective, we noted that the $124  million DOD spent on premium class related travel during these 2 fiscal  years exceeded the total travel and transportation expenses\u2014including  airfare, lodging, and meals\u2014spent by 12 major agencies covered by the  Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, including the Social Security  Administration; the Departments of Energy, Education, Housing and Urban  Development, and Labor; and the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration. The difference between a premium class ticket and a  comparable coach class ticket can range from negligible\u2014particularly if  the traveler traveled within Europe\u2014to thousands of dollars. In one  instance, a traveler\u2019s first class flight between Washington and Los Angeles  was 14 times, or about $3,000 more than, the price of a coach class flight.", "We also found that higher-ranking civilian personnel and military officials  accounted for a large part of premium class travel. Based on our statistical  sample, we estimated that DOD civilian employees under the General  Schedule (GS) grade GS-13 to GS-15 (supervisors and managers), Senior  Executive Service (SES) (career senior executives), presidential  appointees with Senate confirmation, and DOD senior military officers O-4  and above accounted for almost 50 percent of premium class travel. The  remaining 50 percent in our statistical sample comprised mostly other  officers, senior enlisted personnel, and technical or professional staff. We  consider travel by high-ranking officials, in particular senior-level  executives, to be a sensitive payment area because of its susceptibility to  abuse or noncompliance with laws and regulations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Internal Controls Were Ineffective", "paragraphs": ["Internal control activities help ensure that management\u2019s directives are carried  out.

Specifically, we estimated, based on our statistical sample, that  72 percent of the DOD centrally billed travel transactions containing  premium class travel for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 were not properly  authorized, and 73 percent were not properly justified. (See app. I for  further details of our statistical sampling test results.) Using our statistical  sample and data mining results, we found numerous examples of premium  class travel without authorization or adequate justification, illustrating the  improper use of premium class travel and the resulting increase in travel  costs. Further, we used data mining techniques to identify the most  frequent users of premium class travel. Our analysis of these cases showed  that almost all were senior-level employees whose travel, although properly  authorized, generally was not adequately justified."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Results of Statistical Sampling Work", "paragraphs": ["We selected two key transaction-level controls for statistical sampling  testing. As shown in table 2, we estimated that 72 percent of premium class  travel was unauthorized. Because the FTR and DOD regulations provide  that premium class travel must be specifically authorized, transactions that  failed this test also failed the justification test. In addition, we found two  transactions in our statistical sample were properly authorized but failed  the justification test as they were not supported by the documentation  provided or did not adhere to the FTR and DOD travel regulations.", "Requiring premium class travel to be properly authorized is the first step in  preventing improper premium class travel. The FTR requires premium  class travel to be specifically authorized. DOD specifies that premium class  travel must be authorized in advance of travel, unless extenuating or  emergency circumstances make authorization impossible, in which case  the traveler is required to request written approval from the appropriate  authority as soon as possible after the travel. In addition to the FTR and  DOD regulations, we also applied the criteria set forth in our internal  control standards and sensitive payments guidelines in evaluating the  proper authorization of premium class travel. For example, while DOD  travel regulations and policies do not address subordinates authorizing  their supervisors\u2019 premium class travel, our internal control standards  consider such policy to be flawed; therefore, a premium class transaction  that was approved by a subordinate would fail the control test. Using these  guidelines, we found that transactions failed the authorization test in the  following three categories: (1) the premium class airline ticket was  purchased, but the authorization of premium class travel was not noted on  either the travel order or on additional documentation supporting the travel  order, (2) the travel order authorizing premium class travel was not signed,  and (3) premium class travel was authorized by a subordinate.", "Premium class travel not specifically authorized. Based on our  statistical sample, we estimated that the travel order and other supporting  documentation for 64 percent of the premium class transactions did not  specifically authorize the traveler to fly premium class, and thus the  commercial travel office should not have issued the premium class ticket.  Further, we estimated that 5 percent of the transactions lacking specific  authorization were intra-European flights covered under a blanket  authorization issued in February 2002 by the U.S. Army Transportation  Management Center, Europe, located in Germany. The blanket  authorization permitted the commercial travel office to automatically  purchase business class tickets on 65 flights between Frankfurt, Munich, or  Stuttgart and other selected European cities. The blanket authorization  stated that business class was authorized for these routes because it was  the lowest unrestricted fare. Consequently, DOD considered these  transactions to have been authorized. However, we disagree that a blanket  authorization can be used for premium class travel because it is not  consistent with GSA and DOD requirements that all premium class travel  be specifically authorized and, wherever possible, minimized. Further, the  importance of having individual authorization for premium class travel is  illustrated by our independent evaluation of the 65 flights, which showed  that business class tickets were not necessarily equal to or lower than the  cost of unrestricted coach, as claimed in the blanket authorization. For  example, according to the travel agency that served GAO, the business fare  between Munich, Germany, and Tbilisi, Georgia (located near Turkey), was  $3,232 and the unrestricted economy fare was $992, a difference of $2,240.", "Travel order not signed. We also estimated that 6 percent of premium  class transactions were related to instances where the travel order  authorizing business class was not signed at all or the travel order  authorizing first class was not signed by the service secretary or his  designee, as required by DOD regulations. Ensuring that travel orders are  signed by an appropriate official is a key control to preventing improper  premium class travel. If the travel order is not signed, or not signed by the  individual designated to do so, DOD has no assurance that the substantially  higher cost of the premium class tickets was properly reviewed and  represented an efficient use of government resources.", "Premium travel authorized by a subordinate. We estimated that 2  percent of the premium class transactions involved situations where a  subordinate approved a superior\u2019s travel. Although these limited instances  do not necessarily indicate the existence of a significant systemic problem,  allowing subordinates to approve their supervisors\u2019 premium class travel is  synonymous to self-approval and reduces scrutiny of premium class  requests. Our internal control standards state that \u201cTransactions and other  significant events should be authorized and executed only by persons  acting within the scope of their authority. This is the principal means of  assuring that only valid transactions to exchange, transfer, use, or commit  resources and other events are initiated or entered into.\u201d"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Valid Justification for Premium Travel Often Did Not Exist", "paragraphs": ["Another internal control weakness identified in the statistical sample was  that the justification used for premium class travel was not always  provided, not accurate, and/or not complete enough to warrant the  additional cost to the government. As previously stated, premium class  travel is not an entitlement. In fact, recent changes to the DOD regulations  state that premium class travel, in the context of lengthy flights, should  only be used when exceptional circumstances warrant and that alternatives  should be explored to minimize unnecessary premium class travel. In  reviewing whether premium class travel was justified, we looked at  whether there was documented authorization and, if there was, whether  the authorization for premium class travel was supported by evidence of a  valid reason. As shown in table 2, an estimated 72 percent of premium class  transactions were not authorized and therefore could not have been  justified. An additional 2 transactions in the statistical sample were  authorized but not justified in accordance with DOD\u2019s criteria.

Following the table is  more detailed information on some of these cases.", "Traveler #1 is a GS-14 at the Department of the Navy; he along with three  family members flew a combination of first and business class when  they were relocated from London to Honolulu. The cost to the  government for those four first and business class tickets was almost  $21,000, compared to an estimated total cost of about $2,500 for four  coach class tickets. An audit of the travel orders for this trip indicated  that the DOD civilian employee and his family were not authorized to fly  first or business class. Consequently, the traveler failed both the  authorization and the justification test. Despite the lack of specific  authorization, the traveler was issued premium class tickets for this trip,  resulting in additional cost to the government of more than $18,000.  Upon being contacted, the traveler agreed that his travel order did not  specifically state that premium class was authorized, and stated that he  inquired about business class tickets from the commercial travel office  because his flight lasted more than 14 hours. Based on the issuance of  premium class tickets for other permanent change-in-station moves  exceeding 14 hours in total travel time, the commercial travel office  issued the premium class tickets to the traveler.", "Traveler #4 is a GS-13 at the Department of the Navy. In March 2002, the  traveler flew business class round-trip from San Francisco to Osaka,  Japan, where he had an overnight layover before proceeding to Busan,  Korea. The travel order DOD provided us did not authorize business  class travel. Further, because the traveler had an overnight layover in  route to Korea, the 14-hour rule would not apply. The cost of the ticket  was $3,695, compared to an estimated cost of $2,161 for a comparable  unrestricted ticket in coach. Without authorization or valid justification,  the additional $1,534 spent on the business class ticket was improper.", "Traveler #7 is a GS-13 in the Navy. In March 2002, the traveler flew  business class from San Francisco to Tokyo on a ticket costing $3,168.  Although the flight to Tokyo lasted more than 14 hours, the use of  premium class travel was not properly authorized because the travel  order was not signed by the appropriate official. In comparison, the  estimated cost of an unrestricted government fare in coach was $610.", "Traveler #9 was a GS-13 in the Department of the Army who flew most  of his trip from Tucson to Bahrain and then from Bahrain to Los Angeles  in business class, at a cost of $8,308. The estimated cost of an  unrestricted coach class ticket for the same route was $4,966. The  justification for the additional cost of the business class ticket was that  the flight lasted more than 14 hours. However, the traveler stopped  overnight in London at the government\u2019s expense on both the outbound  and return portions of the trip. The FTR and JTR specifically prohibit  premium class flights when the traveler has a rest stop en route at the  government\u2019s expense.", "Traveler #10 was a GS-15 in the Department of the Navy who flew  premium class from Washington, D.C., to Amsterdam and back on the  basis of a medical condition.

The  supporting documentation provided to us included a note, written by the  traveler\u2019s supervisor, that was prepared more than 18 months after the  travel, stating that the traveler had a medical condition requiring the  premium class ticket. However, the note was not signed by a doctor nor  did it reference a medical professional who recommended the need for  premium class seating. The traveler informed us that his supervisor  wrote the medical note after our inquiry into his case. In addition, none  of the other 9 flights taken by the traveler cited a medical condition, and  the traveler flew coach class on a number of flights that lasted longer  than his flight from Washington, D.C., to Amsterdam. According to the  traveler, he never had been properly authorized to fly business class on  the basis of a medical condition.", "Traveler #11 was a political appointee and a member of the Commission  on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry (Commission), an  organization that was almost entirely funded by DOD and for which  DOD paid the cost of all airline tickets for Commission members and  staff. The traveler flew business class from Washington, D.C., to London,  and then traveled by rail from London to Brussels and onto Paris. In  Paris, the traveler took a business class flight to Moscow to attend a 2- day conference. According to the travel order, business class travel was  authorized because it was mission essential. However, the travel order  did not indicate why the cost of business class travel for a trip to a  conference was mission essential. Further, mission essential is not a  DOD criterion for authorizing business class travel. Our data mining  efforts found that DOD paid the travel of a total of 13 individuals\u20146  commissioners and 7 commission staff\u2014to attend the Moscow  conference after stopping off in London, Brussels, and Paris. The 6  commissioners flew business class for all of the flights, while the  commission staff flew coach to London and on the return flights, and  flew business class while in Europe. None of the commissioners were  government employees; however, all of the staff were employed by DOD  and other agencies. The average cost of the airline tickets for all 6  commissioners was about $7,500 while the average cost of the airline  tickets for the staff was about $3,100. The official told us he authorized  premium class travel for the commissioners because they were high- salaried individuals from the private sector who were donating 10 days  of their time to the government with no compensation.

As indicated by the examples in table 4,  the frequent travelers were almost all senior DOD personnel. Specifically,  we found that all but 1 of the 28 most frequent travelers were at least GS-13  civilians or O-4 military officials. Although these frequent travelers were  generally authorized to fly premium class by someone at the same or a  higher level, we determined that many of the transactions were improper  because their justification was not supported by the documentation  provided or did not adhere to the FTR and DOD travel regulations. Other  cases involving frequent travelers were questionable because the  justification documentation was not adequate to determine whether the  transaction met DOD\u2019s criteria.", "Our work indicated that the most frequent travelers were, in most  instances, authorized to obtain premium class travel by people at the same  or higher levels. Only 3 of the 28 most frequent travelers failed the  authorization test because they or their subordinates authorized their  travel orders. More often, justification provided by frequent travelers failed  the justification test or the justification was not adequate to permit us to  determine whether the transaction complied with the FTR and DOD travel  regulations. The following provides further details on some of the cases in  table 4.", "Frequent traveler #1 was a GM-14 at the Navy who took 45 round-trip  flights during our 2-year audit period.

Attached to the travel order  for each trip was a doctor\u2019s certification noting that, for health reasons,  the traveler needed to fly in premium class. However, we found that the  medical certification did not indicate whether premium class travel was  needed on all flights or flights of certain duration, but that many of the  traveler\u2019s domestic trips, which he took in coach class, were almost as  long as some of the international flights he took in business class. For  example, the traveler regularly flew in coach class from Washington,  D.C., to cities in California and, in one instance, to Honolulu. The flight  times for individual legs of these trips ranged from about 5 to 7 hours.  The traveler\u2019s business class flights included flights from Washington,  D.C., to Frankfurt or Amsterdam. Those flights lasted about 7 hours.  When we discussed the trips with this traveler, he stated that although  some of the domestic flights that he took were similar in duration to the  international flights, his flights to Europe were generally evening flights  and the extra room provided in business class enabled him to be less  confined and to be ready for meetings the next day. The traveler\u2019s  discussion with us and the nature of his coach and premium travel  raises questions regarding his medical need to fly business class.", "Frequent traveler # 3 is an assistant secretary of defense in Washington,  D.C., who used a blanket order to authorize and justify business and first  class travel based on an unspecified medical condition. We identified a  total of 17 first and business class tickets for this traveler totaling nearly  $68,000. Neither the travel orders nor the travel vouchers included a  physician\u2019s certification identifying the medical justification to fly first  or business class. In addition, the traveler occasionally flew in coach  class. About a month after we requested additional documentation for  these airline tickets, DOD provided us with a letter from a physician  dated September 11, 2001, requesting that the traveler be authorized to  fly first class so that the traveler could stretch his legs. The records DOD  provided concerning the 17 flights indicated that the travel office did not  attempt to satisfy the traveler\u2019s need for space by reserving a bulkhead  seat or purchasing two coach seats, in accordance with DOD  requirements. We estimate that the total cost of these flights, if flown in  coach class, would have been about $17,000. The individual who made  the premium class reservations told us that she had not been trained on  the limitations associated with premium class travel. She also told us  that in the future she would get the Deputy Secretary\u2019s approval for first  class travel and that she would attempt to limit premium class travel to  instances in which less expensive alternatives were not available.", "Frequent traveler #5 was a GS-15 in the Navy who took 11 first class  flights totaling over $35,000 from San Diego to east coast cities including  Washington, D.C., during fiscal years 2001 and 2002. The traveler  justified the 11 flights based on a certification from a medical authority  based on his size and medical condition. However, because his first  class travel was not authorized by the Under Secretary of the Navy, as  required by Navy regulations, we contacted the traveler to obtain further  information on his condition. We estimate that the total cost of these  flights if all flown in coach class would have been about $7,000.

However, sometimes the justification provided did not  appear applicable to the trip in question. For example, during a 12-day  period in late August 2001, the traveler flew business class from  Washington, D.C., to six European cities and South Africa at a cost of  over $8,800. He then flew business class from South Africa to Atlanta,  and first class from Atlanta to Washington, D.C. The documentation  supporting the trip was an order, signed by the military assistant to the  under secretary, that authorized the traveler to fly first class from  Washington, D.C., to Tampa, Florida\u2014destinations that are different  from the itinerary in question.

Further, as discussed in the examples, we identified several anomalies in  the application of medical condition justification, as evidenced by travelers  who used both coach and premium class accommodations during flights of  similar duration and during the same period. This may indicate that  additional steps should be taken to verify the validity of the medical  certification. During testing, an Army official at the Traffic Management  Office informed us that his office forwards all medical certifications to the  Surgeon General for an opinion before recommending to the Secretary of  the Army that approval be granted for first class travel.

Specifically, DOD Directive 4500.9 grants blanket authority for high- ranking officials to use premium class travel when traveling overseas on  official government business. This policy contradicts and is less  stringent than the FTR, which does not cite rank as a condition for  obtaining premium class travel. The JTR and JFTR (both modified in  2003) also do not cite rank as a criterion for allowing business class  travel for international flights. Further, DOD\u2019s General Counsel staff told  us this provision was superseded by DOD Directive 4500.56.", "GSA\u2019s FTR authorizes agencies to approve the use of first class or  business class accommodations when required by an agency\u2019s mission,  but neither the JTR nor the JFTR adopts this authorization.

In contrast, DOD\u2019s JTR and JFTR that were in effect at the time of  our audit did not indicate whether a rest period upon arrival at the duty  station prohibited the authorization of premium class travel. Both DOD  directives on travel (4500.9 and 4500.56) do not directly address whether  premium class travel is allowed if the flight exceeds 14 hours. Further,  the services\u2019 implementing guidance is inconsistent in its application of  the 14-hour rule.

Because we followed a probability  procedure based on random selections, our sample is only one of a large  number of samples that we might have drawn. Since each sample could  have provided different estimates, we express our confidence in the  precision of our particular sample's estimates as 95 percent confidence  intervals (e.g., plus or minus 7 percentage points). These are intervals that  would contain the actual population value for 95 percent of the samples we  could have drawn. As a result, we are 95 percent confident that each of the  confidence intervals in this report will include the true values in the study  population. All percentage estimates from the sample of premium class air  travel have sampling errors (confidence interval widths) of plus or minus  9 percentage points or less. Table 5 and table 6 summarize the population  of DOD airline travel transactions containing at least one premium class leg  charged to DOD\u2019s centrally billed accounts in fiscal years 2001 and 2002  and the subpopulation subjected to testing.", "In addition to our audit of a DOD-wide statistical sample of transactions,  we also selected other transactions identified by our data mining efforts for  audit. Our data mining identified individuals who frequently flew using first  or business class accommodations, frequent trips to one location, and trips  involving family travel. For data mining transactions, we also requested  that DOD provide us the travel order, travel voucher, travel itinerary, and  any other supporting documentation that could provide evidence that the  premium class travel was properly authorized and justified in accordance  with DOD policies. If the additional documentation provided indicated that  the transactions were proper and valid, we did not pursue further  documentation of those transactions. If the additional documentation was  not provided or if it indicated further issues related to the transactions, we  obtained and reviewed additional documentation or information about  these transactions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Control Environment", "paragraphs": ["To assess the overall control environment for premium class travel, we  obtained an understanding of the travel process, including authorization of  premium class travel, by interviewing officials from the Department of the  Army, Department of the Navy, Department of the Air Force, and Defense  Finance and Accounting Service. We reviewed applicable policies and  procedures and program guidance that they provided. We visited two Army  units, three Navy units, three Air Force units, and two Marine Corps units  to gain an understanding of the travel process, including the management  of premium class travel. We used as our primary criteria applicable laws  and regulations, including GSA\u2019s Federal Travel Regulation and DOD\u2019s  Joint Travel Regulations and Joint Federal Travel Regulations. We also  used as criteria our Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government and our Guide to Evaluating and Testing Controls Over  Sensitive Payments.

If the traveler determines that he or she needs  premium class travel, the traveler submits the travel request, along with  justification for premium travel, to his or her supervisor for approval. Once  the supervisor reviews the travel request, along with the required  supporting documentation, such as a doctor\u2019s note supporting a specific  physical condition and the necessity for premium travel, it is forwarded to  the official who signs the order. For first class travel, the secretary within  the military service or a designee reviews the request and justification for  first class travel for consistency with DOD regulations. In the case of  premium class other than first class transportation, the local transportation  officer or other appropriate authority reviews the request and justification.", "The order-signing official reviews the travel request and documentation  and determines if there is adequate support for the premium travel. If the  travel is properly supported and justified, then the premium class travel is  approved and the official signs the travel request to generate a travel order.  If adequate support does not exist for the class of travel requested, then the  request for premium travel is denied.", "The travel order is issued, signed by the official, and delivered to the  government travel office (GTO), or the commercial travel office (CTO)acting on behalf of the government. Either the GTO or CTO verifies the  existence of documentation and checks for an authorizing signature. The  CTO then issues the premium class ticket and charges the centrally billed  account. The CTO is not supposed to use the centrally billed account to  purchase a premium class ticket until the traveler or the official provides  the CTO with a signed travel order authorizing the premium class travel.
