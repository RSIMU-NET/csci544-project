U.S. military forces provide security for those Department of Defense (DOD) civilians and contractors who directly support the combat mission. In Iraq, the Department of State and other federal agencies contract with several private security providers to protect their employees. Under their contracts, contractors rebuilding Iraq are responsible for providing their own security and have done so by awarding subcontracts to private security providers. As of December 2004, the agencies and contractors we reviewed had obligated more than $766 million for private security providers. The contractors' efforts to obtain suitable security providers met with mixed results, as they often found that their security provider could not meet their needs. Overall, GAO found that contractors replaced their initial security providers on more than half the 2003 contracts it reviewed. Contractor officials attributed this turnover to various factors, including the absence of useful agency guidance. While the U.S. military and private security providers have developed a cooperative working relationship, actions should be taken to improve its effectiveness. The relationship between the military and private security providers is one of coordination, not control. Prior to October 2004 coordination was informal, based on personal contacts, and was inconsistent. In October 2004 a Reconstruction Operations Center was opened to share intelligence and coordinate military-contractor interactions. While military and security providers agreed that coordination has improved, two problems remain. First, private security providers continue to report incidents between themselves and the military when approaching military convoys and checkpoints. Second, military units deploying to Iraq are not fully aware of the parties operating on the complex battle space in Iraq and what responsibility they have to those parties. Despite the significant role played by private security providers in enabling reconstruction efforts, neither the Department of State, nor DOD nor the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) have complete data on the costs of using private security providers. Even at the contract level, the agencies generally had only limited information readily available, even though agency and contractor officials acknowledged that these costs had diverted a considerable amount of reconstruction resources and led to canceling or reducing the scope of some projects. For example, in March 2005, two task orders for reconstruction worth nearly $15 million were cancelled to help pay for security at a power plant. GAO found that the cost to obtain private security providers and security-related equipment accounted for more than 15 percent of contract costs on 8 of the 15 reconstruction contracts it reviewed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United States is spending billions of dollars to reconstruct Iraq while at  the same time is engaged in combating an insurgency that has targeted  military personnel, contractors, and the Iraqi people.  According to the  Department of Defense (DOD) and other sources, as of June 1, 2005, more  than 1,600 U.S. and coalition military forces and 200 contractor personnel  have been killed since major combat operations ended in May 2003.  This  uncertain security environment created a need for U.S. government  agencies and contractors involved in rebuilding Iraq to obtain substantially  more security services than is normally the case when operating in other  countries.  Creating a democratic Iraq and rebuilding its infrastructure is a  U.S. national security and foreign policy priority, and, even without the  need for enhanced security, is a challenging and complex effort.", "Prior to the conflict, DOD and the U.S. government agencies responsible  for the reconstruction of Iraq believed that reconstruction would take place  in an environment with little threat from insurgents or terrorists.  By June  2003 the security situation in Iraq began to worsen and it became clear in  August 2003, with the bombing of the United Nations complex, that  insurgents were targeting nonmilitary targets.  The killings of four U.S.  citizens working for a U.S. security provider in Iraq in March 2004 and the  allegations of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison resulted in significant  congressional concern over the use of private security providers in Iraq  and raised a number of operational, legal, and contracting questions.", "Because of the broad level of interest by Congress in issues dealing with  Iraq, the Comptroller General initiated this review under his statutory  authority.  Specifically, we evaluated the extent to which (1) U.S.  government agencies and contractors working in Iraq have acquired  security services from private providers; (2) the U.S. military and private  security providers in Iraq have developed a cooperative working  relationship; and (3) U.S. government agencies assessed the costs  associated with using private security providers on reconstruction  contracts.  Additionally, we assessed the impact of the increased use of  private security providers on attrition in key military skills.", "To identify the rules and regulations governing and assigning responsibility  for protecting government and contractor personnel working in Iraq, we  reviewed policies, regulations, instructions, guidance, and orders issued by  DOD, the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), and other DOD  components relating to the use of contractors during wartime; orders and  policies issued by the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) regarding  contractor operations in Iraq; and Department of State policies regarding  the protection of U.S. government employees working abroad, including  the Foreign Affairs Manual.  We also interviewed military officials who had  been stationed in Iraq as well as selected private security providers to  understand their responsibilities and collaborative working relationship in  Iraq.  To understand the process by which contractors obtained private  security providers, we selected 16 reconstruction contracts using a non- probabilistic methodology that considered such factors as the awarding  agency; the year awarded; the contract\u2019s expected dollar value; and the  type, nature and location of the reconstruction activity.  These 16 contracts  were awarded by various DOD components, including the U.S. Army Corps  of Engineers; the Department of State; and the U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID).  Nine of these contracts were  awarded in 2003 and 7 were awarded in 2004.  As of December 2004, the  agencies had obligated about $8.6 billion on these contracts. We also  obtained and reviewed six contracts that had been awarded the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers, the Department of State, USAID, and by Army  activities on behalf of the CPA for the protection of their personnel and  facilities in Iraq.  We then compared the type of security-related  requirements incorporated within U.S. government contracts with those  incorporated into contracts awarded to prime reconstruction contractors  and, in turn, to subcontracts with security providers.  We interviewed  agency and contractor officials, reviewed agency guidance provided to the  contractors, reviewed the reconstruction contracts and security  subcontracts, and analyzed the vouchers and other billing information  submitted by the reconstruction contractors and security providers.  To  assess the impact on military attrition caused by the use of private security  providers we obtained and analyzed DOD attrition data and spoke with  private security providers and representatives of the U.S. Special  Operations Command and the military services. We determined that the  information and data discussed in this report were sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of the report.  Appendix I contains more detail on our scope  and methodology.

This body of law considers contractors who  deploy with the force generally to be noncombatant civilians  accompanying the force who may not take a direct part in hostilities.   CENTCOM is concerned that using armed private security employees to  protect clearly military activities would risk a change in status for these  contractors from noncombatants to illegal combatants.

During a discussion with DOD we were told that  this expectation was based on determinations made at the most senior  levels of the executive branch and the contracting officials were bound to  reflect that expectation in their requests for proposals. Consequently, they  made few or no plans for any other condition. Reconstruction contractors  shared this perspective, relying upon the language in the agency requests  for proposals and the comments of agency representatives at pre-proposal  and other meetings.  Our discussions with contractor officials found that  they anticipated providing for only a minimal level of security under their  contracts, such as hiring guards to prevent theft and looting at residential  and work sites. In one case, the contractor expected that the military would  provide security for its personnel.", "Our review of the agencies\u2019 request for proposals and other documents  found that they were consistent with this expectation.  For example, our  review of five contracts awarded by late July 2003, including four awarded  by USAID and one awarded by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, found  that    USAID\u2019s requests for proposals instructed the contractors that work  was to begin only when a permissive environment existed. Contractors  were given little guidance concerning security for their personnel and  facilities and were not asked to estimate security costs as part of their  proposals.", "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 request for proposal noted that the  military was expected to provide security for the contractor and, thus,  the contractor was not required to propose any security costs.", "According to agency and contractor officials, the Iraqi security  environment began to deteriorate by June 2003, although two contractors  noted that the bombing of the United Nations compound in August 2003  made it apparent that the insurgency was beginning to target nonmilitary  targets (see figure 2).", "Contractor officials told us that as the security environment worsened they  unexpectedly found themselves in immediate need of enhanced security  services.  These officials told us that they received little guidance from the  agencies relative to possible security providers.  We found that the  contractors\u2019 efforts to obtain security providers often met with mixed  results.  For example:  One contractor, awarded a contract by the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers, expected that the U.S. military would provide security for its  personnel.  That contractor expressed concern, however, that the  military protection being provided was insufficient to ensure its  employees\u2019 safety and to allow for the performance of its mission and  subsequently stopped work at one of its locations.  In June 2003, the  Army finally told the contractor that it did not have adequate forces to  continue to provide security as promised, and advised the contractor to  acquire its own security. Following a limited competition, the  contractor awarded a subcontract to a security provider in June 2003.  In  this case, the contractor has been satisfied with the services provided  and retained the security provider when the contractor was  subsequently awarded another reconstruction contract in June 2004.", "One USAID reconstruction contractor told us it quickly awarded a non- competitive subcontract to a security provider in July 2003.  Within  three months, the security company notified the reconstruction  contractor that it was pulling its employees out of the country.  As a  former prisoner-transport service firm trying to expand into the  protective services area, it discovered it lacked sufficient capacity to  fulfill its contract requirements in Iraq.  The reconstruction contractor  subsequently conducted a competition among security providers  already operating in Iraq to meet its needs.", "Another reconstruction contractor initially hired a security service  provider in October 2003. A contractor official stated that it soon  became apparent that the security provider did not have the capacity to  meet its security needs.  As a result, the contractor awarded another  subcontract, on a sole-source basis, to a security provider to augment  the security services provided to its personnel.", "Three of the reconstruction contractors we reviewed hired a newly  established security provider company that was marketing itself in Iraq  in mid- to late 2003. Officials representing one contractor told us that the  provider was the only known provider capable of meeting their needs;  officials for another contractor told us that they selected the provider  based, in part, on its reputation.  Each of the contractors, however, for  various reasons, replaced the security provider.  Subsequently, this  security provider has been suspended from receiving further  government contracts due to allegations of fraudulent billing practices.", "Overall, we found that five of the eight reconstruction contractors that  were awarded contracts in 2003 that we reviewed replaced their initial or  second security provider with another company, while in other cases, the  contractors needed to augment the security services provided by their  initial provider.  As shown in figure 3, two contractors have awarded up to  four contracts for security services.", "Contractor officials attributed this turnover to various factors, including  the urgent need to obtain security, the increasing threat level, their lack of  knowledge of potential sources and the security market, and the absence of  useful agency guidance.  In this latter regard, the detailed standards and  requirements in their own agency security contracts may have provided  useful assistance to reconstruction contractors in identifying potential  criteria for evaluating security providers and in structuring their  subcontracts.  For example, the USAID security services contract, awarded  in August 2003, contained  a detailed and required organization structure to be used by the  contractor, with titles, duties and responsibilities of various levels of  security providers specified;   requirements for background checks on potential employees and  provisions for agency approval and acceptance of those employees;   detailed standards of conduct for contractor employees;   language, health, and training requirements;   weapons capability requirements; and  instructions regarding providing armored vehicles.", "Our review of five other agency security contracts awarded directly to  private security providers from December 2003 through May 2004 for the  protection of agency personnel in Iraq found that, to varying degrees, most  of the cited areas were addressed.

They discussed the  possibility of a qualified vendors list, or, if time permitted, the  establishment of a multiple award schedule of qualified security providers,  which contractors could use to quickly contract for their security needs  through competitive task orders.", "Agency officials believed that information regarding personnel  qualifications and competent providers could be made available to  contractor personnel in future efforts, especially if the information was  provided for the contractor\u2019s consideration, rather than being a contract  requirement. For example, one agency official noted that his agency\u2019s  requests for proposals for security services are publicly available.  Some  officials believed that making information a contractual requirement would  infringe upon the contractor\u2019s privity of contract with its subcontractors  and might pose a potential government liability should such requirements  later prove inadequate.

This authority allows the commander to establish  the rules and regulations in effect at each installation.

When a private security provider  arrived in a unit\u2019s area of operation, the security provider would try to meet  with key officials of the unit and establish a relationship. A private security  provider we spoke with told us that the results of this informal  coordination varied based on the individual personalities of the military  and provider personnel.  According to some security providers, although  many military commanders were very interested in establishing a  relationship with the security providers, others were not.  Additionally,  coordination was inconsistent.  For example, one officer who had served  with the 4th Infantry Division in Iraq told us that coordination in his area  was mixed.  According to the officer, some security providers, such as the  one providing security for the Iraqi currency exchange program, would  always coordinate with the division before moving through the division\u2019s  area of operations but another contractor rarely coordinated with the  division.  This is similar to information we obtained from officials of the  2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment.  One officer from one of the regiment\u2019s  squadrons told us that contractors that worked within the unit\u2019s area of  operation generally coordinated with the regiment while those who were  traveling in or through his unit\u2019s area of operation generally did not  coordinate with the regiment.  He also told us that on one occasion security  providers escorted the CPA administrator into their area of operation  without the squadron\u2019s knowledge and while the squadron was conducting  an operation in Najaf.

Another officer, who served on the  Combined Joint Task Force-7 staff, told of instances when contractors  died and the division commander did not know that the contractors were  operating in his area of operations until he was instructed to recover the  bodies.  Finally, according to a military officer serving with the PCO at the  time of our review, the genesis of the Reconstruction Operations Center  (ROC) (discussed next) was the need to improve coordination between  contractors and the major subordinate commanders.", "The ROC serves as the interface between the military and the contractors  in Iraq and is located within the PCO.  In May 2004, the Army awarded a  contract to a private security provider to provide security for PCO  personnel and to operate the ROC, shown in figure 4.  The goal of the ROC,  which became operational in October 2004, is to provide situational  awareness, develop a common operating picture for contractors and the  military, and facilitate coordination between the military and contractors.", "The national ROC is located in Baghdad and six regional centers are co- located with the military\u2019s major subordinate commands, to enhance  coordination between the military and the private security providers.   Figure 5 shows the locations of the regional centers.", "Participation in the ROC is voluntary (although some DOD officials told us  that participation should be mandatory) and is open (at no cost) to all U.S.  government agencies, contractors, and nongovernmental organizations  operating in Iraq.  The ROC and the regional centers are staffed with a  combination of military, U.S. government civilian, and contractor personnel  who provide a number of services for private security providers and others.   Among the services the ROC provides are:  Intelligence information.  The military provides unclassified intelligence  information to the ROC for dissemination to contractors.  Intelligence  information is updated daily and information is available on a password- protected Web site and through daily intelligence briefings.  In addition,  contractors can request specific threat assessments on future building  sites and planned vehicle routes.  Contractors use the ROC to pass on  information about incidents and threats to coalition forces as well.", "Military assistance.  The ROC serves as the 911 for contractors who  need military assistance.  Contractors who need assistance contact  either the national ROC or the regional ROCs and ROC personnel  contact the closest military unit and ask it to provide assistance.   Assistance, such as a quick reaction force or medical assistance, is  provided if military assets are available.  Security providers we spoke  with said that they rarely call for a quick reaction force because  incidents with insurgents are usually over within a matter of minutes but  on some occasions the quick reaction forces have proved to be very  helpful.  For example, one after action report described an incident in  February 2005 in which a private security team was ambushed by 20  insurgents and attacked by small arms fire and three rocket-propelled  grenades.  The contractors contacted both the regional ROC in Mosul  and the national ROC in Baghdad.  The military responded with fixed  wing assets within 15 minutes and a rotary wing quick reaction force  escorted the team safely back to Mosul.  Contractors more frequently  receive medical assistance from the military and described the  assistance they received as excellent.  Figure 6 depicts the process used  to request assistance through the ROC or the regional ROCs.", "Improved communications.  Communications with the military can be  difficult in Iraq because of a lack of radio interoperability between the  military and contractors.  The ROC facilitates communications between  the military and contractors.  First, the ROC provides contact numbers  for the military to private security providers to use when they are  moving around in Iraq.  Second, the ROC will ensure that the military is  aware of contractor movements.  Security providers who so choose can  provide the ROC with information on convoy movements, which the  ROC will forward to the appropriate military commands.  Third, the  ROC can contact the military to provide assistance to contractors, and  finally, the ROC can track convoys through a real-time tracking system  that uses the global positioning system and includes a communications  link with the ROC if assistance is needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Coordination Problems Remain between Private Security Providers and the U.S. Military", "paragraphs": ["While security providers, reconstruction contractors, and military  representatives of the PCO believe that the ROC has improved  coordination on the complex battle space in Iraq, both the private security  providers and the military believe that several coordination issues remain  to be resolved.

Blue on white violence is  the term used by contractors and the military to describe situations when  the military fires at friendly forces (such as contractors) or, as happens less  frequently, when private security employees fire at military forces.  An  analysis of incident reports completed by the ROC indicates that these  incidents happen most frequently when contractors encounter a military  checkpoint or a military convoy.  Private security providers have told us  that they are fired upon by U.S. forces so frequently that incident reports  are not always filed with the ROC.  According to some incident reports filed  with the ROC, some contractors believe that U.S. forces have fired on  private security provider vehicles without provocation.  For example, one  security company official reported that his convoy was traveling on a route  in Iraq when a U.S. military convoy approached.  According to the report,  the security convoy identified itself using generally recognized  identification procedures and pulled off the road to allow the military  convoy to pass.  After about half of the 20-vehicle convoy had passed, a  gunner in the military convoy began firing at the security convoy.   According to the after incident report filed with the ROC, no injuries or  damage resulted from this incident.  A similar incident happened on the  road from the International Zone to the Baghdad airport.  As in the previous  incident, part of a U.S. military convoy passed the private security convoy  without incident when a gunner in the fourth vehicle of the convoy began  to fire at the lead vehicle in the private security convoy.  After this incident,  the private security team leader received an apology from the  servicemember who had fired on the security company vehicle.  As a result  of this incident, the company\u2019s vehicle was rendered unserviceable.", "In another incident report, a private security provider documented an  incident at a U.S. military checkpoint.  According to the report, a security  convoy had slowed to approach the checkpoint, and was then fired on by a  U.S. soldier.  The report went on to say that no verbal or hand warnings  were given and no reason was given for the shooting.  According to  representatives of the security providers and the former director of  security for the PCO, many of these incidents happen because of the  military\u2019s concerns over insurgents using vehicle-borne improvised  explosive devices, as well as the inexperience of some U.S. troops.", "Reducing the number of blue on white incidents is a high priority for the  U.S. military, the PCO, private security providers, and the Private Security  Company Association of Iraq, a Baghdad--based association that works  with both the U.S. government and the Iraqi government to resolve issues  related to private security providers.  In late December 2004, in an effort to  reduce the number of blue on white incidents, the Multi National Corps- Iraq (MNC-I) issued an order to major subordinate commands in Iraq  establishing procedures for private security providers to use when  approaching military convoys and military checkpoints.  MNC-I directed  the subordinate commanders to implement the procedures detailed in the  order and to educate all private security providers and military on the  procedures.  Among the procedures were (1) a prohibition on nontactical  vehicles (such as the vehicles used by private security providers) passing  moving military convoys; (2) a requirement that warning shots, when fired,  be aimed away from a vehicle and demonstrate a clear intention to do harm  if directions are not obeyed; and (3) a requirement that vehicles should  maintain a distance of a least 200 meters from a military convoy.", "In early 2005, MNC-I completed an analysis of friendly-fire incidents that  occurred between November 1, 2004 and January 25, 2005 to determine the  top 10 lessons learned from such incidents.  Among the top 10 lessons was  the need for U.S. forces to comply with the rules of engagement, which  require that U.S. troops determine that a person\u2019s intent is hostile before  the military uses deadly force.  The other lessons learned were similar to  the procedures included in the order.  According to a PCO official, the top  10 list was provided to the private security providers.", "Despite the MNC-I order, blue on white incidents continue to occur and  security providers remain concerned about the frequency of the attacks. In  the 5 months (January to May 2005) since the order was issued, the ROC  has received reports on 20 blue on white incidents and the number of  actual incidents is likely to be higher since, as we noted previously, some  providers no longer report these types of incidents.  Data on the number of  incidents for the 5 months before the order was issued was not available  because the ROC did not start collecting information on blue on white  incidents until November 2004.  A ROC official noted that blue on white  incidents had decreased in April 2005.  He believed that the reduction was  due, in part, to the adoption of the procedures outlined in the order.   However, he also noted that the number of incidents could increase again  as troops rotate in and out of Iraq or if terrorist attacks increase."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Units Do Not Receive Specific Training or Guidance about Working with Private Security Providers before Deploying", "paragraphs": ["Military units that deployed to Iraq received no guidance or training  regarding the relationship between private security providers and the  military prior to deploying.

Furthermore, a representative of a unit that is preparing to deploy, the 101st  Airborne Division, told us that it had not received any guidance on how to  work with private security providers nor had it been directed to include  information on private security providers, the PCO, or the ROC in its pre- deployment training, even though the 101st will be co-located with a  regional ROC.  To highlight the lack of training and guidance,  representatives from one unit told us that they did not know there were  private security providers in their battle space until the providers began  calling for assistance.

For example, the quarterly report submitted by the  Department of State to Congress on the status of reconstruction projects  and funding does not provide information on security costs that are  incurred under reconstruction contracts.  Even at the contract level, the  agencies generally had varying degrees of information on the costs  associated with private security providers.  On 15 reconstruction contracts  we found that the cost to obtain private security providers and security- related equipment at the reconstruction contract level can be considerable,  as it accounted for 15 percent or more on 8 of the 15 contracts we  reviewed; on only 4 of those 8 contracts, however, did the agencies  formally track security costs under a separate task order or contract line  item.

For example, in its April 2005 report, the  State Department noted that nearly $1.3 billion in funding has been, or will  be, used  in part to (1) cover unanticipated post-battle reconstruction costs,  (2) cover indirect cost increases of contractors operating on cost-plus  contracts that allow them to continue billing even during delays, and  (3) account for increased security costs.  The reports, however, do not  identify the magnitude or impact of the costs associated with security  providers on reconstruction efforts or available funding.  Discussions with  DOD and USAID personnel found that the financial and management  information systems used to help prepare the report are not able to track  costs incurred by reconstruction contractors for security services.  Agency  officials noted that to obtain such information would currently require the  agencies to request such information from the contractors and manually  prepare the information.  Agency officials noted they have made inquiries  on an ad hoc basis in the past, but cautioned that such requests can be  burdensome for both the contractors and agency officials.", "Contractor officials acknowledge that the cost of private security services  and security-related equipment, such as armored vehicles, has exceeded  what they originally envisioned.  In some cases, increased security costs  resulted in reducing or canceling the scope of some reconstruction  projects.  For example:  Contractor officials noted they were originally tasked to rehabilitate 23  electrical substations and had conducted site surveys and procured  equipment for all 23 substations.  According to contractor officials,  however, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers concluded that securing 14  of the substations would not be cost effective, and therefore reduced the  scope to 9 substations.  Contractor officials indicated that the  equipment and materials procured for the 14 substations have been or  will be turned over to the Iraqi Ministry of Electricity.", "In February 2004, USAID obligated an additional $33 million on one of  its contracts to pay for unanticipated increases in security costs that left  it short of funds to pay for construction oversight and quality assurance,  as well as fund administrative costs.", "In March 2005, USAID cancelled two electrical power generation-related  task orders totaling nearly $15 million to help pay for increased security  costs being incurred at another power generation project in southern  Baghdad.", "Contractor officials noted, however, that other factors also affected  reconstruction progress, such as changes in priorities or higher material  costs.  For example, officials at one contractor noted that security had not  been a significant factor delaying their work; rather, they pointed to delays  in reviewing and approving projects and slower than anticipated release of  funding.  Similarly, USAID officials noted that, among other materials, the  cost of concrete is significantly higher than anticipated, driving up the cost  of many reconstruction projects.", "We found that at the contract level, agency personnel did not have  consistent insight into security costs and their impact on reconstruction  efforts. For example, agencies often did not require prospective bidders to  propose meaningful security costs as part of their contract cost proposal  nor require contractors to prepare a baseline security cost estimate at the  time of contract award.  Many of the contracts, including those awarded  after the security environment began to deteriorate, were indefinite  delivery contracts, in which the work to be accomplished was often  described in general terms, with the specific work to be accomplished  determined as task orders are issued.  In several cases, agency personnel  provided prospective contractors a sample task order to use in preparing  their proposals.  While the contractors\u2019 cost and technical proposals  described how they would approach security issues and provided an  associated cost estimate, such estimates were only for evaluation purposes  and did not reflect meaningful security costs. Overall, in only 3 of the 16  contracts we reviewed did contractors prepare an initial security cost  estimate for the entire contract.", "Further, we found that in only 7 of the 16 contracts did the contractors  regularly provide security-related cost information in either monthly  progress reports or in separate contract line items or task orders.  The level  of information and insight provided varied greatly depending on the  approach taken.  For example, on three contracts, the contractor provided  security cost-related information for each of its projects, but did not  provide information at the total contract level.  In one contract, security  costs were reported on both the task order and contract level.  In one  contract, the security cost information was reported under a separate  contract line item with other expenses, and visibility was more limited.  In  the remaining two contracts, the agency established separate task orders  specifically to track security-related expenses at the contract level.", "In 15 of the 16 reconstruction contracts that we reviewed, we were able to  obtain data on the costs of acquiring private security services and related  security equipment by reviewing invoices that private security providers  and security equipment providers submitted to contractors. Our analysis of  this data found that at the reconstruction contract level there was  considerable variation in estimated security costs as a percentage of total  contract billings (see figure 7).  Eight of the 15 contracts had security  costs that exceeded 15 percent of total contract billings as of December 31,  2004; on 4 contracts, the percentage of contract billings accounted for by  the cost of security subcontractors was more than 25 percent.  On only 2  of those 8 contracts in which security costs exceeded 15 percent did  agency personnel require the contractors to formally track and report  security costs under a separate task order or contract line item.  Though  not required, one contractor reported incurred security costs on two  contracts on its own initiative.", "While our analysis indicates that at the reconstruction contract level the  cost of obtaining private security services can account for a significant  percentage of the contract\u2019s total cost, it does not reflect total private  security costs.  For example, reconstruction contractors did not always  specifically track security-related costs incurred by their subcontractors or  lower tier suppliers.  According to contractor officials, in seven of the  sixteen reconstruction contracts that we reviewed, at least one of their  subcontractors provided for their own private security; in five of those  seven contracts, all of the subcontractors were required to provide for their  own security.  The cost for a subcontractor to obtain private security  services can be considerable.  For example, in one case, the costs incurred  by a major subcontractor amounted to almost $10 million, or nearly one- third of what the reconstruction contractor was paying for security. In  another case, the costs incurred by a major subcontractor exceeded $3.5  million, or about 8 percent of what the reconstruction contractor was  paying for security.", "Our analysis and discussions with agency and contractor officials identified  several factors that influenced security costs, including (1) the nature and  location of the work; (2) the type of security required and the security  approach taken; and (3) the degree to which the military provided the  contractor security services. For example, projects that took place in a  fixed, static location were generally less expensive to secure than a project  that extended over a large geographic location, such as electrical  transmission lines. In other cases, contractors relied on former military  personnel or other highly-trained professionals to provide security to their  employees.  Conversely, some contractors made more extensive use of  local Iraqi labor and employed less costly Iraqi security guards. Lastly,  some contractors were able to make use of security provided by the U.S.  military or coalition forces. For example, several contractors had facilities  within or near U.S.-controlled locations, such as Baghdad\u2019s International  Zone or on military bases, which reduced their need to obtain private  security services. In another case, the contractor was provided a limited  degree of protection by the U.S. Army.", "Agency and contractor officials had mixed opinions on the value of  establishing separate reporting or tracking mechanisms.  For example,  some agency officials believed that having visibility into security-related  costs enabled them to provide more effective contract oversight, and  identify security cost trends and their impact on the project. Other officials  noted that many factors affect the cost and progress of reconstruction  efforts, including changes in planned funding or projects, material costs,  and the inability to find qualified workers willing to work in Iraq.   Consequently, they indicated that they generally try to manage the projects  at a total project level, rather than by individual elements, such as security.   For example, they noted that when reviewing project status reports with  the contractors, they will question the contractors on the factors causing  delays or cost increases.  They were not certain that having specific insight  into security costs would help them better manage or oversee their  projects.  Agency program and financial management officials noted that  from a budgeting perspective, tracking security cost information could  enable staff to provide better estimates of future funding requirements.", "Contractor officials generally indicated that establishing a separate task  order or contract line item for security enabled them to more efficiently  account for and bill security costs and to more accurately report  reconstruction progress.  For example, officials at one contractor noted  that they often had several projects under way which required security.   Prior to establishing a separate task order, the security provider would be  required to allocate costs to each of the projects even though the security  was provided for a given location, often resulting in lengthy and complex  vouchers, higher potential for error, and increased administrative  expenses.  Once a separate task order was established, its security provider  charged the costs incurred for providing security to the location, rather  than each project, simplifying the billing and review process.  Other  contractor officials noted that the need to obtain security providers and  security-related equipment often occurred during the early stages of the  contract when the agencies had issued only a few task orders for specific  reconstruction projects.  Consequently, contractor officials told us they  found themselves incurring considerable security-related expenses during  the mobilization phase that had to be allocated to subsequent task orders,  thereby increasing costs. These officials noted that allocating security  costs to existing task orders would have resulted in the task\u2019s cost  exceeding the government\u2019s estimate. Contractor officials indicated that a  separate task order for security would have enabled them to better explain  to agency personnel the cost of the reconstruction effort and the impact of  security costs and enable them to account for and bill security costs more  efficiently."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Expanded Use of Private Security Providers Does Not Appear to Be Increasing Attrition among Military Personnel", "paragraphs": ["Data from the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) show that in  fiscal year 2004, the attrition rates for the occupational specialties  preferred by private security providers returned to the same or slightly  lower levels than those seen prior to the institution of occupational stop  losses in September 2001 despite the increased use of private security  providers.

Continuation rates were calculated by determining which  personnel remained on active duty from one year to the next and are an  alternative method used to demonstrate retention and attrition.  The  continuation rates showed an increase in losses in 2004 for the Army  Special Operations and Navy Special Warfare Commands senior  noncommissioned officers, as well as Army Special Operations warrant  officers.  Similar to the DMDC data provided to us, these commands also  saw a decrease in losses (or a decrease in attrition rates) in 2002 after a  stop loss was issued and, with the exception of the Navy Special Warfare  warrant officers, an increase in losses (or an increase in attrition rates)  after the stop loss was lifted.", "Additionally, as shown in figure 10, the continuation data for Army Enlisted  Special Operations personnel with 14 through 19 years of service separated  at only a slightly higher rate in 2004 than in the pre-stop loss years \u2014 fiscal  years 2000 and 2001.  In the July 2004 hearing before the House Armed  Services Committee, Subcommittee on Terrorism, Unconventional Threats  and Capabilities, the Senior Enlisted Advisor for the United States Special  Operations Command stated that the loss of these mature, operationally  experienced personnel creates critical operational risk for the Special  Forces.  According to the Special Operations Command officials with  whom we spoke, because the command is losing some of its most  experienced personnel, younger less experienced servicemembers are  being promoted to leadership positions more quickly than in the past.  This  need to rely on less experienced personnel has created some concerns for  the command."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Factors Influence the Decision to Separate from the Military", "paragraphs": ["While available data indicate that attrition, in almost all of the military  specialties favored by private security providers, has returned to pre- September 11, 2001 levels, the data do not indicate why personnel are  leaving the military and what they are doing after they leave.

Officials at  the Army Human Resources Command told us that after September 11,  2001, the opportunities for employment in the security field became more  widespread as government agencies as well as private companies and  organizations recognized the need to improve their security.  These officials  as well as officials from the Special Operations Command noted that they  are losing personnel not only to private security firms operating in Iraq but  also to security management companies operating in the United States, and  security operations in other government agencies.

The extensive use of private security  providers has raised a number of issues, particularly regarding how to  facilitate methods contractors use to obtain capable providers.  And, once  security providers are actively working in an area, they must determine  how best to establish effective coordination mechanisms with nearby  military forces.  While the experience in Iraq was certainly unique relative  to historical reconstruction and assistance efforts, it is far less certain  whether or not the future will find the United States engaged in  reconstruction and assistance efforts in other hostile environments with  costs that are likely to be significant.  Much has been learned in Iraq over  the past two years on this subject that can serve the United States and its  contractors well in planning for and executing future reconstruction or  assistance efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making four recommendations to address a number of immediate  and long term issues:   To assist contractors operating in hostile environments in obtaining  security services required to ensure successful contract execution, we  recommend that the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and  the Administrator, U.S. Agency for International Development, explore  options that would enable contractors to obtain such services quickly  and efficiently.  Such options may include, for example, identifying  minimum standards for private security personnel qualifications,  training requirements and other key performance characteristics that  private security personnel should possess; establishing qualified vendor  lists; and/or establishing contracting vehicles which contractors could  be authorized to use.", "To ensure that MNF-I has a clear understanding of the reasons for blue  on white violence, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct  the Combatant Commander, U.S. Central Command, to direct the  Commander, MNF-I, to further assess all of the blue on white incidents  to determine if the procedures outlined in the December 2004 order are  sufficient.  Furthermore, if the procedures have not proven to be  effective, we recommend that the Commander, MNF-I, develop  additional procedures to protect both U.S. military forces and private  security providers.", "To ensure that commanders deploying to Iraq have a clear  understanding of the role of private security providers in Iraq and the  support the military provides to them, we recommend that the Secretary  of Defense develop a training package for units deploying to Iraq which  provides information on the Reconstruction Operations Center, typical  private security provider operating procedures, any guidance or  procedures developed by MNF-I or MNC-I applicable to private security  providers (such as procedures outlined in the December 2004 order to  reduce blue on white incidents), and DOD support to private security  provider employees.  The training package should be re-evaluated  periodically and updated as necessary to reflect the dynamic nature of  the situation in Iraq.", "To improve agencies\u2019 ability to assess the impact of and manage security  costs in future reconstruction efforts, we recommend that the Secretary  of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the Administrator, U.S. Agency  for International Development, establish a means to track and account  for security costs to develop more accurate budget estimates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD, the Department of State and USAID provided written comments on a  draft of this report.  Their comments are discussed below and are reprinted  in appendixes II, III, and IV, respectively.", "DOD concurred with each of our recommendations, noting that it  welcomed our assistance in improving how DOD and its contractors can  plan for and effectively execute contracts in a complex and changeable  security environment. Moreover, DOD described the steps it would take to  implement some of our recommendations.", "The Department of State disagreed with our recommendation to explore  options to assist contractors in obtaining private security services, citing  concerns that the government could be held liable for performance  failures.  For example, while the Department noted that it could provide the  criteria it utilizes to select its contractors on a non-mandatory basis, it  expressed concern that contractors relying on government minimum  standards could assert that performance failures were the result of the  government establishing poor standards. The Department also noted it was  unclear that a government-managed security contractor program would  result in enhanced contractor security, compared to a contractor-managed  security program.  While our work found that contractors had difficulty in  obtaining security providers that met their needs and that they would have  benefited from the agencies\u2019 assistance, we did not recommend a particular  course of action nor recommend a government-managed security program.   Rather, we recommended that the Department, working jointly with DOD  and USAID, explore options to assist contractors that are unfamiliar with  obtaining the type of security services needed in Iraq.  Such an effort would  necessarily entail a thorough assessment of the advantages, disadvantages  and risk mitigation strategies of the potential options.  Given the  significance of contractors in accomplishing reconstruction objectives and  the mixed results that they encountered when selecting their security  providers, we continue to believe that thoroughly exploring potential  options would be prudent.", "The Department of State did not indicate whether it agreed with our  recommendation to establish a means to track and account for security  costs in order to develop more accurate budget estimates. It noted that it  can capture costs associated with direct security providers and work with  prime reconstruction contractors to determine the feasibility of providing  subcontract security costs.  It is not clear to us from the Department\u2019s  comments how it intends to work with DOD and USAID to establish a  uniform means to track and account for private security costs, which is  essential given that DOD and USAID are the principal agencies responsible  for awarding and managing the majority of reconstruction contracts.", "In written comments on a draft of this report, USAID found the report  factually correct, but did not comment on the recommendations.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairman and Ranking Minority  Member, House Committee on Government Reform; the Chairman and  Ranking Minority Member, House Committee on Energy and Commerce;  the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, Senate Committee on  Governmental Affairs; and other interested congressional committees.

We discussed the guidance and  direction they received prior to awarding contracts and how such  information was provided to the contractors.  We reviewed various  acquisition documents, including agency acquisition plans, requests for  proposals, price negotiation memoranda, correspondence between  contractors, and other relevant documents.  We met with agency and  contractor officials to discuss the nature and type of guidance provided  relative to the expected security environment, the need for obtaining  security services, and requirements and standards for security personnel or  security-related equipment.", "We identified how security-related requirements were reflected in  reconstruction contracts by selecting 16 contracts that were awarded to  10 reconstruction contractors. We selected these contracts using a  nonprobabilistic methodology that considered such factors as the awarding  agency; the year awarded; the contract\u2019s expected dollar value; and the  type, nature and location of the reconstruction activity.  Nine of these  contracts were awarded in 2003 and 7 were awarded in 2004. For each of  these contracts, we obtained the contract and contract modifications  issued as of December 31, 2004, totaling about $8.6 billion; relevant  sections of the contractor's cost and technical proposal; security plans;  security-related subcontracts; and other pertinent documents.  We also  obtained and reviewed 6 contracts that had been awarded by the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers, the Department of State, USAID and by an Army  contracting agency for the CPA, for the protection of their personnel and  facilities in Iraq to compare the type of security-related requirements  incorporated within U.S. government contracts with those incorporated  into contracts awarded to reconstruction contractors and, in turn, to  subcontracts with security providers.", "We identified whether there are existing government or international  standards relative to security providers that were applicable to the Iraqi  security environment.

Our analysis was limited to  active duty personnel and did not include reservists.  The Center provided  information on personnel numbers and losses for fiscal years 2000, 2001,  2002, 2003, and 2004.  Attrition for the purposes of this report is an active  duty member who is on active duty at the start of a given fiscal year and is  no longer on active duty in the same service in the same pay category at the  end of that fiscal year.  An enlisted member who becomes a warrant or  commissioned officer (or vice versa) or a member who changes services is  considered to be a loss.  The fiscal year lasts from October 1st of the  previous year to September 30th of the named year.  For example, fiscal  year 2000 lasted from October 1, 1999 to September 30, 2000.  Personnel  numbers were calculated as the total number of members at the start of the  fiscal year (for example, October 1, 1999 for fiscal year 2000).  Losses are  the endforce members who have attrited during the fiscal year (For  example, for fiscal year 2000, losses would be the number of personnel  attrited from October 1, 1999 to September 30, 2000.).", "We received data from the Defense Manpower Data Center on active duty  attrition rates for five military occupational specialties: special forces,  military police, infantry, para-rescue, and combat controller.  These military  occupational groupings were selected because they represented military  occupational skills most sought after by private security providers working  in Iraq, as determined through interviews with officials at the human  resources commands and private security companies.
