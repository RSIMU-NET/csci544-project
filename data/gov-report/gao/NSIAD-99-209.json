The foreign share of this market in Japan is 3.7 percent, compared to  a foreign share of the U.S. insurance market of 10.7 percent in 1996. In  order to improve foreign access to the Japanese insurance market, the  United States and Japan have signed two bilateral insurance agreements, in  1994 and 1996. The United States had two key objectives in negotiating  these agreements: (1) to ensure that Japan deregulated its primary  insurance market, comprised of life and non-life (property/casualty)  insurance and (2) to ensure that Japan provides U.S. companies with a  reasonable period of time to compete in a deregulated primary sector  before opening the \u201cthird\u201d sector to increased Japanese competition where  U.S. firms have a substantial presence. The third sector is comprised of  specialized life and non-life products such as cancer, hospitalization, and  personal accident insurance.", "In light of concerns that have been raised with your Subcommittee about  the agreements' implementation and the executive branch's actions related  to enforcement of the agreements, you asked us to examine (1) the views  of U.S. insurance companies operating in Japan regarding the agreements'  implementation and impact on their ability to compete in the Japanese  market; (2) the roles and efforts of the Office of the U.S. Trade  Representative and the Departments of Commerce, State, and the Treasury  in monitoring and enforcing the agreements, and U.S. government views on  whether Japan has met its commitments under the agreements; and (3) U.S. insurance industry views on U.S. government monitoring and  enforcement efforts.

In negotiating the insurance agreement, the U.S. government sought to  establish that deregulation of the large primary sector of the Japanese  insurance market, where U.S. firms had experienced only limited success,  would be required before deregulation of the smaller third sector, where  foreign companies have a substantial presence, would occur. According to  the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), while the third sector  accounted for roughly 5 percent of the total Japanese insurance market in  Japanese fiscal year 1997, foreign market share for this sector was over 40  percent\u2014much higher than in the traditional, primary insurance market.  U.S. government and industry officials believed that the lack of U.S.  company success in the larger primary sector was the result of a heavily  regulated environment that did not allow for new market entry, product  innovation, or price competition.", "In the 1994 agreement, the United States met its negotiating objective of  establishing that primary sector deregulation would be required before  third sector deregulation would occur. Under the agreement, Japan agreed  to avoid \u201cradical change\u201d in the third sector until foreign insurance  companies were granted a \u201creasonable period\u201d to compete in a significantly  deregulated primary sector market, although the terms \u201cradical change\u201d  and \u201creasonable period\u201d were not defined in the agreement. The agreement  recognized that Japan was in the process of reforming its insurance sector,  noting that the reform would be based on promoting competition and  enhancing efficiency through deregulation and liberalization. Consistent  with this reform initiative, the agreement included specific commitments  by Japan to deregulate the primary sector. For example, the agreement  provided that insurance companies would be afforded greater flexibility in  establishing the price (rate) they would charge to customers for certain  product lines. In addition, the agreement stated that Japan would expedite  and simplify the application review process for the approval of insurance  products and rates by gradually introducing expedited approval systems  for certain products. Japan also agreed to make its regulatory process more  transparent by, for example, publishing and making publicly available the  standards that insurance regulators will apply in reviewing applications for  approval of new insurance products.", "During subsequent negotiations in 1996, the two governments reached an  interim understanding in September, in which Japan agreed to allow direct  sales of automobile insurance to consumers by mail or telephone and  established restrictions on sales by subsidiaries of large Japanese insurers  of some third sector insurance products. The commitment to allow direct  sales of automobile insurance is referred to in the final December 1996  agreement (discussed below), while third sector commitments were largely  superseded by measures contained in the December 1996 agreement.", "The second agreement was signed on December 24, 1996. This agreement  was negotiated in response to U.S. insurance company concerns that the  Japanese government was preparing to allow large Japanese insurers  increased access to the third sector through their subsidiaries in violation  of the 1994 agreement. The 1996 agreement further defined restrictions on  third sector entry by Japanese companies, and it clarified when these  restrictions would be lifted by more explicitly linking them to substantial  deregulation of Japan's larger, primary sector. Specifically, the agreement  listed five deregulation criteria for the primary sector that would have to be  met by July 1, 1998, in order to start a 2.5-year countdown toward opening  the third sector no later than 2001. These criteria reflected specific  deregulation commitments in the agreement, such as allowing for greater  pricing flexibility for automobile insurance and applying a system to  expedite marketing of additional products. The two governments  recognized that if, on July 1, 1998, there were disagreement about whether  the criteria had been met, each side would be able to act in accordance  with its own view of whether the criteria had been met. The U.S.  government has stated that, in the case of disagreement over  implementation, it can invoke various trade remedies.", "On July 1, 1998, USTR announced that, in its view, Japan had not fully  implemented key agreement commitments including two of the five  primary sector deregulation criteria. As a result, USTR did not (and still  does not) support initiation of the 2.5-year countdown to open the third  sector to increased competition in 2001. The Japanese government stated  that it believed it had fully implemented all commitments, including the five  primary sector deregulation criteria. Thus, in its view the 2.5-year \u201cclock\u201d  began on July 1, 1998, and restrictions on the ability of large Japanese  insurance companies to operate in the third sector will be lifted on January 1, 2001.", "The agreement also contains a commitment by Japan to take steps to  increase the number of staff responsible for processing insurance  applications.", "In 1998, Japan enacted legal and regulatory changes that affected the  insurance industry:", "Japan reorganized its financial regulatory system and created the  Financial Supervisory Agency (FSA). Responsibility for licensing,  application processing, surveillance, and inspection of the insurance  industry was shifted from the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to FSA in June.", "Japan agreed to include most of the commitments contained in the 1996  agreement as part of its obligations in the World Trade Organization  (WTO) financial services agreement. The WTO can therefore be a forum  for resolving disputes related to these commitments.

This view is  consistent with our survey data on application processing, which showed  that of all approved applications submitted by U.S. insurance companies  since completion of the 1996 agreement, 95 percent were approved within  90 days of submission, while 5 percent took more than 90 days to receive  approval (though this information is insufficient for determining whether  these last cases constitute violations of the agreement).", "In addition, the 1994 and 1996 agreements included commitments by the  Japanese government to improve the distribution of insurance products  through the approval of a direct response system (for example, marketing  over the telephone) for automobile insurance and the licensing of brokers.

For these cases, Japan  maintained that the applications were delayed due to sloppiness and  errors. According to USTR officials, USTR was not given permission by the  company to reveal its identity to the Japanese, and thus USTR was unable  to engage in detailed discussions with Japan regarding suspension of the  90-day period and whether the suspensions were justified in these cases.", "Also related to the product approval process, several industry participants  that we interviewed in March 1999 reported that the transfer of product  approval authority from MOF to the newly created FSA resulted in a  reduction in the number of insurance product examiners.

Historically, rating  organizations collected claims and expense data from member firms and  computed premium rates that were approved by the government. Rating  organization members were required to use the approved rate, unless the  Minister of Finance approved a deviation based on the firm's circumstance.  The result was considerable uniformity in insurance policies and rates for  major non-life insurance products.", "At the time of U.S.-Japan consultations in June 1998, the necessary legal  changes to meet the deregulation criterion were pending. While all  necessary legal reforms were made by July 1, and the U.S. government was  aware that rating organization members were no longer required to use  rating organization rates, USTR concluded in its July 1, 1998, statement that  \u201cfundamental reform\u201d of rating organizations was incomplete.", "USTR stated that certain aspects of rating organization reform, such as the  continued collection of expense data and the collection of data for  additional insurance products, promote anticompetitive activities among  companies and therefore the rating organization criterion has not been  met. The two specific issues raised by USTR are not mentioned in the  bilateral agreements. USTR most recently raised its concerns about Japan's  incomplete compliance in April 1999 meetings with Japanese officials.  Japanese officials responded that the 1996 agreement only required that the  use of rating organization rates not be mandatory, a commitment that has  been met.", "One of USTR's outstanding concerns about Japanese rating organizations  involves the scope of cost data that such organizations can collect from  member firms. Specifically, USTR opposes the continued collection of  expense data from member firms, believing it limits competition and  promotes price uniformity. As part of rating organization reform that took  effect in July 1998, the Japan Fair Trade Commission imposed restrictions  on what kind of expense data the rating organizations could collect from  member firms on a voluntary basis. This restriction was to ensure that the  full rate, which member firms had previously been required to use in  establishing company rates, could no longer be computed by these firms.  However, according to USTR, the collection of partial expense data on a  voluntary basis would still enable firms to set prices in a way that would  lead to cartel-like, or uniform, practices. Several U.S. insurance providers  that we interviewed in March 1999 agreed with USTR's overall position that  fundamental reform has not yet occurred.", "However, both Japanese rating organizations, as well as the Japanese  government and the Foreign Non-Life Insurance Association, reported to  us that now, after the reforms, the rating organizations can only collect  partial expense data on a voluntary basis and, therefore, the data held by  these organizations is incomplete and does not provide a basis to establish  an industry rate. One rating organization reported that since the July 1998  reforms, it now collects one-tenth of the data it formerly collected, while  the other organization said it is unsure of the accuracy or value of the  expense data, since the data is incomplete in scope. Further, since all  companies choose whether or not to participate in the system, the  completeness of the data cannot be assumed. The Foreign Non-Life  Insurance Association questioned the statistical validity of the data  because not all firms participate and less data is collected. One large U.S.  non-life company characterized the collected data as \u201cuseless.\u201d Further,  Japanese officials have stated that rating organizations in the United States  collect and publish complete expense data from companies and do so for  more product lines. Finally, one U.S. firm told us that it welcomed the  potential for its competitors to price uniformly, since it could price beneath  the uniform price and gain market share. Also, the Foreign Non-Life  Insurance Association noted that small firms need data, including expense  data, to function, since their sales volume is not large enough to be a  statistically sound sample from which to forecast costs and derive rates.", "Another issue raised by USTR about rating organization reform concerned  the scope of business the rating organizations covered. Specifically, USTR  opposes the expansion of rating organization authority to collect data for  additional products such as nursing care and medical insurance. USTR  views such expansion as being inconsistent with Japan's objective of  achieving fundamental reform.", "ACCJ and the Foreign Non-Life Insurance Association had expressed  concern over this expansion prior to the July 1, 1998, announcement.  However, the Foreign Non-Life Insurance Association reversed its position  before July 1, 1998, and now supports this expansion of data collection.  One U.S. insurance company we interviewed said that it would like rating  organizations to expand the number of product lines for which they collect  data. According to one Japanese rating organization, the collection of data  serves to encourage new entrants and promote competition, a position  agreed to by the Insurance Services Office, a U.S. supplier of insurance information.

The 1996 agreement stated that life subsidiaries of non-life insurance  providers will not be allowed to sell stand-alone cancer insurance.  Japanese subsidiaries may sell cancer insurance as a rider to a life  insurance policy provided that cancer benefit payments are limited to a  specific percentage of life insurance benefit payments, as set forth in a  September 1996 memorandum between the two governments. USTR's  analysis concluded that, based on the Tokyo-Anshin insurance policy's  design and marketing, the rider was clearly intended to circumvent third  sector protections. According to USTR, the rider was essentially a \u201cstand-alone\u201d product, equivalent to cancer policies prohibited for sale by  Japanese life subsidiaries under the 1996 agreement.", "USTR first raised the issue beginning in January 1998 after two U.S.  companies raised concerns about the rider.

Following  completion of negotiation of the 1996 U.S.-Japan insurance agreement but  before the agreement was signed, USTR and the Japanese government  created a separate document, referred to as a \u201cminute,\u201d that was intended  to provide a limited exception to the agreement. According to USTR  negotiators, this exception, which proved difficult to negotiate, was meant  to allow CIGNA, per a business agreement reached in 1993, to sell a  majority interest in INA (which has third sector business) to Yasuda and  then allow the Japanese-owned INA to continue to have a limited level of  third sector life sales. Sales of third sector life \u201cniche\u201d products, such as  cancer and medical insurance, by subsidiaries of large Japanese insurance  companies, were expressly prohibited in the 1996 agreement.

While AIG and AFLAC did not  raise objections in December 1996 when USTR informed them of the  \u201caccommodation\u201d for the sale of INA to Yasuda, they reacted negatively  upon learning of the existence of the \u201cminute.\u201d An AFLAC official has noted  that the 1996 agreement states that no large Japanese insurer will sell  stand-alone cancer or stand-alone medical insurance prior to 2.5 years after  primary sector deregulation; in his view, this prohibition should include  INA once it is majority owned by Yasuda, a large Japanese insurer. Further,  an AIG official has written that \u201cregrettably, USTR saw fit in late 1996 to  allow an exception , which has the effect of  allowing a U.S. company to divest itself in Japan, thus reducing the overall  U.S. market penetration while jeopardizing the integrity of the entire  agreement.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USTR Expressed Concerns to Japan in 1997 Over Yasuda's Ongoing Third Sector Activities While Making Clear That the Majority Sale of INA Should Be Allowed", "paragraphs": ["In late September 1997, as a result of urgent concerns on the part of AIG  and AFLAC, an official from the U.S. embassy in Tokyo met with Japanese  government officials from the Ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs, at  USTR's instruction, to discuss a recent expansion of third sector activities  by INA and Yasuda. This U.S. embassy official emphasized that while the  two governments had reached an understanding (the \u201cminute\u201d) to allow  Yasuda to move forward with its plans to acquire a controlling interest in  INA, the understanding also contained a commitment to constrain the  growth of INA's third sector business so as to avoid \u201cradical change.\u201d The  U.S. embassy representative informed Japanese officials that INA's third  sector licenses must be modified in order to achieve this commitment.", "The U.S. government had concerns that Yasuda and INA were acting in a  manner inconsistent with the agreements' restrictions on avoiding \u201cradical  change\u201d by greatly expanding the marketing of INA products by Yasuda  sales agents before the majority acquisition. This U.S. embassy official  expressed concerns to Japanese officials that Yasuda had more than  doubled the number of agents selling INA products in a 1-year period and,  as a result, INA was rapidly increasing its third sector sales. This change  was characterized to Japan as \u201chistorically unprecedented\u201d and \u201cresulting  in a serious loss of business for U.S. firms in the third sector.\u201d He  emphasized the U.S. belief that the bilateral insurance agreement  compelled MOF to limit the growth of INA's third sector business and  agents to historical trends and roll back the past year's dramatic increase in  INA's force of Yasuda agents.", "Japanese officials responded that INA's activities had nothing to do with  the agreements. They stated that the agreements' provisions apply to  Japanese, not U.S., subsidiaries and INA is majority-owned by a U.S.  company. They noted that Yasuda owned only 10 percent of INA and any  market developments reflected the independent operations of INA. These  officials also emphasized that there was no basis under Japanese law to  restrict the license of a company operating properly under law and  regulation, and, further, an agent rollback would be impossible.", "After U.S. embassy meetings with the Japanese government, CIGNA's  outside counsel expressed concern to USTR that the U.S. government's  recent communication with MOF had threatened the majority sale. CIGNA  believed, as a result of its discussions with MOF, that the U.S. government  would only support MOF approval of the sale if Yasuda and INA were to be  restricted from selling any third sector products and reduce the number of  Yasuda agents at INA to the number at the end of the previous fiscal year.  CIGNA requested that USTR rectify the situation by sending a letter to MOF  supporting the sale without conditions or modification of licenses.", "USTR met with CIGNA's outside counsel and explained that USTR did not  oppose the transaction but had concerns about Yasuda's third sector  activities. Again, USTR noted that, while it was still looking into the facts,  Yasuda's current activities might violate the terms of the insurance  agreement. USTR pointed out to CIGNA that while what might constitute  \u201cradical change\u201d was not precisely defined, the threshold was not very  high- particularly when activities by a large Japanese insurance company  might result in a direct loss of business for U.S. firms.", "USTR eventually concluded that sending a letter to MOF would be  counterproductive based on concerns that the letter might be  misinterpreted. During this period, while USTR was communicating  frequently with CIGNA regarding the majority sale of INA to Yasuda and  subsequent third sector activities, USTR received congressional letters of  support for the transaction, as well as letters claiming that Yasuda was  violating the agreements and should not be allowed to sell third sector  products after the sale.", "In October of 1997, a senior USTR official traveled to Japan for 2 days of  meetings with Japanese officials and certain U.S. companies to discuss the  activities of INA and Yasuda. This official emphasized to Japanese officials  that (1) the transaction should be allowed to go forward, (2) INA's licenses  should be modified as necessary, (3) this is the only exception to the  agreement, and (4) Yasuda's actions both before and after the acquisition  should not be permitted to result in radical change in the third sector. He  noted that there was evidence suggesting that Yasuda was controlling INA  and might be causing radical change.", "Japanese officials again responded that Yasuda's and INA's activities before  the acquisition cannot constitute an agreement violation since INA is a U.S.  company. Furthermore, these officials said that Japan could not impose  legally enforceable restrictions (such as license modifications) upon the  activities of INA just because it is acquired by Yasuda. However, Japanese  officials also suggested that, recognizing the agreement's spirit, Yasuda was  likely to act on its own initiative to keep INA's activities in the third sector  within a certain limit.", "CIGNA correspondence with USTR shows that the company was unhappy  with USTR's visit to Japan, believing that a link had been made with  Japanese officials that the transaction should not be approved unless  Yasuda's current activities were restricted. CIGNA also expressed concern  that USTR was discussing its private business decisions with its  competitors.", "The U.S. and Japanese governments had additional discussions in late 1997  regarding the majority sale and subsequent third sector activities of INA  once it was owned by Yasuda.

The U.S. government held this position (1) in order to  seek third country support for full implementation of the agreement, (2) to  have access to WTO dispute settlement procedures, and (3) to respond to  U.S. industry support for this initiative.", "In December 1997, the Japanese government agreed to include most of the  provisions in the 1996 agreement in the WTO financial services agreement,  including third sector provisions. (See fig. 10 for a time line of events from  1997 to the present regarding the Yasuda-INA deal.) Japan's legislation that  implements its WTO financial services commitments authorizes MOF to  prohibit entry into the third sector by acquired, as well as newly  established, subsidiaries. A MOFA official confirmed to us that Japan's  implementing legislation and its referral to established as well as acquired  subsidiaries implied that if Yasuda were to acquire INA, INA would be  considered a life insurance subsidiary of a non-life insurance company  subject to the third sector sales prohibition in the 1996 agreement.  Therefore, while Japanese officials had said, before implementation of  Japan's WTO financial services commitments, that they were unable to use  legal means to regulate third sector activities even following Yasuda's  purchase of the company, Japan has now implemented its WTO insurance  commitments and has expressed a view that INA's sales in the third sector,  post transaction, would be completely prohibited.", "In February 1998, MOF notified insurers to explain that Japan's  commitments under the WTO financial services agreement prohibit sales of  third sector products by acquired life subsidiaries of non-life insurance  providers. One day later, Yasuda announced that it would delay its majority  purchase of INA until agreement restrictions are lifted on sales of third  sector products by life subsidiaries of non-life insurance companies.", "In later communication with USTR, CIGNA did not preclude the possibility  that the sale still might go through before third sector restrictions are lifted.  Therefore, in June 1998, the month before Japan's WTO insurance  commitments were implemented on July 1, USTR engaged in discussions  with Japanese officials regarding the consistency of Japan's implementing  legislation with the intent of the \u201cminute.\u201d Specifically, USTR sought  reassurance that INA could continue third sector sales if acquired by  Yasuda. USTR officials claim that Japanese officials responded in a  noncommittal fashion and never provided an answer. USTR officials have  emphasized to Japan that it has an obligation to uphold the \u201cminute,\u201d which  allows for the majority sale of INA to Yasuda, and to limit third sector  activity for the new entity, regardless of Japan's WTO insurance  commitments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Government Review of Yasuda's and INA's Ongoing Activities in the Third Sector Determined That No Agreement Violations Have Occurred", "paragraphs": ["In early 1998, USTR began a review of the ongoing activities of Yasuda and  INA to determine whether they were consistent with the third sector  restrictions in the 1994 and 1996 agreements. Two companies, AFLAC and  AIG, had contended that Yasuda, through its partnership with INA, had  entered the third sector and caused radical change to that sector in  contravention of the agreements. USTR provided CIGNA, AFLAC, and AIG  with an opportunity to present their views in writing. AFLAC and AIG  argued that Yasuda had effectively entered the third sector through receipt  of financial benefits it had obtained in connection with its business  relationship with INA. They also argued that because of its relationship  with Yasuda, INA was a de facto Japanese company and that its third sector  activities violated the agreements' restriction on these activities by  Japanese companies. Finally, the U.S. companies argued that changes to  INA's corporate structure and business operations constituted radical  change and should therefore not have been permitted.", "During this review, the U.S. Trade Representative expressed a reluctance to  choose sides among U.S. companies and a hope that the companies could  cooperate to find a mutually agreeable business solution. However, such a  solution never materialized. Therefore, USTR examined each of the  allegations and, as summarized in a classified memorandum, concluded  that the activities of Yasuda and INA did not constitute a violation of the  agreements. After conducting an analysis of INA's operations, USTR's  fundamental position was that INA is a U.S. company and, therefore, its  activities do not fall within the terms of the 1994 and 1996 agreements. This  decision was agreed upon during interagency meetings that reached the  subcabinet (NEC Deputies) level and included officials from the  Departments of State, Commerce, the Treasury, and Justice; as well as the  NEC and USTR. On July 1, 1998, USTR communicated the consensus  decision to CIGNA, AIG, and AFLAC.", "In response to a request by AFLAC and a few Members of Congress, an  additional interagency review was subsequently conducted in late July and  early August 1998. This final review reached the level of the Cabinet (NEC  Principals), whose review had participation from the Council of Economic  Advisers; the Office of Management and Budget; the National Security  Council; NEC; the Departments of Commerce, Justice, Labor, State, and the  Treasury; and USTR. During this second review, all three companies  presented their arguments orally to the interagency group. The original  conclusion- that information provided to date did not support a  determination that the activities of INA and Yasuda in the third sector had  violated the 1996 agreement- was reaffirmed. During the second  interagency review, which reached a consensus decision that there was no  violation of the \u201cradical change\u201d provisions of the 1996 agreement, the  Department of Commerce recommended that additional measures be taken  to monitor the situation. A Commerce official proposed that an interagency  team conduct further work in Tokyo to verify the facts presented to the  U.S. government. According to USTR, this suggestion was not adopted  based on the general interagency view that no further information was  necessary to resolve the issue.", "In discussing how USTR's views evolved from raising serious concerns  regarding a possible violation of the agreements with Japan in late 1997 to a  final determination that no violation of third sector provisions had  occurred, USTR officials noted that AIG and AFLAC expressed concerns  over Yasuda and INA activities in an extremely urgent manner in 1997. As  the companies emphasized that they were losing business as a result of  these activities, USTR felt compelled to address the issue with the  Japanese government immediately. However, over the next several months,  as USTR was able to conduct its own analysis of the situation, it ultimately  determined that no violation had occurred.", "Both AFLAC and CIGNA raised concerns about the process used by USTR  to conduct the formal review of Yasuda's and INA's activities in the third  sector. AFLAC expressed frustration over USTR's requests for updated  information on the situation after the agency did not act on information  provided by AFLAC months earlier. CIGNA felt that it never received a  complete explanation from USTR as to what accusations had been made  against the company, but was compelled to respond to allegations made  against it nonetheless in an attempt to defend itself.", "AIG and AFLAC disagreed with the interagency decision. However, officials  from one company have also noted that Yasuda's activities in the third  sector have slowed. Specifically, these officials have stated that the rapid  growth in the Yasuda agent force selling INA products has ended and their  company's existing client base is no longer being actively threatened. INA's  principal U.S. third sector competitor believes that the government of  Japan has been successful in restraining Yasuda's activities through the use  of \u201csoft controls,\u201d such as requiring a slowdown in the projected  registration of Yasuda agents with INA in the company's business plans.  This company has also noted that the impact of Yasuda's and INA's  activities on its business has been small to date.

After the agreement negotiations were concluded,  USTR felt compelled to preserve CIGNA's support for the agreement by  accommodating the company's business plans that predated negotiation of  both insurance agreements but that would clearly violate the 1996  agreement's terms if not addressed by the two governments. This situation  was made more delicate due to the fact that competing U.S. companies had  opposing and strong views as to whether or how Yasuda/INA should be  allowed to sell third sector life products. In deciding to accommodate  CIGNA's sale of INA to Yasuda and subsequent third sector life sales by the  company, USTR took a position that appeared to benefit one U.S. firm at  the expense of others. USTR faced the difficult challenge of determining  the U.S. interest in a case where U.S. companies' interests were opposed.", "Moreover, given the sensitive issues the \u201cminute\u201d raised in Japan, USTR  officials believed that broad dissemination of the document might lead to  its disavowal and possibly to the unraveling of the 1996 agreement itself.  USTR therefore sought to limit distribution of the \u201cminute\u201d and thus did not  provide copies to the two other U.S. insurance companies that had an  interest in developments related to Yasuda/INA. Further, in late December  1996, USTR did not explicitly describe to AIG and AFLAC the extent to  which a Yasuda-owned INA would be allowed access to the third sector life  insurance business. This \u201cgrandfather\u201d document added to the 1996  agreement, combined with USTR's incomplete description of the exception  and the failure of USTR to provide the actual document to industry, created  frustration with USTR on the part of U.S. insurers that lasted for months.", "Further, the \u201cminute\u201d used undefined terms that made its meaning and  implementation uncertain. While USTR officials maintained that a Yasuda- owned INA would only be allowed restricted access to the third sector, it is  unclear what language or provision in the \u201cminute\u201d requires that the  company maintain only a limited presence. As a result of this undefined  language in the \u201cminute,\u201d the U.S. and Japanese governments had  numerous consultations during 1997 regarding the meaning of the  document's terms. U.S. and Japanese government officials have expressed  very different understandings of the \u201cminute,\u201d with Japan's actions  suggesting an unwillingness, even an inability under Japanese law, to  implement the document as intended by USTR. After several months of  discussions, the two governments were never able to reach an agreement  as to how Yasuda might be restricted in the third life sector, demonstrating  the questionable value of the \u201cminute\u201d in creating a limited exception to the  1996 agreement to accommodate CIGNA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Trade, Committee on Ways  and Means, asked us to examine (1) the views of U.S. insurance companies  operating in Japan regarding the agreements' implementation and impact  on their ability to compete in the Japanese market; (2) the roles and efforts  of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Departments of  Commerce, State, and the Treasury in monitoring and enforcing the  agreements, and U.S. government views on whether Japan has met its  commitments under the agreements; and (3) U.S. insurance industry views  on U.S. government monitoring and enforcement efforts.

Surveys for life and  non-life insurers differed somewhat depending on whether a particular  commitment applied to them, and the survey included far fewer questions  for brokers as several of the commitments in the agreements do not  directly pertain to them. The survey was distributed in January 1999, and  we obtained a 100-percent response rate to our questionnaire. We then  traveled to Japan and met with representatives from all the insurers and  brokers in March to obtain detailed explanations of and clarifications to  their questionnaire responses. In some cases, responses were revised  during discussions at our meetings. The questionnaire asked U.S. insurers  and brokers for their views on the implementation and the impact of those  provisions of the agreements for which the companies would have first- hand experience. All of the questions were referenced back to their related  provisions in the agreements. For the questions related to the 1994  agreement, we developed, where possible, similar or identical questions to  those we used in a 1996 survey on the implementation and impact of the  1994 agreement. This allowed us in some cases to compare how company  responses had changed over time. Eleven of the 13 companies and two of  the three brokers included in our current survey also responded to our 1996  survey. In analyzing questionnaire results, we examined response  frequencies. We also computed the percentage of U.S. insurance sales in Japan represented by company responses. In requesting company  participation in our survey, we pledged that company responses would be  reported in aggregate form and that we would not identify specific  responses with the individual companies. In certain cases, the reporting of  responses in conjunction with the percentage of U.S. insurance premiums  in Japan associated with that response limits this confidentiality. In those  cases, the firms that could be identified, due to their large size, gave us  permission to report the market premium data. We also interviewed and  collected information from industry groups and insurance companies in the  United States.", "To identify the roles and efforts of USTR and the Departments of  Commerce, State, and the Treasury in monitoring and enforcing the  insurance agreements, as well as U.S. government views on  implementation, we conducted interviews with officials from each agency,  including the U.S. embassy in Tokyo.
