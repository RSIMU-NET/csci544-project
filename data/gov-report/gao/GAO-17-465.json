However, its October 2016 revised plan showed that the monthly cash balances were projected to be within the requirements for all 12 months. The plan changed because (1) DOD made unplanned cash transfers out of the DWWCF in the second half of fiscal year 2016 and (2) DOD reduced the standard fuel price in September 2016, leading to lower projected cash balances for fiscal year 2017."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD update the FMR to include guidance on the timing of when DOD managers should use available tools to help ensure that monthly cash balances are within the upper and lower cash requirements.

Under the working capital fund  concept, the DWWCF charges these customers for the anticipated full  cost of these goods and services. For fiscal year 2016, the three DOD  agencies reported total revenue of $45.7 billion for the DWWCF,  including, among other things, (1) DFAS providing finance and accounting  services to the military services and defense agencies; (2) DISA providing  global information technology solutions to the military services and  defense agencies; and (3) DLA managing about 6.2 million inventory  items and providing comprehensive worldwide energy solutions for the  military services, which included selling about 99 million barrels of fuel to  customers.", "The DWWCF needs to maintain a sufficient cash balance to pay its bills  and sustain operations to achieve its mission. The availability of cash in  the DWWCF depends on the outcome of many decisions made during  DOD\u2019s budget process with regard to (1) projecting workloads,   (2) estimating costs, and (3) setting prices to recover the estimated full  cost of providing goods and services. The DWWCF cash balance is  directly affected by collections from the sale of goods and services;  disbursements for salaries, inventory purchases, and other items;  appropriations passed by Congress and enacted into law; and transfers  into and out of the DWWCF. A disbursement in excess of available cash  would potentially constitute an Antideficiency Act violation. Conversely, if  the DWWCF builds excess cash balances, it could be subject to reduced  budget requests by DOD, transfers from the DWWCF to other  appropriation accounts, or rescissions. For example, because of an  excess cash balance in the DWWCF, Congress rescinded $1.037 billion  from the DWWCF in fiscal year 2016. Consequently, it is important for the  DWWCF to manage its cash balance to stay within the upper and lower  cash requirements.", "You asked us to review issues related to DWWCF cash management.

If the cash balances were not within the  upper and lower requirement amounts, we met with DLA, DISA, and  DFAS officials and reviewed DWWCF budgets and other documentation  to ascertain the reasons. Further, to determine the extent that cash  transfers for fiscal years 2007 through 2016 caused the DWWCF cash  balances to be above or below the cash requirements, we analyzed DOD  budget and accounting reports to determine the dollar amount of transfers  made for the period. We analyzed cash transfers to determine if any of  the transfers contributed to the cash balances falling outside the upper or  lower cash requirements and, if so, the amount that fell outside those  requirements. We also obtained and analyzed documents that provide  information on transfer of funds into and out of the DWWCF and  interviewed key DLA, DISA, and DFAS officials to determine the reasons  for the transfers.", "To address the second objective, we obtained and analyzed DWWCF  budget documents and cash management plans for fiscal year 2017.

Customers primarily  use appropriated funds to finance orders placed with the DWWCF. Cash  generated from the sale of goods and services, rather than annual  appropriations, is the DWWCF\u2019s primary means of maintaining an  adequate level of cash to sustain its operations. The ability to operate on  a break-even basis and generate cash consistent with DOD\u2019s regulations  depends on accurately (1) projecting workload, (2) estimating costs, and  (3) setting prices to recover the full costs of producing goods and  services. DOD policy requires the DWWCF to establish its sales prices  prior to the start of each fiscal year and to apply these predetermined or  \u201cstabilized\u201d prices to most orders received during the year\u2014regardless of  when the work is accomplished or what costs are incurred. Stabilized  prices provide customers with protection during the year of execution  from prices greater than those assumed in the budget and permit  customers to execute their programs as authorized by Congress.", "Developing accurate prices is challenging because the process to  determine the prices begins about 2 years in advance of when the  DWWCF actually receives customers\u2019 orders and performs the work. In  essence, the DWWCF\u2019s budget development has to coincide with the  development of its customers\u2019 budgets so that they both use the same set  of assumptions. To develop prices, the DWWCF estimates labor,  material, and other costs based on anticipated demand for work as  projected by customers. Higher-than-expected costs or lower-than- expected customer sales for goods and services can result in lower cash  balances. Conversely, lower-than-expected costs or higher-than-expected  customer sales for goods and services can result in higher cash  balances. Because the DWWCF must base sales prices on assumptions  made as long as 2 years before the prices go into effect, some variance  between expected and actual costs and sales is inevitable.", "If projections of cash disbursements and collections indicate that cash  balances will drop below the lower cash requirement, the DWWCF may  need to generate additional cash. One way this may be done is to bill  customers in advance for work not yet performed. Advance billing  generates cash almost immediately by billing DWWCF customers for  work that has not been completed. This method is a temporary solution  and is used only when cash reaches critically low balances because it  requires manual intervention in the normal billing and payment processes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Description of DWWCF Work Performed by DLA, DISA, and DFAS", "paragraphs": ["During fiscal year 2016, DLA, DISA, and DFAS reported total revenue of  $45.7 billion through the DWWCF.", "DLA: During fiscal year 2016, DLA reported total revenue of   $37.5 billion.

These adjustments would  increase the minimum and maximum cash requirements. First, a working  capital fund could increase the cash requirements by the amount of  accumulated profits planned for return to customer accounts. A working  capital fund returns accumulated profits to its customers by reducing  future prices so it can operate on a break-even basis over time. The  second adjustment allowed by the revised DOD Financial Management  Regulation was for funds appropriated to the working capital fund that  were obligated in the year received but not fully spent until future years.  The adjustment allowed the working capital fund to retain these amounts  as an addition to their normal operational costs. Finally, a working capital  fund could increase the minimum and maximum cash requirements by  the marginal cash required to purchase goods and services from the  commodity or business market at a higher price than that submitted in the  President\u2019s Budget.

The rate of disbursement is the average  amount disbursed between collection cycles.

The rate describes  the average amount of cash needed to cover disbursements from one  collection cycle to the next.", "Range of operation.

An Office of  the Under Secretary of Defense (OUSD) (Comptroller) official informed us  that DLA provides the OUSD (Comptroller) monthly information on  DWWCF cash balances compared to the upper and lower cash  requirements. This information is used by the OUSD (Comptroller) and  DWWCF officials to determine whether actions are needed to increase or  decrease the DWWCF cash balance, such as transferring funds into or  out of the DWWCF. Our analysis of accounting documentation and  discussions with OUSD (Comptroller) and DLA officials showed that DOD  used two types of actions to increase or decrease the monthly cash  balances to help bring the cash balances within the cash requirements  during the 10-year period of our review.", "First, DOD transferred a total of about $9 billion into and out of the  DWWCF to adjust the cash balance during this period. For example,  DOD transferred about $3 billion from the DWWCF to other DOD  appropriation accounts throughout fiscal year 2016. This reduced the  DWWCF cash balance to within the cash requirements after remaining  above the upper cash requirement for 15 consecutive months from April  2015 to July 2016. Second, the OUSD (Comptroller), in coordination with  DLA, adjusted the standard fuel prices upward or downward a total of 16  times outside of the normal budget process. For example, in fiscal year  2012, DOD lowered the standard fuel price three times from October  2011 through July 2012 to help offset cash increases by DLA Energy  Management on the sale of fuel to its customers. These price changes  helped offset further increases in the cash balances, but they did not  reduce the monthly cash balances to within the cash requirements during  this period.", "Although DOD managers used management tools such as transfers and  price adjustments to help bring the DWWCF monthly cash balances  within upper and lower cash requirements, such actions did not always  bring the balances within the requirements in a timely manner.

Furthermore, the monthly  cash balances remained above the upper cash requirement for 15  consecutive months, from April 2015 through June 2016.", "According to DLA officials and our analysis of financial documentation,  the monthly cash balances were above the upper cash requirement for  three primary reasons.", "First, the DWWCF cash balance at the beginning of fiscal year 2014  was above the upper cash requirement because of the $1.4 billion  transferred into the fund during the last 4 months of fiscal year 2013.", "Second, in fiscal year 2015, DLA Energy Management\u2019s price for the  sale of fuel to its customers was considerably more than the cost to  purchase, refine, transport, and store fuel. As a result, DLA Energy  Management collected about $3.7 billion more than it disbursed for  fuel during the year.", "Third, in fiscal year 2016, DLA Energy Management continued to  charge its customers more for fuel than it cost."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The DWWCF\u2019s Revised Monthly Cash Balances Are Projected to Be within the Upper and Lower Cash Requirements for Fiscal Year 2017", "paragraphs": ["Initially, the DWWCF monthly cash plan that supports the fiscal year 2017  President\u2019s Budget, dated February 2016, showed the monthly cash  balances were projected to be above the upper cash requirement for  most of fiscal year 2017. However, after the DWWCF revised its fiscal  year 2017 cash plan in October 2016, cash balances were projected to be  within the upper and lower cash requirement for all 12 months, in  accordance with the DOD Financial Management Regulation.", "According to DOD officials, the DWWCF changed its plan after the  President\u2019s Budget was issued because (1) DOD made unplanned cash  transfers out of the DWWCF in the second half of fiscal year 2016 and   (2) DOD reduced the fiscal year 2017 standard fuel price in September  2016, leading to lower projected cash balances. Figure 2 shows the  DWWCF\u2019s initial cash plan under the President\u2019s Budget and the revised  monthly cash plans compared to the upper and lower cash requirements  for fiscal year 2017.", "As shown in figure 2, the DWWCF\u2019s revised cash plan for fiscal year 2017  shows that the cash balance at the end of fiscal year 2016 (September  2016) was about $1.1 billion lower than the President\u2019s Budget cash plan.  According to DOD officials and our review of documentation on transfers,  this decrease was largely due to DOD\u2019s transfer of about $2 billion out of  the DWWCF in the second half of fiscal year 2016, which occurred after  the fiscal year 2017 President\u2019s Budget cash plan was submitted in  February 2016. The $2 billion of DWWCF cash was transferred to other  DOD appropriations accounts to pay for, among other things, unforeseen  military requirements to maintain a larger troop presence in Afghanistan  than that planned for in the President\u2019s Budget and funding shortfalls in  fuels, consumable inventory items, repair parts, and medical supplies and  services.", "The DWWCF monthly cash balances under the revised cash plan are  projected to remain within the upper and lower cash requirements for all  12 months in fiscal year 2017. This is a significant change from the  President\u2019s Budget cash plan that showed the DWWCF monthly cash  balances exceeding the upper cash requirement for 9 of the 12 months.  Another factor that contributed to the improved results reflected in the  revised plan is that the OUSD (Comptroller) lowered the standard fuel  price in September 2016 from $105.00 per barrel to $94.92\u2014a $10.08  difference. DOD lowered the standard fuel price for refined petroleum  products because the fiscal year 2017 costs for those products were  expected to remain lower than initially projected when the fiscal year 2017  President\u2019s Budget was developed. In connection with its decision to  lower fuel prices, DOD stated that the lower refined product costs have  had a positive impact on the DWWCF cash balance (i.e., higher cash  balances), and the department anticipated an associated congressional  reduction as a result of the positive cash balance. Thus, DOD reduced  the fiscal year 2017 standard fuel price effective October 1, 2016.", "In November 2016, DLA officials informed us that several factors could  nevertheless cause the DWWCF monthly cash balances to fall outside  the upper and lower cash requirements in fiscal year 2017. These factors  could include (1) higher or lower fuel product costs than expected,   (2) higher or lower customer sales than expected, (3) the timing of vendor  payments on a daily basis versus collections from customers on a weekly  or monthly basis, and (4) nonpayment from customers for goods or  services provided to them. While DWWCF officials stated that these  factors could affect whether the DWWCF monthly cash balances are  within the cash requirements for all 12 months in fiscal year 2017, the  officials believe that the cash balances will remain within the cash  requirements for the entire period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The DWWCF supports military readiness by providing energy solutions,  inventory management, information system solutions, and financial  services for DOD in times of peace and war. Maintaining the DWWCF  cash balance within the upper and lower cash requirements as defined by  DOD regulation is critical for the DWWCF to continue providing these  services for its customers. During fiscal years 2007 through 2016, DOD  transferred a total of $9 billion into and out of the DWWCF and adjusted  fuel prices 16 times outside of the normal budget process to try to bring  the cash balances within the cash requirements. However, the cash  balances were outside the upper and lower cash requirements almost  three quarters of that time and for more than a year on three separate  occasions.", "Although the DOD Financial Management Regulation provides guidance  on tools DOD managers can use to help bring the monthly cash balances  within the upper and lower cash requirements, the regulation does not  provide guidance on the timing of when DWWCF managers should use  these tools to help ensure that the monthly cash balances are within the  cash requirements. Without this guidance, DOD risks not taking prompt  action in response to changes in fuel costs, inventory costs,  appropriations, or other events to bring the monthly cash balances within  the cash requirements. When DWWCF monthly cash balances are below  the lower cash requirements for long periods of time, the DWWCF is at  greater risk of either (1) not paying its bills on time or (2) making a  disbursement in excess of available cash, which would potentially result  in an Antideficiency Act violation.

If  the cash balances were not within the upper and lower requirement  amounts, we met with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), the Defense  Information Systems Agency (DISA), and the Defense Finance and  Accounting Service (DFAS) officials and reviewed DWWCF budgets and  other documentation to ascertain the reasons. We also identified  instances in which monthly cash balances were outside the upper and  lower cash requirements for 12 consecutive months or more to assess  the timeliness of DOD actions to bring them within the upper and lower  cash requirements. We selected the 12-month period for comparing the  monthly cash balances to the cash requirements because (1) DOD  develops a budget every 12 months; (2) the DWWCF annual budget  projects fiscal year-end cash balances and the upper and lower cash  requirements based on 12-month cash plans that include information on  projected monthly cash balances, and whether those projected monthly  cash balances fall within the cash requirements; and (3) DOD revises the  DWWCF stabilized prices that it charges customers for goods and  services every 12 months during the budget process.", "In addition, we performed a walk-through of DFAS processes for  reconciling the Department of the Treasury trial balance monthly cash  amounts for the DWWCF to the balances reported on the DWWCF cash  management reports. Further, to determine the extent cash transfers for  fiscal years 2007 through 2016 contributed to the DWWCF cash balances  being above or below the cash requirements, we (1) analyzed DOD  budget and accounting reports to determine the dollar amount of transfers  made for the period and (2) obtained journal vouchers from DFAS that  documented the dollar amounts of the cash transfers. We analyzed cash  transfers to determine if any of the transfers contributed to the cash  balances falling outside the upper or lower cash requirements and, if so,  the amount outside those requirements.
