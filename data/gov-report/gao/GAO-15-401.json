To perform this calculation,  CMS multiplies the amount of shared savings or losses by the ACO\u2019s final  sharing rate. For shared savings, CMS calculates the final sharing rate by  multiplying the ACO\u2019s sharing rate by its total quality score. As a result,  ACOs with higher total quality scores will have higher final sharing rates  for savings and thus, will receive a higher portion of any shared savings.  To calculate the final sharing rate for losses, CMS first adds 40 percent to  the ACO\u2019s sharing rate and then subtracts the product of the sharing rate  and the ACO\u2019s total quality score. quality scores will have lower final sharing rates for losses and thus, will  owe CMS a lower portion of any shared losses. The total quality score is  calculated with the 33 quality measures that the ACOs report to CMS  each year. ACOs earn from 0 to 2 points for each measure, depending on  their level of performance relative to the performance benchmarks CMS  established. The total quality score is a percentage of the maximum  number of points that an ACO can earn for the measures combined. The  maximum total quality score is 100 percent. As an example of a final  sharing rate for an ACO with savings, an ACO with a sharing rate of   50 percent and a quality score of 80 percent would have a final sharing  rate of 40 percent (0.50 x 0.80 = 0.40).

The reported findings  addressed two of the eight research areas that CMS established for the  evaluation\u2014Medicare service use and expenditures and ACO  characteristics. CMS issued a public report in November 2013 that  included findings related to these two research areas. For example,  CMS reported that none of the ACO characteristics it tested, such as  organization type, was significantly related to an ACO\u2019s ability to reduce  expenditures in the first year of the model, and that most of the ACOs that  reduced expenditures had higher Medicare expenditures than their  comparison groups prior to the start of the Pioneer ACO Model. CMS  planned to issue the report in the summer of 2013, and intended to  include results for more of the research areas, according to agency  officials. However, the release of the report was delayed until November  2013 because of delays in securing the CMS contractor\u2019s access to  Medicare claims data. The delay also limited the scope of the findings for  which CMS could report, according to CMS officials, and these data  access issues have since been resolved.", "In 2015, CMS also plans to report additional findings for the first year of the model. For  example, CMS plans to report findings related to quality of care. beneficiaries, (2) access to care, (3) beneficiary quality of care, (4) health  care markets, and (5) ACO characteristics. CMS officials added that  although they have not made such findings public, they have shared  preliminary second year findings internally for five of the eight research  areas and their analysis is ongoing for the other three research areas.
