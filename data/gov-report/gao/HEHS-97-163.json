The Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has estimated that as much as one-third of these costs is due to musculoskeletal disorders (MSD), a wide range of illnesses and injuries related to repetitive stress or sustained exertion on the body. Over the last few years, OSHA has tried to develop a workplace standard requiring employers to take particular actions to reduce MSDs and the contributing workplace hazards (often called ergonomic hazards). But there is disagreement about what workplace conditions cause or contribute to MSD and what actions employers should take to reduce MSDs. A draft standard that OSHA circulated for informal comment in 1995 generated significant opposition from many employers because they believed it required an unreasonable level of effort to identify jobs with ergonomic hazards and to reduce these hazards. Others, including labor organizations, generally supported the draft standard and believed it was consistent with approaches implemented by many employers. Between July 1995 and October 1996, a restriction in an appropriations law prohibited OSHA from spending appropriated funds to do further work to develop a draft standard. The Congress has enacted a modified restriction for fiscal year 1998 that prohibits OSHA from issuing a proposed or final ergonomics standard during the year, but allows OSHA to develop such a proposal in the meantime.", "Despite the controversy surrounding OSHA\u2019s draft standard, some employers have taken the initiative to address MSDs through the implementation of ergonomics programs. To learn about these programs and their results, you asked that we (1) identify the core elements of effective ergonomics programs and describe how these elements are operationalized at the facility level, (2) discuss whether these programs have proven beneficial to the employers and employees that have implemented them, and (3) highlight the implications of these employers\u2019 experiences for other employers and OSHA.", "To identify the core elements of effective ergonomics programs, we conducted a literature review and interviewed experts in the business, labor, and academic communities with experience in implementing such programs or expertise in the field of ergonomics. To learn how the elements of ergonomics programs have been operationalized at the facility level and determine whether these programs have proven beneficial, we conducted case studies at selected facilities of five employers, interviewing pertinent program officials and obtaining program and results data (app. I details how these facilities were selected and how the case studies were conducted). Table 1 shows the employers and facilities selected, their product or service, and their staffing level.", "To explore the implications of our findings for other employers and OSHA, we interviewed pertinent officials and obtained information about current activities from OSHA and selected states that operate their own OSHA programs about how employers and employees can be encouraged to reduce or eliminate the occurrence of MSDs. We explored the extent to which these activities responded to employers\u2019 needs as reflected through the experiences of our case study employers. We also convened several panels comprising representatives from the business, labor, and academic communities to obtain their views on the implications of our findings.

While there is some debate about what injuries should be considered MSDs, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) show that, in 1995, there were 308,000 cases of illness due to repeated trauma, accounting for over 60 percent of all work-related recorded illnesses and continuing the decade-long increase in illness due to repeated trauma. However, the 1995 total was a slight decrease from 1994 and represented a small percentage of the total number of recordable injuries and illnesses. In 1997, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), a federal agency that conducts independent research on workplace safety and health issues, reported that, for all cases involving days away from work in 1994, about 700,000 (or 32 percent) were the result of repetitive motion or overexertion. It also reported that MSDs accounted for 14 percent of physician visits and 19 percent of hospital stays.", "To protect employees from workplace hazards, OSHA issues workplace standards and enforces the provisions of those standards through citations issued as a result of on-site inspections of employers. OSHA can also provide information and technical assistance or work with employers and employees in a cooperative manner that rewards compliance instead of penalizing noncompliance. Because currently no standard exists specifically for MSDs, federal and state-operated OSHA programs have generally relied on what is referred to as the \u201cgeneral duty clause\u201d of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or its state equivalent, to cite employers for ergonomic hazards. This clause requires employers to furnish employees with employment and a place of work \u201cfree from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.\u201d To justify using this authority, OSHA must prove that the hazard is likely to cause serious harm, that the industry recognizes the hazard, and that it is feasible to eliminate or materially reduce the hazard\u2014conditions that require major OSHA resources to demonstrate.", "Over the last several years, OSHA has tried to develop a standard specifically for MSDs to carry out its mandate to protect workers and improve worker health. In 1992, OSHA announced in the Federal Register its intent to develop a standard for MSDs. Before formally proposing a standard, in March 1995, OSHA circulated a draft of a standard to selected stakeholders to obtain their comments. The standard was subsequently distributed widely and has come to be known as the \u201cdraft standard.\u201d This draft standard required employers to identify problem jobs on two bases: where there had been one or more recorded MSD (for example, on the OSHA 200 log or as a workers\u2019 compensation claim) and where an employee had daily exposure during the work shift to any \u201csignal risk factor.\u201dEmployers would have to \u201cscore\u201d these jobs using a checklist provided in the draft standard, or an alternative checklist if the employer could demonstrate that it was as effective, to determine the severity of the problem. If a job received more than five points, the employer would have to conduct a job improvement process to address the hazards on that job. This process involved a detailed job analysis (identification and description of each risk factor) and the selection, implementation, and evaluation of controls. Some employers opposed this requirement, stating that the net effect of this approach would result in considering virtually every job a problem job and necessitating considerable resources from employers to analyze and develop controls for each problem job. Others said that because MSDs are cumulative or chronic in nature, they may take a long time to develop and may have many contributing factors. Because of this, some employers questioned whether OSHA could demonstrate that provisions in the standard would be able to address the hazards that cause MSDs.", "OSHA has now said its 1995 draft standard is no longer under consideration, and it has renewed efforts to determine the best approach to protect workers from ergonomic hazards. OSHA is currently undertaking a \u201cfour-pronged approach,\u201d which involves (1) education, outreach, and technical assistance to employers; (2) research on the effectiveness of ergonomic improvements that employers have implemented; (3) enforcement efforts targeted toward high-hazard employers, issuing citations when warranted under the general duty clause; and (4) continued work on a standard that will take findings from these efforts into account.", "The California state-operated program also spent several years developing a standard, which program officials said was initiated in response to a legislative mandate. The two-page standard, which went into effect in July 1997, covers only those employers with 10 or more employees, thus excluding a significant number of California\u2019s employers. The standard is triggered only when an injury has been reported. While the standard requires employers to implement particular elements of an ergonomics program, such as worksite evaluation, development of controls, and training, the standard does not require a medical management program, nor are there many requirements as to specifically how these elements should be implemented. An employer who makes an effort to comply will not be cited for being out of compliance unless it can be shown that a control known to, but not taken by, the employer is substantially certain to have caused a greater reduction in these injuries and that this alternative control would not have imposed additional unreasonable costs. Some labor organizations believed this standard fails to provide adequate protection to employees and were skeptical that it would be effective in reducing MSDs. Additionally, even though the standard had been revised significantly to reduce employers\u2019 responsibilities in response to employer concerns, some employer groups still question the merit of a standard for MSDs. As a result, both labor and employer groups are challenging the standard."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "An Effective Program Includes a Core Set of Elements", "paragraphs": ["Experts, available literature, and officials at our case study facilities generally agreed that, to be effective, an ergonomics program should include a core set of elements or provisions to ensure management commitment, employee involvement, identification of problem jobs, development of controls for problem jobs, training and education for employees, and appropriate medical management. These core elements are said to be typical of any comprehensive safety and health program and, together, they can help an employer ensure that ergonomic hazards are identified and controlled and that employees are protected. Research provides a wide spectrum of options for how these elements can be implemented, requiring varying levels of effort on the part of employers and employees.

Especially in this element, research has highlighted a wide variety of ways employers can identify problem jobs or job tasks. For example, a relatively straightforward way to identify problem jobs is for employers to focus on those jobs where there is already evidence that the job is a problem, because MSDs have already occurred or symptoms have been reported. For this approach, employers could use the following methods to identify problem jobs: following up on employee reports of MSDs, symptoms, discomfort, physical fatigue, or stress; reviewing the OSHA 200 logs and other existing records, such as workers\u2019 conducting interviews or symptom surveys or administering periodic medical examinations.", "A more complex approach to identifying problem jobs before there is evidence of an injury entails employers\u2019 looking for workplace conditions that may contribute to MSDs. This more complex method could include screening and evaluating jobs for particular workplace conditions that may contribute to MSDs, such as awkward postures, forceful exertions, repetitive motions, and vibration. Screening and evaluation could be achieved through walk-through observational surveys, interviews with employees and supervisors, or the use of checklists for scoring risk factors.", "Experts and recent literature also recognize that employers may have to prioritize which jobs or job tasks will receive immediate attention. It is generally agreed that jobs in which MSDs are being reported should be given top priority. Factors to consider in prioritizing problem jobs might be whether past records have noted a high incidence or severity of MSDs, which jobs have a large number of affected employees, or whether changes in work methods for that job will be taking place anyway."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analyzing and Developing Controls for Problem Jobs", "paragraphs": ["The first step in eliminating the hazard is to analyze the job or job task to identify the ergonomic hazards present in the job.

Different ways facilities can carry out medical management include encouraging early reporting of symptoms of MSDs and ensuring that employees do not fear reprisal or discrimination on the basis of such reporting; ensuring prompt evaluation of MSD reports by health care providers; making health care providers familiar with jobs, perhaps through periodic facility walk-throughs or review of job analysis reports, detailed job descriptions, or videotapes of problem jobs; and giving employees with diagnosed MSDs restricted or transitional duty assignments (often referred to as \u201clight\u201d duty) until effective controls are installed on the problem job, and conducting follow-up or monitoring to ensure that they continue to be protected from exposure to ergonomic hazards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected OSHA Efforts Encourage Employers to Implement These Core Elements", "paragraphs": ["Federal and state-operated OSHA programs have undertaken a number of enforcement and education efforts to encourage employers to adopt the core elements of an ergonomics program. For example, as a result of inspections under the general duty clause, OSHA has entered into a number of corporate settlement agreements, primarily with automobile manufacturing and food processing employers, that allow these employers to take actions to implement these core elements in an effort to reduce the identified hazards according to an agreed-upon timetable. OSHA monitors the employers\u2019 progress under the agreement and will not cite them as long as the terms of the agreement are upheld. In 1996, OSHA introduced a nursing home initiative, under which it targeted nursing homes in seven states for inspection to look for evidence of safety and health programs as evidenced by these core elements. Before launching the enforcement part of the effort, OSHA sponsored safety and health seminars for the nursing home industry to help employers implement safety and health programs.", "The North Carolina state-operated program makes extensive use of settlement agreements for employers that have been found during investigations to have ergonomic hazards. Under what it calls the Cooperative Assessment Program (CAP) for Ergonomics, employers are not cited for ergonomic hazards if they enter into and make a good faith effort to comply with these agreements, under which they must take actions to implement the core elements of a safety and health program. To help these and other employers learn how to develop programs, the state recently established an ergonomics resources center that provides a variety of ergonomic services to employers. The California state-operated program creates joint agreements and \u201cspecial orders\u201d for individual employers when ergonomic hazards are identified during an inspection. These agreements and orders require employers to take corrective action to reduce the identified hazards according to a particular timetable; if the employers take the corrective actions specified, no penalties are assessed.", "Instead of using the general duty clause, some states have used existing regulatory authorities that require employers to establish worksite safety and health programs, workplace safety committees, or both to encourage employers to address MSDs. These safety and health programs must have particular elements, such as the identification of problem jobs and training, and in some cases, the committees themselves are responsible for undertaking particular activities. For example, in Oregon, workplace committees are required to conduct particular activities as they relate to identification of ergonomic hazards.", "Through Cooperative Compliance Programs, federal and state-operated OSHA programs have targeted certain employers because of their high rates of injuries or high numbers of workers\u2019 compensation claims and offered them a chance to work with OSHA to reduce hazards in exchange for not being inspected. If employers agree, they must implement a program containing these elements to reduce hazards and injuries. For example, in the Maine 200 program, about 200 Maine employers were invited to develop a comprehensive safety and health program to reduce the injuries and hazards identified by OSHA. Employers \u201cgraduate\u201d from this program once they demonstrate that they have successfully implemented the core elements of a safety and health program, not necessarily because they have achieved a particular reduction in injuries or hazards. Also, OSHA\u2019s Voluntary Protection Program allows employers to be excluded from programmed inspections if they can demonstrate they have an exemplary safety and health program consisting of these core elements.", "Federal and state-operated OSHA programs and other organizations also educate employers about how to reduce MSDs and other safety and health hazards through consultation and technical assistance. The services are typically coordinated by federal or state-operated programs but are actually delivered by state government agencies, universities, or professional consultants. Consultation programs allow employers to contact OSHA or its designee to identify and address safety and health problems outside the enforcement arena. If employers address the hazards identified by these consultants, they can be exempt from inspections for up to 1 year. The consultation and technical assistance services provide information on how to develop effective safety and health programs. A key document used in the provision of these services is OSHA\u2019s Safety and Health Program Management Guidelines, which provides information on how to implement a safety and health program (although it does not include a medical management component). Additionally, because of high rates of MSDs in the meatpacking industry, in 1990 OSHA published the Ergonomics Program Management Guidelines for Meatpacking Plants, a voluntary set of guidelines on how to implement the core elements of an ergonomics program in that industry."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Facilities Have Implemented Core Elements in a Variety of Ways", "paragraphs": ["Each of the facilities we visited displayed all of the core elements of an effective ergonomics program, but the facilities implemented them in a variety of ways that reflected their unique characteristics, such as their different industries and product lines, corporate cultures, and experiences during program evolution.

For two of the elements\u2014identification of problem jobs and development of controls\u2014the facilities displayed a lower level of effort than many of the options identified in the literature would entail. To illustrate, the facilities primarily identified jobs on an \u201cincidence basis,\u201d that is, on the basis of reports of injury, employee discomfort, or other employee requests for assistance, and did not typically screen jobs for ergonomic hazards. The facilities also used an informal process to analyze jobs and develop controls, often relying on in-house resources, and did not typically conduct complex job analyses. Finally, facilities typically implemented what they called \u201clow-tech\u201d controls, those solutions that did not require significant investment or resources, as opposed to more complex controls that drastically changed jobs or operations.

Primary among them was an interest in reducing the workers\u2019 compensation costs associated with MSDs. Additionally, the variation in implementation was often explained by industry type, product lines or production processes, corporate cultures, or experiences during program evolution. For example, most of the employees at the headquarters of American Express Financial Advisors, a financial services employer, are engaged in similar operations that require significant use of computers, so they face similar hazards associated with computer use. Because of this similarity, the cornerstones of the ergonomics program are training for all employees on how to protect themselves from these hazards and developing furniture and equipment standards, which is accomplished by involving such departments as real estate and facilities.", "Facility product lines, production processes, and other individual facility characteristics also affected implementation of the elements. For example, the Navistar facility\u2019s layout has constrained the implementation of some controls. Additionally, Navistar offers customized truck assembly, which often contributes to frequent production and schedule changes. This makes it difficult to ensure that controls are effective in the long run. Finally, because few new employees have been hired in recent years, the facility now has an older workforce that could be more vulnerable to these types of injuries.", "Corporate culture may also influence program development. Both AMP\u2019s and Texas Instruments\u2019 corporate cultures emphasize decentralized operations whereby individual facilities are given considerable flexibility to reach production goals. Local employee teams are key to their operations because they allow for this type of decentralized approach. As a result, the facilities rely extensively on employee teams to implement their ergonomics programs. Texas Instruments has a number of teams throughout its management structure, which address ergonomics in some aspect. Additionally, performance targets drive all corporate and facility activities at Texas Instruments, so these kinds of targets have also been established for the facility\u2019s ergonomics program.", "Experiences during program evolution also have influenced the ultimate shape of the program. At the Texas Instruments facility, where the ergonomics program has been in place the longest (since 1992), the facility is beginning to identify problem jobs on a more proactive basis given that many problem jobs identified on an incidence basis have already been addressed. The Sisters of Charity facility, which initiated its program in 1994 at the invitation of OSHA to participate in the Maine 200 program, is still principally working to control problem jobs as a result of employee requests.

The achievement of these reductions is significant, given that high MSD costs were a major impetus for initiating these programs and lowering these costs was often a major outcome goal.", "These reductions can be attributed to a strong medical management component in the ergonomics program. As the medical director of the Navistar facility explained, the key to a cost-effective ergonomics program is getting injured employees back to work as soon as appropriate, minimizing lost workdays. Officials at several of the facilities said one of their first activities when implementing this program was to assist employees in returning to work. As figure 2 shows, the facilities were able to reduce the number of days injured employees were away from work. Conversely, restricted work days increased at facilities owned by AMP and Sisters of Charity, which officials said reflected their success at bringing employees back to work. This reflects an important challenge to a return-to-work policy, however, because bringing employees back to work as soon as possible may require a greater number of available restricted- or light-duty positions than are often available. For example, according to Navistar officials, light-duty positions for returning employees must be allocated according to the seniority provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, so if an injured employee does not have sufficient seniority, there may not be any light-duty jobs available. Or, the jobs available to less senior employees, such as clean-up duty, are often not appealing to employees who desire productive work. Sisters of Charity officials said they do not have difficulty finding light-duty jobs for employees, but there have been cases in which employees\u2019 restrictions were so severe that it was difficult for these employees to be productive.", "Medical management also includes encouraging employees to report symptoms of MSDs before they become serious injuries requiring more expensive treatment or surgery; as a result, reductions in the average cost per claim reflect early reporting and treatment. The Sisters of Charity facility was the only facility that had not yet experienced a decline in the average cost per claim (although this cost is well within the range of the average cost per MSD claim at other facilities).

Sisters of Charity officials said, in many cases, incident reports must be reviewed to identify whether the injury was caused by ergonomic hazards. Ergonomics staff at the facilities said the OSHA 200 log was not very useful to them for identifying MSDs because it does not allow various injuries that they believe are a result of ergonomic hazards to be recorded as such. For example, officials at several of the facilities said that back injuries, which are often a result of repetitive lifting, are not recorded in the OSHA 200 log in a way that they can be identified as MSDs.", "These employers used their respective corporate workers\u2019 compensation databases to help them identify what types of injuries should be included as MSDs for the program, as well as to track reductions in these injuries and illnesses. Several of the facilities worked with their insurance company, or the administrator of their insurance policy, to help track these injuries and illnesses and related costs. However, because corporate workers\u2019 compensation databases included different categories of injuries, and because facilities differed in the frequency and type of injuries experienced, facilities used different categories of injuries to track MSDs. For example, while all of the facilities included injuries or illnesses that resulted from obviously repetitive activity, some also included those that were the result of a one-time occurrence. Differences of opinion also existed in at least one facility between the ergonomist and corporate management as to what categories should be included to track MSDs.Using cost data, like workers\u2019 compensation costs, to interpret outcomes is also problematic, because health care costs in general continue to rise and there is often a several-year lag between the time injuries occur and when a workers\u2019 compensation claim is finally closed. Such lags, if large, could make tracking program performance difficult.", "Facilities experienced other factors that made it difficult to interpret outcomes in light of program efforts, including limited data on program costs, the effects of growing employee awareness of MSDs, changes in staffing levels, and the effect of increasing workloads. For example, facilities did not track the total costs of the ergonomics programs, so they did not know whether the reductions in MSD costs and other outcomes exceeded program expenditures. Facility officials said it was also difficult to know whether these outcomes resulted solely from investments taken to reduce ergonomic hazards or from other productivity and quality investments as well. However, these officials said that many ergonomic investments were small, and at several facilities, a written justification was needed only when the cost of proposed controls was over a certain threshold. Despite their strong commitment to their program, officials at AMP emphasized that the limited number of years of its trend data makes it difficult to draw any conclusions at this time regarding the impact of its program.", "Facility officials also stated that increases in MSDs and claims, at least initially, could result from growing awareness of ergonomic hazards. At the Texas Instruments facility, ergonomics awareness training contributed to employees\u2019 making more MSD claims in 1994 (see app. VII). MSDs and workers\u2019 compensation claims can also be affected by changes in staffing levels, as new employees may be more likely to get hurt, and the threat of layoffs may encourage employees to report discomfort or injuries. Since 1988, American Express Financial Advisors has experienced significant increases in staffing levels and workloads, increases that officials said need to be considered when looking at its claim experience (see app. III).", "Other facility officials said claims tend to increase before a layoff, then decline again when employees are recalled to work.

Federal and state-operated OSHA programs have tried to provide information, technical assistance, and consultation in an effort to respond to employers\u2019 interest in these initiatives.", "The flexibility provided by OSHA under the Maine 200 cooperative compliance program was key to the success of the Sisters of Charity facility in reducing MSDs. Sisters of Charity was not given targets for reduction of injuries or hazards, but it was required to implement a comprehensive safety and health program. To help Sisters of Charity accomplish this, an OSHA compliance officer was specifically assigned to it (and to other employers in the health care industry as well) for the duration of its participation in the program. The compliance officer was responsible for becoming familiar with the facility to help identify and evaluate controls, perform on-site monitoring inspections to ensure Sisters of Charity was implementing the core elements of a safety and health program, and review quarterly progress reports Sisters of Charity provided to OSHA. The compliance officer monitored Sisters of Charity\u2019s progress against the provisions in the Safety and Health Program Management Guidelines, looking for continuous improvement and \u201cscoring\u201d the facility on how well it was implementing key elements of the program. Sisters of Charity graduated from the program in 1996 because it had, in the judgment of OSHA, made sufficient progress in establishing the elements of an effective program. Sisters of Charity officials said the value of this approach was not only the hands-on assistance provided by OSHA, but also the compliance officer\u2019s familiarity with the facility, which made it possible for OSHA to appropriately judge the efforts Sisters of Charity was making. OSHA is currently developing a safety and health program management standard based on the guidelines and on evidence that such worksite programs can reduce injuries and illnesses.", "OSHA\u2019s settlement agreements for MSDs have also provided some degree of flexibility, as they require employers to implement core elements of an ergonomics program but allow employers to carry out these elements under negotiated timetables with little threat of citation unless the company fails to comply with the overall agreement. OSHA attributes significant progress made by selected employers in reducing ergonomic hazards to a great extent to these agreements. In addition, we interviewed officials from two states with regulations that require employers to establish worksite safety and health programs or committees who view these regulations as a way to leverage existing resources to encourage employers to address ergonomic hazards, especially when MSDs constitute a significant portion of their injuries and illnesses. Officials said these programs require employers to take actions to reduce injuries and illnesses but allow the employers some discretion about what actions they will take.", "North Carolina offers a model of combining a flexible regulatory approach\u2014as reflected in the CAP program, which has general requirements for implementing the core elements of an ergonomics program\u2014with the provision of technical assistance through the state\u2019s Ergonomics Resources Center. Several employers involved with this effort said that the flexibility in these agreements and the availability of technical assistance were very helpful to them, because they were new to ergonomics and did not know where to begin.", "Although these initiatives reflect the value of employer-provided flexibility, they may not offer a complete solution to protecting employees from MSDs. For example, while the Sisters of Charity facility demonstrated significant reductions in workers\u2019 compensation costs for MSDs and in the number of days employees lost from work, progress was more mixed in terms of reducing all injuries and illnesses, the average cost per MSD, and the number of days employees were assigned to restricted work activity.While these results would suggest that the facility has made some progress, it is not clear whether the requirements of the Maine 200 program ensure that this would be the case for every employer or that employees are adequately protected. Additionally, OSHA officials in Maine said the Maine 200 program required more resources than originally anticipated and that if they were to do this again, they might be more selective in the number of employers they targeted. Moreover, safety and health program requirements exist only in some states and often for selected industries, which limits the number of employers covered. The North Carolina initiative is small and new and has not yet been fully evaluated. OSHA\u2019s efforts to expand Cooperative Compliance Programs similar to Maine 200 to other states continue to evolve, as OSHA deals with the difficult issues raised by employers and labor advocates alike about the most effective ways to target employers for inclusion into these programs, provide employers flexibility to take action, and adequately protect employees. Additionally, labor representatives have stressed the need for OSHA to provide (1) the necessary guidance to employers who are targeted by these programs so they know what actions to take and (2) the tools to OSHA compliance officers to help them adequately evaluate employer efforts. In the absence of a standard, these programs rely largely on an employer\u2019s willingness to take action to reduce ergonomic hazards.", "Our case study employers reported that, although they had made significant use of in-house engineering and other resources to analyze problem jobs and develop controls, they did, on occasion, call upon outside resources, including consultants, for information and technical assistance. These officials said that other employers, especially smaller ones, may have an even greater need for help from outside resources to learn how to implement a program or develop controls. This suggests a role for OSHA\u2019s consultation assistance programs in providing, or facilitating the dissemination of, information and technical assistance. For example, 34 states have ergonomics resource personnel among their consultation program staff, according to a recent OSHA survey, and many states offer clearinghouses of information on MSDs, provide training, or have launched technical assistance initiatives specifically for ergonomics.", "Federal and state-operated OSHA programs also provide grants to employers\u2014for example, to smaller employers to provide for ergonomic training, or, as in Oregon, to employers or employer groups to develop and implement solutions to workplace ergonomic problems that cannot be solved with available technology.

Further, although employers are currently required to record information on workplace injuries and illnesses on the OSHA 200 log, the case study facilities have found that the log does not facilitate the collection of accurate data on MSDs. In 1996, OSHA proposed changes to simplify how all injuries and illnesses could be recorded on the OSHA 200 log. As a part of this proposal, OSHA specified criteria for recording MSDs that would include a diagnosis by a health care provider that an injury or illness is an MSD and an \u201cobjective\u201d finding, such as inflammation, or a report of two or more applications of hot or cold therapy. These criteria would be applied equally to all cases involving any part of the body, including backs.

More importantly, we found that these efforts do not necessarily have to involve costly or complicated processes or controls, because employers were able to achieve results through a variety of simple, flexible approaches. Our findings are based on a small number of cases and are not generalizable to all workplaces. However, the qualitative information provides important insights into employers\u2019 efforts to protect their workers from ergonomic hazards. Additionally, experts from the business, labor, and academic communities reviewed the results of our case studies and said our findings on employer efforts to reduce MSDs were consistent with their experiences.", "Our work also found that these facilities\u2019 programs included all of the core elements highlighted in the literature and by experts as key to an effective program\u2014management commitment, employee involvement, identification of problem jobs, analyzing and developing controls for problem jobs, training and education, and medical management\u2014with the elements customized to account for local conditions. Uncertainties continue to exist about particular aspects of MSDs that may complicate regulatory action by OSHA, and our analysis does not allow us to draw any conclusions about whether a standard for MSDs is merited.

BLS 1994 data showed that other industries (such as services, retail trade, and communications) known for office environments and the use of computers were reporting high rates of illnesses due to repeated trauma, and interviews with experts and a review of the current articles in the press revealed increasing concerns about hazards in the office environment. There was also concern about the hazards in the health care industry; in fact, in 1996, OSHA instituted an initiative to provide training to nursing homes to reduce injuries. As a result, we decided the other two case studies would include an employer whose employees worked largely in an office or computer environment and an employer in the health care industry.", "We categorized the 132 nominations by manufacturing and other industries.

In 1990, it hired a consultant to provide ergonomics awareness training to selected departments that faced ergonomic hazards. AEFA\u2019s safety department began to receive employee complaints about physical discomfort and requests to evaluate their workstations to improve the layout, which officials believed was at least partly the result of this training. AEFA staff tried to accommodate these requests but were unable to keep up with the demand. Additionally, in 1992, workers\u2019 compensation costs for MSDs increased significantly. Then, after the 1993 budget had been approved, the director of support services decided to establish an ergonomics function in his department. Assuring top management that this action would not affect budget or personnel ceilings, he reallocated a portion of his furniture budget to support a full-time ergonomist to be responsible for the program. This ergonomist was hired in 1993 and took the lead in implementing the program.", "A major staff reorganization also provided the opportunity to develop an ergonomics function.

This team reviewed available information and selected several potential chairs, which employees then tested and rated. On the basis of employee feedback and other criteria (such as delivery time and warranty), the team selected for purchase the two highest rated chairs. In so doing, AEFA reduced purchasing costs, by buying in large quantities, as well as increased employee comfort. In much the same manner, a team was assembled to design and select new adjustable furniture for private offices. The team, which included the ergonomist, developed specifications for the furniture, then the purchasing and real estate departments worked with a vendor to develop furniture that met these specifications. In the end, AEFA was able to buy this adjustable furniture for about the same price as other furniture, while it also increased comfort, reduced future injuries, and now expects to save additional resources from not having to retrofit furniture every time employees relocate.", "AEFA also has invested significant resources to train employees. Office ergonomics training is strongly encouraged, and employees generally are not able to have their workstations adjusted by the facilities department without first attending training.

During these evaluations, which take about 30 minutes, the ergonomics specialist interviews the employee, watches him or her perform the job, and determines whether he or she is performing any activities outside of work that may be contributing to the discomfort or injury. When the evaluation is triggered by an injury, the ergonomics specialist adheres to a questionnaire that collects information about the job (such as whether the workstation is shared, what types of tasks are performed, and how often tasks are performed) as well as about the workstation itself (such as height of the work surface, location of the keyboard and mouse, and height of the monitor). The questionnaire also asks for information about the presence of risk factors for particular parts of the body.

Because most employees covered by the program face similar computer-related hazards, in many cases, controls have been developed by first determining whether employees have the equipment available from the approved computer accessories listing. If necessary, AEFA works with its real estate and purchasing departments to design or obtain a piece of furniture or equipment that is not already available in-house. If the ergonomics specialist recommends controls such as taking rest breaks, the employee and supervisor are supposed to work together to achieve this. If adjustments to the employee\u2019s workstation are required, the ergonomics specialist will put in a requisition to the facilities department to adjust the workstation, which is typically done within a week.", "To ensure that these controls are effective over the long term, AEFA has developed a database that contains the results of each workstation evaluation performed. Each employee\u2019s \u201cprofile\u201d (that is, workstation measurements, preferences such as left- or right-handed mouse, appropriate monitor height, and equipment used) is kept in this database; currently the database contains about 4,000 employee profiles.

So, while controls already implemented have helped to reduce reports of MSDs in the re-reeling department, the ergonomics team continues to work to improve this job. For example, the introduction of vacuum lifts to lift boxes from the conveyor to a skid for packaging slowed the operator down while he or she manipulated the boxes so they were properly oriented before being placed on the skid.

Additionally, Tower City reduced the number of lost days by 78 for every 100 employees from 1993 through 1996. In contrast, during the same period the number of restricted days increased by 21 for every 100 employees, which, in fact, may be the consequence of bringing more injured workers back to work (see fig. 2).

Process mapping enables the facility to demonstrate how comparatively fewer steps (less time and shorter distances) are required to perform the same activity. For example, employees used to have to manually search through bins filled with numerous channels, or attachments, to locate, align, and fix a particular channel on a die to guide a newly manufactured terminal as it was re-reeled. Through process mapping, a new way of attaching the matching channel to the die earlier in the process was identified.

Originally designed to produce pick-up trucks, the facility was built in 1967 and currently employs about 4,000 employees, most of whom work on the production floor assembling truck parts. About 80 percent of Navistar\u2019s workforce is unionized and under contract with the United Auto Workers (UAW). Some office employees and security personnel are also unionized at the local level.", "The culture at Navistar has influenced the implementation of the ergonomics program. For example, the UAW bargaining agreement requires each facility to have an ergonomics program that includes employee involvement in the identification of hazards and selection of control methods; job analysis to identify ergonomic risk factors and target ergonomic interventions; training for employees; and active involvement of the medical department in the identification of problems, medical evaluation, treatment, rehabilitation, record keeping, and job placement of restricted workers, among other requirements.", "Navistar\u2019s facilities have flexibility in how they carry out their ergonomics programs and achieve bargaining agreement requirements, safety and health standards, and injury reporting requirements. Thus, the programs differ somewhat from one facility to another. For example, only three of Navistar\u2019s facilities have full-time ergonomists to lead the ergonomics programs. Additionally, because of experiences during program evolution, the membership of the ergonomics committees may differ from one facility to the next.", "Local facility conditions also affect program implementation. A key feature of Navistar\u2019s products is that they can be customized; this means that production lines and processes at the Springfield facility can change frequently. Additionally, because there is cyclical demand for any particular product, production line speeds can vary significantly. Both of these factors mean that jobs or job tasks may change every few months. This poses challenges for Springfield to identify particular problem jobs and ensure that controls are effective over the long term. Additionally, Springfield has hired relatively few new employees over the past 2 decades, and over the past several years its staffing level has remained fairly stable. As a result, the facility\u2019s workforce is composed largely of men whose average age is 50. While the collective experience of this workforce helps to prevent injuries, it also may be problematic, because as employees age they may be more susceptible to injury. In 1994, Springfield did hire about 500 new employees, a large number of whom were women, but they were subsequently laid off throughout 1995.

Composed of line employees, these committees were tasked with looking for problem jobs and developing controls. However, the employees on these committees often lacked knowledge of ergonomics, lacked the engineering resources necessary to implement suggested controls, and found it difficult to meet because of workload demands. Additionally, Springfield also found there were too many employees on its committee to make it effective. As a result, Navistar and the UAW decided to restructure committee membership so that the only required members would be the local union safety representative and a management safety representative, with other employees brought in as appropriate.", "In 1991, Springfield decided to hire its first ergonomist to coordinate the ergonomics program.

Additionally, the ergonomist provides training to Springfield employees and develops ergonomic guidelines for them to follow.", "Navistar has also integrated ergonomic principles into corporate accountability mechanisms. For instance, Springfield is given a cumulative percentage reduction goal for injuries and illnesses. The percentage reduction is based on the number of incidents, the frequency of those incidents, the number of incidents with lost time, and costs for workers\u2019 compensation. Springfield also uses 5-year strategic business plans that lay out goals and timeframes for completion of those goals. Achieving these goals contributes to compensation decisions affecting managers. For the last 2 years, these strategic plans have included goals for the ergonomics program that have been developed by the ergonomist and the UAW representative. The most recent plan calls for redesigning processes ergonomically to reduce injuries and costs associated with MSDs, training technical support staff on ergonomics, and reducing lost time days and dollars by bringing employees on workers\u2019 compensation or medical layoff back to work. Springfield officials said including ergonomic requirements in the strategic business plan has brought ergonomics to the forefront and represents a tangible sign of management commitment.", "Ergonomic principles have also been incorporated into Navistar\u2019s yearly safety audits. For the first time, in 1996, Navistar conducted a safety audit at each of its facilities that scored each facility on various safety matters, including ergonomics. Although the audit was predominantly compliance based (relating to, for example, record-keeping and maintenance issues), it also looked for evidence that an effective ergonomics program was in place\u2014for example, that there was evidence of employee awareness about ergonomics, that processes were in place to evaluate repetitive trauma injuries, and that medical staff were involved in the program. The 1996 score will be used as a baseline to evaluate future performance, and Springfield\u2019s progress relative to this baseline score will be included in future years\u2019 injury and illness reduction goals. Springfield takes the results of this audit seriously; as a result of last year\u2019s audit, Springfield created a management-level ergonomics committee to spread awareness of the ergonomics program. This committee also helps to ensure management support for the program. The committee meets bimonthly and includes representatives from each of the departments of the facility (primarily department heads or their designees). The committee reviews the status, feasibility, and appropriateness of various controls that have been suggested or implemented.", "The ergonomics staff also said that suggestions for ergonomic controls generally have been implemented, although recent budget restrictions have made it more difficult to justify all types of capital investments. However, if Springfield does not have the funds to obtain safety-related items, it can request that corporate Navistar pay for them. Cost justifications are typically required for ergonomic controls, as they are for all capital investments. To justify the purchase of the control, the ergonomist typically cites the costs of injuries or the potential costs of injuries if the control is not implemented. For example, in a cost justification for additional automatic lift tables (tables that keep supplies at an appropriate distance and level for employees by rising as the loads on them decrease), the ergonomist reported that these tables help to reduce shoulder and back injuries, which have cost the facility well over $200,000 a year in workers\u2019 compensation costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Employee Involvement", "paragraphs": ["Navistar relies on committees to accomplish the employee involvement required by the collective bargaining agreement.

Other employees (such as the employee doing the job, a line supervisor, an engineer, and the medical director) are pulled in on an ad hoc basis depending upon the particular job being studied and the expertise needed to develop a control. Officials said this type of committee works well because it is relatively small and focused on a particular job, so the analysis and control development can be done fairly quickly. Additionally, corporate officials said this approach allows Springfield to involve a large number of employees in identifying problem jobs and developing controls in a more efficient way than using a standing committee would allow.", "In some cases, Springfield has formed special committees to address particularly difficult jobs. For example, the \u201cpin job\u201d is considered the most onerous job in the facility. On this job, the frame of the truck is lowered onto the axle. Employees have to \u201cmanhandle\u201d the frame so it aligns with the axle, while simultaneously manually hammering in pins that attach the frame to the axle. This job requires significant force, vibration, and awkward postures. Because previously suggested long-term controls for this job would require significant changes in the production process or in the design of the product, Springfield officials said they have recently created a new committee and given it 6 months and an \u201cunlimited\u201d budget to assess the job and develop alternative types of controls.", "Springfield has also established procedures that allow employees direct access to services. For example, employees can trigger a job analysis simply by submitting a \u201cRequest for Ergonomic Study\u201d form to the ergonomist or UAW representative if they feel discomfort or just want to have an analysis performed. This one-page form elicits basic information about the employee involved (name, time of injury, or type of discomfort reported); the \u201cergonomic concern\u201d being reported (that is, the action that has caused the injury, discomfort, or both); the area of the body affected; and any suggestions the employee may have to alleviate the ergonomic concern.

Facility officials emphasized that this process must be simple in order to encourage employees to report their injuries or discomfort early. When an employee reports an injury or discomfort to the medical department (Springfield has an on-site occupational health clinic), the medical director evaluates whether the injury or discomfort was caused by an ergonomic hazard, and, if so, completes a Request for Ergonomic Study and gives it to the ergonomist or UAW representative. As noted above, employees or supervisors can also complete this form if they or their employees are feeling discomfort that has not yet resulted in a visit to the medical department or if other conditions exist that lead them to believe there are potential problems with the job. Employees can also informally tell the ergonomist or UAW representative about a problem job during their frequent walk-throughs of the facility without using the form to generate a job analysis.", "Springfield does not use a discomfort survey to identify potential problem jobs because the results are difficult to interpret, and a survey carried out by an intern several years ago identified those jobs that the ergonomics staff already knew were problematic. Officials said it is difficult to know whether the discomfort being experienced by employees on particular jobs is attributable to the employee\u2019s aging, or whether it is in fact due to a particular job. Even if it could be determined that the job was causing the discomfort, because the nature of jobs changes frequently, it would be difficult to tell whether the discomfort was the result of the job itself or of the interaction between the employee and the job.", "Although Springfield has spent most of its time on incidence-based identification, the facility has recently started to identify problem jobs on a more proactive basis. The ergonomist asked all supervisors to identify problem jobs on the basis of those staffed mostly by employees with low seniority and those with high turnover. In a unionized environment, as employees gain seniority, they can \u201cbid off\u201d of certain less desirable jobs and onto more desirable ones. This means that those jobs done by employees with the lowest level of seniority are probably jobs that most employees do not want to do\u2014and the probable reason for this is that there are ergonomic hazards on these jobs. Officials said using these indicators may be more appropriate than using risk factors. Virtually any job in a manufacturing environment involves risk factors, they said, so it would be prohibitively time consuming and expensive to use risk factors as a basis to identify problem jobs.", "Although the ergonomist and the UAW representative complete an analysis on every job for which they receive a Request for Ergonomic Study, they currently give the highest priority to those jobs on which injuries have already occurred or discomfort has already been reported to the medical department. The next highest priority is given to those jobs for which a large number of requests for job analysis have been submitted. At this time, the lowest priority is given to those jobs identified by supervisors on the basis of high turnover and low seniority. Aiding in this prioritization is a database developed by the ergonomist called the \u201cErgonomic Log Line Breakdown,\u201d which tracks all requests for job analysis and provides information such as the employee who was involved, the time the injury occurred or discomfort was reported, the job the employee was working on, and the body part affected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analyzing Problem Jobs and Developing Controls", "paragraphs": ["Springfield\u2019s process for analyzing jobs and developing controls was described as simple, informal, and purposely not paper intensive.

In other cases, the committee identifies other operations in the facility to determine whether their controls may be appropriate for this job. The officials said it is imperative that they \u201cwalk the floor\u201d to understand what the jobs are and what types of controls may be effective. For example, for the cab part of the truck to be adequately attached to the frame, the cab must be positioned at a particular angle. To accomplish this, employees previously had to \u201cjack up\u201d the cab with a car-type jack numerous times a day and were experiencing back, shoulder, and other problems as a result. The UAW representative knew that employees on other production lines were using a hydraulic pump to lift up the cab and suggested to the employees working on this process that they look into whether this type of control would work. These employees are now using a hydraulic pump, and discomfort has been reduced.", "For more complex situations, the committee presents the problem to the in-house engineers and asks them to develop controls. For example, on the radiator line, employees had to attach a metal casing (called a \u201chorse collar\u201d) to the radiator, which was suspended from an overhead line. Because the holes on the casing and the radiator were not lining up properly, employees had to manually pry the components with a screwdriver to adjust the holes before inserting the bolts. A number of employees were complaining of fatigue and pain from this job, and there were quality problems because the bolts were sometimes inserted incorrectly. In this case, the in-house engineers designed a U-shaped \u201cspreader bar\u201d that precisely aligns the holes in the radiator with those in the casing. The spreader bar has eliminated the physical strain of the employees and also improved the quality of the work.", "Springfield officials said they used no specific threshold to determine whether and when a control should be put in place. In most cases, these are judgment calls based on several factors, such as the severity of the problem or hazard, the extent to which the problem can be fixed, and the time or resources needed to develop and implement controls. Because of the limited number of in-house engineers to design or implement controls, Springfield tries to prioritize controls on the basis of likely injuries and other costs if the job is not fixed.", "Facility officials acknowledged that the program is never completed and the ergonomics staff is always on the lookout for improving existing controls. However, follow-up is typically informal, as there are insufficient time and resources to formally follow up on all jobs where controls have been implemented. However, the Ergonomic Log Line Breakdown can help the ergonomist determine whether jobs that have been analyzed continue to be the subject of requests for ergonomic study. If they are, the ergonomics staff will continue to revisit those jobs.", "The iterative nature of the program is especially important because not every hazard on every job can be totally eliminated. Facility officials said a small number of jobs they have analyzed have not been able to be fixed, primarily because it would have been prohibitively expensive to do so, requiring a change in product or in the production process. However, even in these cases, as with the pin job, Springfield has made repeated efforts to reduce exposure to hazards through other means. The establishment of the committee to develop controls for the pin job is the most recent example of this iterative process.", "In some cases, it is difficult to implement controls immediately because of the complexity of the product, the customization of the product, or the facility layout. In these cases, changes must often be implemented when a production or schedule change takes place. This was the case with the change in how windshields are installed (see app. II). On the other hand, constantly making changes can make it difficult to know whether controls are working. Additionally, it is not always feasible or appropriate to take a control implemented on one job or workstation and implement it on all similar jobs or workstations. For example, Springfield currently has about 30,000 guns at the facility that are used to drill in bolts. Many of these guns are \u201cimpact\u201d guns that have excessive vibration, but they are very powerful. As many of the impact guns wear out, Springfield is replacing them with \u201cnutrunner\u201d guns, which are less powerful but cause less vibration.

To participate, the medical center and nursing home had to conduct a baseline hazard survey to identify existing hazards, set up an action plan that outlined the steps the facility would take to address identified hazards, and establish a comprehensive safety and health program that would seek to reduce injuries and the contributing hazards. The facilities were also required to report quarterly to OSHA on their progress and allow OSHA inspectors to conduct on-site monitoring visits.

WorkMed has helped design new office space in the medical records department and the emergency registration area at the medical center, as well as in other areas. Additionally, the nursing home recently bought new medical carts to eliminate identified ergonomic hazards. Medical carts are used to store residents\u2019 medications and are wheeled around the nursing home when medications are dispersed.

The supervisor\u2019s form elicits information about the length of time the employee has been doing this task or job, what may have contributed to the incident, corrective actions the supervisor has taken for the affected employee (which must be taken within 72 hours), and actions the supervisor is taking to prevent a similar incident in the future. This form is then forwarded to WorkMed, which performs a physical examination of the employee. After the examination, WorkMed determines whether the injury or reported discomfort is due to ergonomic hazards (such as experiencing shoulder pain from prolonged use of microscopes) and, if so, WorkMed performs a workstation evaluation. Workstation evaluations can also be triggered simply by a phone call to WorkMed if the employee does not need a physical examination.", "Although SOCHS devotes most of its time to workstation evaluations resulting from complaints of discomfort or employee requests for assistance, SOCHS also identifies problem jobs on the basis of potential risks.

Since 1995, SOCHS has spent about $10,000 for evaluations at the nursing home and the medical center.", "Although SOCHS does not typically videotape jobs, it may perform detailed analyses of jobs. For example, in the surgical area at the medical center, one job requires a secretary to input a significant number of medical charges into a computer. This is an extremely stressful job, because if items are omitted or input incorrectly, the medical center loses revenue. The secretary is required to perform several other tasks simultaneously, which contributes to the overall difficulty of the job. In doing its analysis of this job, SOCHS evaluated not only the physical characteristics of the workstation (work surface and chair height), but also the environment (noise and other distracting influences) and the numerous additional required tasks to determine whether any of these tasks could be eliminated or altered to reduce the stress of the position and increase the efficiency of the data input process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Process Used to Develop Controls", "paragraphs": ["Once the WorkMed staff have completed the workstation evaluation, they work with the employee who performs the job, in-house engineering staff, or others to \u201cbrainstorm\u201d possible suggestions for eliminating the identified hazard.

WorkMed officials said that when developing controls, they try to do those things that are easy to accomplish or fairly inexpensive. Additionally, for the duration of its participation in the Maine 200, SOCHS obtained ideas for controls from the compliance officer who had been assigned to it. Because of her familiarity with SOCHS and because she also had been assigned to similar employers in the health care industry, she was able to suggest ideas for controls that had worked for other employers.", "WorkMed incorporates these suggestions into its evaluation summary\u2014a two- to three-page memorandum that is provided to the director of risk management and the employee\u2019s supervisor. The director of risk management evaluates the suggestions; determines how much implementing them will cost; and forwards them, along with their costs, to the cognizant department head for review and approval. For example, WorkMed recently suggested controls to alleviate employee discomfort in the shoulders and neck from excessive phone use, and back and arm discomfort from inappropriate computer workstation design in the medical center\u2019s reception area. WorkMed suggested buying headsets for the employees; putting monitors on articulating risers so they could be placed at appropriate heights for numerous users; and buying ergonomic chairs, among other suggested controls. These controls will cost about $4,000.", "In many cases, controls have been developed by in-house engineering staff.

In another instance, in-house engineers designed a wood computer monitor riser that elevates monitors to the appropriate height.", "Facility officials agreed that analyzing problem jobs and developing controls must be a long-term effort, and the key is to look for continuous improvement. Accordingly, WorkMed or the ergonomics staff follows up after a workstation evaluation is performed if problems persist.", "Officials also mentioned that not all problems can be fixed immediately, since the ability to implement controls is often dependent upon available resources. For example, the ideal way to adequately address the hazards on the surgical secretary job mentioned above would be to implement a computer system that would allow employees to input the medical charges as they are accrued, thereby reducing the amount of keying required by the secretary. However, this type of computer system could cost over $200,000. Until the facility is able to afford this control or comes up with another alternative, SOCHS is trying other methods, such as rotating workers through the position on a part-time basis, in order to relieve the pressure of this job."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Types of Controls Implemented", "paragraphs": ["SOCHS has implemented a mix of controls equally distributed between engineering controls (such as buying equipment), which alleviate or reduce hazards, and administrative controls, which encourage proper work techniques.

SOCHS has instituted a variety of other types of engineering controls in the laboratory area at the medical center. Employees who work in this area use computers, phones, and microscopes extensively. Because of the former configuration of lab counters and chairs, employees often had to use awkward postures to input data or use the microscopes. As a result, employees were experiencing shoulder, neck, and hand discomfort, as well as some injuries. SOCHS lowered the countertops, bought adjustable ergonomic chairs, placed the monitors on articulating monitor risers to accommodate multiple users, raised the microscopes, and put glare screens on the computers. In the laundry room area, SOCHS has also placed false bottoms in laundry bins that rise as the load becomes lighter so employee bending and reaching are minimized.", "SOCHS has also used administrative controls. For example, smaller laundry bags that hold only a limited amount of laundry are now used so employees\u2019 lifting requirements are lessened. SOCHS has also purchased antifatigue mats for its employees who stand while working. SOCHS has also offered body mechanics training and increased staffing to better manage high workloads in some work areas. WorkMed officials emphasized that quite often controls involve telling employees how to use better work practices. For example, recently a laboratory employee was experiencing a great deal of wrist pain resulting from the practice of dropping liquid from an eyedropper into a test tube. After watching the employee perform the job, it was found that she was flicking her wrist back after she dropped the liquid in the test tube. In this case, the control was a recommendation that she not flick her wrist. In the medical center\u2019s medical records area, employees were also experiencing wrist and hand pain from shoving copies of patient records onto shelves.

If employees do not attend this training, they will not receive their performance ratings. SOCHS officials said this training is required by several OSHA standards, Maine\u2019s accreditation committee for health care organizations, and a state law that requires training for employees who work in front of video display terminals for at least 4 hours a day. Other general awareness education for ergonomics has been provided through an employee newsletter and advice from a \u201csafety mascot.\u201d", "The officials said that it is not feasible to require employees to attend training for more than 4 hours at a time or more than once a year.

Officials said this was a major emphasis for them, since the large number of workers\u2019 compensation claims with lost workdays was a basis for their inclusion in Maine 200. In fact, when SOCHS began this program, a number of employees were out on disability, and SOCHS immediately tried to get them back to work on restricted duty.

If the trust becomes larger than SOCHS believes is required, it can withdraw any excess funds. In 1996, SOCHS withdrew $800,000.", "Nonetheless, the officials said a number of issues need to be considered when evaluating these data. First, when SOCHS implemented its program, officials found the existing systems were inadequate to track injury and claim experience, so SOCHS developed two databases\u2014one based on the Report of Employee Incident form and the other based on workers\u2019 compensation claim experience. These databases help SOCHS officials monitor injuries and claims, but officials said they do not typically isolate injuries that would be categorized as MSDs because SOCHS has sought to reduce all types of injuries and their associated costs. Officials said it could be difficult to isolate MSDs from other injuries, since doing so would require that all Report of Employee Incident forms be reviewed to fully understand the circumstances of the incidents and, thereby, determine whether the injuries resulted from ergonomic hazards.", "Officials also said costs can be significantly affected by one or two large claims. For example, in 1996, the medical center had a total of 179 lost workdays, 157 of which resulted from one claim. Thus, this one claim was in large part responsible for the increase in average MSD cost discussed above. Officials also said the number of incidents is likely to increase because early reporting is being encouraged.", "Moreover, officials said it was difficult to know how much of a reduction in injuries, illnesses, and associated costs is appropriate. They agreed that it was appropriate for OSHA not to impose specific performance goals, such as a certain percentage reduction in workers\u2019 compensation costs, given the newness of the program.

Additionally, the average cost for each MSD claim declined from $21,946 in 1991 to $5,322 in 1996 (see fig. 3).", "Total Dollars for MSD Claims (in Thousands)", "Corporate officials said that increased awareness of ergonomics can lead to higher reporting of MSDs and, consequently, higher workers\u2019 compensation claims and costs. The officials said the high cost of MSDs in 1991 can be attributed to the efforts the facility made to increase awareness in the late 1980s; similarly, the spike in 1994 can be attributed to heavy awareness training in the early 1990s, as well as a notification sent to all employees in 1993 of a possible program shutdown due to cutbacks in federal contracts (the shutdown was ultimately averted). Officials said employees are more likely to report injuries before a shutdown in order that they might collect workers\u2019 compensation benefits should they be laid off.", "Officials also said they could not estimate total program costs or determine whether the reductions in MSD costs and other outcomes exceeded program expenditures. A facility official said it would be difficult to distinguish between those investments made for ergonomic reasons and those made for other purposes, such as to enhance productivity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reductions in Injuries and Illnesses According to the OSHA 200 Log", "paragraphs": ["Trends in overall injuries and illnesses reported in the OSHA 200 log are important because MSDs account for a significant portion of all injuries and illnesses at our case study facilities and because these data are what OSHA looks at when inspecting a facility. Furthermore, OSHA 200 data are key to how TI measures safety and health performance. In fact, using OSHA 200 data, Lewisville was able to demonstrate that it had achieved in 1996 its yearly target of a 20-percent reduction in the overall incidence rate and the lost or restricted workday rate. Meeting this goal contributed to the corporationwide goal of eliminating all preventable occupational and nonoccupational injuries and illnesses by the year 2005.", "The facility\u2019s incidence rate\u2014the number of injuries and illnesses per 100 employees\u2014for all injuries and illnesses recorded in its OSHA 200 log declined from 5.5 in 1991 to 1.5 in 1996 (see fig. 4). The 1995 incidence rate of about 2.1 was below the industry average of 3.8 for other manufacturers of semiconductors and related devices in 1995, the most recent year for which these data are available. Additionally, between 1991 and 1996, Lewisville reduced the number of lost and restricted days for every 100 employees by 66 days and 15 days, respectively (see fig. 2).", "While TI relies on OSHA 200 log data to track corporate performance in safety and health, facility officials said it is important that the right OSHA data be tracked.

However, they also said they are just beginning to consider how productivity gains through ergonomic improvements might be documented. These officials believe that productivity gains will be more difficult to demonstrate than injury and illness reduction, because most of the \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d (that is, problem jobs that are easier to identify and control) has already been addressed at Lewisville.", "Currently, Lewisville is piloting productivity studies. For example, the ergonomics team will be examining production bottlenecks to which ergonomic hazards might be contributing. The team refers to these efforts as its Continuous Flow Manufacturing Program. Recent efforts to improve hand tools are part of this initiative. In addition, the Systems Group Ergonomics Council recommended that Lewisville and other Systems Group facilities and their respective ergonomics teams begin to compare the productivity of operations at workstations that have adjustable-height equipment with the productivity of operations at workstations that do not have this equipment. Productivity changes will be measured in terms of cycle time, output, and ergonomic gains. In addition, to document any productivity changes, the ergonomics specialist plans to videotape these jobs before and after the introduction of the adjustable-height workstations.", "Evidence regarding morale improvement was largely anecdotal. However, corporate and facility staff emphasized that the ergonomics efforts at TI were consistent with quality management principles and that employee participation and empowerment are key to employee satisfaction.
