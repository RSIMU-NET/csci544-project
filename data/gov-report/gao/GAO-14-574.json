Further, Ex-Im stated that it will develop and implement  instructions for loan officers regarding the preparation and inclusion of all  required documents in a loan file and mechanisms to oversee compliance  with Ex-Im\u2019s existing procedures prior to loan guarantee approval. Ex-Im  also stated that it would document its risk-based approach for scheduling  delegated authority lender examinations and its fraud process, including a  description of roles and responsibilities. If implemented effectively, Ex- Im\u2019s planned actions should address the intent of our recommendations.", "We are sending copies of this report to appropriate congressional  committees, the Chairman of the U.S. Export-Import Bank of the United  States, and the Ex-Im Inspector General.

We also examined Ex-Im\u2019s charter, credit framework, content  policy, and other due diligence procedures. We compared the various  requirements and guidance to Ex-Im\u2019s Loan, Guarantee and Insurance  Manual (Manual), which describes, among other things, Ex-Im\u2019s  procedures for assessing loan guarantee applications and preparing loan  agreements. In addition, we reviewed Ex-Im\u2019s Office of Inspector  General (IG) reports since 2009 related to underwriting issues, various  laws applicable to Ex-Im, and GAO reports related to Ex-Im. We also  discussed underwriting requirements and the due diligence process with  Ex-Im officials. For the implementation of the underwriting process, we  identified key procedures from Ex-Im\u2019s Manual. We also reviewed Ex-Im\u2019s  loan files used to document procedures performed during the  underwriting process and Ex-Im\u2019s financial statements from 2011 through  2013 along with other reports summarizing loan guarantee amounts.", "To select loan files to review, we obtained Ex-Im\u2019s population of all  authorized loan guarantee transactions from October 1, 2011, to   March 31, 2013, which included data such as borrower, authorization  amount and date, lender name, and product type. The total loan  guarantee population contained 275 medium- and long-term loan  guarantees totaling $21.9 billion and 792 working capital loan guarantees  totaling $4.0 billion, which were authorized by Ex-Im from October 1,  2011, to March 31, 2013. To assess the reliability of data provided by Ex- Im, we analyzed information related to data elements and controls,  reviewed the data for obvious errors in accuracy and completeness,  compared data to published documents, and interviewed knowledgeable  Ex-Im officials about the data. We concluded that the data elements we  used were sufficiently reliable for purposes of selecting samples of loan  guarantee transactions to review and for describing Ex-Im\u2019s loan  guarantee balances.", "Because of the differences in the underwriting process between the  working capital loan guarantees and the medium- and long-term loan  guarantees, we divided the population into two groups. The medium- and  long-term guarantees were combined in one group while the working  capital loan guarantees were placed in another group. For each sample,  we made estimates for an attribute measure at the 95 percent level of  confidence. From the sample design, we were able to conclude that the  population error rate was less than 5 percent at the 95 percent level of  confidence when no control violations were discovered in the sample. The  final samples for the medium- and long-term transactions and the working  capital transactions were 54 and 58, respectively.", "Because we followed a probability procedure based on random  selections, each of our samples is only one of a large number of samples  that we might have drawn. Since each sample could have provided  different estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our  particular sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence interval (e.g., plus  or minus 7 percentage points). This is the interval that would contain the  actual population value for 95 percent of the samples we could have  drawn. Confidence intervals are provided along with each sample  estimate in the report. The results from our samples apply to the universe  of loan guarantees authorized from October 1, 2011, to March 31, 2013.", "Based on our review of the Manual and the key procedures we identified,  we developed a data collection instrument for working capital loan  guarantee transactions and another data collection instrument for  medium- and long-term loan guarantee transactions, which we used to  test the two samples extracted from the loan guarantee population.", "Working capital loan guarantees. We divided our working capital loan  guarantee data collection instrument into delegated authority and  nondelegated authority transactions. For each nondelegated authority  working capital loan guarantee transaction in our sample, we reviewed  the credit memo to determine if Ex-Im documented the following: credit  reports on individual guarantor(s) or Dunn and Bradstreet reports if the  guarantor was a business, analysis of contract and payment terms,  financial analysis, bank references, collateral, and additionality. We also  tested to see if exporter eligibility; Character, Reputational, and  Transaction Integrity reviews, which included due diligence for Iran  sanctions and other reputational risks; and appropriate signatures for  approval from Ex-Im management were documented. For delegated  authority working capital loan guarantees, we reviewed the selected  transactions for exporter credit reports to determine if Ex-Im addressed  any risks associated with the transaction participants and reviewed Dunn  and Bradstreet reports on the exporter. We tested to see if all required  information and approvals were contained in Ex-Im\u2019s Application  Processing System, including documentation of the type of loan facility, a  product description, primary and secondary collateral, use of proceeds,  export markets, export value, loan amount, additionality, and any  environmental impacts. In addition, we tested to see if the loan amount on  our sample was equal to the loan amount reported in the Application  Processing System and that the transaction was properly classified as a  working capital transaction. We also tested to see if an Ex-Im program  management assistant completed and signed a delegated authority  checklist for the borrower that contained information such as the lender,  borrower, loan amount, type of facility, letters of credit, warranties, final  disbursement date, primary and secondary collateral, and term of the  loan. We also tested to see if an appropriate Ex-Im official signed the  delegated authority checklist. For each of the delegated authority working  capital loan guarantee transactions in our sample, we examined Ex-Im\u2019s  available examination reports for the applicable delegated authority  lenders and tested to see if the approved loan guarantee transaction were  within delegated authority lender levels. We requested the three most  recent examinations conducted for the 18 lenders involved in the  delegated authority transactions from our sample (47 out of the 58 items  in our sample were done under delegated authority). For 12 lenders, we  received three reports; we received one report for 4 of the lenders and no  report for 2 of the lenders.", "Medium- and long-term loan guarantees. The key procedures relate to  the following four underwriting activities:  (1) Application screening. For this activity, we evaluated the  documentation of the eligibility of loan guarantee participants and whether  the information contained in the loan guarantee transactions met  minimum eligibility criteria standards. We tested to see if the sample  items contained complete transactional party information, including  applicant, borrower, guarantor, buyer, lender, end user, exporter,  supplier, and guaranteed lender. We determined if the eligibility of the  export item was clearly stated or could be clearly assumed in the sample  documents. We also tested to see if additionality, country eligibility, and  any applicable State Department clearance were recorded. We tested to  see if Ex-Im\u2019s Credit Review and Compliance Division documented the  Character, Reputational, and Transaction Integrity review process prior to  loan guarantee approval which included the full request, the participants  screened list, and the results of the Ex-Im library\u2019s research and  determined if issues identified in this review were resolved by viewing the  board memo for each long-term loan guarantee transaction and the credit  memo for each medium-term loan guarantee transaction. For all board- approved transactions, we also tested to see if the Iran Sanctions  Certification was obtained. For all medium- and long-term loan  guarantee transactions, we tested to see if a credit report, a Dunn and  Bradstreet report, or both dated within 6 months of the application date,  were obtained and maintained or, if not, whether Ex-Im documented why  these reports were not applicable. Further, we tested to see if the loan  guarantee application contained an antilobbying statement and an  Environmental Screening Document.  (2) Risk assessment and due diligence. For this activity, we evaluated  the documentation related to financial risk factors and the commercial  viability of the loan guarantee transaction. We tested to see if the  engineering memo for long-term loan guarantee transactions and the  credit memo for medium-term loan guarantee transactions documented  the eligibility of costs and the value and eligibility of U.S. and foreign  content. For long-term loan guarantee transactions, we tested to see if  Ex-Im documented the environmental impact in the engineering report.  For medium-term loan guarantee transactions, we tested to see if the  Vice President of Ex-Im\u2019s Engineering and Environment Division  conducted an environmental impact analysis. For long-term loan  guarantee transactions that were authorized after May 30, 2012, we  tested to see if a summary of economic impact analysis was included.", "We also tested to see if Ex-Im documented its due diligence over certain  applicable risks and the mitigation of those risks. These risks included  country exposure and technical and environmental risk for long-term loan  guarantee transactions. In addition, we tested to see if Ex-Im performed  due diligence for sovereign risk, political risk, financial institution risk, and  nonfinancial institution risk factors for both medium- and long-term loan  guarantee transactions. We also reviewed credit and board memos to  determine if Ex-Im summarized risks included in credit reports and the  mitigating factors for those risks. We further reviewed loan files to  determine if the overall budget cost level for both medium- and long-term  loan guarantee transactions were documented. For aircraft transactions,  we tested to see if the credit and legal strength, weakness, and  uncertainties analyses were completed. For medium-term loan guarantee  transactions in excess of $1 million, we tested to see if the transaction  risk classification was assessed and documented in the loan file. We  tested the appendixes of the credit memo for long-term loan guarantee  transactions to see if the financial assessment, engineering report,  country risk assessment, risk rating summary, economic analysis, and  any special conditions were documented.  (3) Credit structure. For this activity, we evaluated the documentation of  the financing terms and conditions, including collateral to be  recommended for the loan guarantee transaction. For medium- and long- term loan guarantee transactions, we reviewed the loan file to determine  if Ex-Im documented the exposure fee calculator worksheet; the  repayment terms, to ensure that the terms did not exceed the useful life of  the collateral or scope of supply; the long-term action sheet; and the  medium-term decision memo. We tested to see if collateral for the loan  guarantee had been identified and assessed and to see if the loan  agreement included requirements for the borrower to maintain the  collateral, where applicable.  (4) Credit decision. For this activity, we evaluated the approved amount,  proper categorization of the loan guarantee, and the appropriate records  storage for the loan documentation. For long-term and aircraft loan  guarantee transactions, we tested to see if there was approval by an Ex- Im loan officer, an Ex-Im lawyer, and the Vice President of Trade Finance  on the credit memo. For medium-term loan guarantee transactions, we  tested to see if the credit memo was signed by the appropriate official.  For long-term loan guarantee transactions, we tested to see if approval  signatures on the board memo were documented. For all selected loan  guarantee transactions, we tested to see if the actual loan amount per Ex- Im\u2019s Application Processing System was equal to the loan agreement and  equal to or less than the financed amount approved. We also tested to  see if the loan agreement was signed by all applicable parties and that  the transaction was approved by the appropriate authority level. In  addition, we tested to see if the loan was properly categorized as medium  or long term and that the loan documentation was kept in the appropriate  records storage location.", "For any unresolved issues found on both the working capital and  medium- and long-term loan guarantee data collection instruments, we  followed up with Ex-Im officials to evaluate any additional supporting  documentation not originally included in the loan files. Additionally, we  interviewed Ex-Im loan officers, directors, and other officials to obtain  further perspective on the underwriting process of loan guarantee  transactions.", "To evaluate whether Ex-Im adequately designed procedures to prevent,  detect, and investigate potential fraud in loan guarantee transactions, we  identified key procedures by reviewing Ex-Im\u2019s established procedures  and interviewing officials from the Ex-Im IG. We also interviewed lenders  and Ex-Im officials to identify steps Ex-Im has taken to strengthen lender  fraud procedures. We evaluated the federal standards and, as  appropriate, industry standards and best practices for preventing,  detecting, and investigating fraud. We reviewed Ex-Im\u2019s practices for  verifying that debarred lenders and borrowers have not been authorized  to receive loan guarantees. To assess Ex-Im\u2019s implementation of  procedures to prevent fraudulent applications from being approved, we  reviewed the same sample of loan guarantee transactions described  above to determine whether Ex-Im effectively implemented its  procedures, such as reviewing and evaluating documentation and  implementing its Character, Reputational, and Transaction Integrity  check, to detect and prevent fraudulent applications from being approved  during the underwriting process. To identify and evaluate Ex-Im\u2019s  processes for detecting potential fraud among active loan guarantee  transactions, we interviewed officials about current practices and  reviewed documentation of cases showing how Ex-Im detected potential  fraud under a variety of circumstances.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2013 to September  2014 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for   our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Export- Import Bank of the United States", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contacts named above, Marcia Carlsen (Assistant  Director), Joah Iannotta (Assistant Director), Jeanette Brahame, Michael  Bird, Katy Crosby, Dennis Fauber, Natasha Guerra, Cole Haase, Debra  Hoffman, Dragan Matic, and Carroll Warfield Jr. made key contributions  to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
