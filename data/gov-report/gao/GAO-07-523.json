State and USAID have strategic goals specific to promoting improved education. Several other U.S. agencies support basic education-related activities as part of programs that address their broader mission goals. For example, DOL supports alternative school programs as a way to remove children from exploitative work, USDA provides school meals or take-home rations to students, and DOD constructs dormitories and schools to provide better access for children who have to travel long distances to attend classes. GAO found that agencies did not always coordinate in the planning or delivery of basic education-related activities. From 2001 to 2006, there was no government-wide mechanism to facilitate interagency collaboration and, as a result, GAO identified instances where agencies missed opportunities to collaborate and maximize U.S. resources. In addition, GAO found that the level of U.S. coordination with host governments and other donors in the eight visited countries varied. Without effective coordination, donors cannot easily monitor or assess the host government's progress toward achieving international goals, such as Education for All by 2015, one of State-USAID's strategic goals. While U.S. agencies GAO reviewed conduct basic education-related programs to achieve different goals, most collect and use output measures, such as the numbers of schools built or children enrolled, to assess and report on results. USAID is the only agency with an education-specific goal of increasing access to quality basic education. However, in many instances, USAID faces challenges in collecting valid and reliable data needed to measure improvements in education quality.

Primarily through MEPI, the agency supports  international basic education activities aimed at increasing access to basic  education, especially for girls and women, and improving the quality of  basic education through teacher training, curriculum development, and  community involvement in North African and Middle Eastern countries and  territories. For example, through MEPI, State\u2019s Bureau of Near Eastern  Affairs supports a \u201cscholarships for success\u201d program in Morocco to  increase access to secondary schools for girls living in remote rural  communities through the creation of girls\u2019 dormitories (see fig. 3).

In April 2005, USAID  issued an education strategy that prioritizes the broad education objective  of increasing equitable access to quality education, with the more specific  focuses on primary education and girls\u2019 education. The strategy directs that  USAID focus on (1) increasing access to basic education, (2) improving the  quality of basic education, and (3) building the institutional capacity of the  host countries\u2019 basic education systems. This strategy also supports the  broader State and USAID strategic goals of improving education globally  with a particular emphasis on the Muslim world, as it emphasizes the  importance of education in strategic countries, as well as implementing  international education commitments, such as the Education for All by  2015 initiative.", "In the eight countries we visited, we found that USAID generally  implemented programs that aligned with its three main strategic objectives  and targeted the agencies\u2019 emphasized population of primary-level students  and girls. According to USAID, as a matter of policy, USAID\u2019s efforts focus  on increasing children\u2019s access to quality primary education because the  quality and accessibility of primary education plays a critical role in  determining whether children gain core skills, such as literacy and  numeracy, and have a chance to gain further education. In addition,  USAID has a special focus on girls\u2019 education. Missions engaged in basic  education are required to assess the extent of educational disadvantage  faced by girls at the primary level in the host country and take further steps  where this disadvantage is found to be significant. Seven of the eight  missions we visited implemented projects to increase access and improve  the quality of basic education for primary-school youth. However, USAID  also recognizes the need for missions to have flexibility in planning and  implementing programs, and taking into account both the conditions of the  particular host countries and the activities of other donors in the country.  For example, while the mission in Morocco continued to focus on girls\u2019  education, its basic education assistance shifted more toward middle  schools, since the mission determined that high dropout rates among  primary-school students were often due to the lack of access to quality  secondary schools where those students would have continued with their  education and because other donors were already investing significant  resources into primary education in the country.", "Following are details about USAID\u2019s programs to support its three strategic  goals: (1) increasing access to basic education, (2) improving the quality of  basic education, and (3) building the institutional capacity of the host  countries\u2019 basic education systems.", "Access:  To increase access to basic education, USAID supports a wide  range of programs, such as distance learning, girls\u2019 scholarships, and  school construction, that increase the number of boys and girls who  enter and remain in school, particularly underserved populations such  as girls, the poor, children in rural areas, and out-of-school youth. To  increase access, the agency often uses distance learning tools, such as  radio, television, and other information and communication  technologies, to deliver quality educational content to populations not  accommodated by the traditional school system. Agency efforts to  increase access to basic education also include, among other things,  construction and rehabilitation of school facilities, girls\u2019 scholarships,  and adult literacy programs. In six of the eight countries we visited  (Egypt, Honduras, South Africa, Mali, Morocco, and Zambia), we found  that missions implemented programs in support of this strategic goal.  For example, in Egypt, Honduras, South Africa, and Zambia, USAID  used distance learning programs, such as prerecorded lessons, to  deliver educational content to preprimary, primary, and secondary  school youth--particularly girls, children from rural areas, and poor  children. In Egypt, Mali, Morocco, South Africa, and Zambia, USAID  implemented scholarship programs for girls, while the mission in Egypt  also supported the construction of primary schools to increase access  and enrollment of girls in underserved communities. See figure 4 for an  example of a USAID program aimed at increasing education access.", "Quality:  USAID also implements a wide array of programs to improve  education quality. These programs are generally designed to improve  teachers\u2019 subject matter knowledge and pedagogical skills, ensure the  curriculum includes specific knowledge and skills relevant to students\u2019  lives, and provide learners with access to appropriate workbooks and  other learning materials that complement and reinforce teachers\u2019  efforts. Typical forms of assistance include training teachers, along with  technical assistance to strengthen the capacity of local teacher training  institutions; promoting the adoption of teaching methods that involve  students in the learning process; promoting improvements in curriculum  content; helping host countries develop methods of student assessment;  and providing learning materials, such as textbooks and portable  libraries. All eight missions we visited implemented programs to  improve quality, using a variety of the approaches described above. See  figures 5 to 7 for examples of USAID projects aimed at improving  education quality.", "Capacity building:  USAID implements a wide variety of basic  education programs to build host countries\u2019 institutional capacity to  manage their basic education systems. Typical forms of assistance  include training school principals in educational leadership and  management; promoting the active participation by parents and parent  associations in supporting school improvement; developing effective  policy analysis units within education ministries; supporting the  adoption and use of appropriate data and educational management  information systems, as well as measures to enhance accountability and  transparency in the use of public education funds; and the  decentralization of educational decision making to local levels. All eight  missions we visited implemented programs that either specifically  focused on building the host countries\u2019 educational capacity or  contained a capacity-building component. For example, in Zambia,  USAID implemented a project to decentralize administration of the  country\u2019s education management information systems. In Egypt, USAID  implemented a project to support the country\u2019s decentralization efforts  by rewarding schools and surrounding communities that are active in  assessing their needs and successful in planning and implementing  measures to improve education quality.", "Because many USAID programs simultaneously support multiple  objectives, USAID could not provide a breakout of funding for its  international basic education efforts by strategic objective, such as access  or quality, or by program activity, such as teacher training. According to  USAID, quality and access are interlinked in important ways, as when  quality improvements lead to reduced grade repetition, accelerating  children\u2019s progress through school and increasing access for subsequent  students. Missions decide whether to concentrate their efforts on  increasing access or improving quality and which program approaches to  use based on their assessment of how they can achieve the most valuable  results in light of country conditions. For example, in Mali, a country in  which only about 50 percent of primary school-aged children are enrolled  in school, USAID decided to focus its strategy on improving the quality of  basic education based on the rationale that the greatest impediment to  achieving universal access is the poor quality of education.", "USAID Resources Directed at Strategic Partners of U.S. Foreign  Priorities  USAID\u2019s resource allocations for basic education are consistent with  USAID and State\u2019s efforts to more closely align foreign policy and  development goals. According to USAID\u2019s April 2005 education strategy  and USAID officials, the agency allocates resources based on the host  country\u2019s needs, commitment, and overall development progress, while  acknowledging the importance of geo-strategic states, such as some  predominantly Muslim countries. USAID and State\u2019s joint strategic plan  also states that their education programs will be particularly focused on  Muslim countries following the September 11 attacks. For example, in Mali,  a predominantly Muslim country, USAID implemented a girls\u2019 scholarship  program in which it focused on girls in traditional, religious communities  and also tried to engage local religious Muslim leaders in discussions on  how the scholarship program would be structured and invited them to  become members of the local management committee. We found that  USAID has implemented programs to target strategic states; specifically,  from fiscal years 2001 through 2006, many of the top 10 recipient countries  of USAID basic education assistance were strategic partners in achieving  U.S. foreign policy objectives, including fighting the war against terrorism  and promoting regional stability and democracy. Among these top 10  recipients were many predominantly Islamic countries, such as  Afghanistan, Indonesia, Iraq, Jordan, and Pakistan, which did not receive  any USAID basic education funding in fiscal year 2001, but received  significant funding beginning in fiscal year 2002. These countries, along  with Egypt and Ethiopia, all ranked among the top 10 recipients of basic  education funding from fiscal years 2001 through 2006 and were all  considered strategically important allies in the global war on terror,  according to USAID officials and USAID and State operational plans. See  appendix III for a list of recipient countries of USAID basic education  funding from fiscal years 2001 through 2006 and selected educational  indicators from the World Bank.", "USAID began basic education programs in the war-affected countries of  Iraq and Afghanistan to support efforts to facilitate their transition to more  stable, democratic, and productive states. In 2002, following the defeat of  the Taliban, USAID started a basic education program in Afghanistan,  which originally focused on four areas: textbook production and  distribution, radio-based teacher training, accelerated learning for over-age  and out-of-school students, and school construction and rehabilitation.  USAID\u2019s current efforts in Afghanistan focus on improving the quality of  the country\u2019s basic education system through teacher training. In May 2003,  in the immediate aftermath of initial combat operations in Iraq, USAID  program efforts supported the resumption of school through the  rehabilitation of classrooms and the provision of educational materials.  However, according to USAID officials, the mission\u2019s efforts faced many  challenges due to attacks on teachers and schools. While the USAID  mission in Iraq has rehabilitated 2,962 primary and secondary schools since  the conflict began in 2003, the mission does not know whether these  schools are currently operating due to the hostile security environment.  USAID\u2019s basic education efforts in Iraq have also focused on improving the  quality of Iraq\u2019s basic education system through training primary and  secondary school teachers, building the education ministry\u2019s capacity to  manage and reform its education system, and increasing access to basic  education for out-of-school youth through an accelerated learning  program. These basic education activities were funded through  supplemental appropriations specifically for Iraq.

USDA\u2019s efforts, which target low-income, food-deficit  countries, particularly focus on girls since they tend to have much lower  school attendance rates than boys in many of USDA\u2019s recipient countries.  In fiscal year 2001, USDA\u2019s Foreign Agricultural Service administered the  Global Food for Education Initiative (GFEI), a pilot program with the  overall goal of contributing to universal education by using school meals to  attract primary-school children to school, keep them attending once  enrolled, and improve learning. Through the program, USDA donated U.S.  agricultural commodities and associated technical and financial assistance  to the World Food Program, 13 private voluntary organizations, and one  national government (the Dominican Republic, see fig. 8).

The ILAB uses two mechanisms to  implement these projects: (1) the International Labor Organization\u2019s  International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor (ILO-IPEC), which  removes or prevents exploitative child labor and provides affected children  with education or training or both, strengthens the ability of host countries  to address child labor, and raises awareness on the hazards of child labor  and the benefits of education; and (2) Child Labor Education Initiative (EI),  which funds projects that promote access to quality basic education for  children at risk or engaging in exploitative child labor. The Bureau  allocates basic education resources to countries based on its assessment of  where there are child labor needs going unaddressed, and where the  agency will have the greatest impact.
