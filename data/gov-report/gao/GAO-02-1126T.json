As Congress considers reauthorizing the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) in 2003, it does so in the face of a continuing need for the nation to invest in its surface transportation infrastructure and at a time when both the federal and state governments are experiencing severe financial constraints.  Many observers are concerned that a significant gap exists between the availability of funds and immediate needs. In the longer term, questions have been raised about the financial capacity of the Highway Trust Fund to sustain current and future levels of highway and transit spending. This is of particular concern since Congress has by law established a direct link between Highway Trust Fund revenues and surface transportation spending levels.", "In recent years, as transportation needs have grown, Congress provided states\u2014in the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 (NHS) and TEA-21\u2014additional means to make highway investments through alternative financing mechanisms.  These alternative mechanisms included State Infrastructure Banks (SIBs)\u2014revolving funds to make or guarantee loans to approved projects; Grant Anticipation Revenue Vehicles (GARVEEs)\u2014which are state issued bonds or notes repayable with future federal-aid; and credit assistance under the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA)\u2014including loans, loan guarantees, and lines of credit.  All are part of the Federal Highway Administration\u2019s (FHWA\u2019s) Innovative Finance Program.  As the time draws nearer to reauthorizing TEA-21, information is needed about the performance of these tools and the potential for these and other proposed tools to help meet the nation\u2019s surface transportation infrastructure investment needs.", "At the request of your Committees, we are examining a range of surface transportation financing issues, including FHWA\u2019s Innovative Finance Program and proposed alternative financing approaches.  My testimony today is based on the preliminary results of our work and discusses (1) the use and performance of existing innovative financing tools and the factors limiting their use, and (2) the prospective costs of current and newly proposed alternative financing techniques for meeting surface transportation infrastructure investment needs.  I will also discuss issues concerning the potential costs and benefits of expanding alternative financing mechanisms to meet our nation\u2019s surface transportation needs. My testimony is based on our review of applicable laws, FHWA\u2019s evaluation studies and other reports concerning its Innovative Financing Program, and interviews with FHWA officials, transportation officials in eight states, and bond rating companies.  It is also based on a cost comparison we conducted of four current and newly proposed financing techniques.", "A number of states are using existing alternative financing tools such as State Infrastructure Banks, GARVEE bonds, and TIFIA loans.  These tools can provide states with additional options to accelerate projects and leverage federal assistance\u2014they can also provide greater flexibility and more funding techniques.  However, a number of factors can limit the use of these tools, including some states\u2019 preference not to use the tools, restrictions in state law on using them, and restrictions in federal law on the number of states and types of projects that can use them.", "Federal funding of surface transportation investments includes federal-aid highway program grant funding appropriated by Congress out of the Highway Trust Fund, loans and loan guarantees, and bonds that are issued by states and that are exempt from federal taxation.  In addition, the use of tax credit bonds\u2014where investors receive a tax credit against their federal income taxes instead of interest payments from the bond issuers\u2014have been proposed for helping to finance surface transportation investments. Because each of these financing mechanisms is structured differently, we determined that the total cost of providing $10 billion in infrastructure investment using each of these existing or proposed mechanisms ranges from $10 billion to over $13 billion (in present value terms).  The mechanisms that involve greater borrowing from the private sector, such as tax-exempt bonds and tax credit bonds, require the least amount of public outlays up front.  However, those same mechanisms have the highest long-term costs to the public sector participants in the investments because the latter must compensate the private investors for the risks that they assume.  With respect to the federal government\u2019s contribution, tax credit bonds are the most costly mechanism, while TIFIA loans and tax exempt bonds are the least costly.", "Expanding the use of alternative financing mechanisms has the potential to stimulate additional investment and private participation.  But expanding investment in our nation\u2019s highways and transit systems raises basic questions of who pays, how much, and when.  How alternative financing mechanisms are structured determines how much of the needs are met through federal funding and how much are met by the states and others.

Federal aid for highways is provided largely on a cash basis from the Highway Trust Fund. States have financed roads primarily through a combination of state revenues and federal aid. Typically, states raise their share of the funds by taxing motor fuels and charging user fees. In addition, debt financing\u2014issuing bonds to pay for highway development and construction\u2014 represents about 10 percent of total state funding for highways, although some states make greater use of borrowing than others.", "Federal-aid highway funding to states is typically in the form of grants. These grants are distributed from the Highway Trust Fund and apportioned to states based on a series of funding formulas.  Funding is subject to grant-matching rules\u2014for most federally funded highway projects, an 80-percent federal and 20-percent state funding ratio. States are subject to pay-as-you-go rules where they obligate all of the funds needed for a project up front and are reimbursed for project costs as they are incurred.", "In the mid-1990s, FHWA and the states tested and evaluated a variety of innovative financing techniques and strategies. Many financing innovations were approved for use through administrative action or legislative changes under NHS and TEA-21. Three of the techniques approved were SIBs, GARVEEs, and TIFIA loans. SIBs are state revolving loan funds that make loans or loan guarantees to approved projects; the loans are subsequently repaid, and recycled back into the revolving fund for additional loans. GARVEEs are any state issued bond or note repayable with future federal-aid highway funds. Through the issuance of GARVEE bonds, projects are able to meet the need for up-front capital as well as use future federal highway dollars for debt service. TIFIA allows FHWA to provide credit assistance, up to 33 percent of eligible project costs, to sponsors of major transportation projects. Credit assistance can take the form of a loan, loan guarantee, or line of credit. See appendix II for additional information about these financing techniques.", "According to FHWA, the goals of its Innovative Finance Program are to accelerate projects by reducing inefficient and unnecessary constraints on states\u2019 management of federal highway funds; expand investment by removing barriers to private investment; encourage the introduction of new revenue streams, particularly for the purpose of retiring debt obligations; and reduce financing and related costs, thus freeing up the savings for investments into the transportation system itself.  When Congress established the TIFIA program in TEA-21, it set out goals for the program to offer sponsors of large transportation projects a new tool to leverage limited Federal resources, stimulate additional investment in our nation\u2019s infrastructure, and encourage greater private sector participation in meeting our transportation needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alternative Financing Mechanisms Offer States Options, But Factors Limit Their Use", "paragraphs": ["Over the last 8 years, many states have used one or more of the FHWA- sponsored alternative financing tools to fund their highway and transit infrastructure projects.

For example, using a $25 million SIB loan for land acquisition in the initial phase of the Miami Intermodal Center, Florida accelerated the project by 2 years, according to FHWA. Similarly, South Carolina used an array of innovative finance tools when it undertook its \u201c27 in7 program\u201d\u2014a plan to accomplish infrastructure investment projects that were expected to take 27 years and reduce that to just 7 years.

For example, the TIFIA program funds a lower share of eligible project costs than traditional federal-aid programs, thus requiring a larger investment by other, non-federal funding sources.  It also attracts private creditors by assuming a lower priority on revenues pledged to repay debt. Bond rating companies told us they view TIFIA as \u201cquasi-equity\u201d because the federal loan is subordinate to all other debt in terms of repayments and offers debt service grace periods, low interest costs, and flexible repayment terms.", "It is often difficult to measure precisely the leveraging effect of the federal investment. As a recent FHWA evaluation report noted, just comparing the cost of the federal subsidy with the size of the overall investment can overstate the federal influence\u2014the key issue being whether the projects assisted were sufficiently credit-worthy even without federal assistance and the federal impact was to primarily lower the cost of the capital for the project sponsor.", "However, TIFIA\u2019s features, taken together, can enhance senior project debt ratings and thus make the project more attractive to investors. For example, the $3.2 billion Central Texas Turnpike project\u2014a toll road to serve the Austin\u2013San Antonio corridor\u2014received a $917 million TIFIA loan and will use future toll revenues to repay debt on the project, including revenue bonds issued by the Texas Transportation Commission and the TIFIA loan.

For example, faced with the challenge of Interstate highway needs of over $1.0 billion, the state of Arkansas determined that GARVEE bonds would make up for the lack of available funding. In June 1999, Arkansas voters approved the issuance of $575 million in GARVEE bonds to help finance this reconstruction on an accelerated schedule. The state will use future federal funds, together with the required state matching funds and the proceeds from a diesel fuel tax increase, to retire the bonds. The GARVEE bonds allow Arkansas to rebuild approximately 380 miles, or 60 percent of its total Interstate miles, within 5 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Factors Can Limit the Use of Finance Tools", "paragraphs": ["Although FHWA\u2019s innovative financing tools have provided states with additional options for meeting their needs, a number of factors can limit the use of these tools.", "State DOTs are not always willing to use federal innovative financing tools, nor do they always see advantages to using them. For example, officials in two states indicated that they had a philosophy against committing their federal aid funding to debt service. Moreover, not all states see advantages to using FHWA innovative financing tools. For example, one official indicated that his state did not have a need to accelerate projects because the state has only a few relatively small urban areas and thus does not face the congestion problems that would warrant using innovative financing tools more often. Officials in another state noted that because their DOT has the authority to issue tax-exempt bonds as long as the state has a revenue stream to repay the debt, they could obtain financing on their own and at lower cost.", "Not all state DOTs have the authority to use certain financing mechanisms, and others have limitations on the extent to which they can issue debt. For example, California requires voter approval in order to use its allocations from the Highway Trust Fund to pay for debt servicing costs. In Texas, the state constitution prohibits using highway funds to pay the state\u2019s debt service. Other states limit the amount of debt that can be incurred.  For example, Montana has a debt ceiling of $150 million and is now paying off bonds issued in the late 1970s and early 1980s and plans to issue a GARVEE bond in the next few years.", "Some financing tools have limitations set in law.  For example, five states are currently authorized to use TEA-21 federal-aid funding to capitalize their SIBs.  Although other states have created SIBs and use them, they could not use their TEA-21 federal-aid funding to capitalize them. Similarly, TIFIA credit assistance can be used only for certain projects.

To date, most federal funding for highways and transit projects has come through the federal-aid highway grants\u2014appropriated by Congress from the Highway Trust Fund.  Through the TIFIA program, the federal government also provides subsidized loans for state highway and transit projects. In addition, the federal government also subsidizes state and local bond financing of highways by exempting the interest paid on those bonds from federal income tax.  Another type of tax preference\u2014tax credit bonds\u2014 has been used, to a very limited extent, to finance certain school investments.  Investors in tax credit bonds receive a tax credit against their federal income taxes instead of interest payments from the bond issuer.  Proposals have been made to extend the use of this relatively new financing mechanism to other public investments, including transportation projects.", "The use of these four mechanisms to finance $10 billion in infrastructure investment result in differences in (1) total costs\u2014and how much of the cost is incurred within the short term 5-year period and how much of it is postponed to the future; (2) sharing costs\u2014or the extent to which states must spend their own money, or obtain private investment, in order to receive the federal subsidy; and (3) risks\u2014which level of government bears the risk associated with an investment (or compensates others for taking the risk).

As figure 1 shows, grant funds are the lowest-cost method to finance a given amount of investment expenditure, $10 billion. The reason for this result is that it is the only alternative that does not involve borrowing from the private sector through the issuance of bonds. Bonds are more expensive than grants because the governments have to compensate private investors for the risks that they assume (in addition to paying them back the present value of the bond principal). However, because the grants alternative does not involve borrowing, all of the public spending on the project must be made up front. The TIFIA direct loan, tax credit bond, and tax-exempt loan alternatives involve increased amounts of borrowing from the private sector and, therefore, increased overall costs.", "Grants entail the highest short term costs as these costs, in our example, are all incurred on a pay-as-you-go basis.

Federal costs for the tax-exempt bond and TIFIA loan alternatives are significantly lower than for tax credit bonds and grants.", "In some past and current proposals for using tax credit bonds to finance transportation investments, the issuers of the bonds would be allowed to place the proceeds from the sales of some bonds into a \u201csinking fund\u201d and, thereby, earn investment income that could be used to redeem bond principal. This added feature would reduce (or eliminate) the costs of the bond financing to the issuers, but this would come at a significant additional cost to the federal government. For example, in our example where states issue $8 billion of tax credit bonds to finance highway projects, if the states were allowed to issue an additional $ 2.4 billion of bonds to start a sinking fund, they would be able to earn enough investment income to pay back all of the bonds without raising any of their own money.

By making these investments the investors are taking the risk that project revenues will be sufficient to pay back their principal, plus an adequate return on their investment. In the case where the nonrecourse bond is a tax-exempt bond, the state must pay an interest rate that provides an adequate after-tax rate of return, including compensation for the risk assumed by the investors. By exempting this interest payment from income tax, the federal government is effectively sharing the cost of compensating investors for risk. Nevertheless, the state still bears some of the risk-related cost and, therefore has an incentive to either select investment projects that have lower risks, or select riskier projects only if the expected benefits from those projects are large enough to warrant taking on the additional risk.", "In the case of a tax credit bond where project revenues would be the only source of financing to redeem the bonds and the federal government would be committed to paying whatever rate of credit investors would demand to purchase bonds at par value, the federal government would bear all of the cost of compensating the investors for risk. States would no longer have a financial incentive to balance higher project risks with higher expected project benefits. Alternatively, the credit rate could be set equal to the interest rate that would be required to sell the average state bonds (issued within the same timeframe) at par value.  In that case, states would bear the additional cost of selling bonds for projects with above- average risks.", "In the case of a TIFIA loan for a project that has private sector participation, the federal loan does not compensate the private investors for their risk; instead, the federal government assumes some of the risk and, thereby, lowers the risk to the private investors and lowers the amount that states have to pay to compensate for that risk.", "In summary, Mr. Chairman, alternative financing mechanisms have accelerated the pace of some surface transportation infrastructure improvement projects and provided states additional tools and flexibility to meet their needs\u2014goals of FHWA\u2019s Innovative Finance Program. FHWA and the states have made progress to attain the goal Congress set for the TIFIA program\u2014to stimulate additional investment and encourage greater private sector participation\u2014but measuring success involves measuring the leverage effect of the federal investment, which is often difficult.
