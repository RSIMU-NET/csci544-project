This report examines the extent to which VHA has (1) provided guidance on the governance of the program; (2) provided guidance on staffing the program; (3) assessed the training needs of patient advocates and monitored training completion; and (4) monitored patient advocacy program data-entry practices and reviewed program data. GAO reviewed VHA and VAMC documents, including summaries of program data. GAO interviewed VHA officials about the program, as well as officials from a non-generalizable selection of eight VAMCs and five VISNs selected based on the volume of veteran complaints and other factors. GAO also compared VHA policies and practices to federal internal control standards."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provided limited guidance to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers (VAMC) on the governance of its patient advocacy program and its guidance, a program handbook, has been outdated since 2010. VAMCs are still expected to follow the outdated handbook, which does not provide needed details on governance, such as specifying the VAMC department to which patient advocates should report. Officials from most of the VAMCs that GAO reviewed noted that the VAMC department to which patient advocates report can have a direct effect on the ability of staff to resolve veterans' complaints. The lack of updated and complete guidance may impede the patient advocacy program from meeting its expectations, to receive and address complaints from veterans in a convenient and timely manner.", "VHA also has provided limited guidance to VAMCs on staffing the patient advocacy program. VHA's handbook states that every VAMC should have at least one patient advocate and appropriate support staff; however, it did not provide guidance on how to determine the number and type of staff needed. Officials at all but one of the eight VAMCs in GAO's review stated that their patient advocacy program staff had more work to do than they could accomplish. This limited guidance on staffing could impede VAMCs' efforts to ensure that they have the appropriate number and type of staff to address veterans' complaints in a timely manner.", "Further, VHA has recommended training for patient advocates, but it has not developed an approach to routinely assess their training needs or monitored training completion. VHA officials stated that they relied on VAMC and Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) staff to conduct these activities. However, GAO found that for the eight VAMCs in its review, the training needs of patient advocates were not routinely assessed, and training completion was not always monitored. Without conducting these activities, VHA increases its risk that staff may not be adequately trained to advocate on behalf of veterans.", "Finally, VHA has not monitored patient advocacy program data-entry practices or reviewed the data to assess program performance. VHA officials stated that they relied on VISN and VAMC officials to ensure that all complaints were consistently entered into VHA's Patient Advocate Tracking System (PATS). However, GAO identified inconsistencies in the extent to which VAMC officials did so. VHA's lack of monitoring may pose a risk that not all complaints are entered into this tracking system\u2014a goal of the program. Additionally, VHA officials stated they did not systemically review data in the system to assess program performance and identify potential system-wide improvements because VHA considered this the responsibility of VAMCs. As a result, VHA officials may miss opportunities to improve veterans' experiences.", "VHA is beginning to address many of these governance, staffing, training, and data issues, including directing a workgroup to provide recommendations by spring of 2018.

The total number of veteran enrollees in VA\u2019s health care  system rose from 7.9 million to almost 9 million from fiscal year (FY) 2006  through FY 2016. As the number of veterans using VA health care  services increases, it is important to ensure that feedback about their care  is addressed in a convenient and timely manner. To that end, VHA has  designated patient advocates at each VA medical center (VAMC) to  receive and document feedback from veterans or their representatives,  including requests for information, compliments, and complaints.", "Although VHA\u2019s patient advocacy program has been in place since 1990,  it has taken on new significance in recent years given concerns about  veterans\u2019 ability to receive timely and quality care, among other issues.  Our work, along with that of the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) and  others, has cited longstanding concerns about VA\u2019s oversight of its health  care system, including ambiguous policies and inconsistent processes.  These concerns contributed to the addition of veterans\u2019 health care to  GAO\u2019s High-Risk List in 2015, and its continued inclusion in the 2017  update.

Officials from two of the five VISNs we interviewed stated that they  did not perform any audits or checks of the data entered into PATS by  patient program staff at VAMCs.", "We also found inconsistencies in the extent to which VAMC officials  entered complaints into PATS, with complaints always entered into PATS  at one of our selected VAMCs, while at other VAMCs some complaints  were left unrecorded, according to officials. For example, at one VAMC,  officials stated that over a third of the complaints received were not  entered into PATS due to the competing workload demands of patient  advocates. Similarly, at another selected VAMC, almost a quarter of the  complaints received were not entered into PATS, according to patient  advocates there who explained that they primarily used a document  outside of PATS to record veterans\u2019 feedback.", "In addition, OPCC&CT officials told us they did not monitor whether  patient advocates used a consistent practice to assign issue codes to  veterans\u2019 feedback recorded into PATS. Using a consistent data-entry  practice is important to ensure that PATS data can be compared across  VAMCs to better enable an accurate and comprehensive understanding  of veterans\u2019 issues and concerns, a goal of the patient advocacy program.  OPCC&CT officials stated that they relied on VISN-level coordinators to  monitor coding practices because VHA\u2019s handbook for the program states  that these coordinators should develop VISN-wide consistent approaches  for entering complaints into PATS. VISN-level coordinators from two  selected VISNs stated that they created a standard practice for assigning  issue codes within a particular VISN; however, the coding practices  differed between VISNs, making national level analysis difficult.", "We also found inconsistencies in how VAMC officials coded specific  veterans\u2019 feedback. For example, patient advocates did not use  consistent practices to code issues related to the Veterans Choice  Program (Choice Program), one of the most common types of issues  patient advocates told us they hear about from veterans. Officials from  one of our selected VAMCs said they code feedback related to the  Choice Program under a specific \u201crequest for information\u201d issue code,  regardless of whether the feedback was a request for information,  compliment, or complaint. In contrast, officials at another VAMC stated  that they typically code feedback related to the Choice Program as a  complaint related to billing. (See app. II for additional information on data- entry practices at selected VAMCs.)", "OPCC&CT\u2019s lack of monitoring of PATS data-entry practices is  inconsistent with GAO\u2019s Assessing the Reliability of Computer-Processed  Data which identifies the importance of consistent data-entry practices to  ensure that data are reasonably complete and accurate. Further, federal  standards for internal control related to information and communications  require agencies to use quality information, such as relevant data from  reliable sources, to achieve the agency\u2019s objectives. Under internal  control standards for control activities, management also is to monitor  performance to achieve objectives. Without OPCC&CT monitoring data- entry practices, the patient advocacy program is at risk of not meeting its  goal that all complaints are entered into PATS and there is an increased  likelihood of VHA not having an accurate understanding of veterans\u2019  complaints across VAMCs.", "Moving forward, in fall 2017, OPA distributed meeting minutes to all VISN  and VAMC directors stating that all veterans\u2019 feedback should be  consistently recorded in PATS. OPA officials also updated some of the  issue codes in PATS in fall 2017 and added a code specifically for  community care issues, such as issues related to the Choice Program. In  addition, OPA officials stated that they plan to promote the consistent  assignment of issue codes to veterans\u2019 feedback through national  training, but have not specified when this training will occur or if OPA staff  will monitor patient advocates\u2019 consistent assignment of issue codes or of  data-entry practices generally. Until these actions are completed,  however, the gaps in monitoring of PATS data-entry practices that we  identified will continue to exist, putting the program at risk of incomplete  or unreliable data that may not allow an accurate understanding of  veterans\u2019 complaints, critical to making system-wide improvements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VHA Has Not Systematically Reviewed PATS Data to Assess Program Performance and Identify Potential System- Wide Improvements", "paragraphs": ["VHA officials have not systematically reviewed PATS data to assess  program performance and identify potential system-wide improvements,  goals of the patient advocacy program.

For example, they did  not track VAMC performance on responding to complaints in a timely  manner or track the most common complaints across VAMCs to identify  potential opportunities for system-wide improvements.", "OPCC&CT officials stated that they did not conduct systematic reviews of  PATS data because VISN and VAMC officials were primarily responsible  for these analyses. However, according to VHA\u2019s handbook for the  patient advocacy program, VHA officials have a responsibility to examine  PATS data for trends across VAMCs and identify any areas for system- wide improvement. Officials stated that it was challenging to analyze  PATS information included in narrative text, such as descriptions of  veterans\u2019 feedback.", "Not reviewing PATS data is inconsistent with federal standards for  internal control for monitoring which require agencies to establish and  operate monitoring activities, such as assessing the quality of  performance over time, and evaluate the results. Further, not  conducting systematic assessments of PATS data made it difficult for  OPCC&CT to determine program performance, such as whether the  program was meeting its goal that all complaints are entered into PATS  and responded to within 7 days. Officials explained that VHA interprets  this goal to mean that complaints are closed in PATS within 7 days.  According to VA, between FY 2014 and FY 2017 there were more than  53,000 complaints per year open for greater than 7 days. If OPCC&CT  officials had conducted systematic reviews of PATS data, they may have  been able to identify that there were a significant number of complaints  open for longer than 7 days and consider what actions should be taken,  such as providing additional guidance to VAMCs on how to address  complaints in a timely manner.", "Furthermore, without systematically reviewing PATS data across VAMCs  to identify potential system-wide improvements, OPCC&CT officials may  have been unaware of important care issues across VAMCs. For  example, patient advocates from several of our selected VAMCs stated  that opioid prescription issues are among the most common complaints  they received from veterans. If OPCC&CT officials were to have  systematically reviewed PATS data across VAMCs to determine the  prevalence of these types of complaints, they could have identified the  need to address them on a national level and consider system-wide  policies or guidance in response.", "According to VHA officials, OPA is in the process of identifying the data it  needs to review on a routine basis, and directed its National Strategic  Workgroup to identify program data that could be reviewed to assess  program performance and identify potential system-wide improvements  by the spring of 2018. However, OPA expects that these efforts will result  in recommendations for OPA to consider, and it is unclear what steps, if  any, will be taken based on the recommendations.

However, VHA\u2019s efforts to ensure that the patient advocacy  program is meeting its goals\u2014to identify potential system-wide  improvements and respond to complaints within 7 days\u2014have fallen  short. OPCC&CT did not provide sufficient oversight to the program in the  four key areas of governance, staffing, training, and data-entry practices,  which has left the program at risk for not meeting its goals.", "VHA\u2019s newly established OPA has initiated plans to improve the patient  advocacy program in these four areas; however, most of these plans  center around a workgroup that will make recommendations for OPA to  consider, and it is unclear what specific actions, if any, will be taken  based on these recommendations. Further, documentation for several of  OPA\u2019s planned efforts has not been finalized. Unless specific actions to  address the weaknesses we identified are completed expeditiously, the  program is at risk of not meeting its goals, including addressing veterans\u2019  complaints in a convenient and timely manner. Furthermore, without  addressing the weaknesses we identified, OPA misses opportunities to  review PATS data across VAMCs to identify potential system-wide issues  that, if addressed, could significantly improve the experience of veterans.

Each ROC includes basic  information regarding the individuals involved, a description of the  feedback provided by the veteran, and a description of the steps taken to  resolve the issue.
