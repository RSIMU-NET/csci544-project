Data on the number of overseas A&A specialists collected by two USAID offices--the Office of Acquisition and Assistance (OAA) and the Office of Human Resources (OHR)--are unreliable or out of date. GAO found significant discrepancies between these offices' data sets, and officials acknowledged that their A&A staff level data are neither reliable nor up-to-date. In addition, USAID has not collected comprehensive competency information on its overseas A&A specialists. GAO's model of strategic human capital planning notes the importance of these data in developing a strategic A&A workforce plan that could enable the agency to better match staff levels to changing workloads. At the missions GAO visited, GAO found that the numbers and competencies of A&A staff did not match A&A workloads. The number of A&A staff with the necessary competencies was less than adequate at some missions, while at others it was more than adequate, according to agency officials. For example, officials at the mission in Mali said they have delayed time-sensitive projects because key A&A staff were not available when needed to approve contracts, while officials at the mission in Indonesia said the current number of A&A staff may be more than adequate. Most of the A&A survey respondents overseas also reported difficulty in altering staffing patterns to meet A&A workload demands. Although USAID has made some efforts to address its A&A workforce issues, these efforts do not constitute a strategic A&A workforce plan that takes into account the entire A&A workforce. Without accurate and reliable A&A staff data, USAID does not have adequate information to address current workload imbalances. USAID has not implemented an evaluation mechanism to provide oversight of its A&A function. OAA's Evaluation Division is responsible for providing oversight to ensure that A&A operations follow USAID policies, primarily by assessing the agency's A&A operations worldwide. However, for fiscal years 2003 through 2005, it conducted on-site evaluations at only 9 of its targeted 85 missions. In fiscal year 2007, the Evaluation Division developed a new evaluation mechanism that is expected to use scorecard evaluations, in which COs self-assess their A&A operations, and a risk-based approach to determine locations for further on-site visits. The division has completed piloting these scorecard evaluations at four missions and identified weaknesses in A&A operations. For example, the division found that 1 mission lacked resources to adequately monitor contractor performance. The division's goal is to implement this evaluation mechanism, including on-site visits to at least 5 missions, within 2 years. However, agency officials informed GAO that the Evaluation Division currently does not have the staff level needed to fully implement this evaluation mechanism. Without implementing the evaluation mechanism, USAID cannot certify the overall adequacy and effectiveness of management controls for the A&A function."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is primarily  responsible for managing U.S. humanitarian and development assistance  efforts worldwide.

However, the division has not yet finalized plans for  full implementation of the scorecard evaluations based on this increase in  staff.", "In addition, according to Evaluation Division staff, USAID headquarters  and missions lack an electronic A&A data system that would facilitate the  evaluation process. Currently, the Evaluation Division reviews the  available A&A documents provided by COs worldwide; while some A&A  units utilize an electronic filing system, A&A operations in many missions  continue to maintain hard-copy A&A documents. Evaluation Division staff  told us they would ideally be able to access a digital repository of A&A  documents remotely while reviewing COs\u2019 completed scorecard  evaluations. Such access would allow the Evaluation Division staff to  review A&A documents in headquarters and reduce their need to conduct  on-site visits, thereby saving resources and time. As of July 2008, USAID  was analyzing information technology options for the OAA Evaluation  Division to achieve its needs, including the implementation of the Global  Acquisition and Assistance System (GLAAS), a new globally accessible  system intended to standardize and automate USAID\u2019s management of  A&A instruments. However, GLAAS has not yet been implemented at all  missions, and the Evaluation Division continues to lack the technology to  access all A&A files electronically in order to conduct scorecard reviews  remotely."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As USAID increasingly relies on nongovernmental organizations to  implement its activities, the agency\u2019s responsibility to effectively manage  the implemented activities gains in importance. Critical to its success in  this area is its management of the A&A function. As the amount of its A&A  obligations and the number of A&A instruments continue to increase,  especially at overseas missions, USAID should work to ensure that the  appropriate number of staff with the requisite competencies and skills are  available to manage A&A operations. Despite a past USAID OIG  recommendation calling for USAID to develop an A&A workforce plan, the  agency has yet to analyze the relation of staffing patterns to existing  workload with the goal of better matching its staff to its workload.  Specifically, the agency currently lacks sufficiently reliable and up-to-date  data on its overseas A&A staff levels and comprehensive information on  the competencies of the A&A staff. With these data, which are key  elements of federal workforce planning models, USAID could better  identify its critical staffing needs and adjust its staffing patterns to meet  those needs.", "A critical component of USAID\u2019s oversight of its A&A operations is the  successful implementation of its new evaluation mechanism. The  mechanism is designed to ensure that A&A operations follow USAID  policies, primarily by assessing A&A operations that manage about $10  billion worldwide. Although the agency is in the process of hiring  additional staff for the division, much time has elapsed since USAID\u2019s OIG  noted in 2006 that the division\u2019s resource constraints hampered its ability  to conduct evaluations.

USAID noted several agencywide initiatives such as the development of a  new Human Capital Strategic Plan and Workforce Plan to address the  agency\u2019s staffing requirements from 2009 to 2013, as well as a competency  management system and a Learning Management System to improve staff  competency information.

We also reviewed prior assessments of  USAID\u2019s workforce planning efforts by GAO and USAID\u2019s Office of  Inspector General (OIG). To determine A&A staff levels, we analyzed and  compared staffing data that USAID\u2019s Office of Acquisition and Assistance  (OAA) and the Office of Human Resources (OHR) made available to us.  We also interviewed OHR officials to determine the reliability of their data.  We obtained and analyzed data on the number of A&A instruments and the  obligated amounts of A&A instruments for fiscal years 2002 through 2007.  We assessed the reliability of these data by reviewing information about  the data and the system that produced them and by interviewing agency  officials knowledgeable about the data. We found USAID\u2019s data  sufficiently reliable for representing the A&A obligations and instruments.

We also analyzed past A&A  evaluation reports, documents pertaining to the scorecard evaluation  methodology, as well as the scorecard evaluations and on-site evaluation  reports conducted for the piloted locations. In addition, we met with  USAID officials in Washington, D.C., to discuss the A&A evaluation  mechanism.", "To assess the A&A function overseas, we conducted fieldwork in the  following seven countries: Cambodia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz  Republic, Mali, Peru, and Thailand. We selected these countries to obtain  geographic diversity and ensure representation of various A&A processes  and organizational structures for the A&A function. In all of these  countries, we met with USAID officials. In some of these countries, we  also met with representatives of nongovernmental organizations (NGO)  that implement A&A activities for USAID under A&A instruments.  Although the findings from our fieldwork in each country are not  generalizable to the population of USAID A&A activities, we determined  that the selection of the countries and activities reviewed was appropriate  for our design and objectives.", "To obtain views from USAID staff with key A&A responsibilities, we also  conducted a survey of USAID\u2019s A&A staff between October 2007 and June  2008. The survey was sent to all USAID contracting officers (CO) in  headquarters and missions, as well as all A&A specialists in headquarters.  The survey contained questions related to work experience, staffing,  workload, and the administration of acquisition and assistance  instruments. We pretested the survey with three COs.", "Our survey of A&A staff received a 95 percent response rate\u2014150  responded out of 158 surveyed.

Based on this analysis and  the 95 percent response rate, we assumed that the nonrespondents were  missing at random and generated statistical estimates of the population of  A&A staff from the 95 percent of respondents. Given the high response  rate and no indications of nonresponse bias, we considered estimates from  this survey to be generalizable to the population surveyed. Because we  treated our respondents as a random sample of A&A staff, our results are  estimates of the population and thus are subject to sampling errors that  are associated with samples of this size and type. Our confidence in the  precision of the results from this sample is expressed in 95 percent  confidence intervals, which are expected to include the actual results in 95  percent of the samples of this type.

USAID noted that our final reporting objectives differed from the  original objectives we provided to the agency when we commenced  our review in early 2007.  In its comments, the agency misinterpreted  our reporting only on certain aspects of the A&A function as an  indication that other aspects of the A&A function are largely in sound  condition.  During the course of GAO engagements, the final reporting  objectives and the scope of the review are sometimes refined based  upon information obtained during the planning and design phase.  For  example, we did not report on the proper organizational alignment of  USAID\u2019s A&A function because USAID officials were unable to  adequately demonstrate significant impediments as a result of its  placement within USAID\u2019s Management Bureau.  2.  USAID stated that the agency does not possess the authority to simply  transfer locally engaged staff to other missions to meet the demands of  missions with greater workloads.  It also noted that overseas programs  and funding fluctuate and mission management can be hesitant to  make abrupt hiring or staff reduction decisions in the short term.  We  recognize that mission management determines how to allocate  resources within missions and some of the staffing decisions  pertaining to overseas A&A specialists are made outside of OAA.  Our  report emphasized that key elements of an agency\u2019s strategic  workforce plan include determining the critical skills and  competencies of its staff, addressing gaps in staff numbers and  deployment, and aligning human capital approaches regardless of  location.  A past OIG report also recommended the development of an  A&A workforce plan that includes a mechanism for collecting and  analyzing A&A data to allow managers to compare current staffing  patterns to developing trends, match staff to workloads, and adjust  quickly when unbalanced workloads develop.  We maintain that  without accurately identifying the number of overseas A&A staff, the  agency can neither determine the appropriate levels of staff with  requisite competencies to manage missions\u2019 A&A workloads, nor  explore ways of making necessary adjustments to gaps in mission A&A  staff levels and competencies as well as imbalances in workloads.  3.  USAID commented that when requested by missions, OAA provides  routine assistance such as temporary duty staff for end-of-fiscal-year  surges.  In our report, we cite several instances of USAID not  addressing staffing imbalances at its overseas missions.  We maintain  that OAA\u2019s approach of providing temporary assistance is not a  substitute for strategic workforce planning that includes key elements  such as reliable and up-to-date data on the number and competencies  of its overseas A&A workforce.  Without this information, USAID  cannot systematically address its critical staffing needs and adjust its  staffing patterns to meet those needs.   4.  USAID commented that it had already begun to enhance the evaluation  function by establishing the Contract Review Board, which reviews all  procurements of $10 million or more at the solicitation, competitive  range, and award stages.  Although we agree that this mechanism is an  important oversight mechanism during the early phases of the A&A  process, our review focused on the oversight of the A&A function at  the administration stage, which commences after the awarding of the  A&A instrument and entails USAID\u2019s monitoring of contractor  performance for the A&A instruments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Zina Merritt (Assistant Director),  James Ashley, Debbie Chung, Mark Dowling, Joel Grossman, Tracy  Guerrero, Clarette Kim, John Krump, Victoria Lin, James Strus, and  William Woods made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
