U.S. firms may be required to obtain a license from the Department of Commerce before exporting these \"dual-use\" technologies from the United States to many other countries, including countries of concern. Since Commerce regulations also deem domestic transfers of controlled dual-use technologies to citizens of these countries to be exports, Commerce may require firms that employ foreign nationals working with these technologies in this country to obtain \"deemed\" export licenses. The firms should, in many cases, hold a deemed export license, and the foreign nationals should have an appropriate visa classification, such as an H-1B specialized employment classification. Commerce issues deemed export licenses to firms that employ or sponsor foreign nationals after consulting the Departments of Defense, State, and Energy. Deemed export licenses are generally valid for 2 years and comprise almost 10 percent of all export licenses approved by Commerce. In fiscal year 2001, Commerce approved 822 deemed export license applications and rejected 3. Most of the approved licenses allowed foreign nationals from countries of concern to work with advanced computer, electronic, or telecommunication and information security technologies in the United States. To better direct its efforts to detect possible unlicensed deemed exports, in fiscal year 2001 Commerce screened thousands of applications for H-1B and other types of visas submitted by foreign nationals overseas. From these applications, it developed 160 potential cases for follow-up by enforcement staff in the field. However, Commerce did not screen thousands of H-1B change-of-status applications submitted domestically to the Immigration and Naturalization Service for foreign nationals already in the United States. In addition, Commerce could not readily track the disposition of the 160 cases referred to field offices for follow-up because it lacks a system for doing so. Commerce attaches security conditions to almost all licenses to mitigate the risk of providing foreign nationals with controlled dual-use technologies.

The  Commerce Control List identifies technologies that must be licensed before  they can be exported to specific countries, including technologies  associated with certain nuclear materials, facilities, and equipment;  chemicals, \u201cmicroorganisms\u201d and toxins; materials processing; electronics;  computers; telecommunications and information security; lasers and  sensors; navigation and avionics; marine systems; and propulsion systems  and space vehicles.

The act defines exports to include transfers of technology within the  United States to (1) affiliates of controlled countries or (2) persons with the  knowledge or intent to transfer the technology to unauthorized parties.   According to Commerce regulations, a transfer of technology within the  United States to a foreign national who is not a permanent resident of the  United States is deemed to be an export.
