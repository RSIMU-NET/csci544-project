Financial regulators  assessed a total of about $1.4 billion in penalties for BSA violations for  which they were responsible for collecting, and collected almost all of this  amount (see fig. 1). The amounts assessed by the financial regulators  and Treasury are guided by statute and based on the severity of the  violation. Based on our review of regulators\u2019 data and enforcement  orders, the federal banking regulators assessed penalties for the failure to  implement or develop adequate BSA/AML programs, and failure to  identify or report suspicious activity. Of the $1.4 billion, one penalty  (assessed by OCC) accounted for almost 35 percent ($500 million). This  OCC enforcement action was taken against HSBC Bank USA for having  a long-standing pattern of failing to report suspicious activity in violation of  BSA and its underlying regulations and for the bank\u2019s failure to comply  fully with a 2010 cease-and-desist order. Financial regulators assess  penalties for BSA violations both independently and concurrently with  FinCEN. In a concurrent action, FinCEN will jointly assess a penalty with  the regulator and deem the penalty satisfied with a payment to the  regulator. Out of the $1.4 billion assessed, $651 million was assessed  concurrently with FinCEN to 13 different financial institutions. FinCEN  officials told us that it could take enforcement actions independently, but  tries to take actions concurrently with regulators to mitigate duplicative  penalties.

FinCEN\u2019s penalty  assessments amounts ranged from $5,000 to $75 million for this period  and are guided by statute and regulations, the severity of the BSA  violation, and other factors. For example, in a case resulting in a $75  million penalty assessment against Hong Kong Entertainment (Overseas)  Investments, FinCEN found that the casino\u2019s weak AML internal controls  led to the concealment of large cash transactions over a 4-year period.

If the payment is a check, FDIC officials  make sure the amount matches the penalty, document receipt of  the payment in an internal payment log, and then send the check  to FDIC\u2019s Department of Finance. Once a quarter, FDIC sends  penalty payments it receives to a Treasury General Fund receipt  account.", "In addition to the processes we discuss in this report for penalty  collections, SEC, Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC all have audited  financial statements that include reviews of general internal controls over  agency financial reporting, including those governing collections.", "From January 2009 through December 2015, FinCEN, OFAC, and  financial regulators collected in total about $2.6 billion from financial  institutions for the covered violations but they did not retain any of the  penalties they collected. Instead, the collections were deposited in  Treasury General Fund accounts and used to support various federal  government activities. Officials from these agencies stated that they have  no discretion over the use of the collections, which must be transmitted to  the Treasury. Once agencies deposit their collections into the Treasury  General Fund, they are unable to determine what subsequently happens  to the money, since it is commingled with other deposits.", "Treasury Office of Management officials stated that the collections  deposited into the General Fund accounts are used according to the  purposes described in Congress\u2019s annual appropriations. More  specifically, once a penalty collection is deposited into a receipt account  in the Treasury General Fund, only an appropriation by Congress can  begin the process of spending these funds. Appropriations from Treasury  General Fund accounts are amounts appropriated by law for the general  support of federal government activities. The General Fund Expenditure  Account is an appropriation account established to record amounts  appropriated by law for the subsequent expenditure of these funds, and  includes spending from both annual and permanent appropriations.", "Treasury Office of Management officials explained that the Treasury  General Fund has a general receipt account that receives all of the  penalties that regulators and Treasury agencies collect for BSA, FCPA,  and sanctions violations. Treasury officials explained that to ensure that  the proper penalty amounts are collected, Treasury requires agency  officials to reconcile the amount of deposits recorded in their general  ledger to corresponding amounts recorded in Treasury\u2019s government- wide accounts. If Treasury finds a discrepancy between the General  Ledger and the government-wide accounts, it sends the specific agency a  statement asking for reconciliation. Treasury\u2019s Financial Manual provides  agencies with guidance on how to reconcile discrepancies and properly  transfer money to the general receipt account. Treasury officials  explained that they cannot associate a penalty collected for a specific  violation with an expense from the General Fund as collections deposited  in General Fund accounts are comingled."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Forfeitures Are Deposited into Accounts with Several Authorized Uses, Including Payments to Crime Victims and Law Enforcement Partners", "paragraphs": ["Forfeitures\u2014including those from financial institutions for violations of  BSA/AML and U.S. sanctions programs requirements\u2014are deposited into  three accounts depending in part on the agency seizing the assets (DOJ  and other law enforcement agencies use the AFF, Treasury and the  Department of Homeland Security use the TFF, and U.S. Postal  Inspection Service uses the Postal Service Fund). In the cases we  reviewed, financial institutions forfeited either cash or financial  instruments, which were generally deposited into the AFF or the TFF.  Figure 5 shows the processes that govern the seizure and forfeiture of  assets for the Justice Asset Forfeiture Program and the Treasury  Forfeiture Program.", "The Justice Asset Forfeiture Program and the Treasury Forfeiture  Program follow similar forfeiture processes. Under the Justice Asset  Forfeiture Program, a DOJ investigative agency seizes an asset (funds in  the cases we reviewed), and the asset is entered into DOJ\u2019s Consolidated  Asset Tracking System. The asset is then transferred to the U.S.  Marshals Service for deposit into the Seized Asset Deposit Fund. The  U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office or the seizing agency must provide notice to  interested parties and conduct Internet publication prior to entry of an  administrative declaration of forfeiture or a court-ordered final order of  forfeiture. Once the forfeiture is finalized, the seizing agency or the U.S.  Attorney\u2019s Office enters the forfeiture information into the Consolidated  Asset Tracking System. U.S. Marshals Service subsequently transfers the  asset from the Seized Asset Deposit Fund to the AFF. Similarly, the asset  forfeiture process for the Treasury Forfeiture Program involves a  Department of Homeland Security or Treasury investigative agency  seizing the asset (funds, in the cases we reviewed). The seizing agency  takes custody of the asset, enters the case into their system of record,  and transfers the asset to the Treasury Suspense Account. Once  forfeiture is final, the seizing agency subsequently requests that  Treasury\u2019s Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture staff transfer the asset  from the Treasury Suspense Account to the TFF. According to Treasury\u2019s  Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture staff, each month, TFF staff  compares deposits in the TFF with records from seizing agencies to  review whether the amounts are accurately recorded.", "From January 2009 through December 2015, for the cases we reviewed,  nine financial institutions forfeited about $3.2 billion in funds through the  Justice Asset Forfeiture Program due to violations of BSA/AML and U.S.  sanctions programs requirements.  AFF expenditures are governed by the  law establishing the AFF, as we have previously reported. Specifically,  the AFF is primarily used to pay the forfeiture program\u2019s expenses in  three major categories:  1.  program operations expenses in 13 expenditure categories such  as asset management and disposal, storage and destruction of  drugs, and investigative expenses leading to a seizure; 2.  payments to third parties, including payments to satisfy interested  parties such as owners or lien holders, as well as the return of  funds to victims of crime; and 3.  equitable sharing payments to state and local law enforcement  agencies that participated in law enforcement efforts resulting in  the forfeitures.", "In addition, after DOJ obligates funds to cover program expenses, any  AFF funds remaining at the end of a fiscal year may be declared an  excess unobligated balance and used for any of DOJ\u2019s authorized  purposes, including helping to cover rescissions.", "Court documents and DOJ data indicate that forfeitures from the Justice  Asset Forfeiture Program cases we reviewed will be used to compensate  victims and have been used to make equitable sharing payments.  Although DOJ data showed that DOJ has not yet remitted payments to  any victims in the cases we reviewed, court documents and comments  from DOJ officials indicated that approximately $2 billion of the forfeited  funds deposited in the AFF would be remitted to victims of fraud. For  example, according to Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section  officials, DOJ has set up the Madoff Victim Fund in part from the related  $1.7 billion forfeited by JPMorgan Chase to collect and review victim  claims related to the Ponzi scheme operated by Bernard Madoff. DOJ  intends to distribute the funds to eligible victims of Madoff\u2019s fraud.  Additionally, DOJ data for seven cases showed that it had made  approximately $660 million in equitable sharing payments.", "From January 2009 through December 2015, for the cases we reviewed,  seven financial institutions forfeited about $5.7 billion in funds due to  violations of BSA/AML and U.S. sanctions programs requirements  through the Treasury Forfeiture Program. These forfeitures have been  deposited in the TFF and can be used for certain purposes as specified  by law. In the cases we identified, all seized and forfeited assets were  cash. TFF expenditures are governed by the law establishing the TFF  and, as we have previously reported, are primarily used to pay the  forfeiture program\u2019s expenses in major categories including program  operation expenses, payments to third parties including crime victims,  equitable sharing payments to law enforcement partners, and other  expenses. Of the $5.7 billion contained in the TFF, the $3.8 billion paid  by BNP Paribas as part of the bank\u2019s settlement with DOJ was  permanently rescinded from the TFF and is unavailable for obligation.  The remaining funds, if not subject to general rescissions, can be used for  a variety of purposes. As of December 2015, DOJ was considering using  approximately $310 million in TFF forfeitures for victim compensation  and, according to Treasury officials, Treasury had made approximately  $484 million in equitable sharing payments and obligated a further $119  million for additional equitable sharing payments. As with the AFF, after  Treasury obligates funds to cover program expenses, any TFF funds  remaining at the end of a fiscal year, if not rescinded, may be declared an  excess unobligated balance. These funds can be used to support a  variety of law enforcement purposes, such as enhancing the quality of  investigations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Criminal Fines and Civil Penalties Are Eligible for Deposit in Treasury General Fund Accounts, Crime Victims Fund, and Three Percent Fund", "paragraphs": ["DOJ has litigated court cases against financial institutions for criminal  violations of BSA/AML and U.S. sanctions programs requirements  resulting in criminal fines ordered by the federal courts. According to DOJ  officials, DOJ determines criminal fines on a case-by-case basis, in  consideration of the underlying criminal activity and in compliance with  relevant statutes. Court documents, such as court judgments and plea  agreements, communicate the amount of the criminal fine to the financial  institution. DOJ U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices are primarily responsible for  collecting criminal fines. They begin the collection process by issuing a  demand letter to the financial institution. Upon receipt of the demand  letter, the financial institution makes the payment to the Clerk of the  Courts. According to officials from the Administrative Office of the U.S.", "Courts, the Clerk of the Courts initially collects the payments which are  deposited into a Treasury account for DOJ\u2019s Crime Victims Fund. Funds  in the Crime Victims Fund can be used for authorized purposes including  support of several state and federal crime victim assistance\u2013related  grants and activities, among other things. DOJ officials told us that all  criminal fines, with a few exceptions, are deposited into the Crime Victims  Fund. This may include criminal fines related to violations of BSA/AML  requirements and U.S. sanctions regulations. In the cases we identified  from January 2009 through December 2015, the court ordered about  $141 million in criminal fines for violations of BSA/AML and U.S.  sanctions programs requirements. The $140 million fine assessed against  BNP Paribas was deposited into the Crime Victims Fund.", "Additionally, in the cases we reviewed, DOJ had litigated a court case  against a financial institution for civil violations of U.S. sanctions programs  requirements which resulted in a civil penalty. The civil penalty collection  process is similar to the criminal fine collection process, but the financial  institution makes the payment to DOJ\u2019s accounts in the Treasury General  Fund instead of to the Clerk of the Courts. As previously discussed in this  report, monies in the Treasury General Fund are used according to the  purposes described in Congress\u2019s annual appropriations. Civil penalties  are also eligible to be assessed up to a 3 percent fee for disbursement to  DOJ\u2019s Three Percent Fund, which is primarily used to offset DOJ  expenses related to civil debt collection. Of the cases we identified, one  case involved a civil penalty of $79 million against Commerzbank for  violating U.S. sanctions program requirements. DOJ collected the  Commerzbank civil penalty, deposited it into DOJ\u2019s accounts in the  Treasury General Fund, and assessed a nearly 3 percent fee (about $2.3  million) that was deposited into the Three Percent Fund."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to Treasury, DOJ, SEC, OCC, FDIC,  and the Federal Reserve for review and comment.

Specifically, our objectives in this report were to describe  (1) the amount of fines, penalties, and forfeitures that the federal  government has collected for these violations from January 2009 through  December 2015; and (2) the process for collecting these funds and the  purposes for which they are used.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed prior GAO and Office of the  Inspector General reports and relevant laws and regulations. We also  reviewed data and documentation and interviewed officials from key  agencies responsible for implementing and enforcing BSA/AML, FCPA,  and U.S. sanctions programs requirements. The agencies and offices  included in this review were: (1) offices within the Department of the  Treasury\u2019s (Treasury) Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence,  including officials from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network  (FinCEN), Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and Treasury  Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture, and Treasury\u2019s Office of  Management; (2) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); (3) the  federal banking regulators\u2014Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  System (Federal Reserve), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  (FDIC), National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), and the Office of  the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC); and (4) the Department of Justice  (DOJ).", "To respond to our first objective, we identified and analyzed these  agencies\u2019 data on enforcement actions taken against financial institutions  that resulted in fines, penalties, or forfeitures for violations of BSA/AML,  FCPA, and U.S. sanctions programs requirements. Specifically, we  analyzed publicly available data from January 2009 through December  2015 on penalties assessed against financial institutions by the Federal  Reserve, FDIC, OCC, SEC, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement  Network (FinCEN), a bureau within Treasury, for violations of BSA/AML  requirements. NCUA officials we spoke with explained that they had not  assessed any penalties against financial institutions for violations of  BSA/AML requirements from January 2009 through December 2015.  FDIC and SEC provided us with a list of enforcement actions they took for  BSA/AML violations since 2009, as we were not able to identify all of their  actions through their publicly available data. We also reviewed Federal  Reserve data on penalties for violations of U.S. sanctions programs  requirements and data that SEC provided on FCPA violations. In  addition, we reviewed enforcement actions listed on Treasury\u2019s Office of  Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) website to identify penalties assessed  against financial institutions for violations of U.S. sanctions programs  requirements enforced by OFAC. To identify enforcement actions taken  against financial institutions from the actions listed on OFAC\u2019s website,  we applied Treasury\u2019s definition of financial institutions, which covers  regulated entities in the financial industry.", "To identify criminal cases against financial institutions for violations of  BSA and sanctions-related requirements, we reviewed press releases  from DOJ\u2019s Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section, associated  court documents, and enforcement actions taken against financial  institutions from the actions listed on OFAC\u2019s website (see table 3 for a  list of these cases). We developed this approach in consultation with  DOJ officials as their data system primarily tracks assets forfeited by the  related case, which can include multiple types of violations, rather than by  a specific type of violation, such as BSA or sanctions-related violations.  Therefore, this report does not cover the entire universe of such criminal  cases as they may not have all been publicized through this channel.  However, this approach does include key cases for the period under our  review that involved large amounts of forfeitures. We obtained data from  DOJ\u2019s Consolidated Asset Tracking System to determine the amounts  forfeited for these cases, and verified any Treasury-related data in DOJ\u2019s  system by obtaining information from the Treasury Executive Office for  Asset Forfeiture. DOJ had not brought any criminal cases against  financial institutions for violations of FCPA.", "We assessed the reliability of the data we used in this report by reviewing  prior GAO assessments of these data, interviewing knowledgeable  agency officials, and reviewing relevant documentation, such as agency  enforcement orders for the assessments. To verify that these amounts  had been collected, we requested verifying documentation from agencies  confirming that these assessments had been collected, and also obtained  and reviewed documentation for a sample of the data to verify that the  amount assessed matched the amount collected. As a result, we  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We  also assessed the reliability of the DOJ data fields we reported on by  reviewing prior GAO and DOJ evaluations of these data and interviewing  knowledgeable officials from DOJ. We determined that these data were  also sufficiently reliable for our report.", "To respond to our second objective\u2014to describe how funds for violations  of BSA/AML, FCPA, and U.S. sanctions programs requirements were  collected\u2014we identified and summarized documentation of the various  steps and key agency internal controls for collection processes, such as  procedures for how financial institutions remit payments. We also  obtained documentation, such as statements documenting receipt of a  penalty payment, for a sample of penalties. We interviewed officials from  each agency about the process used to collect payments for assessed  fines or penalties and, for relevant agencies, the processes for collecting  cash and assets for forfeitures and where funds were deposited. To  describe how these collections were used, we reviewed documentation  on the types of expenditures that can be authorized from the accounts  and funds they are deposited in. Specifically, we obtained documentation  on the authorized or allowed expenditures for accounts in the Treasury  General Fund, Treasury Forfeiture Fund (TFF), and DOJ\u2019s Assets  Forfeiture Fund (AFF) and Crime Victims Fund.
