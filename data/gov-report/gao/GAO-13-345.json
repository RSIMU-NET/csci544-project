However, millions more people still need treatment. Congress reauthorized PEPFAR in 2008--authorizing up to $48 billion over 5 years--making it a major policy goal to help partner countries develop independent, sustainable HIV programs. Congress also set spending and treatment targets. OGAC leads PEPFAR by allocating funding and providing guidance to implementing agencies. As requested GAO reviewed PEPFAR-supported treatment programs. GAO examined (1) how perpatient treatment costs have changed and affected program implementation, (2) how PEPFAR cost information supports efforts to expand treatment, and (3) how PEPFAR has met a legislated treatment spending requirement. GAO reviewed cost analyses and reports and analyzed ARV drug data relating to fiscal years 2005 through 2011; conducted fieldwork in three countries selected on the basis of program size and other factors; and interviewed PEPFAR officials and implementing partners."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of State's (State) Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) has reported that per-patient treatment costs declined from about $1,053 to $339 from 2005 to 2011. Purchasing generic antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, together with declining drug prices, has led to substantial savings. OGAC estimates that the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has saved $934 million since fiscal year 2005 by buying generic instead of branded products. PEPFAR's analyses of data from eight country treatment-cost studies indicate that per-patient costs also declined as programs realized economies of scale while taking on new patients. Furthermore, the analyses suggest that costs decreased as countries' treatment programs matured, particularly in the first year after programs expanded, and reduced one-time investments. Per-patient cost savings have facilitated substantial increases in the number of people on ARV treatment. In September 2012, an estimated 8 million were on treatment in lowand middle-income countries, of which PEPFAR directly supported 5.1 million-- an increase of 125 percent since 2008, the year the program was reauthorized.", "Despite substantial declines in per-patient treatment costs, it is important that countries continue to improve the efficiency of their programs to expand to meet the needs of the estimated 23 million people eligible for ARV treatment under recent international guidelines. PEPFAR's cost estimation and expenditure analysis approaches provide complementary information that can help partner countries expand treatment and identify potential cost savings. However, as currently applied, these approaches do not capture the full costs of treatment. Cost estimation provides in-depth information, but data are limited because detailed cost studies have been done in only eight partner countries, at a small number of sites. Moreover, although treatment programs are changing rapidly, key data for most of the studies are no longer timely, since they were collected in 2006 and 2007. PEPFAR does not have a plan for systematically conducting or repeating cost studies in partner countries. Data from expenditure analyses, while more timely, are limited because they do not include non-PEPFAR costs. Without more timely and comprehensive information on treatment costs, PEFPAR may be missing opportunities to identify potential savings, which are critical for expanding HIV treatment programs to those in need.", "Using an OGAC-developed budgetary formula, PEPFAR has met the legislative requirement that more than half of its funds be spent each year to provide specific treatment and care services for people living with HIV. From fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2012, PEPFAR funds allocated to capacity building--to strengthen health systems, laboratory capacity, and strategic information systems--increased from 15 percent to 21 percent of PEPFAR's total funds to support country programs. However, the current formula does not include the capacity building funds. These funds--which support PEPFAR country teams' efforts to meet another legislative goal of promoting sustainable country-owned programs--and other PEPFAR activities also contribute to HIV treatment and care services. PEPFAR does not currently have a methodology to account for those contributions. Without such a methodology, it is not possible to determine the full amount of PEPFAR funds that are allocated to support the HIV treatment and care services identified in the spending requirement.

Although PEPFAR\u2019s overall increases in generic ARV purchases have  been steady and substantial over the 7 years of data that we reviewed,  the percentage of PEPFAR purchases for generic ARVs each year has  varied across countries based on the availability of quality-assured  generic products in each country.

Five studies  were completed in 2009 (Botswana, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Uganda, and  Vietnam); two studies were completed in 2011 (Mozambique and  Tanzania); and one study was completed in 2012 (Kenya). In the country  treatment-cost studies, ARV and non-ARV drug costs (e.g., equipment,  personnel, and supplies) were identified and evaluated over a period of at  least 1 year as the treatment program expanded.

This analysis estimated a 43 percent decline in per- patient costs if an additional 500 to 5,000 patients are put on ARV  treatment, and a 28 percent decline in per-patient costs if an additional  5,000 to 10,000 patients are put on ARV treatment. Program scale was  also identified in the eight country treatment-cost studies as a factor  affecting per-patient treatment costs, as each country experienced large  increases in the number of people put on ARV treatment after rapid  expansion in clinic capacity and infrastructure in PEPFAR-supported  treatment programs. Officials told us that these reductions with program  scale are due to the efficiencies gained with larger patient cohorts.", "The 2012 summary analysis also identified a relationship between the  program maturity\u2014the time elapsed since sites began expanding their  treatment programs\u2014and reduced per-patient treatment costs. The  summary analysis determined that per-patient costs declined an  estimated 41 percent from 0 to 12 months, and declined an estimated 25  percent from 12 to 24 months. The majority of country treatment-cost  studies found that the first year following expansion saw the greatest  reduction in costs, followed by minor cost reductions in later evaluation  periods. In each country studied, the expansion of treatment programs  included one-time investments, such as training and equipment costs, as  well as ongoing costs, such as personnel and laboratory supplies, that  were analyzed over time. After the large increase in funding at the  beginning of the study period, one-time costs fell by the end of the study  period in all eight countries, ranging from a 9 to 93 percent decline.  Ongoing costs also fell from the beginning to the end of the evaluation  period, ranging from a 16 to 59 percent decline. PEPFAR attributes the  relationship between declining per-patient treatment costs and program  maturity as due primarily to the reduction in one-time investments and in  part to fewer resources needed for ongoing investments as the programs  expanded treatment.

The 2012 updates did not change WHO\u2019s  recommendations about when to initiate ARV treatment; however, the  revised guidance described the long-term benefits of expanding eligibility  for ARV treatment in several categories of HIV-positive people, including  all pregnant and breastfeeding women and certain high-risk populations,  in order to prevent HIV transmission. Some countries are beginning to  expand eligibility for ARV treatment to some of these groups, particularly  by initiating lifelong ARV treatment for all HIV-positive pregnant and  breastfeeding women as part of concerted efforts to eliminate mother-to- child transmission of HIV.

For example, Nigeria\u2019s 2009 country treatment-cost study  projected costs under three scenarios: (1) keeping its treatment targets at  2008 levels, (2) adding 100,000 patients, and (3) adding more than  200,000 patients, which represented half of those estimated to need ARV  treatment in 2008."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PEPFAR Has Detailed Cost Information but Needs More Timely and Comprehensive Data", "paragraphs": ["or  including more widespread approach to HIV testing with immediate initiation of ARV  treatment for those found to be HIV positive.

However, neither  approach captures the full costs to country treatment programs of  meeting increasing demand and resource needs in environments that are  continually changing.", "PEPFAR\u2019s cost estimation approach identifies the costs of providing  comprehensive HIV treatment services in a partner country, examines the  range of the costs across delivery sites and types of patients, and  analyzes the costs over a period of at least 1 year. This approach\u2014and  the country treatment-cost studies conducted as its primary information  source\u2014provides valuable information on the costs of delivering  comprehensive HIV treatment services. The country treatment-cost  studies consist of in-depth analysis from patient record data and  interviews from a selected number of delivery sites\u2014outpatient clinics  that provide comprehensive HIV treatment services. Each delivery site\u2019s  data is grouped by cost unit and segmented into 6-month periods in  order to examine ARV drug and non-ARV drug costs over time. Cost  estimation allows PEPFAR to assess costs to itself and to other funding  sources\u2014country governments, including Global Fund contributions, and  other local and international organizations. However, there are three key  limitations.", "First, the cost estimation approach has provided valuable information on  the costs of delivering comprehensive HIV treatment services, but a lack  of timely data is a significant limitation, particularly given the rapid pace of  change in treatment programs. Data for five of the eight country  treatment-cost studies were collected between April 2006 and March  2007\u2014before the significant expansion of country treatment programs.  PEPFAR officials noted that changes in treatment program costs can  happen too fast to be captured, and because the data collection and  analysis for country treatment-cost studies are time and resource  intensive, the reported results from the studies lag behind conditions on  the ground. PEPFAR collects retrospective data for a determined period  of time\u2014typically a few months\u2014and analyzes that data for treatment  costs and results, which requires a period of typically 2 years. For  example, Nigeria\u2019s treatment-cost study involved data collection at nine  delivery sites and supporting organizations from April to October 2006,  but the final report on the results was completed in December 2009.  Moreover, most country cost estimates included data collected in 6-month  periods beginning at or around the start of PEPFAR support, thus  providing cost information on the impact of treatment expansion with  PEPFAR funds. Only one country treatment-cost study\u2014Kenya\u2019s 2012  study\u2014covered a time period of data collection that could indicate how  costs changed after PEPFAR\u2019s increased support of expanded treatment  programs.", "Second, PEPFAR\u2019s cost estimation approach has been limited in the  scope of information it has provided because of the small number and  type of delivery sites selected. For seven of the eight country treatment- cost studies, patient record data consist mostly of data that typically were  collected from nine outpatient clinics per country that received direct or  indirect PEPFAR support. In addition, PEPFAR reports that the selected  sites vary in how representative they are of the respective country  program.among sites because the services provided may differ widely.  Additionally, services and costs at sites in one country may not represent  the type of services provided under comprehensive HIV treatment  available across other PEPFAR partner countries, which makes it difficult  to identify best practices that can be applied to other programs to  increase program efficiency. However, PEPFAR\u2019s most recent country  treatment-cost study (completed in Kenya in October 2012) included 29  delivery sites and was the first study to use random sampling to select  sites. PEPFAR officials characterized the study as a representative  sample of the country\u2019s delivery sites. Separately, limited information is  available for sites not supported by PEPFAR. Although entities outside  PEPFAR have conducted studies to estimate treatment costs at different  sites, PEPFAR reports that these studies have not assessed as many  services (e.g., services for people living with HIV who are not yet on ARV  treatment), and, as a result, there were not sufficient, comparable data  available for a meaningful comparison of costs.", "The costs of comprehensive HIV treatment services vary  Third, although PEPFAR\u2019s cost estimation process enables it to analyze  costs at the treatment facility level for PEPFAR and other funding  sources, it does not include program management costs incurred above  the facility level. In addition, PEPFAR has identified but not analyzed  possible cost benefits associated with improved patient outcomes from  standardization and extended monitoring intervals for stable patients, and  continued decreases in ARV drug pricing because of better tolerated  regimens and declines in second-line regimen formulations. Challenges in  linking cost data to patient outcomes data was identified as a limitation by  all of the country treatment-cost studies. Information on program  management costs and outcomes will become increasingly important as  countries take on additional responsibility for supporting treatment  delivery and allocating resources across all program sites.", "To obtain more timely cost information, PEPFAR began piloting the use of  expenditure analysis in 2009 to review country-specific PEPFAR  spending across program activities, including treatment. PEPFAR\u2019s  expenditure analysis approach involves collecting data from PEPFAR  implementing partners on amounts that each partner spent to provide  direct or indirect treatment services, and links that spending to the  numbers of patients receiving support for treatment through the partner.  The expenditure analysis approach updates costs rapidly and includes  information on PEPFAR costs above the facility level. Between 2009 and  2012, PEPFAR completed nine expenditure analysis pilots in eight  countries. PEPFAR officials told us that, during fiscal year 2012, it  began to use its formal expenditure analysis approach in a different set of  nine countries, and these analyses were completed and disseminated to  countries in February 2013. PEPFAR uses expenditure analysis to  identify spending outliers among its implementing partners. PEPFAR  officials said they use that information to discuss with implementing  partners the causes of their relatively high or low expenditures per patient  and to identify potential efficiencies that other partners can implement.  For example, in Mozambique\u2014the first country to complete a second  expenditure analysis\u2014PEPFAR officials found that the variation of per- patient expenditures for non-ARV drug costs narrowed among five  implementing partners between 2009 and 2011. PEPFAR attributed the  smaller range of expenditures in part to their ability to use expenditure  analysis data to stress efficient delivery of services.", "Expenditure analysis does not provide a comprehensive picture of  treatment costs, because it only includes spending by PEPFAR  implementing partners. Although expenditure analysis enables PEPFAR  to allocate resources more efficiently by comparing its implementing  partners, it does not include spending from partner-country resources and  other funding sources. Because PEPFAR cannot require reporting for  non-PEPFAR resources, PEPFAR officials stated that using diplomatic  efforts with country governments has been a priority to enable sharing of  expenditure data. PEPFAR has reported that the vast majority of patients  on PEPFAR-supported ARV treatment receive services in the public  sector (36 of the 43 delivery sites among the five country treatment-cost  studies completed by 2009 were government-run facilities). As a result,  cost information across all treatment partners at the facility and country  level is important for facilitating fully informed discussions among those  partners about current and future resource allocation. (The features of  PEPFAR\u2019s cost estimation and expenditure analysis approaches for  obtaining cost information are described in table 2.)", "Each of PEPFAR\u2019s complementary approaches provides cost information  that can help countries to plan for the efficient expansion of treatment  programs, and PEPFAR has made some plans to strengthen each  approach. As of February 2013, PEPFAR was preparing three additional  country treatment-cost studies, including a follow-up study in Tanzania\u2014 PEPFAR\u2019s first repetition of a study in a partner country. In addition,  PEPFAR has shortened the time frame for examining costs, compared  with the time frames for earlier studies. In the Kenya, Mozambique, and  Tanzania treatment-cost studies that were completed in 2011 and 2012,  the data collection period for all facilities was a maximum of 1 year (or two  6-month periods). PEPFAR officials told us that cost estimation is  important for identifying cost drivers, especially because it includes non- PEPFAR costs and can be used to develop cost projections for various  treatment scenarios. However, because the studies are in-depth  analyses, requiring extensive field work, they will continue to be time and  resource intensive. PEPFAR officials told us that conducting country  treatment-cost studies more regularly has not been their highest priority;  they noted that their efforts have been focused on implementing  processes for routine expenditure analysis in PEPFAR partner countries.  Although PEPFAR has taken steps to strengthen cost estimation, country  treatment-cost studies have been conducted in only a small number of  countries (eight partner countries) and delivery sites (usually about nine  clinics per country). In addition, although PEPFAR-supported treatment  programs are changing rapidly, for five of the eight studies that have been  completed, data were collected between 2006 and 2007. PEPFAR  currently does not have a plan for systematically conducting or repeating  country treatment-cost studies, as appropriate, in partner countries.  Without such a plan, PEPFAR may be missing opportunities to identify  potential savings, which are critical for expanding HIV treatment programs  to those in need.", "Using the expenditure analysis approach to obtain more rapid cost  information to inform planning efforts by country teams addresses the  timeliness limitations of the country treatment-cost studies, but does not  capture non-PEPFAR costs. However, PEPFAR officials told us that non- PEPFAR spending data are difficult to obtain because the budget  processes of each partner are often not aligned and country systems may  not be structured to aggregate HIV-specific data. For example, in an  expenditure analysis pilot in Guyana, officials said that aligning  expenditure categories across all treatment partners (PEPFAR, Global  Fund, and Guyana Ministry of Health) was a time-consuming process  requiring negotiation with the country government on the level of  alignment needed. PEPFAR reports that it has engaged with country  governments and multilateral partners to address the ability to capture full  country-expenditure data. Further, it has begun collaborating with up to  three countries to obtain expenditure data for the full country program  during 2013. Although we recognize the difficulties involved in capturing  non-PEPFAR expenditures, these spending data are important for  decision makers as countries take on additional responsibility for  allocating resources. PEPFAR officials told us that, by the end of fiscal  year 2014, they plan to roll out formal expenditure analysis to all PEPFAR  countries as part of annual reporting requirements; however, they said  there are no current plans to routinely capture non-PEPFAR costs in  those analyses. Without comprehensive data on expenditures, PEPFAR- supported programs will not be fully informed when making decisions  about how to allocate resources."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Using OGAC\u2019s Budgetary Formula, PEPFAR Has Met the Treatment Spending Requirement, but the Formula Does Not Fully Account for All Funds", "paragraphs": ["The 2008 Leadership Act requires that more than half of PEPFAR funds  be used to support specific aspects of treatment and care for people living  with HIV.

Over the same time  frame, OGAC-defined budgets for \u201ctreatment and care for people living  with HIV\u201d declined from about $1.8 billion to $1.4 billion.

OGAC officials said  that this approach allows OGAC to isolate budgeted funds that support  the direct services that PEPFAR delivers to patients at the facility level,  consistent with PEPFAR\u2019s early focus on directly delivering treatment  services as part of a broad emergency response.", "As PEPFAR\u2019s role in each country has evolved, the components of  PEPFAR country team budgets that contribute to the HIV treatment and  care services specified in the spending requirement have also evolved.  However, some of those funds are not accounted for in the current  budgetary formula.

Some capacity-building efforts,  such as enhancements to drug supply chain systems that are budgeted  under health systems strengthening, also contribute to HIV treatment and  care services. Other health systems strengthening activities may have a  less direct effect on those services. Moreover, OGAC officials said that  some funds budgeted for prevention activities\u2014particularly funds for  prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV that cover ARV  treatment and care services for HIV-positive pregnant and breastfeeding  women\u2014also contribute to HIV treatment and care services.

Data from  the last 4 years indicate that the growth in treatment programs is  accelerating. Substantial declines in the costs of providing treatment to  each individual have contributed to recent accomplishments. Despite this  progress, there is substantial unmet need. More than 15 million people  are estimated to be eligible for ARV treatment based on current WHO  guidelines. Moreover, 23 million would be eligible if programs expanded  eligibility to include groups such as all pregnant and breastfeeding women  and certain high-risk populations, consistent with recommendations in  recent updates to WHO guidelines.", "In order for the country programs that PEPFAR supports to be able to  expand to meet these needs, it will be important that they maximize how  efficiently they use available resources. Given the scale of the unmet  need, countries\u2019 plans to expand HIV treatment may continue to drive up  the total costs of providing treatment even if per-patient treatment costs  further decline. Each country\u2019s ability to expand treatment, then, hinges  on thorough planning based on data-driven analyses of the cost of  delivering the full scope of comprehensive HIV treatment services. This is  a complex task as cost inputs often cut across PEPFAR budget codes,  and costs are incurred by PEPFAR and other donors, partner-country  governments, and multilateral partners. Although PEPFAR has used its  cost estimation and expenditure analysis approaches to assist countries\u2019  planning efforts and describe opportunities for savings, treatment costs  have not yet been fully studied. In particular, existing data are not always  timely, come from a limited number of sites in select countries, and do not  always capture non-PEPFAR costs.

Using OGAC\u2019s budgetary formula, PEPFAR has met the  current spending requirement. Over the same time frame, PEPFAR funds  have been devoted increasingly to building country capacity. However,  because OGAC cannot fully account for the contributions that its country  capacity building activities have made to the HIV treatment and care  services identified in the treatment spending requirement, it cannot  provide complete information on how PEPFAR funds are being allocated  to meet both the treatment spending requirement and the goal of  promoting country ownership.
