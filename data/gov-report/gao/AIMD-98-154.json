In June 1996, we testified that VBA needed to develop a much improved investment strategy for selecting and managing information technology projects in a more disciplined, businesslike manner. In January 1998, we reported that while VA made significant progress in preparing a strategic plan, dated September 30, 1997, the plan needed improvement in four major areas: (1) development of results-oriented goals, (2) descriptions of how the goals are to be achieved, (3) discussion of external factors, and (4) discussion of coordination efforts with other agencies. Finally, in October 1997, we testified on the importance of having strong CIOs at major federal agencies, such as VA, to bring about much-needed reforms in the government\u2019s management of information technology. In addition, a panel of the National Academy of Public Administration reported in August 1997, that VBA lacks strategic planning and management capabilities that are necessary for leadership to define where the organization wants to be, enable development of specific operational plans for getting there, and provide a set of coordinating and integrating capacities for implementing planned initiatives.", "Recognizing the need to better manage information technology, recent legislative reforms\u2014the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, and the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994\u2014provide guidance to federal agencies on how to plan, manage, and acquire information technology as part of their overall information resources management responsibilities.
