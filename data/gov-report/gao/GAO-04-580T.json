This statement is based on GAO's May 14, 2003, report and discusses the roles of private, state, and federal entities that oversee the appraisal industry; the challenges that Title XI presented to these entities; and industry participants' concerns about the effectiveness of the Title XI regulatory structure."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Title XI created a complex oversight structure for real estate appraisals and appraisers that involves private, state, and federal entities. Two private entities under the Appraisal Foundation establish uniform rules for real estate appraisals and set minimum criteria for certifying appraisers. State regulatory agencies certify appraisers based on these criteria. In addition, states (1) implement licensing of real estate appraisers and (2) monitor and supervise compliance with appraisal standards and requirements. The federal financial regulators oversee financial institutions' use of appraisals, and a federal agency, the Appraisal Subcommittee, monitors the functions of the entities. As part of its oversight activities, the Appraisal Subcommittee performs field reviews of the state appraiser regulatory agencies. GAO found that these reviews and their resulting reports could be more useful if based on clear and consistent criteria for assessing states' compliance with Title XI requirements. All of these entities except the federal financial regulators identified potential impediments to carrying out their Title XI responsibilities. The two private entities stated that fund limitations could impede their ability to ensure that development of standards and qualifications evolve with changing conditions. State agencies said that funding shortfalls hindered their ability to enforce compliance. Appraisal Subcommittee staff reported that rule-making authority and additional enforcement sanctions could facilitate its oversight of state compliance with Title XI. The lack of funding and resources cited by state appraiser regulatory agencies and the two private entities, which establish appraisal standards and appraiser qualification criteria, could affect their future ability to fulfill their Title XI responsibilities. At the same time, the Appraisal Subcommittee has accumulated an operating surplus of almost $4 million from fees levied and collected by the states on behalf of the federal government. Industry participants raised concerns about aspects of the Title XI regulatory system for appraisers. They cited differences in state regulation that affect both lenders and appraisers, gaps in Title XI's coverage--for example, transactions of less than $250,000 do not require an appraisal, high fees and burdensome processes for having appraiser education courses approved, and weak enforcement and complaints processing. Some industry participants felt that states, traditionally involved in regulating professions, should solely regulate the appraisal industry. Others felt that the current structure needed a significant overhaul to become effective. GAO found no clear consensus among the state regulatory agencies it surveyed or other industry participants regarding the need for or impact of possible changes to the Title XI regulatory structure."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to discuss our report on  federal oversight of the real estate appraisal industry. In response to  concerns that faulty and fraudulent appraisals played a major role in the  savings and loans crisis of the 1980s, Congress enacted Title XI of the  Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989  (FIRREA). Among other things, Title XI requires that real estate appraisals  used in connection with federally related transactions be performed in  writing, in accordance with uniform professional standards, and by  individuals whose competency has been demonstrated and whose  professional conduct is subject to effective supervision.", "My statement today, which is based on our May 2003 report, discusses (1)  the specific responsibilities of the entities that comprise the Title XI  oversight structure, (2) factors which these entities identified as potential  impediments to carrying out their Title XI responsibilities; and (3)  concerns expressed by the entities and industry participants about the  effectiveness of the existing regulatory structure. In preparing our report,  we reviewed FIRREA and its legislative history; interviewed officials from  the entities involved in the Title XI regulatory structure; and surveyed  appraiser regulatory agencies in the 50 states, the District of Columbia,  and U.S. territories. Additionally, we met with officials and  representatives of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government sponsored  enterprises (GSEs) that establish standards for appraisals associated with  mortgages they purchase; the Department of Housing and Urban  Development (HUD), which establishes appraisal requirements for its  insured mortgages; trade groups representing appraisers and mortgage  lenders; appraiser education providers; and academic experts.", "In summary, we found the following:  Title XI created a complex regulatory system that relies upon the actions  of private, state, and federal entities to help assure the quality of appraisals  and the qualifications of appraisers used in federally related transactions.", "Two private entities\u2014the Appraisal Standards Board and Appraiser  Qualifications Board\u2014respectively establish (1) uniform rules for  preparing and reporting real estate appraisals and (2) minimum  qualification criteria for certified real estate appraisers.

State appraiser  agencies\u2014which are funded at the state level\u2014reported resource  limitations as the primary impediment in carrying out their oversight  responsibilities.

The five federal financial institution regulators reported no major  impediments to carrying out their Title XI responsibilities. The Appraisal  Subcommittee reported that rule-making authority and additional  authority to ensure state compliance with Title XI could facilitate its  monitoring of state compliance with Title XI. Subcommittee officials  stated that the only mechanism available under Title XI for effecting state  compliance is to decertify a state, which would prohibit all licensed or  certified appraisers from that state from performing appraisals in  conjunction with federally related transactions and have a devastating  effect on the real estate markets and financial institutions within that  state.

In addition, some  industry participants cited concerns with the lack of a national  qualification criteria for the licensed real estate appraiser category.  Education providers and appraiser trade groups expressed concerns about  the Appraiser Qualifications Board\u2019s fees and requirements for instructor  certification and course approval.

Furthermore,  appraisals are sometimes confused with home inspections, which are  intended to warn consumers about serious defects in the home being  purchased that should be repaired. In a loan transaction, the lender rather  than the borrower engages the appraiser, and this usually occurs after the  borrower has agreed to purchase the property.", "The primary purpose of the appraisal reforms contained in Title XI was to  assist in protecting the federal deposit insurance funds\u2014and, by  extension, mortgage lenders\u2014from avoidable losses.

The states\u2019 programs typically  included temporary and reciprocal licensing provisions, though as  discussed below, the provisions varied. (Title XI requires states to  recognize on a temporary basis real estate appraisers who have been  certified or licensed by another state if certain conditions are met, and  encourages states to develop reciprocity agreements that readily authorize  appraisers who are licensed by and in good standing with their home state  to perform appraisals in other states.)", "In addition to conducting certification and licensing activities, states with  certifying and licensing agencies are required under Title XI to provide the  Appraisal Subcommittee with the names of those appraisers who become  certified or licensed in accordance with Title XI, and to collect from them  an annual registry fee that goes to the subcommittee.

According to an  official from the Appraisal Subcommittee, Title XI\u2019s intent was to ensure  that appraisers for federally related transactions met minimum  requirements for experience and education and had been examined in  order to ensure a minimum level of competency. But Title XI specifically  provides that the Appraisal Subcommittee will not set requirements for  licensing and that any subcommittee recommendations are nonbinding.  Some groups believe that this provision has led to a lack of uniform  qualifications in licensing across the country (for example, in education  and experience) and may also have helped to create an environment  conducive to mortgage fraud.", "At the time of our review, officials from the Appraisal Subcommittee  reported that most states have adopted provisions requiring that licensed  appraisers meet AQB recommended criteria. However, six states did not  have a state-licensed appraiser category, and six had licensing  requirements that were less stringent than the AQB\u2019s. As a result,  subcommittee officials said, some licensed appraisers may not meet  recommended qualifications criteria. For example, in 2002, one state  passed legislation that eliminated the experience requirement for its  licensed appraisers; and, in 2001, another state revised its licensing criteria  to comply with AQB requirements but at the same time \u201cgrandfathered\u201d in  several hundred licensed appraisers.", "According to two regulatory officials, problems related to the lack of  uniformity in licensing appraisers are compounded by the fact that Title XI  also makes licensing voluntary at the state level. Voluntary licensing  means that the state does not have a legislative requirement that  appraisers be licensed or certified. However, the volunteer states do  provide the opportunity for an appraiser to become licensed or certified in  order to perform federally related transactions. As of March 2003, 10 states  were classified as being in the voluntary licensing category. Some  regulators, as well as one appraiser trade group, view voluntary licensing  as a serious flaw in the industry\u2019s regulatory structure and a probable  contributor to mortgage fraud. Moreover, voluntary licensing may  indirectly place the onus on financial institutions to ensure that appraisers  for federally related transactions have the appropriate qualifications. One  federal financial institution regulator reported that most of the mortgage  fraud problems it has encountered have occurred in states where licensing  is voluntary. An earlier Federal Bureau of Investigation testimony at a  special congressional hearing on predatory lending in March 2000 echoed  this view. According to that testimony, the most egregious property  flipping problems have occurred in states where licensing is voluntary for  transactions that are not federally related.", "Industry participants also cited a lack of uniformity in the way states grant  temporary and reciprocal licenses. Because a state may not recognize the  credentials from another state, appraisers often have to carry multiple  state licenses. The Appraisal Subcommittee has issued policy statements  on temporary practice and encouraging reciprocity. However, our survey  indicated that state regulatory agencies continue to vary widely on these  issues. For example, of the 53 states and territories that responded to this  question, 40 issued temporary licenses for single assignments, 16 allowed  an appraiser only one temporary license at a time, and 15 limited the  number of temporary licenses an appraiser could receive annually. Six of  the 54 respondents to our survey indicated that visiting appraisers are  required to pass a state exam in order to receive a reciprocal license. This  practice is inconsistent with the Appraisal Subcommittee\u2019s guidance  recommending that states accept licenses or certification from other  states meeting AQB requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transactions Not Covered by Title XI", "paragraphs": ["Industry participants also voiced concerns about the fact that Title XI does  not cover all financial institutions and that mortgage brokers are not  subject to federal regulation. When Title XI was enacted, federally  regulated lending institutions (banks, thrifts, and credit unions) made  most mortgage loans. Today, other financial institutions, such as mortgage  bankers and finance companies, account for a substantial share of the  mortgage marketplace. Many of these financial institutions that are not  federally regulated, as well as an increasing portion of regulated financial  institutions, use mortgage brokers to originate loans, so that these brokers  now originate about 50 percent of all mortgage loans. These entities and  individuals may have state licenses, but they are not monitored by federal  or state entities through, for example, examinations or audits. Appraisers  have anecdotally reported that these originators pressure them the most to  appraise properties at or near the purchase price to assure that the  mortgage transaction will occur.", "Some industry participants have said that the $250,000 real estate  appraisal threshold established by the federal financial institution  regulators undercuts efforts to protect consumers. These groups believe  that oversight of real estate appraisals should be geared toward the  interests of consumers, who should be able to expect an unbiased,  objective third-party opinion of the value of real property offered as  security for a loan. However, Title XI was enacted in response to the  impact of appraisal problems on federally insured depository institutions,  and federal financial institution regulators have identified few problems or  risks to depository institutions associated with loans valued below the  $250,000 threshold."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Costs and Lack of Uniform Approval Processes for Appraiser Education Courses", "paragraphs": ["Several state regulators and education providers expressed concerns  about the expenses and lack of uniformity in the processes associated  with approving instructors and courses for appraisers\u2019 continuing  education. A representative of an appraisers\u2019 trade group noted that  gaining approval for a course and an instructor in one state does not  necessarily translate into approval in other states. As a result, the trade  group spent around $30,000 having courses for a July 2000 training  conference approved in all jurisdictions. Some appraisal industry  participants believe that the added cost and procedures involved in  acquiring approval in each state is overly burdensome.", "AQB officials told us that the board has set up a voluntary national system  for approving courses and that these concerns had influenced their  project. According to the AQB, the course approval program was designed  to be a convenience for both course providers and state regulators while  helping to ensure quality appraisal courses. However, AQB\u2019s course and  instructor approval programs have met opposition in some quarters. For  example, some state officials and other industry participants stated that  requiring AQB approval for all USPAP refresher courses and instructors  and restricting course materials and examinations to AQB publications\u2014 for which AQB charges a royalty fee\u2014represent a conflict of interest. In  addition, some education providers have stated that the fees charged by  the AQB for its course and instructor approval are excessive. On the other  hand, some state and federal financial institution regulators believe that  the Appraisal Foundation and its boards possess expertise and resources  the states do not have and thus are needed to ensure that the quality of  appraiser education and training is not compromised.", "Similarly, some states and educators have expressed concern that the AQB  and Appraisal Subcommittee have encroached upon state authority in  setting certain appraisal standards and appraiser qualifications. For  example, the regulatory agency and an education provider in one state  objected to certain AQB education requirements for certified appraisers,  in particular a requirement that education providers be certified through  the AQB\u2019s instructor certification program. As part of its industry  monitoring function, the Appraisal Subcommittee reviewed those  standards and determined that the AQB had acted appropriately in  adopting them. The Appraisal Subcommittee also requested a legal opinion  from the Legal Advisory Group of the Federal Financial Institutions  Examination Council on the scope of AQB\u2019s authority to adopt education- related standards for certified appraisers; the scope of the Appraisal  Subcommittee\u2019s responsibility in monitoring the AQB; and the Appraisal  Subcommittee\u2019s authority to oversee state regulators\u2019 implementation of  AQB standards. In a June 2002 opinion, the Legal Advisory Group  concluded that the AQB\u2019s and Appraisal Subcommittee\u2019s actions appeared  to be consistent with and authorized by Title XI."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Variations in State Regulatory Agencies\u2019 Enforcement of Title XI Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Some industry participants reported a lack of uniformity in processing  complaints and taking disciplinary actions against those problem  appraisers that were referred to state regulatory authorities. We analyzed  data states submitted to the Appraisal Subcommittee and found that the  number of disciplinary actions taken differed widely. For example, one  state reported taking only a single disciplinary action, while two other  states accounted for over 25 percent of the 4,360 disciplinary actions  reported as of October 31, 2002.", "Several entities reported that states\u2019 complaint filing requirements ranged  from simple to onerous. For example, some states require simply that  complainants submit information on an allegation, while others accept  complaints only on a specific form, or require that complaint documents  be notarized or that complainants provide witnesses and testify against  appraisers. Other concerns included:    The length of time needed to resolve complaints. For example, one state  required 1 to 2 years, potentially allowing the appraiser to continue what  might be fraudulent or questionable practices.", "Statutes of limitations that pose an obstacle in penalizing appraisal  violators. For example, statutes in at least three states prohibit both  investigations into and punitive actions for unlawful appraisal activities  that allegedly took place more than 3 to 5 years earlier.", "In addition to concerns about the complaint process, industry participants  reported misgivings about outcomes, including disciplinary actions and  feedback. For example, Fannie Mae officials commented that they had  been dissatisfied with some state decisions on punitive actions and with  the lack of feedback on actions that had actually been taken. The officials  added that some states do not penalize appraisers for multiple violations if  the appraisers have already been disciplined or do not tell complainants  what action was taken. As an example, they noted that some states  appeared to perform meaningful investigations and took appropriate  actions while others appeared unwilling to investigate similar cases with  comparable support and documentation. HUD officials echoed this view,  saying that states typically do not take action when they are notified that  an enforcement action has been taken against an appraiser. Another  industry participant reported that there is little incentive to make referrals  given the fact that there is no assurance that the state will take action.", "According to Appraisal Subcommittee officials, a number of states have  told them that the referral information that Fannie Mae and HUD have  provided to the states is frequently in a format or manner that they cannot  readily absorb or use. For example, some of the states indicated that they  received over a hundred referrals from Fannie Mae as one group, which  overwhelmed the states\u2019 ability to review and investigate the referrals in a  timely basis. Other states stated that the referrals were for real estate  transactions for which the state\u2019s statute of limitations had already  expired. To improve the process for referring problem appraisals by  entities that oversee or use real estate appraisals to the state appraiser  agencies for possible enforcement actions, we recommended that the  Appraisal Subcommittee work with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and HUD to  ensure that the referral of problem appraisals (1) are provided in a format  that is useful to the state appraiser agencies and (2) facilitate the  subcommittee\u2019s efforts to monitor decisions made by the states regarding  the supervision of appraiser practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "No Clear Consensus Regarding the Need for Changes to the Title XI Regulatory Structure", "paragraphs": ["Among the various representatives of trade groups, education providers,  and other industry participants that we contacted, there were differing  opinions as to what, if any, changes were necessary to Title XI. Likewise,  the responses to the survey that we sent to the state appraiser agencies did  not indicate a clear consensus regarding states\u2019 views of the impacts of  eliminating some of the central aspects of the Title XI regulatory structure.", "Some officials from state appraiser agencies have expressed strong  viewpoints regarding the need for changes to Title XI. For example, an  official from one of the state appraiser regulatory agencies stated that the  states are now in a position to oversee the real estate appraisal industry  without any federal involvement, much as they do other professions. He  suggested that Congress eliminate the Appraisal Foundation and the AQB  and make the ASB independent and self-supporting. An official from  another state regulatory agency said that to correct the present system\u2019s  problems, Congress would need to completely restructure the Title XI  structure. He recommended eliminating the Appraisal Subcommittee and  the Appraisal Foundation, replacing them with a new board at the federal  level. The new board would represent the appraisal industry more broadly  and have strong Congressional accountability. He also suggested that  Congress clearly designate the states as having sole responsibility for  administering and enforcing Title XI.", "However, our survey of the state appraisal agencies showed a wide variety  of views. For example, 22 states and territories (41 percent) said that  eliminating the Appraisal Subcommittee would enhance their ability to  regulate appraisers, while 17 (31 percent) responded that eliminating the  subcommittee would be a hindrance. The remaining states felt that not  having the subcommittee would neither help nor hinder regulation.  Similarly, 31 and 23 states, respectively, indicated that eliminating the ASB  and AQB would hinder their efforts to regulate appraisers, while 10 and 21  states, respectively, indicated that eliminating the ASB and AQB would be  helpful.", "In conclusion, Title XI brought about significant changes in the real estate  appraisal industry. According to federal financial institution regulators,  real estate appraisals have not been a major factor in the failure of  federally insured financial institutions since the passage of Title XI.  However, opportunities exist to enhance the effectiveness of the current  regulatory system to help ensure that federally related transactions are  based on accurate assessments of the value of properties used as  collateral for loans.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
