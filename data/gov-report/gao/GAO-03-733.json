Last year, DOJ issued guidance in response to U.S. Attorneys' questions about their role in relation to two DOJ grant programs--Project Safe Neighborhoods and Weed and Seed. In addition, through its Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys (EOUSA), DOJ provided training on ethical considerations in dealing with grant applicants and grantees under both grant programs. Although EOUSA has an evaluation program to assess and oversee the overall operations of each U.S. Attorney's Office, the evaluations are not designed to assess whether U.S. Attorneys and their staffs are following the recently established guidelines. Without a mechanism to make this assessment, EOUSA does not have assurance that DOJ guidance is adequately understood, has reached all those who are covered by it, and is correctly applied. In addition, federal regulations and procedures call for systematic financial disclosure reporting to facilitate the review of possible conflicts of interest and ensure the efficient and honest operation of the government. However, while GAO did not identify any incidences of conflicts of interest, certain individuals--staff in U.S. Attorneys Offices that work with grantees and nonfederal members of committees that are appointed by each U.S. Attorney to, among other things, assess the merits of grant proposals--are not required to disclose whether they are free from actual or apparent conflicts of interest.

Without a mechanism for monitoring U.S. Attorneys Offices\u2019  compliance with available guidance, DOJ does not have reasonable  assurance that its steps taken to date\u2014such as the issuance of guidance,  ethics training, and video presentations\u2014are adequately understood and  have reached all those who are covered by this guidance. DOJ  components, such as EOUSA and BJA, are also not positioned to  determine (1) if the guidelines are correctly applied and actually and  systematically achieving the end result of preventing actual or apparent  ethical conflicts or (2) whether guidelines related to grant activities could  be clarified, strengthened, or improved. In addition, the absence of  confidential financial disclosure reporting for U.S. Attorneys Office  employees that work with grantees hinders the U.S. Attorneys ability to   (1) fully administer these programs in the context of ethics considerations  and (2) identify possible conflicts of interest to guarantee the efficient and  honest operation of the government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Attorney General instruct the Director of EOUSA  and U.S. Attorneys to take steps to further mitigate the risk associated  with U.S. Attorneys Offices\u2019 involvement in the grant components of the  PSN and Weed and Seed Programs.

Under the May  2002 PSN guidelines, each U.S. Attorneys Office was instructed to work  with interested federal, state, and local officials to form a PSN task force,  chaired or co-chaired by the U.S. Attorney, to develop a comprehensive  strategic plan. As part of this process, the task force was to formulate its  overall mission and goals after which the U.S. Attorney was instructed to  designate a selection committee to (1) review eligible grant proposals and  (2) select a single grantee for Research Partner/Crime Analyst and Media  Outreach and Community Engagement grants funded in fiscal year 2002.  The guidelines stated that the selection committee was not to include  members of the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 staff, but could include other members of  the task force as long as their participation did not represent an actual or  apparent conflict of interest. In addition, the guidelines instructed the U.S.  Attorney to    certify to the selection committee, based on the recommendations of  the task force, whether potential grantees are suitable candidates for  federal funding and   convey the committee\u2019s choice to the Bureau of Justice Assistance  (BJA), along with a letter from the U.S. Attorney, certifying that (1) the  potential grant recipient is free from allegations of criminal misconduct  and current investigation and (2) the applicant\u2019s proposal supports the  PSN task force activities, missions, and goals.", "In December 2002, the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys (EOUSA)  announced that BJA had issued similar guidelines for reviewing and  selecting applicants for grants funded in fiscal year 2003. As before, U.S.  Attorneys and their staff were instructed to work with the PSN task force  and, among other things, the U.S. Attorney was to designate a selection  committee\u2014not comprised of the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 staff or federal  employees\u2014to choose a grantee. Unlike the earlier guidelines, the  selection committee was to (1) choose a single grantee to act as fiscal  agent for the PSN strategy and (2) determine what portions of the PSN  strategy should be funded and to whom after the grant proposal had been  approved by BJA. BJA\u2019s guidelines for both fiscal years also included  hyperlinks to guidance EOUSA had issued for U.S. Attorneys and their  staff earlier in the year. EOUSA\u2019s guidelines were similar to the Attorney  General\u2019s guidelines, but they focused specifically on numerous ethics and  legal issues they need to consider in relation to their involvement with the  PSN Program. For example, similar to the Attorney General\u2019s guidelines  discussed earlier, U.S. Attorneys are expected to express their views if  there is any reason why a particular applicant is an inappropriate  candidate for PSN funds, but they are prohibited from appearing before  the Office of Justice Programs on behalf of an applicant seeking grant  monies associated with PSN."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Weed and Seed Grants", "paragraphs": ["In December 2002, EOUSA also issued guidance that outlined the roles  and responsibilities of U.S. Attorney\u2019s and their staff regarding the Weed  and Seed Program. Similar to the Attorney General\u2019s and EOUSA\u2019s PSN  ethics guidelines, EOUSA\u2019s Weed and Seed guidance covered topics  ranging from working with nonprofit organizations to prohibitions against  fundraising and listed what activities U.S. Attorneys and their staff can  perform in support of the Weed and Seed Program. In regard to grants, the  guidance stated that U.S. Attorneys and their staff may, among other  things    serve as that chair or co-chair of the Weed and Seed Steering    certify to the Executive Office for Weed and Seed (EOWS) via a \u201cletter  of intent\u201d that a potential Weed and Seed site can receive \u201cofficial  recognition;\u201d that is the site has developed a strategy sufficient to make  them eligible to apply for a Weed and Seed grant; review Official Recognition applications and prepare a cover letter for  submission to EOWS supporting the site and its strategy;  review funding applications to ensure technical accuracy and  consistency with the Weed and Seed strategy;   sign a statement of support for the Weed and Seed strategy; and    supervise the site, as chair or co-chair of the steering committee,  throughout the life of the initiative.", "The Weed and Seed guidelines also instructed U.S. Attorneys that, among  other things, they may not become advocates for individual grant  applicants; communicate with or appear before any federal agency on  behalf of a nonprofit organization; or draft grant proposals or applications.  Furthermore, U.S. Attorneys were told that they are authorized to assist  EOWS in monitoring the performance of the project under the grant to  ensure federal grant dollars are not misused, but they are not to act on  EOWS\u2019 behalf. The guidelines stated that U.S. Attorneys are to inform  EOWS of site implementation problems or irregularities to enable EOWS  to take appropriate action."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
