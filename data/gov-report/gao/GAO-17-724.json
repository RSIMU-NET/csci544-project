The March 2016 update identified additional cost savings in categories of efficiencies, and the level of detail in DOD's documentation related to these categories varied. For example, for one category, documentation showed cost savings estimates by organization, how estimates were calculated, and actions organizations planned to take to achieve the cost savings. In contrast, for two categories, documentation identified cost savings by fiscal year but did not include information on specific actions planned to achieve them.

In 2010, the Secretary of Defense expressed concerns about  the dramatic growth in DOD\u2019s headquarters and support organizations  that had occurred since 2001. The Secretary directed that DOD  undertake a department-wide initiative to assess how the department is  staffed, organized, and operated, with the goal of reducing overhead  costs and reinvesting these savings toward the sustainment of DOD\u2019s  current force structure and the modernization of its weapons portfolio.  Since then, the department has worked to identify and implement  headquarters-related efficiencies.", "Since 2013, Congress has also directed DOD to find efficiencies. In  section 904 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2014, Congress directed DOD to develop and report on a plan to  streamline headquarters by changing or reducing the size of staffs,  eliminating tiers of management, cutting functions that provide little or no  added value, and consolidating overlapping and duplicative programs and  offices (i.e., the Section 904 Report). Additionally, the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 directed DOD to modify the  streamlining plan described in the Section 904 Report to ensure the  department achieves savings not less than 25 percent of the baseline  amount in the total funding available for major headquarters activities  through fiscal year 2020. Congress also directed DOD to conduct a  comprehensive review of its headquarters for purposes of consolidating  and streamlining headquarters functions, among other things.", "Since 2012, we have reported on the prior growth in DOD\u2019s headquarters- related activities, the difficulties of accounting for the resources, functions,  and costs associated with headquarters activities, and the department\u2019s  efforts to pursue reductions in headquarters staff. As part of our  fragmentation, overlap, and duplication work, we have tracked steps that  the department has taken in response to recommendations to achieve  headquarters reductions and improve program efficiency. For example,  in March 2012, we recommended that DOD continue to seek further  opportunities to centralize administrative and command support services,  functions, and programs and that the department improve its ability to  identify headquarters personnel. The department concurred with our  recommendation, and DOD officials have stated that since 2012 the  department has established a comprehensive definition of major  headquarters activities and will update the DOD instruction defining major  headquarters. However, as of April 2017, DOD has not completed its  update of the instruction.", "In June 2014, we recommended, among other things, that DOD set  clearly defined and consistently applied baselines and track management  headquarters reductions against the baselines. The department  concurred with these two recommendations and said that it planned to  use Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) data to set the baseline  going forward. DOD officials also stated that the department had created  additional Program Elements to better identify and track major headquarters activities resources in the FYDP. In addition, as of  November 2016, DOD had taken some steps to set a clearly defined and  consistently applied starting point as a baseline for headquarters  reductions, but the department\u2019s efforts were not yet complete. A listing of  related GAO products appears at the end of this report.", "In the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, Congress  required DOD to implement a plan to ensure it achieves not less than $10  billion in cost savings from headquarters, administrative, and support  activities (hereafter referred to as efficiency-related cost savings) for fiscal  years 2015 through 2019. This plan is to include specific elements  related to the types of savings and dates for achievement. Further, in the  act Congress required DOD to submit a report describing and assessing  the department\u2019s progress in implementing and achieving cost savings for  each of fiscal years 2017, 2018, and 2019. DOD was to submit this report  upon submitting the department\u2019s fiscal year 2017 budget, which the  department submitted on February 9, 2016. At the time of our review,  DOD officials stated they had not submitted the required report; however,  in March 2016, DOD submitted to Congress a letter with an interim  update on its plan. The update identified $7.8 billion in cost savings for  fiscal years 2017 through 2021, but it provided no detail about how DOD  would achieve these cost savings.", "The act also included a provision that we examine and report on DOD\u2019s  required plan to achieve the $10 billion in cost savings. Although DOD  has not submitted the report, as we agreed with congressional committee  offices regarding this report, our objective was to examine the extent to  which the department has taken actions to achieve required cost savings,  including using reliable cost savings estimates. This report is a public  version of a sensitive report that we issued concurrently. DOD deemed  some of the information in our report to be sensitive, which must be  protected from public disclosure. Therefore, this report omits sensitive  budget information. Although the information provided in this report is  more limited, the report addresses the same objectives as the sensitive  report and uses the same methodology.", "To address our objective, we obtained available information related to  DOD\u2019s efforts to develop and report on the required cost savings plan and  compared this information with the elements required by the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 and our guidance for  evaluating cost estimates. We used this guidance to assess the reliability  of DOD\u2019s estimates for headquarters-related cost savings because  savings, if any, are derived from the difference in costs over time. The  guidance states, among other things, that cost estimates used to make  decisions or allocate resources should be reliable\u2014well documented,  comprehensive, accurate, and credible\u2014and that they should be  acceptable to someone unfamiliar with the program. We also assessed  information reported to Congress in DOD\u2019s March 2016 interim update on  its cost savings plan and documentation related to DOD\u2019s headquarters- related efficiency efforts DOD identified in a February 2016 budget  document. Additionally, we obtained documents from, and conducted  interviews with, officials from the office of the Deputy Chief Management  Officer (DCMO), the office of the DOD Chief Information Officer, the  Defense Human Resource Activity, the Defense Threat Reduction  Agency, the DOD Test Resource Management Center, Washington  Headquarters Service \u2013 Financial Management Directorate, and the  Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation to determine the  scope and status of the estimated cost savings.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2016 to July 2017 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The  DCMO directed delayering for the Office of the Secretary of Defense and  Defense Agencies and Field Activities and identified cost savings for  fiscal years 2017 through 2021. As part of delayering, organizations  used DCMO\u2019s guidance, which recommended that there be no more than  five organizational layers within the Office of the Secretary of Defense,  among other things. DCMO\u2019s guidance also recommended that  organizations pursue cross-organizational partnerships and shared work  activities when possible.

DOD-provided  documentation did not identify how DOD plans to achieve the cost  savings not related to delayering and was not sufficiently detailed to allow  us to clearly track these savings.
