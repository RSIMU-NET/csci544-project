In order to set prices that will enable the business area to operate on a break-even basis, it is extremely important that the business area accurately estimate the work it will perform and the cost of performing that work.

Further, our analysis of UNISYS workload reports also showed that actual processing at 5 of the 8 DMCs providing UNISYSmainframe services was 57 percent to 70 percent of projected amounts. At one of the DMCs, however, the actual reported workload was almost 66 percent more than projected. Tables 2.2 and 2.3 show the projected and actual amounts of processing for IBM and UNISYS systems in fiscal year 1997.", "In discussing the workload fluctuations with DISA-WESTHEM personnel, we were informed that although they are responsible for estimating future requirements for DMC services, the accuracy of these estimates depends heavily on information provided by DISA customers. According to DISA-WESTHEM personnel, systems have been installed which enable DISA to determine the amount of services actually provided to DMC customers. However, DISA-WESTHEM cannot easily identify all of the factors that could cause a change in future customer needs. For example, the current DOD initiatives to standardize systems have led to widespread migration of workloads from numerous older systems to new systems. Central Design Activities are responsible for maintaining existing systems and for working with customers on the development of replacement systems. Decisions concerning the types of data to be maintained by the new systems and specific program operations affect the types and amounts of DMC services required, such as data storage and the number of input/output operations that will occur during program execution. In addition, the actual pace of progress made in developing, testing, installing, and implementing the new systems affects the volume of processing that will continue to be done on the legacy systems. For example, the Chief of the Resource Management Branch in the Denver DMC Business Management Division stated that the CPU hours for the Defense Civilian Pay System were 46 percent higher than projected in fiscal year 1997 because of an increase in accounts migrated from legacy systems requiring mainframe processing services.", "DISA-WESTHEM officials also confirmed that this issue is continuing to hinder their ability to develop accurate workload estimates. For example, DISA-WESTHEM was recently notified that the planned migration of the Base Level Personnel System workload from DISA to Randolph Air Force Base on September 30, 1998, has been delayed until fiscal year 2000. As a result, DISA will be providing about $7 million in services during fiscal year 1999 that were not included in its customer projections or factored into DISA\u2019s prices for the fiscal year. DISA-WESTHEM officials further noted that the workload for the Defense Transportation Reporting System is now four times the fiscal year 1997 projected level. DISA only received 30 days notice of the increased workload. Because of the long lead time to develop prices, which is tied to preparing the budget, this additional workload will not be reflected in the fiscal year 1999 prices.

Our report fully recognizes the efforts DISA put forth in planning the consolidation and the importance the February 1996 cost analysis played in the decision-making process. However, our analysis disclosed that there were considerable differences in the reported cost of doing business between the DMCs. Our conclusion that opportunities for savings exist is based in part on the magnitude of the DMC operating cost differences which now exist\u2014the reported variance per CPU hour is $40.35 to $274.55. Further, in an August 1998 meeting, the Acting Deputy Comptroller and the Resource Manager, Operations Directorate, stated that DISA has not formally analyzed the reasons for the cost differences between the DMCs. Furthermore, a DISA official acknowledged that DISA had not studied the differences in costs between DMCs providing the same or similar service. This evidence clearly indicates to us that despite earlier analyses, a more rigorous study of costs is warranted to determine and correct the underlying causes of these differences.", "DOD also disagreed with our characterization of the need for improvements in the estimation of the workload performed by the DMCs. DOD noted that given the changes brought on by the consolidation effort, it is difficult to develop accurate workload estimates. DOD also noted that as discussed in the report, the process of developing workload starts 2 years before the prices go into effect. DOD further stated that regardless of the quality of the estimated workload, the customers will inevitably change workload requirements to meet their current situation.", "The report recognizes the efforts that DISA has undertaken to improve the accuracy and reliability of its workload estimates, the obstacles it faces in doing so, and the difficulty involved in precisely estimating the workload to be performed. Indeed, there will always be some variance between the estimated workload and the actual work performed by the DMCs. However, the extent of the reported workload variance for IBM CPU hours (from about 74 percent more than the projected workload at Columbus DMC to about 19 percent less than the projected workload at the Warner Robins DMC) is much greater than would normally be expected. The DMCs posted a $90 million net profit for mainframe services in fiscal year 1997 primarily because workload volumes were substantially higher than anticipated.", "Since the volume of workload is one factor in determining the CPU hourly price, the accuracy and reliability of the workload estimate is critical in establishing an hourly CPU price. Conceptually, the larger the volume of work to be performed the lower the price because the cost of operations can be spread across more CPU hours. Therefore, for fiscal year 1997, a more accurate workload estimate for the DMCs would have resulted in a lower CPU hourly price for IBM mainframe services and a higher hourly price for UNISYS mainframe service. A lower hourly IBM mainframe price may have afforded some customers, such as DFAS, the opportunity to pay for more of the services DISA provided.", "Further, as discussed in the report, DISA personnel developing mainframe projections stated that they rely heavily on data gathered on past workload levels and that these data do not necessarily reflect future requirements.

Recovering the full cost of operations is one of the basic underpinnings of the working capital fund (WCF). Not including the full cost of operations in developing prices understates the prices charged customers for the services provided.

However, based upon our review of DISA\u2019s fiscal year 1998 budgetary request, the rationale for financing WCF-related costs through the use of appropriations was not clear. Normally, costs are recovered through customer billings and, in most instances, the WCF generally does not receive appropriations for financing day-to-day operations. Since the Defense Information Services business area prices do not take into consideration the use of appropriated funds, this further understates the prices charged for services offered by DISA.

For example, in developing the prices for fiscal year 1998, transition costs were reduced by the amount of the collections that DISA anticipated receiving from a contractor because of savings and volume discounts.

Examples of each condition are as follows.", "Ogden DMC reported revenues with no costs, including approximately $1.5 million in revenue for Direct Customer Support, $169,000 for Network Control, and $58,000 for services provided to a specific customer.", "Montgomery DMC reported no costs for four of the five categories of service with revenues totaling $823,000.", "Chambersburg DMC reported costs with no revenues for four of the eight services, including about $627,000 for Defense Information Integrated Engineering, $96,000 for Information Systems Support, $91,000 for Output Distribution, and $69 for Network and Program Management.", "DISA-WESTHEM officials acknowledged that the accounting for DMC revenues and costs has been unreliable. They further stated that DISA has focused much of its attention on the management of the mainframe processing workload and has little overall visibility over the other types of services the DMCs were providing to their customers. These services included computer repair and local area network operations that are not associated with mainframe operations. As part of DISA\u2019s DMC consolidations, these services will be offered by the Regional Information Services locations.", "DISA has initiated efforts to improve its oversight over C-Goal services. For example, the Resource Management Branch has developed new unit identification codes to reduce the risk of misclassifying revenue and cost and new budgeting and accounting procedures manuals, including guidance for pricing nonmainframe services. DISA-WESTHEM also appointed a project manager who has begun efforts to standardize categories of services being offered. Standardizing services is an important first step in gaining visibility and oversight of the various services being offered. The outcome of these efforts should improve DISA\u2019s ability to develop accurate projections of operating costs and prices and to evaluate operating results.", "Additionally, the accurate recording of revenues and costs is important to the successful operations of the Regional Information Services locations which are a part of DISA\u2019s overall plan to further consolidate its megacenter operations. According to DISA\u2019s consolidation plan, each regional location must be self-sustaining as required by the WCF. Further, an official within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) stated that locations operating at a loss will be closed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Efforts to Improve Accuracy of Financial Data", "paragraphs": ["The types of problems identified by the DOD IG and discussed in DOD\u2019s fiscal year 1997 Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) report, and the DFAS Status Report are not unique to DISA. Since the concept of DBOF was put forth in February 1991, we have repeatedly identified weaknesses with the accuracy and reliability of the financial reports prepared on the results of operations. DOD itself has also recognized the inadequacies in financial reports\u2014in the Acting Comptroller\u2019s February 2, 1993, letter to the congressional Defense committees; the September 24, 1993, Defense Business Operations Fund improvement plan; and DOD\u2019s February 2, 1994, response to our October 1993 letter on concerns we had with the Defense Business Operations Fund improvement plan. Further, DOD\u2019s fiscal year 1997 FMFIA report noted deficiencies with WCF accounting and reporting. More specifically, DOD\u2019s CFO Status Report notes that IFAS cannot provide financial data that are complete, reliable, consistent, timely, and responsive to the needs of agency management. To resolve these problems, DOD stated that it has undertaken an alternative analysis to determine the most cost effective means of implementing a compliant system. However, DOD has not specified a date for completion of the analysis.", "Because of congressional concern over DOD\u2019s inability to resolve these long-standing problems, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 directed DOD to prepare a plan to improve the management and operations of the WCFs. Among other things, the act specifically required DOD to address the issue involving financial reporting. As discussed in our recent report, DOD\u2019s September 30, 1997, response clearly articulated the problems hindering accurate financial reporting and discussed the decisions made to resolve the problems. However, the plan does not (1) identify the specific tasks that need to be performed, (2) establish accountability for ensuring that the tasks are completed when more than one DOD organizational entity is involved, and (3) establish milestones for ensuring that the tasks are completed promptly. Our report recommended that DOD develop a detailed implementation plan that (1) identifies the specific actions that need to be taken, (2) establishes milestones, and (3) clearly delineates responsibilities for performing the specific tasks. In his May 14, 1998, response to our report, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) concurred with the overall findings and recommendations. The Comptroller noted that the Office of the Secretary of Defense Revolving Fund Directorate has established three working groups that will develop specific implementation and execution plans and procedures for financial reporting."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Accurate and credible financial data are essential for DISA managers to ascertain if realistic prices are being established. Reliable financial information is also necessary to enable the Congress to exercise its oversight responsibilities. Although DOD has acknowledged accounting and reporting problems and developed various improvement plans, the financial reporting problems confronting the WCF today are essentially the same as they were since their inception. Until the accuracy and reliability of the financial reports improve, DISA will continue to be in the untenable position of attempting to manage and fulfill its fiduciary responsibility based on questionable data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD expressed concern that our findings related to DISA and that the report does not recognize the systemic nature of the deficiencies in DOD.

Further, the report also recognizes that the responsibility for resolving these problems rests with DOD, not DISA.", "In addition, some of the financial reporting weaknesses discussed above are the result of DISA personnel not following procedures in the recording of revenue and cost at the DMCs. As noted in our report, the DMCs have experienced difficulty in accurately recording revenues and costs.
