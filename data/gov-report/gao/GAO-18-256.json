GAO found several weaknesses with the analyses of six financial regulators (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) that could undermine the goal of RFA and limit transparency and public accountability, as shown in the following examples.", "Certifications. In certifications for rules that regulators determined may affect small entities, regulators conducted analyses to support their conclusions. GAO found many analyses across all regulators lacked key information the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) recommend.

For most rules GAO reviewed, regulators (five of six) were unable to provide documentation supporting their regulatory flexibility analyses, as OMB recommends, including analyses supporting certification decisions.

All but one of the financial regulators have guidelines that restate RFA requirements for certification and for preparing regulatory flexibility analyses and provide some information on how to approach these analyses. However, these regulators generally have not developed specific policies and procedures to assist staff in complying with RFA, which may contribute to the weaknesses GAO identified in the analyses. For example, regulators' guidance generally did not include procedures for evaluating a rule's potential economic impact; identifying and assessing regulatory alternatives that could minimize impact on small entities; disclosing methodology and data sources; and creating and maintaining documentation that supports findings. By not developing and implementing comprehensive policies and procedures for RFA analyses, regulators' ability to consistently and effectively meet RFA objectives may be limited."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making a total of 10 recommendations among the six financial regulators reviewed, including that regulators develop and implement specific policies and procedures for consistently complying with RFA requirements and related guidance for conducting RFA analyses.

The Federal Reserve usually performed an initial and final regulatory  flexibility analysis, while the other agencies, except SEC, rarely did.

None of the  regulators defined what would constitute a substantial number of small  entities for the rule in the Federal Register notices. OCC was the one  agency to define its criteria for a significant economic impact in its  rulemaking, although it did not include this definition in all of its  certifications. The other agencies did not define significant economic  impact for the rule in the Federal Register notices. While CFPB did not  disclose its criteria in the Federal Register notices, it defined these criteria  in its internal workpapers for two certifications.

Two FDIC rules related to revisions of  the treatment of financial assets transferred in connection with a  securitization provided no additional information beyond the declarative  statement that the agency certified that the rule would not have a  significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  Additionally, an OCC certification in a joint rule that formalized the  calculation method for mortgage loans exempted from certain  requirements provided little information, although an internal agency  workpaper detailed the number of small entities affected and the  estimated economic impact that supported the certification.

The majority (11 of 17) of the Federal  Reserve\u2019s analyses stated that the rules either did not apply to small  entities or lacked compliance requirements. Nevertheless, the Federal  Reserve conducted regulatory flexibility analyses in which nearly all of the  initial (14 of 17) and final analyses (15 of 17) concluded that the rule  would not have a significant economic impact on small entities, which  generally is a basis for certification. Examples included rules on capital  and liquidity requirements applicable only to large banking organizations  and rules that amended official regulatory interpretations or repealed  regulations.

For example, there may  be no compliance costs to estimate, alternatives to consider, necessary  professional skills to describe, or actions that could minimize impact on  small entities. With their focus largely on explaining why the rule would  not affect small entities rather than examining effects of compliance  requirements and potential alternatives to limit such effects, such cases  resemble certifications more than regulatory flexibility analyses.

Nearly all (five of six) did not quantify compliance costs in either the  initial or final analyses or explain why such assessments were not  possible. For two rules, the Federal Reserve\u2019s assessments of economic  effects and compliance costs generally consisted of descriptive  statements on the rule\u2019s provisions and coverage. For example, the final  analysis for a rule on margin and capital requirements for participants in  financial swap transactions stated that, among other things, all financial  end users would be subject to the variation margin requirements and  documentation requirements of the rule but that the Federal Reserve  believes such treatment is consistent with current market practice and  should not represent a significant burden on small financial end users.", "Although containing minimal information, analyses in three of the six rules  indicated that the rules would have a largely beneficial impact for small  entities by reducing burden or offering positive economic effects. These  analyses generally lacked clear descriptions of any compliance  requirements that would apply to small entities. For example, the initial  and final analyses for a rule involving the Federal Reserve\u2019s emergency  lending authority stated that participants at a minimum likely would be  required to pay interest on loans extended to them and to keep records,  but that the positive economic impact of receiving a loan likely would  outweigh any economic burden. The initial analysis for another rule  stated that the projected reporting, recordkeeping, and other compliance  requirements were expected to be minimal but did not describe the  requirements or any associated costs.", "Alternatives. Few of the Federal Reserve\u2019s initial regulatory flexibility  analyses identified alternatives to the proposed rule and some did not  explain why there were no alternatives. Although most of the rules\u2019  analyses (10 of 17) described alternatives, all but 2 stated that there were  no alternatives that would have less economic impact on small entities. Of  the 6 rules that might impose compliance requirements on small entities,  2 included such a statement, 1 had no mention of alternatives, and  another solicited comments on any significant alternatives that would  reduce burden associated with the proposed rule. Analyses for the other  two rules described alternative approaches included in the proposed rule  to limit economic impact on small entities.

For these three rules, FDIC\u2019s analyses described and quantified  each of the rule\u2019s compliance costs and concluded that each rule would  not have a significant economic impact on small entities, but other  components were missing. For example, these rules\u2019 analyses focused  on illustrating how the rule would not have an economic impact on small entities and did not include other required components including a  description and assessment of regulatory alternatives. The initial and final  analyses for each of the rules were nearly identical and did not include  statements about alternatives, any issues raised in public comments, or  steps to minimize impact on small entities, among other missing  components.

Of the analyses that included cost  estimates, several did not quantify all identified costs or explain why such  estimates were not available. Unlike other regulators we reviewed, CFPB  is required to seek input from small entities during the rulemaking process  (through Small Business Review Panels) when proposed rules are  expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number  of small entities. CFPB\u2019s regulatory flexibility analyses often  incorporated information received from these panels in its assessment of  potential economic effects and regulatory alternatives. For example,  several analyses that estimated compliance costs relied on information  from small entities that participated in the panel process as well as data  from other sources.

For example, in  December 2015, SEC published a proposed rule requiring resource  extraction issuers to disclose certain payments. The proposed rule\u2019s  initial regulatory flexibility analysis described requirements for the  disclosures.

As part of describing any significant  alternatives to the proposed rule which accomplish statutory objectives  while minimizing any significant economic impact on small entities, RFA  requires that initial regulatory flexibility analyses discuss alternatives such  as  the establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements or  timetables that take into account the resources available to small  entities;  the clarification, consolidation, or simplification of compliance and  reporting requirements under the rule for such small entities;  the use of performance rather than design standards; and an exemption from coverage of the rule, or any part thereof, for such  small entities.", "For five of the nine rules, the initial analysis discussed the general types  of alternatives listed in RFA but did not describe specific options for  implementing them in the proposed rule. For example, the initial  regulatory flexibility analyses did not identify how compliance or reporting  requirements might be altered for small entities or in what ways  requirements could be simplified. One of the rules involved changes to  SEC\u2019s requirements for the reporting and disclosure of information by  registered investment companies. The initial analysis stated that the  agency had considered (1) establishing different reporting requirements  or frequency to account for resources available to small entities, (2) using  performance rather than design standards, and (3) exempting small  entities from all or part of the proposal.

The reasons cited typically included that the different regulatory  approaches would not be consistent with the agency\u2019s goals or statutory  objectives. For example, the analysis for SEC\u2019s rule on reporting and  disclosure by registered investment companies concluded that the  agency believed that establishing different reporting requirements or  frequency for small entities would not be consistent with SEC\u2019s goal of  industry oversight and investor protection. However, for this and the other  proposed rules, the analyses generally did not examine the extent to  which the considered alternatives could limit the rule\u2019s economic impact  on small entities. In another case, a rule\u2019s final analysis stated that one public commenter raised concerns that the initial analysis did not identify  significant alternatives, including that it only considered alternatives  related to exempting small business from the proposed rules. Several of  the commenters suggested additional alternatives for reducing burden.

However, the handbook was last revised in 1999, so it  does not incorporate recommendations from the Office of Advocacy\u2019s  compliance guide, and two SEC divisions have developed their own  manuals, which generally restate RFA requirements.", "As previously described, we found inconsistencies and weaknesses in  financial regulators\u2019 certifications and regulatory flexibility analyses that  we reviewed, including for the key elements discussed in this section. The  shortcomings are attributable in part to the regulators\u2019 lack of  comprehensive policies and procedures for RFA requirements. Our prior  work on RFA implementation by federal agencies found that uncertainties  about RFA\u2019s requirements and varying interpretations of those  requirements by federal agencies limited the act\u2019s application and  effectiveness. However, the Office of Advocacy subsequently published  guidance on complying with RFA requirements that includes information  to help agencies interpret and implement RFA requirements. Such  guidance could help regulators develop comprehensive and specific  policies and procedures. Without such policies and procedures,  regulators\u2019 ability to consistently and effectively meet RFA objectives may  be limited."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Financial Regulators Varied in Their Approach to RFA- Required Retrospective Reviews", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Banking Regulators Relied on Other Retrospective Reviews to Meet RFA Section 610 Requirements", "paragraphs": ["As previously discussed, section 610 of RFA requires agencies to review,  within 10 years of adoption, those rules assessed as having a significant  economic impact on a substantial number of small entities to determine if  they should be continued without change, amended, or rescinded to  minimize any significant economic impact on small entities. During the  last 10 years, the three federal banking regulators (Federal Reserve,  FDIC, and OCC) used other retrospective reviews that they said fulfilled  RFA requirements. Specifically, the banking regulators said that the  retrospective reviews required under the Economic Growth and  Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 (EGRPRA) also satisfied  RFA section 610 requirements. EGRPRA requires the federal banking  regulators to identify outdated or otherwise unnecessary regulatory  requirements imposed on insured depository institutions every 10 years.", "We compared EGRPRA requirements for retrospective reviews to those  of section 610 and found they do not fully align (see table 8). For  example, the EGRPRA review process relies on public comments to  identify rules that may be outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome.  The comments are solicited through public notices in the Federal Register  and through public outreach meetings held across the country. In  contrast, public comments are only one component of section 610  reviews. Following a public notice and comment period, section 610  requires agencies to evaluate rules found to have a significant economic  impact on a substantial number of small entities to identify opportunities  to reduce unnecessary burden. The section 610 reviews are to consider  five specific factors, such as the degree to which technology and  economic conditions have changed in the area affected by the rule.  Section 610 reviews focus specifically on reducing unnecessary  regulatory burden on small entities; EGRPRA reviews focus more broadly  on reducing regulatory burden on all insured depository institutions.", "We reviewed the 2007 and 2017 EGRPRA reports, along with their  preceding Federal Register notices, and found that the regulators  solicited comment from the public on the burden of regulations on  community banks and other smaller, insured depository institutions.  However, we found that the final reports primarily focus on the issues  identified through public comments and generally did not include  independent agency consideration of the impact of regulations on small  entities, as required by section 610.", "The public notice requirements for RFA section 610 and EGRPRA also  differed. RFA requires agencies to publish in the Federal Register a list of  the rules that have a significant economic impact on a substantial number  of small entities and that are to be reviewed pursuant to section 610  during the upcoming year. This list must include a brief description of  each rule and the need for and legal basis of each rule. The notices alert  the public to specific rules that may affect small entities and request  public comment on these rules. EGRPRA public notice requirements do  not require agencies to specifically identify rules that have an impact on  small entities. Rather, agencies must at regular intervals provide notice  and solicit public comment on a particular category or categories of rules  (such as consumer protection, safety and soundness) governing all  insured depository institutions. The notices request commenters to  identify areas of the regulations that are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly  burdensome. Our searches of the Federal Register turned up no notices  of section 610 reviews posted by the regulators in the last 10 years.", "In its RFA guide, the Small Business Administration\u2019s Office of Advocacy  stated that agencies may satisfy section 610 requirements through other  retrospective reviews if these other reviews meet the criteria of section  610. To obtain credit for a section 610 review through another review  process, the Office of Advocacy recommends that agencies adequately  communicate with stakeholders and the Office of Advocacy. According to  an official from the Office of Advocacy, the office has not yet made a  determination on whether the EGRPRA review process satisfies the  requirements of section 610. Although the agencies stated that they fulfill  RFA requirements through EGRPRA, without confirming this with the  Office of Advocacy, it is possible that they are not meeting the RFA  section 610 requirements and therefore may not be achieving the small- entity burden reduction that the statute seeks to ensure. We found that  the regulators lack policies and procedures for how to conduct section  610 reviews or provide rationale for meeting the section 610 review  requirements through other retrospective review processes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SEC Conducted RFA Section 610 Reviews, but the Reviews Were Late and Not Fully Consistent with RFA Requirements or Office of Advocacy Guidance", "paragraphs": ["Our review of SEC\u2019s section 610 reviews found that they were conducted  late and were not fully consistent with RFA requirements or the Office of  Advocacy\u2019s guidance for such reviews. Although SEC staff have a  process for tracking which rules are due for section 610 reviews, SEC  conducted all but one of its reviews 12 years after the rules were  published. According to RFA requirements, rules must be reviewed within  10 years of their publication as final rules. SEC staff told us that SEC  conducted a broader review than required by RFA and recommended by  the Office of Advocacy. Moreover, staff said that SEC conducted section  610 reviews for all rules previously published for notice and comment to  assess the continued utility of the rules. Agency officials stated that  when they prepare the agency\u2019s annual Federal Register notice of rules  to be reviewed during the succeeding 12 months, they consult a  chronological list of final rules adopted by the agency to determine which  rules are due for a section 610 review. However, when we reviewed  documentation of 46 section 610 reviews SEC staff conducted in 2015  and 2016, we found that each of the reviews was conducted for a rule  adopted in 2003 or 2004, with 45 rule reviews being conducted 12 years  after their publication as final rules. By not conducting section 610  reviews within the time frame established by RFA, SEC may delay taking  timely action to minimize significant economic impact of rules on small  entities.", "In general, SEC did not follow Office of Advocacy\u2019s guidance for  conducting section 610 reviews. The Office of Advocacy recommends  that to evaluate and minimize any significant economic impact of a rule on  a substantial number of small entities, agencies may want to use an  economic analysis similar to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis.  Additionally, OMB guidance on regulatory analysis states that agencies  should provide documentation that analysis is based on the best  reasonably obtainable scientific, technical, and economic information  available. As previously discussed, independent regulatory agencies are  not required to follow the OMB guidance, but it provides a strong set of  analytical practices relevant to agency rulemakings.", "To facilitate its section 610 reviews, SEC staff used a template that  prompts staff to consider each of the five RFA-required section 610  considerations and to document the conclusion of the review (if the rule  should be continued without change, amended, or rescinded). We  reviewed the templates for all 46 reviews conducted between 2015 and  2016 and found that SEC staff consistently followed this template to  document their conclusions. However, the reviews generally lacked  substantive analysis and no rules were amended as a direct result of their  section 610 review. Overall, of the 46 reviews, 7 identified comments or  complaints from the public, 4 identified changes in technology, economic  conditions, or other factors in the area affected by the rule, and 4  identified instances of overlap, conflict or duplication. The reviews  generally provided no evidence of empirical analysis and no data to  support the conclusions of the reviews, as recommended by the Office of  Advocacy and OMB. Furthermore, in most cases, the reviews lacked a  description of whether, or to what extent, the rule was affecting small  entities. For example, when addressing the first RFA-required  consideration, describing and evaluating the continuing need for a rule,  most SEC section 610 reviews included language from the final rule as a  description and included SEC\u2019s conclusion that the rule continues to be  necessary.", "The Office of Advocacy also suggests that useful section 610 reviews  should evaluate potential improvements to the rule by going beyond  obvious measures and evaluating factors such as the unintended market  effects and distortions and widespread noncompliance with reporting and  other paperwork requirements. We found no evidence that these factors  were considered. The Office of Advocacy further recommends that  agencies pay particular attention to changes in the cumulative burden  faced by regulated entities. We did not find evidence that SEC considered  the cumulative burden faced by regulated agencies in the reviews we  examined. By not including these best practice elements as part of its  section 610 reviews, SEC may not fully achieve RFA\u2019s purpose of  minimizing significant economic impact of rules on small entities.", "SEC does not have written policies or procedures for completing rule  reviews pursuant to RFA section 610, potentially contributing to the  weaknesses we identified on the timing of the reviews, and the lack of  data and analysis to support the review findings. As previously  mentioned, federal internal control standards state the importance for  agency management to establish policies and procedures needed to  achieve objectives. In addition, Executive Order 13272 requires  agencies to establish policies and procedures to promote compliance with  RFA. While this executive order is not binding on independent  regulatory agencies, including SEC, it represents a best practice for  rulemaking.", "SEC also does not publicly disclose the findings or conclusions of its  section 610 reviews. Although RFA does not require that agencies  publish the results of their 610 reviews, the Office of Advocacy  recommends that to enhance transparency, agencies should  communicate with interested entities about the status of ongoing as well  as completed section 610 reviews. Several executive orders also highlight  the importance of public disclosure of retrospective reviews. For example,  Executive Order 13563 recommends that retrospective analyses,  including supporting data, should be released online whenever  possible. Executive Order 13610 reiterated this recommendation,  stating that public disclosure promotes an open exchange of  information. While these executive orders are not binding on  independent regulatory agencies, we consider them a best practice for  rulemaking. OMB guidance on regulatory analysis states that to provide  greater access to regulatory analysis, agencies should post their analysis,  along with supporting documents, on the Internet so the public can review  the findings. Staff from SEC confirmed that they do not publish the results  or summaries of their section 610 reviews, stating that they are not  required to do so by law.

For these rules, we  collected and reviewed internal workpapers from the financial regulators  on their decisions to certify that regulatory flexibility analyses were not  required because the rule would not have a significant economic impact  on a substantial number of small entities (certifications).", "We then assessed the regulators\u2019 certifications in Federal Register  publications to determine the extent to which they reflected RFA  requirements, guidance from the Small Business Administration\u2019s Office  of Advocacy on complying with RFA, and other best practices for  rulemaking, specifically Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  guidance on regulatory analysis and Executive Order 13563. Our  analysis did not include an evaluation of other aspects of agency  rulemaking, including regulatory analyses for purposes other than RFA,  such as analyses for the Paperwork Reduction Act and other economic  analyses in the preamble. We based our evaluation on the RFA sections  of each Federal Register notice for proposed and final rules and did not  review other rule sections unless the RFA section explicitly referenced  them. We also reviewed the workpapers and notices of joint rules for  coordination on the certification analysis or decisions between regulators.", "To examine the financial regulators\u2019 initial and final regulatory flexibility  analyses and the analyses\u2019 effects on their rulemakings, we used the  results from the trend review to select all final rules published in the  Federal Register from January 2015 through December 2016 for which  the agency performed an initial regulatory flexibility analysis in the  proposed rule and a final regulatory flexibility analysis in the final rule. For  any regulator that had fewer than three rules meeting these criteria, we  selected all rules published in the prior year for which the agency  performed an initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis until we  reached three rules or a publication date of January 2013. For rules  issued jointly by multiple financial regulators in our scope, we included the  rule for each regulator that prepared an initial and final regulatory  flexibility analysis. We included such rules even if they would not  otherwise have been selected using the outlined criteria. This resulted in  the inclusion of one additional rule for the Federal Reserve (a 2013 rule  issued jointly with OCC). We selected a total of 39 final rules for which the  agency performed an initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis. More  specifically, we selected 7 CFPB rules, 1 CFTC rule, 4 FDIC rules, 17  Federal Reserve rules, 1 OCC rule, and 9 SEC rules. For these rules, we  obtained and reviewed internal workpapers from the financial regulators  related to the initial and final regulatory analyses.", "We assessed the regulators\u2019 regulatory flexibility analyses contained in  the RFA summary in the notices of proposed and final rules published in  the Federal Register to determine the extent to which they reflected RFA  requirements, the Office of Advocacy\u2019s guidance on complying with RFA,  and OMB guidance on regulatory analysis. Our analysis did not include  an evaluation of other aspects of agency rulemaking, including regulatory  analyses for purposes other than RFA. We based our evaluation on the  RFA sections of each rule and did not review other rule sections unless  the RFA section explicitly referenced them. We also analyzed the  workpapers, notices, and interviews to identify the extent to which  regulators revised draft and proposed rules as a result of regulatory  flexibility analyses, the source of the changes, and the types and  characteristics of changes that regulators made to draft and proposed  rules as a result of regulatory flexibility analyses. We also reviewed the  workpapers and notices of joint rules for coordination on the analyses.", "To examine financial regulators\u2019 policies, procedures, and criteria for  complying with RFA requirements, we obtained and reviewed internal  agency policies, procedures, and guidance for conducting initial and final  regulatory flexibility analyses or certifying that such analyses were not  required. We then assessed the documents received to determine the  extent to which they reflected RFA requirements and Office of Advocacy\u2019s  guidance on complying with RFA. We also assessed the extent to which  the documents included comprehensive policies and procedures to assist  staff in complying with RFA in accordance with best practices outlined in  Executive Order 13272 and federal internal control standards.", "To examine the extent to which financial regulators performed  retrospective reviews required by RFA, we searched the Federal Register  for notices of upcoming section 610 reviews as well as results of section  610 reviews. We also obtained and reviewed documentation from the  financial regulators of section 610 reviews performed from calendar year  2006 through 2016. We assessed the section 610 reviews we received  against RFA requirements and other best practices for rulemaking,  specifically OMB guidance on regulatory analysis and Executive Orders  13563 and 13610. For agencies that conducted other retrospective  reviews in lieu of section 610 reviews, we compared the other  retrospective review processes to RFA requirements for section 610  reviews to determine the extent to which they aligned. We also  interviewed staff from each of the financial regulators to understand the  process and analysis supporting their certification decisions, regulatory  flexibility analyses, and retrospective reviews.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2017 to January 2018  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Extent of Coordination in Financial Regulators\u2019 Certifications and Regulatory Flexibility Analyses", "paragraphs": ["In the seven joint rules we reviewed with a certification, financial  regulators conducted their own certification analyses independently of the  other agencies responsible for the rule. The Regulatory Flexibility Act  (RFA) allows agencies to coordinate on their RFA analyses but does not  require it. The Small Business Administration\u2019s Office of Advocacy does  not make any recommendation on coordination in its RFA guide. Because  agencies regulate different small entities that could be affected differently  by a rule, coordination would not necessarily result in efficiencies or other  benefits.", "In joint rules, the regulators (except for the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), which generally treated  regulatory flexibility analyses differently) reached the same conclusion to  certify, although their analyses sometimes differed. For example, in one  joint rule, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) concluded that the rule  mainly imposes requirements on states and therefore affected no small  entities. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau agreed that the rule  pertained mainly to states, but performed an analysis to assess the  indirect impact on small entities, concluding that even indirectly the rule  would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of  small entities. The Federal Reserve found that some entities would be  federally regulated but that the number was uncertain but not substantial  (less than five). In another joint rule, FDIC concluded that the rule would  not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small  entities because banks with less than $1 billion in assets were  exempted. The Small Business Administration defines a small bank as one with assets of $550 million or less; therefore, no small entities would  be affected. However, OCC assumed that every bank subject to the rule  would be required to comply regardless of the exemption and performed  its analysis with that assumption. Under this premise, OCC found that a  substantial number of small entities would be affected by the rule but that  the economic impact would not be significant.", "Of the seven joint rules that we reviewed with initial and final regulatory  flexibility analyses, the analyses for two rules indicated that regulators  collaborated in preparing the analysis. For one rule, the Federal  Reserve, FDIC, and OCC published a joint initial analysis but FDIC and  OCC made a certification determination in the final rule. For the other  rule, the Federal Reserve and OCC prepared separate initial analyses but  published a joint final analysis that included separate sections evaluating  the potential economic impact of the final rule. The remaining five joint  rules included separate regulatory flexibility analyses for each regulator  and all but the Federal Reserve reached a certification determination.  None of the rules we reviewed with initial and final flexibility analyses that  were issued by individual regulators indicated that the regulator had  coordinated with other agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Commodity Futures Trading Commission Entities That Are Not Small Entities for Regulatory Flexibility Act Purposes", "paragraphs": ["The following table details the entities regulated by the Commodity  Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that the agency determined were  not small entities for the purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA).
