DHS has sole or critical responsibility for four GAO high-risk areas\u2014(1) strengthening its management functions, (2) NFIP, (3) information security and cyber critical infrastructure protection, and (4) terrorism-related information sharing. This statement addresses DHS's progress and work remaining in addressing high-risk areas for which (1) it has sole responsibility and (2) it has critical, but shared responsibility.", "This statement is based on GAO's February 2013 high-risk update, reports and testimonies issued from March 2013 through April 2014, and analyses from GAO's ongoing assessment of DHS's efforts since February 2013 to address its high-risk designations. For these analyses, GAO examined DHS documents and interviewed DHS officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made progress in addressing high-risk areas for which it has sole responsibility, but significant work remains.", "Strengthening management functions. In this area, DHS has met two and partially met three of GAO's five criteria for removing areas from the high-risk list. Specifically, DHS has met the criteria for having (1) demonstrated leadership commitment, and (2) a corrective action plan for addressing its management risks. However, it has partially met GAO's criteria for (1) capacity (having sufficient resources); (2) having a framework to monitor progress; and (3) demonstrated, sustained progress. DHS has made important progress, but to more fully address GAO's high-risk designation, DHS needs to show measurable, sustainable progress in implementing key management initiatives. For example:", "Human capital management. DHS has developed and demonstrated progress in implementing a strategic human capital plan. However, DHS needs to improve other aspects of its human capital management. As GAO reported in December 2013, the Office of Personnel Management's 2013 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey data showed that DHS ranked 36th of 37 federal agencies in a measure of employee job satisfaction. In addition, employee satisfaction had decreased 7 percentage points since 2011, which is more than the government-wide decrease. Accordingly, DHS has considerable work ahead to improve its employee morale. Further, DHS is finalizing its analysis of skill gaps in key portions of its workforce including emergency management specialists and cyber-focused IT management personnel.", "Acquisition management. DHS has made progress in initiating efforts to validate required acquisition documents. However, about half of DHS major programs lack an approved baseline, 77 percent lack approved life cycle cost estimates, and the department has not implemented its acquisition policy consistently. In March 2014, GAO reported that the Transportation Security Administration does not collect or analyze available information that could be used to enhance the effectiveness of its advanced imaging technology. In March 2014, GAO also found that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) did not fully follow DHS policy regarding testing for the integrated fixed towers being deployed on the Arizona border. As a result, DHS does not have complete information on how the towers will operate once they are fully deployed.", "Financial management. DHS has made progress toward improving its financial management, but a significant amount of work remains to be completed. For example, DHS needs to eliminate all material weaknesses at the department level in areas such as property, plant, and equipment before its financial auditor can assert that the controls are effective. DHS also needs to effectively manage the modernization of financial management systems at the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).", "Information Technology (IT) Management. While important steps have been taken to define IT investment management processes, work is needed to demonstrate progress in implementing these processes across DHS's 13 IT investment portfolios. In July 2012, GAO recommended that DHS finalize the policies and procedures associated with its new tiered IT governance structure and continue to implement key processes supporting this structure. DHS agreed with these recommendations; however, as of April 2014, the department had not finalized the key IT governance directive, and the draft structure has been implemented across only 5 of the 13 investment portfolios.", "National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) . DHS's FEMA, which manages the NFIP, has partially met the five criteria for NFIP removal from the high-risk list, but needs to initiate or complete additional actions. For example, FEMA has not completed actions in certain areas, such as modernizing its claims and policy management system and overseeing compensation of insurers that sell NFIP policies. In addition, FEMA is unlikely to generate sufficient revenue to cover future catastrophic losses or repay billions of dollars borrowed from the Department of the Treasury. As of December 2013, FEMA owed the Treasury $24 billion\u2014primarily to pay claims associated with Superstorm Sandy (2012) and Hurricane Katrina (2005)\u2014and had not made a principal payment since 2010.", "Progress has been made in the following government-wide high-risk areas in which DHS plays a critical role, but significant work remains.", "Information security and cyber critical infrastructure protection. Federal agencies, including DHS, have taken a variety of actions that were intended to enhance federal and critical infrastructure cybersecurity, but more efforts are needed. DHS needs to take several actions to better oversee and assist agencies in improving information security practices. For instance, DHS should continue to assist agencies in developing and acquiring continuous diagnostic and mitigation capabilities to protect networks and counteract day-to-day cyber threats. In addition, DHS has taken steps to enhance the protection of cyber critical infrastructure but could do more to enhance coordination with the private sector.", "Terrorism-related information sharing. The federal government faces significant challenges in sharing terrorism-related information. However, DHS has made significant progress in enhancing the sharing of this information. For example, DHS is taking steps to measure the extent to which fusion centers\u2014collaborative efforts within states that investigate and respond to criminal and terrorist activity\u2014are coordinating with other field-based task forces and centers to share terrorism-related information, and assessing opportunities to improve coordination and information sharing. The federal government has important work ahead to address the high risk issue, such as developing metrics that measure the homeland security results achieved from improved information sharing."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["This testimony contains no new recommendations.

In the 11 years since the Department\u2019s creation, DHS has  implemented key homeland security operations, achieved important goals  and milestones, and grown to more than 240,000 employees and  approximately $60 billion in budget authority. During that time, our work  has identified several areas where DHS needs to address gaps and  weaknesses in its current operational and implementation efforts, as well  as strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of those efforts. Since  2003, we have made approximately 2,100 recommendations to DHS to  strengthen program management, performance measurement efforts, and  management processes, among other things.

DHS has made progress addressing areas we  have identified as high risk, but needs to continue to strengthen its efforts  in order to more efficiently and effectively achieve its homeland security  missions. In particular:  In 2003, we designated implementing and transforming DHS as high  risk because DHS had to transform 22 agencies\u2014several with major  management challenges\u2014into one department, and failure to address  associated risks could have serious consequences for U.S. national  and economic security.", "While challenges remain across its missions,  DHS has made considerable progress in transforming its original  component agencies into a single department. As a result, in our 2013  high-risk update, we narrowed the scope of the high-risk area to focus  on strengthening DHS management functions (human capital,  acquisition, financial management, and information technology ).", "In 2006, we added the NFIP\u2014a key component of the federal  government\u2019s efforts to limit the damage and financial impact of  floods\u2014to the GAO high-risk list because the program faced  significant ongoing financial and management challenges.particular, the NFIP, which is managed by DHS\u2019s Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA), is unlikely to generate sufficient  revenue to cover future catastrophic losses or repay billions of dollars  borrowed from the Department of the Treasury to cover insurance  claims from previous disasters.", "In 1997, we designated federal information security as a government- wide high-risk area, and we expanded the area in 2003 to include  systems supporting critical infrastructure such as power distribution,  communications, banking and finance, water supply, national defense,  and emergency services. The effective security of these systems and  the data they contain is essential to national security, economic well- being, and public health and safety. DHS is responsible for securing  its own information systems and data and also plays a pivotal role in  government-wide cybersecurity efforts.", "In 2005, we designated the sharing of terrorism-related information as  high risk because of the significant challenges the federal government  faces in sharing this information in a timely, accurate, and useful  manner.government-wide effort that involves numerous federal departments  and agencies. DHS plays a critical role in this sharing given its  homeland security missions and responsibilities.", "The sharing of terrorism-related information is a  In November 2000, we published our criteria for removing areas from the  high-risk list. Specifically, agencies must have (1) a demonstrated strong  commitment and top leadership support to address the risks; (2) a  corrective action plan that identifies the root causes, identifies effective  solutions, and provides for substantially completing corrective measures  in the near term, including but not limited to steps necessary to implement  solutions we recommended; (3) the capacity (that is, the people and other  resources) to resolve the risks; (4) a program instituted to monitor and  independently validate the effectiveness and sustainability of corrective  measures; and (5) the ability to demonstrate progress in implementing  corrective measures. When legislative, administration, and agency  actions, including those in response to our recommendations, result in  significant progress toward resolving a high-risk problem, we remove the  high-risk area.", "My testimony today discusses our observations on DHS\u2019s progress and  work remaining in addressing (1) high-risk areas for which DHS has sole  responsibility, and (2) high-risk areas for which DHS has critical, but  shared, responsibility.", "This statement is based on GAO\u2019s 2013 high-risk update as well as  reports and testimonies we issued from March 2013 through April 2014.For the past products, among other things, we analyzed DHS strategies  and other documents related to the department\u2019s efforts to address its  high-risk areas; reviewed our past reports issued since DHS began its  operations in March 2003; and interviewed DHS officials. More detailed  information on the scope and methodology of our prior work can be found  within each specific report. This statement is also based on analyses from  our ongoing assessment of DHS\u2019s efforts to address its high-risk areas  since February 2013. We expect to report final results from this work in  our 2015 high-risk update. For our analyses, among other things, we  analyzed DHS documentation, such as departmental guidance, and met  with DHS officials, including the Deputy Secretary and Under Secretary  for Management, to discuss DHS\u2019s efforts to address its high-risk areas.  With respect to the Strengthening DHS Management Functions high-risk  area, on May 1, 2014, DHS provided us with an updated version of its  Integrated Strategy for High Risk Management. We plan to analyze this  update as part of our ongoing assessment of DHS\u2019s progress in  addressing this high-risk area.", "We conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.

This has included  taking numerous actions specifically designed to address our criteria for  removing areas from the high-risk list. However, as we reported in our  February 2013 high risk update, this area remains high risk because the  department has significant work ahead. As shown in table 1, DHS has  met two of our criteria for removal from the high-risk list (leadership  commitment and a corrective action plan), and has partially met the  remaining three criteria (a framework to monitor progress; capacity; and  demonstrated, sustained progress).", "Leadership commitment (met). The Secretary and Deputy Secretary of  Homeland Security, the Under Secretary for Management at DHS, and  other senior officials have continued to demonstrate commitment and top  leadership support for addressing the department\u2019s management  challenges. They have also taken actions to institutionalize this  commitment to help ensure the long-term success of the department\u2019s  efforts. For example, in May 2012, the Secretary of Homeland Security  modified the delegations of authority between the Management  Directorate and its counterparts at the component level to clarify and  strengthen the authorities of the Under Secretary for Management across  the department.", "In addition, in April 2014, the Secretary of Homeland Security issued a  memorandum committing to improving DHS\u2019s planning, programming,  budgeting, and execution processes through strengthened departmental  structures and increased capability. This memorandum identified several  initial areas of focus intended to build organizational capacity.DHS officials have also routinely met with us over the past 5 years to  discuss the department\u2019s plans and progress in addressing this high-risk  area, during which we provided specific feedback on the department\u2019s  efforts. According to these officials, and as demonstrated through their  progress, the department is committed to demonstrating measurable,   Senior  sustained progress in addressing this high-risk area. It will be important  for DHS to maintain its current level of top leadership support and  sustained commitment to ensure continued progress in successfully  executing its corrective actions through completion.", "Corrective action plan (met). DHS established a plan for addressing this  high-risk area. In a September 2010 letter to DHS, we identified and DHS  agreed to achieve 31 actions and outcomes that are critical to addressing  the challenges within the department\u2019s management areas and in  integrating those functions across the department. In January 2011, DHS  issued its initial Integrated Strategy for High Risk Management, which  included key management initiatives and related corrective action plans  for addressing its management challenges and the outcomes we  identified. DHS provided updates of its progress in implementing these  initiatives and corrective actions in its later versions of the strategy. In  March 2014, we made updates to the actions and outcomes in  collaboration with DHS to reduce overlap and ensure their continued  relevance and appropriateness. These updates resulted in a reduction  from 31 to 30 total actions and outcomes.", "DHS\u2019s strategy and approach to continuously refining actionable steps to  implementing the outcomes, if implemented effectively and sustained,  provide a path for DHS to be removed from GAO\u2019s high-risk list.", "Capacity (partially met). In May 2014, DHS identified that it had  resources needed to implement 7 of the 11 initiatives the department had  under way to address the actions and outcomes, but did not identify  sufficient resource needs for the 4 remaining initiatives. In our analysis of  DHS\u2019s June 2013 update, which similarly did not identify sufficient  resource needs for all initiatives, we found that this absence of complete  resource information made it difficult to fully assess the extent to which  DHS has the capacity to implement its initiatives.", "In addition, our prior work has identified specific capacity gaps that could  undermine achievement of management outcomes. For example, in  September 2012, we reported that 51 of 62 acquisition programs faced  workforce shortfalls in program management, cost estimating,  engineering, and other areas, increasing the likelihood that the programs  will perform poorly in the future. Since that time, DHS has appointed  component acquisition executives at the components and made progress  in filling staff positions. In April 2014, however, we reported that DHS  needed to increase its cost-estimating capacity, and that the department  had not approved baselines for 21 of 46 major acquisition programs.These baselines\u2014which establish cost, schedule, and capability  parameters\u2014are necessary to accurately assess program performance.", "DHS needs to continue to identify resources for the remaining initiatives;  determine that sufficient resources and staff are committed to initiatives;  work to mitigate shortfalls and prioritize initiatives, as needed; and  communicate to senior leadership critical resource gaps.", "Framework to monitor progress (partially met). DHS established a  framework for monitoring its progress in implementing the corrective  actions it identified for addressing the 30 actions and outcomes. In the  June 2012 update to the Integrated Strategy for High Risk Management,  DHS included, for the first time, performance measures to track its  progress in implementing all of its key management initiatives. DHS  continued to include performance measures in its May 2014 update.", "Additionally, in March 2014, the Deputy Secretary began meeting monthly  with the DHS management team to discuss DHS\u2019s progress in  strengthening its management functions. According to senior DHS  officials, as part of these meetings, attendees discuss a report that senior  DHS officials update each month, which identifies corrective actions for  each outcome, as well as projected and actual completion dates.", "However, there are opportunities for DHS to strengthen this framework.  For example, as we reported in September 2013, DHS components need  to develop performance and functionality targets for assessing their  proposed financial systems. This would include having an independent  validation and verification program in place to ensure the modernized  financial systems meet expected targets. Moving forward, DHS will need  to closely track and independently validate the effectiveness and  sustainability of its corrective actions and make midcourse adjustments,  as needed.", "Demonstrated, sustained progress (partially met). Key to addressing  the department\u2019s management challenges is DHS demonstrating the  ability to achieve sustained progress across the 30 actions and outcomes  we identified and DHS agreed were needed to address the high-risk area.  These actions and outcomes include, among others, validating required  acquisition documents in accordance with a department-approved,  knowledge-based acquisition process, and sustaining clean audit  opinions for at least 2 consecutive years on department-wide financial  statements and internal controls. As illustrated by the examples below,  DHS has made important progress in implementing corrective actions  across its management functions, but it has not demonstrated  sustainable, measurable progress in addressing key challenges that  remain within these functions and in the integration of those functions.", "GAO, DHS Strategic Workforce Planning: Oversight of Departmentwide Efforts Should  Be Strengthened, GAO-13-65 (Washington, D.C.: Dec. 3, 2012). is more than the government-wide decrease of 4 percentage points  over the same time period. As a result, the gap between average  DHS employee satisfaction and the government-wide average  widened to 7 percentage points. Accordingly, DHS has considerable  work ahead to improve its employee morale.", "Further, according to senior DHS officials, the department has efforts  under way intended to link workforce planning efforts to strategic and  program-specific planning efforts to identify current and future human  capital needs, including the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed for  the department to meet its goals and objectives. According to these  officials, the department is in the process of finalizing competency gap  assessments to identify potential skills gaps within its components  that collectively encompass almost half of the department\u2019s workforce.  These assessments focus on occupations DHS identifies as critical to  its mission, including emergency management specialists and cyber- focused IT management personnel. DHS plans to analyze the results  of these assessments and develop plans to address any gaps the  assessments identify by the end of fiscal year 2014. This is a positive  step, as identifying skills gaps could help the department to better  identify current and future human capital needs and ensure the  department possesses the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to  meet its goals and objectives. Given that DHS is finalizing these  assessments, it is too early to assess their effectiveness.", "Acquisition management. DHS has mostly addressed one of the five  acquisition management outcomes, partially addressed one, and initiated  activities to address the remaining three. DHS has made the most  progress in increasing component-level acquisition capability by, for  example, establishing a component acquisition executive in each DHS  component to provide oversight and support programs within its portfolio.  DHS has also taken steps to enhance its acquisition workforce by  establishing centers of excellence for cost estimating, systems  engineering, and other disciplines to promote best practices and provide  technical guidance. However, DHS needs to improve its acquisition  management. For example:", "DHS initiated a governance body in 2013 to review and validate  acquisition programs\u2019 requirements and identify and eliminate any  unintended redundancies, but it considered trade-offs only across  acquisition programs within the department\u2019s cybersecurity portfolio.  DHS acknowledged that the department has no formal structure in  place to consider trade-offs DHS-wide, but DHS anticipates chartering  such a body by the end of May 2014.", "DHS also has initiated efforts to validate required acquisition  documents in accordance with a knowledge-based acquisition  process, but this remains a major challenge for the department. A  knowledge-based approach provides developers with information  needed to make sound investment decisions, and it would help DHS  address significant challenges we have identified across its  acquisition programs. DHS\u2019s acquisition policy largely reflects key  acquisition management practices, but the department has not  implemented it consistently. In March 2014, we reported that the  Transportation Security Administration does not collect or analyze  available information that could be used to enhance the effectiveness  of its advanced imaging technology. In March 2014, we also found  that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) did not fully follow  DHS policy regarding testing for the integrated fixed towers being  deployed on the Arizona border. As a result, DHS does not have  complete information on how the towers will operate once they are  fully deployed.", "Finally, DHS does not have the acquisition management tools in place  to consistently demonstrate whether its major acquisition programs  are on track to achieve their cost, schedule, and capability goals.  About half of major programs lack an approved baseline, and 77  percent lack approved life cycle cost estimates. DHS stated in its  2014 update that it will take time to demonstrate substantive progress  in this area. We have recently initiated two reviews to examine DHS\u2019s  progress in these high-risk areas. In addition, the House Homeland  Security committee recently introduced a DHS acquisition reform bill  that reinforces the importance of key acquisition management  practices, such as establishing cost, schedule, and capability  parameters, and includes requirements to better identify and address  poor-performing acquisition programs, which could aid the  Department in addressing its acquisition management challenges.", "Financial management: DHS has made progress toward improving its  financial management and has fully addressed one of eight high-risk  financial management outcomes\u2014ensuring its financial statements are  accurate and reliable. However, a significant amount of work remains to  be completed on the other seven outcomes related to DHS\u2019s financial  statements, internal control over financial reporting, and modernizing  financial management systems.", "DHS produced accurate and reliable financial statements for the first  time in fiscal year 2013, in part through management\u2019s commitment to  improving its financial management process. As of May 2014, DHS is  working toward sustaining this key achievement.", "DHS has also made some progress toward implementing effective  internal control over financial reporting, in part by implementing a  corrective action planning process aimed at addressing internal  control weaknesses. For example, the department took corrective  actions to reduce the material weakness in environmental and other  liabilities to a significant deficiency.eliminate all material weaknesses at the department level before its  financial auditor can assert that the controls are effective. For  example, one of the material weaknesses involves deficiencies in  property, plant, and equipment. DHS plans to achieve this outcome  for fiscal year 2016. To meet another outcome, DHS needs to sustain  these efforts for 2 years.", "However, DHS needs to", "DHS also needs to effectively manage the modernization of financial  management systems at the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Both USCG and ICE have  made some progress toward modernizing their systems and foresee  moving to a federal shared service provider and completing their  efforts in the latter part of 2016 and 2017. Because of critical  stability issues with its legacy financial system that were resolved in  May 2013, FEMA postponed its modernization efforts and has not  restarted them.", "IT Management. DHS has fully addressed one of the six IT management  outcomes and partially addressed the remaining five. In particular, the  department has strengthened its enterprise architecture program (or  blueprint) to guide IT acquisitions by, among other things, largely  addressing our prior recommendations aimed at adding needed  architectural depth and breadth, thus fully addressing this outcome.  However, the department needs to continue to demonstrate progress in  strengthening other core IT management areas. For example,", "While the department is taking the necessary steps to enhance its IT  security program, such as finalizing its annual Information Security  Performance Plan, further work will be needed for DHS to eliminate  the department\u2019s current material weakness in its information security.  It will be important for the department to fully implement its plan, since  DHS\u2019s financial statement auditor reported in December 2013 that  flaws in the security controls such as access controls, contingency  planning, and segregation of duties were a material weakness for  financial reporting purposes.", "While important steps have been taken to define IT investment  management processes generally consistent with best practices, work  is needed to demonstrate progress in implementing these processes  across DHS\u2019s 13 IT investment portfolios. In July 2012, we  recommended that DHS finalize the policies and procedures  associated with its new tiered IT governance structure and continue to  implement key processes supporting this structure. DHS agreed  with these recommendations; however, as of April 2014, the  department had not finalized the key IT governance directive, and the  draft structure has been implemented across only 5 of the 13  investment portfolios.", "Fully addressing these actions would also help DHS to address key IT  operations efficiency initiatives, as well as to more systematically  identify other opportunities for savings. For example, as part of the  Office of Management and Budget\u2019s data center consolidation  initiative, we reported that DHS planned to consolidate from 101 data  centers to 37 data centers by December 2015.officials told us that the department had achieved actual cost savings  totaling about $140 million in fiscal years 2011 through 2013, and that  it estimates total consolidation cost savings of approximately $650  million through fiscal year 2019.", "Further, DHS", "DHS has also made progress in establishing and implementing sound  IT system acquisition processes, but continued efforts are needed to  ensure that the department\u2019s major IT acquisition programs are  applying these processes and obtaining more predictable outcomes.  In 2013, DHS\u2019s Office of the Chief Information Officer led an  assessment of its major IT programs (against industry best practices  in key IT system acquisition process areas) to determine its capability  strengths and weaknesses, and has work under way to track  programs\u2019 progress in addressing identified capability gaps, such as  requirements management and risk analysis. While this gap analysis  and approach for tracking implementation of corrective actions are  important steps, DHS will need to show that these actions are  resulting in better, more predictable outcomes for its major IT system  acquisitions. Demonstrated progress in closing these gaps is  especially important in light of our recent reports on major DHS IT  programs experiencing significant challenges largely because of  system acquisition process shortfalls, including DHS\u2019s major border  security system modernization, known as TECS-Mod.", "Management integration. DHS has made substantial progress integrating  its management functions, fully addressing three of the four outcomes we  identified as key to the department\u2019s management integration efforts.

In  addition, FEMA officials have met with us to discuss outstanding  recommendations, the actions they have taken to address them, and  additional actions they could take. Further, a DHS official said that FEMA  holds regular meetings to discuss the status of open recommendations.", "Recent legislative changes, however, have presented challenges for  FEMA in addressing the financial exposure created by the NFIP. For  example, in July 2012, the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of  2012 (Biggert-Waters Act) was enacted, containing provisions to help  strengthen the future financial solvency and administrative efficiency of  NFIP, including phasing out almost all discounted insurance premiums  (commonly referred to as subsidized premiums). In July 2013, we  reported that FEMA was starting to implement some of the required  changes. However, on March 21, 2014, the Homeowner Flood  Insurance Affordability Act of 2014 (2014 Act) was enacted, reinstating  certain premium subsidies and restoring grandfathered rates removed by  the Biggert-Waters Act. The 2014 Act addresses affordability concerns  for certain property owners, but may also increase NFIP\u2019s long-term  financial burden on taxpayers.", "Corrective action plan (partially met). While FEMA developed  corrective action plans for implementing the recommendations in  individual GAO reports, it has not developed a comprehensive plan to  address the issues that have placed the NFIP on GAO\u2019s high-risk list.  While addressing our recommendations is part of such a plan, a  comprehensive plan also defines the root causes, identifies effective  solutions, and provides for substantially completing corrective measures  near term. According to a DHS official, the individual action plans  collectively represent their plan for addressing these issues, as the  recommendations cover steps needed to improve the program\u2019s financial  stability as well as its administration. The official added that DHS has  developed more comprehensive plans for other high-risk areas, which  have been helpful, and could consider doing so for the NFIP, but such  plans require a lot of work. Such a plan could help FEMA ensure that all  important issues, and all aspects of those issues, are addressed. For  example, while our recommendations regarding the NFIP\u2019s financial  stability have focused on the extent of subsidized rates and the rate- setting process, financial stability could include other important areas,  such as debt management. As of December 2013, FEMA owed the  Treasury $24 billion\u2014primarily to pay claims associated with Superstorm  Sandy (2012) and Hurricane Katrina (2005)\u2014and had not made a  principal payment since 2010.", "Capacity (partially met). FEMA faces several challenges in improving  the program\u2019s financial stability and operations. First, recent legislative  changes permit certain premium subsidies and restore grandfathered  rates removed by the Biggert-Waters Act. These provisions, along with  others, may weaken the potential for improved financial soundness of the  NFIP program. Second, while FEMA is establishing a reserve fund as  required by the Biggert-Waters Act, it is unlikely to initially meet the act\u2019s  annual targets for building up the reserve, partly because of statutory  limitations on annual premium increases. Third, while FEMA has begun  taking some actions to improve its administration of the NFIP, it is unclear  how the resources required to implement both the Biggert-Waters Act and  the 2014 Act will affect its ability to continue and complete these efforts.  For example, the Acts require FEMA to complete multiple studies and  take a number of actions within the next several years, which will require  resources FEMA would normally have committed to other efforts.", "Monitoring Progress (partially met). FEMA has a process in place to  monitor progress in taking actions to implement our recommendations  related to the NFIP. For example, the status of efforts to address the  recommendations is regularly discussed both within the Flood Insurance  and Mitigation Administration, which administers the NFIP, and at the  DHS level, according to a DHS official. However, it does not have a  specific process for independently validating the effectiveness or  sustainability of those actions. Instead, according to a DHS official, once  a recommendation related to the NFIP is implemented, the effects of the  actions taken to do so are not tracked separately, but are evaluated as  part of regular reviews of the effectiveness of the entire program. Broader  monitoring of the effectiveness and sustainability of its actions would help  ensure that appropriate corrective actions are being taken.", "Demonstrated, sustained progress (partially met). FEMA has begun  to take actions to improve the program\u2019s financial stability, such as  initiating actions to improve the accuracy of full-risk rates. However,  these efforts are not complete, and FEMA does not have some  information, such as the number and location of existing grandfathered  properties and information necessary to appropriately revise premium  rates for previously subsidized properties. Similarly, FEMA has taken a  number of actions to improve areas of the program\u2019s operations, such as  financial reporting and continuity planning. However, some important  actions, such as modernizing its policy and claims management system  and ensuring the reasonableness of compensation to insurance  companies that sell and service most NFIP policies, remain to be  completed.financial and operational issues facing NFIP."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Government-wide High-Risk Areas in Which DHS Plays a Critical Role", "paragraphs": ["Progress has been made in the government-wide high-risk areas in which  DHS plays a critical role, but significant work remains."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Information Security and Cyber Critical Infrastructure Protection", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in our February 2013 high-risk update, the White House  and federal agencies, including DHS, have taken a variety of actions that  were intended to enhance federal and critical infrastructure cybersecurity.
