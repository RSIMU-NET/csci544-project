Nevertheless, NNSA does not have reliable enterprise-wide management information on program budgets and costs, which potentially increases risk to NNSA\u0092s programs. For example, in June 2010, GAO reported that NNSA could not identify the total costs to operate and maintain essential weapons activities facilities and infrastructure. In addition, in February 2011, GAO reported that NNSA lacks complete data on, among other things, the condition and value of its existing infrastructure, cost estimates and completion dates for planned capital improvement projects, and critical human capital skills in its contractor workforce that are needed for its programs. As a result, NNSA does not have a sound basis for making decisions on how to most effectively manage its portfolio of projects and other programs and lacks information that could help justify future budget requests or target cost savings opportunities. NNSA recognizes that its ability to make informed decisions is hampered and is taking steps to improve its budget and cost data.", "For more than a decade and in numerous reports, GAO found that NNSA has continued to experience significant cost and schedule overruns on its major projects. For example, in 2000 and 2009, respectively, GAO reported that NNSA\u0092s efforts to extend the operational lives of nuclear weapons in the stockpile have experienced cost increases and schedule delays, such as a $300 million cost increase and 2-year delay in the refurbishment of one warhead and a nearly $70 million increase and 1-year delay in the refurbishment of another warhead. NNSA\u0092s construction projects have also experienced cost overruns. For example, GAO reported that the cost to construct a modern Uranium Processing Facility at NNSA\u0092s Y-12 National Security Complex experienced a nearly seven-fold cost increase from between $600 million and $1.1 billion in 2004 to between $4.2 billion and $6.5 billion in 2011. Given NNSA\u0092s record of weak management of major projects, GAO believes careful federal oversight of NNSA\u0092s modernization of the nuclear security enterprise will be critical to ensure that resources are spent in as an effective and efficient manner as possible.", "NNSA\u0092s oversight of safety and security in the nuclear security enterprise has also been questioned. As work carried out at NNSA\u0092s sites involves dangerous nuclear materials such as plutonium and highly enriched uranium, stringent safety procedures and security requirements must be observed. GAO reported in 2008 on numerous safety and security problems across NNSA\u0092s sites, contributing, among other things, to the temporary shutdown of facilities at both Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Ineffective NNSA oversight of its contractors\u0092 activities contributed to many of these incidents as well as relatively lax laboratory attitudes toward safety procedures. In many cases, NNSA has made improvements to resolve these safety and security concerns, but better oversight is needed to ensure that improvements are fully implemented and sustained. GAO agrees that excessive oversight and micromanagement of contractors\u0092 activities are not an efficient use of scarce federal resources, but that NNSA\u0092s problems are not caused by excessive oversight but instead result from ineffective departmental oversight."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our work on the governance,  oversight, and management of the nation\u2019s nuclear security enterprise. As  you know, the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a  separately organized agency within the Department of Energy (DOE), is  responsible for managing its contractors\u2019 nuclear weapon- and  nonproliferation-related national security activities in research and  development laboratories, production plants, and other facilities known  collectively as the nuclear security enterprise. With the moratorium on  underground nuclear testing that began in 1992 and the subsequent  creation of the Stockpile Stewardship Program, the mission of the nuclear  security enterprise changed from designing, building, and testing  successive generations of weapons to extending the life of the existing  nuclear weapons stockpile through scientific study, computer simulation,  and refurbishment.", "Ensuring that the nuclear weapons stockpile remains safe and reliable in  the absence of underground nuclear testing is extraordinarily complicated  and requires state-of-the-art experimental and computing facilities as well  as the skills of top scientists in the field. To its credit, NNSA consistently  accomplishes this task, as evidenced by the successful assessment of  the safety, reliability, and performance of each weapon type in the nuclear  stockpile since such assessments were first conducted in 1995. NNSA\u2019s  three nuclear weapon design laboratories are heavily involved in this  assessment process and, over the past decade, the United States has  invested billions of dollars in sustaining the Cold War-era stockpile and  upgrading the laboratories.", "Nevertheless, DOE\u2019s and NNSA\u2019s management of the nuclear security  enterprise has been the subject of much criticism. The department\u2019s  problems are long-standing. For example, we have designated DOE\u2019s  management of its contracts as an area at high risk of fraud, waste,  abuse, and mismanagement because of the department\u2019s record of  inadequate management and oversight of its contractors.  In January  1995, we reported that DOE\u2019s laboratories did not have clearly defined  missions that focus their considerable resources on accomplishing the  department\u2019s changing objectives and national priorities. Noting that the  laboratories have made vital contributions to the nation\u2019s defense and  civilian science and technology efforts, we reported that DOE had not  coordinated these laboratories\u2019 efforts to solve national problems but had  instead managed each laboratory on a program-by-program basis. The  establishment of NNSA as a semi-autonomous agency within DOE in  2000 was intended to correct these long-standing and widely recognized  DOE management problems, which had been underscored by significant  cost overruns on major projects and security problems at the national  laboratories.", "NNSA\u2019s creation, however, has not yet had the desired effect of fully  resolving these management problems. Progress has been made, but  NNSA and DOE\u2019s Office of Environmental Management remain on our  high-risk list. Furthermore, we continue to identify problems across the  nuclear security enterprise, ranging from significant cost and schedule  overruns on major projects to ineffective federal oversight of safety and  security at NNSA\u2019s sites. Concerns have also been raised by national  laboratory and other officials that DOE\u2019s and NNSA\u2019s oversight of the  laboratories\u2019 activities has been excessive and that the safety and  security requirements the laboratories\u2019 are subject to are overly  prescriptive and burdensome, which has resulted in a negative effect on  the quality of science performed at these laboratories.", "My testimony today discusses NNSA\u2019s management of the nuclear  security enterprise.

Since the Manhattan Project produced the first  atomic bomb during World War II, NNSA, DOE, and predecessor  agencies have depended on the expertise of private firms, universities,  and others to carry out research and development work and efficiently  operate the facilities necessary for the nation\u2019s nuclear defense. DOE\u2019s  relationship with these entities has been formalized over the years  through its M&O contracts\u2014agreements that give DOE\u2019s contractors  unique responsibility to carry out major portions of DOE\u2019s missions and  apply their scientific, technical, and management expertise.", "Currently, DOE spends 90 percent of its annual budget on M&O  contracts, making it the largest non-Department of Defense contracting  agency in the government.

Various headquarters and field-based organizations  within DOE and NNSA develop policies and NNSA site offices, collocated  with NNSA\u2019s sites, conduct day-to-day oversight of the M&O contractors,  and evaluate the contractors\u2019 performance in carrying out the sites\u2019  missions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNSA Does Not Have Reliable Enterprise- Wide Management Information on Program Budgets and Costs", "paragraphs": ["As we have reported since 1999, NNSA has not had reliable enterprise- wide budget and cost data, which potentially increases risk to NNSA\u2019s  programs. Specifically:  In July 2003 and January 2007, we reported that NNSA lacked a  planning and budgeting process that adequately validated contractor- prepared cost estimates used in developing annual budget requests.  Establishing this process was required by the statute that created  NNSA\u2014Title 32 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2000. In particular, NNSA had not established an independent  analysis unit to review program budget proposals, confirm cost  estimates, and analyze budget alternatives.

Without this information, NNSA risks being unable to identify return on its  investment or opportunities for cost savings or to make fully informed  decisions on trade-offs in a resource-constrained environment.", "NNSA, recognizing that its ability to make informed enterprise-wide  decisions is hampered by the lack of comprehensive data and analytical  tools, is considering the use of computer models\u2014quantitative tools that  couple data from each site with the functions of the enterprise\u2014to  integrate and analyze data to create an interconnected view of the  enterprise, which may help to address some of the critical shortcomings  we identified. In July 2009, NNSA tasked its M&O contractors to form an  enterprise modeling consortium. NNSA stated that the consortium is  responsible for leading efforts to acquire and maintain enterprise data,  enhance stakeholder confidence, integrate modeling capabilities, and fill  in any gaps that are identified. The consortium has identified areas in  which enterprise modeling projects could provide NNSA with reliable data  and modeling capabilities, including capabilities on infrastructure and  critical skills needs. In addition, we recently observed progress on  NNSA\u2019s development of an Enterprise Program Analysis Tool that should  give NNSA greater insight into its sites\u2019 cost reporting. The Tool also  includes a mechanism to identify when resource trade-off decisions must  be made, for example, when contractor-developed estimates for program  requirements exceed the budget targets provided by NNSA for those  programs.

However, for more than a decade and in  numerous reports, we have found that NNSA has continued to experience  significant cost and schedule overruns on its major projects, principally  because of ineffective oversight and poor contractor management.  Specifically:  In August 2000, we found that poor management and oversight of the  National Ignition Facility construction project at Lawrence Livermore  National Laboratory had increased the facility\u2019s cost by $1 billion and  delayed its scheduled completion date by 6 years. Among the many  causes for the cost overruns or schedule delays, DOE and Livermore  officials responsible for managing or overseeing the facility\u2019s  construction did not plan for the technically complex assembly and  installation of the facility\u2019s 192 laser beams. They also did not use  independent review committees effectively to help identify and correct  issues before they turned into costly problems. Similarly, in April 2010,  we reported that weak management by DOE and NNSA had allowed  the cost, schedule, and scope of ignition-related activities at the  National Ignition Facility to increase substantially., Since 2005,  ignition-related costs have increased by around 25 percent\u2014from  $1.6 billion to over $2 billion\u2014and the planned completion date for  these activities has slipped from the end of fiscal year 2011 to the end  of fiscal year 2012 or beyond.", "We have issued several reports on the technical issues, cost  increases, and schedule delays associated with NNSA\u2019s efforts to  extend, through refurbishment, the operational lives of nuclear  weapons in the stockpile. For example, in December 2000, we  reported that refurbishment of the W87 strategic warhead had  experienced significant design and production problems that  increased its refurbishment costs by over $300 million and caused  schedule delays of about 2 years. Similarly, in March 2009 we  reported that NNSA and the Department of Defense had not  effectively managed cost, schedule, and technical risks for the B61  nuclear bomb and the W76 nuclear warhead refurbishments. For the  B61 life extension program, NNSA was only able to stay on schedule  by significantly reducing the number of weapons undergoing  refurbishment and abandoning some refurbishment objectives. In the  case of the W76 nuclear warhead, NNSA experienced a 1-year delay  and an unexpected cost increase of nearly $70 million as a result of  its ineffective management of one the highest risks of the program\u2014 the manufacture of a key material known as Fogbank, which NNSA  did not have the knowledge, expertise, or facilities to manufacture.", "In October 2009, we reported on shortcomings in NNSA\u2019s oversight of  the planned relocation of its Kansas City Plant to a new, more modern  facility. Rather than construct a new facility itself, NNSA chose to  have a private developer build it. NNSA would then lease the building  through the General Services Administration for a period of 20 years.  However, when choosing to lease rather than construct a new facility  itself, NNSA allowed the Kansas City Plant to limit its cost analysis to  a 20-year life cycle that has no relationship with known requirements  of the nuclear weapons stockpile or the useful life of a production  facility that is properly maintained. As a result, NNSA\u2019s financing  decisions were not as fully informed and transparent as they could  have been. If the Kansas City Plant had quantified potential cost  savings to be realized over the longer useful life of the facility, NNSA  may have made a different decision as to whether to lease or  construct a new facility itself.", "We reported in March 2010 that NNSA\u2019s plutonium disposition  program was behind schedule in establishing a capability to produce  the plutonium feedstock necessary to operate its Mixed-oxide Fuel  Fabrication facility currently being constructed at DOE\u2019s Savannah  River Site in South Carolina. In addition, NNSA had not sufficiently  assessed alternatives to producing plutonium feedstock and had only  identified one potential customer for the mixed-oxide fuel the facility  would produce. In its fiscal year 2012 budget justification to Congress,  NNSA reported that it did not have a construction cost baseline for the  facility needed to produce the plutonium feedstock for the mixed-oxide  fuel, although Congress had already appropriated over $270 million  through fiscal year 2009 and additional appropriation requests totaling  almost $2 billion were planned through fiscal year 2016. NNSA stated  in its budget justification that it is currently considering options for  producing necessary plutonium feedstock without constructing a new  facility.", "GAO, Nuclear Weapons: National Nuclear Security Administration\u2019s Plans for Its  Uranium Processing Facility Should Better Reflect Funding Estimates and Technology  Readiness, GAO-11-103 (Washington, D.C.: Nov. 19, 2010).", "Senate Committee on Appropriations.

For example, DOE has  updated program and project management policies and guidance in an  effort to improve the reliability of project cost estimates, better assess  project risks, and better ensure project reviews that are timely, useful and  identify problems early. However, DOE needs to ensure that NNSA has  the capacity\u2014that is, the people and other resources\u2014to resolve its  project management difficulties and that it has a program to monitor and  independently validate the effectiveness and sustainability of its corrective  measures.

Work carried out at NNSA\u2019s  sites may involve plutonium and highly enriched uranium, which are  extremely hazardous. For example, exposure to small quantities of  plutonium is dangerous to human health, so that even inhaling a few  micrograms creates a long-term risk of lung, liver, and bone cancer and  inhaling larger doses can cause immediate lung injuries and death. Also,  if not safely contained and managed, plutonium can be unstable and  spontaneously ignite under certain conditions. NNSA\u2019s sites also conduct  a wide range of other activities, including construction and routine  maintenance and operation of equipment and facilities that also run the  risk of accidents, such as those involving heavy machinery or electrical  mishaps. The consequences of such accidents could be less severe than  those involving nuclear materials, but they could also lead to long-term  illnesses, injuries, or even deaths among workers or the public. Plutonium  and highly enriched uranium must also be stored under extremely high  security to protect it from theft or terrorist attack.", "In numerous reports, we have expressed concerns about NNSA\u2019s  oversight of safety and security across the nuclear security enterprise.  With regard to nuclear and worker safety:  In October 2007, we reported that there had been nearly 60 serious  accidents or near misses at NNSA\u2019s national laboratories since  2000. These incidents included worker exposure to radiation,  inhalation of toxic vapors, and electrical shocks. Although no one was  killed, many of the accidents caused serious harm to workers or  damage to facilities. For example, at Los Alamos in July 2004, an  undergraduate student who was not wearing required eye protection  was partially blinded in a laser accident. Accidents and nuclear safety  violations also contributed to the temporary shutdown of facilities at  both Los Alamos and Livermore in 2004 and 2005. In the case of Los  Alamos, laboratory employees disregarded established procedures  and then attempted to cover up the incident, according to Los Alamos  officials. Our review of nearly 100 reports issued since 2000 found  that the contributing factors to these safety problems generally fell into  three key categories: (1) relatively lax laboratory attitudes toward  safety procedures; (2) laboratory inadequacies in identifying and  addressing safety problems with appropriate corrective actions; and  (3) inadequate oversight by NNSA.", "We reported in January 2008 on a number of long-standing nuclear  and worker safety concerns at Los Alamos.included, among other things, the laboratory\u2019s lack of compliance with  safety documentation requirements, inadequate safety systems,  radiological exposures, and enforcement actions for significant  violations of nuclear safety requirements that resulted in civil penalties  totaling nearly $2.5 million.", "In October 2008, we reported that DOE\u2019s Office of Health, Safety, and  Security\u2014which, among other things, develops, oversees, and helps  enforce nuclear safety policies at DOE and NNSA sites\u2014fell short of  fully meeting our elements of effective independent oversight of  nuclear safety.independently was limited because it had no role in reviewing  technical analyses that help ensure safe design and operation of  nuclear facilities, and the office had no personnel at DOE sites to  provide independent safety observations.", "With regard to security:  In June 2008, we reported that significant security problems at Los  Alamos had received insufficient attention. The laboratory had over  two dozen initiatives under way that were principally aimed at  reducing, consolidating, and better protecting classified resources but  had not implemented complete security solutions to address either  classified parts storage in unapproved storage containers or  weaknesses in its process for ensuring that actions taken to correct  security deficiencies were completed. Furthermore, Los Alamos had  implemented initiatives that addressed a number of previously  identified security concerns but had not developed the long-term  strategic framework necessary to ensure that its fixes would be  sustained over time. Similarly, in October 2009, we reported that Los  Alamos had implemented measures to enhance its information  security controls, but significant weaknesses remained in protecting  the information stored on and transmitted over its classified computer  network. A key reason for this was that the laboratory had not fully  implemented an information security program to ensure that controls  were effectively established and maintained.", "In March 2009, we reported about numerous and wide-ranging  security deficiencies at Livermore, particularly in the ability of  Livermore\u2019s protective force to assure the protection of special nuclear  material and the laboratory\u2019s protection and control of classified  matter. Livermore\u2019s physical security systems, such as alarms and  sensors, and its security program planning and assurance activities  were also identified as areas needing improvement. Weaknesses in  Livermore\u2019s contractor self-assessment program and the NNSA  Livermore Site Office\u2019s oversight of the contractor contributed to these  security deficiencies at the laboratory. According to one DOE official,  both programs were \u201cbroken\u201d and missed even the \u201clow-hanging fruit.\u201d  The laboratory took corrective action to address these deficiencies,  but we noted that better oversight was needed to ensure that security  improvements were fully implemented and sustained.", "We reported in December 2010 that NNSA needed to improve its  contingency planning for its classified supercomputing operations. All three NNSA laboratories had implemented some components of a  contingency planning and disaster recovery program, but NNSA had  not provided effective oversight to ensure that the laboratories\u2019  contingency and disaster recovery planning and testing were  comprehensive and effective. In particular, NNSA\u2019s component  organizations, including the Office of the Chief Information Officer,  were unclear about their roles and responsibilities for providing  oversight in the laboratories\u2019 implementation of contingency and  disaster recovery planning.", "In March 2010, the Deputy Secretary of Energy announced a new effort\u2014 the 2010 Safety and Security Reform effort\u2014to revise DOE\u2019s safety and  security directives and reform its oversight approach to \u201cprovide  contractors with the flexibility to tailor and implement safety and security  programs without excessive federal oversight or overly prescriptive  departmental requirements.\u201d We are currently reviewing the reform of  DOE\u2019s safety directives and the benefits DOE hopes to achieve from this  effort for, among others, the House Committee on Energy and  Commerce.

Over  the past decade, we have made numerous recommendations to DOE and  NNSA to improve their management and oversight practices. DOE and  NNSA have acted on many of these recommendations, and we will  continue to monitor progress being made in these areas. In the current  era of tight budgets, Congress and the American taxpayer have the right  to know whether investments made in the nuclear security enterprise are  worth the cost. However, NNSA currently lacks the basic financial  information on the total costs to operate and maintain its essential  facilities and infrastructure, leaving it unable to identify return on  investment or opportunities for cost savings. NNSA is now proposing to  spend decades and tens of billions of dollars to modernize the nuclear  security enterprise, largely by replacing or refurbishing aging and  decaying facilities at its sites across the United States.
