Although DCGS was started in 1998, DOD has not yet formally identified which systems are going to be involved in DCGS; what the time frames will be for making selections and modifications, conducting interoperability tests, and integrating systems into the overarching system; how transitions will be funded; and how the progress of the initiative will be tracked. Moreover, DOD's process for testing and certifying that systems will be interoperable is not working effectively. In fact, only 2 of 26 DCGS systems have been certified as interoperable. Because 21 of the systems that have not been certified have already been fielded, DOD has a greater risk that the new systems will not be able to share intelligence data as quickly as needed.

This data can come from aircraft like  the U-2 or Global Hawk or satellites or other ground, air, sea, or spaced- based equipment. The sensors that collect this data are linked to ground- surface-based processing systems that collect, analyze, and disseminate it  to other intelligence processing facilities and to combat forces.  (See figures 1 and 2.) These systems can be large or small, fixed, mobile,  or transportable. For example, the Air Force operates several large, fixed  systems that provide extensive analysis capability well beyond combat  activities. By contrast, the Army and Marine Corps operate smaller, mobile  intelligence systems that travel with and operate near combat forces.", "A key problem facing DOD is that these systems do not always work  together effectively, thereby slowing down the time it takes to collect data  and analyze and disseminate it sometimes by hours or even days, though  DOD reports that timing has improved in more recent military operations.  At times, some systems cannot easily exchange information because they  were not designed to be compatible and must work through technical  patches to transmit and receive data. In other cases, the systems are not  connected at all. Compounding this problem is the fact that each service  has its own command, control, and communications structure that present  barriers to interoperability.", "Among the efforts DOD has underway to improve interoperability is the  migration to a family of overarching ground-surface systems, based on the  best systems already deployed and future systems. DCGS will not only  connect individual systems but also enable these systems to merge  intelligence information from multiple sources. The first phase of the  migration effort will focus on connecting existing systems belonging to the  military services\u2014so that each service has an interoperable \u201cfamily\u201d of  systems. The second phase will focus on interconnecting the families of  systems so that joint and combined forces can have an unprecedented,  common view of the battlefield. DOD\u2019s Office of the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence is  leading this effort.", "Successfully building a compatible ground-surface system is extremely  challenging. First, DOD is facing a significant technical challenge. The  ground-surface-based systems must not only have compatible electronic  connections, but also compatible data transfer rates and data formats and  vocabularies. At the same time it modifies systems, DOD must protect  sensitive and classified data and be able to make fixes to one system  without negatively affecting others. All of these tasks will be difficult to  achieve given that the systems currently operated were designed by the  individual services with their own requirements in mind and that they still  own the systems. Second, sufficient communications capacity (e.g.,  bandwidth) must exist to transmit large amounts of data. DOD is still in the  early stages of adding this capacity through its bandwidth expansion  program. Third, DOD must have enough qualified people to analyze and  exploit the large volumes of data modern sensors are capable of collecting.  Lastly, DOD must still address interoperability barriers that stretch well  beyond technical and human capital enhancements. For example, the  services may have operating procedures and processes that simply  preclude them from sharing data with other services and components, or  they may have inconsistent security procedures. Formulating and following  common processes and procedures will be difficult since the services have  historically been reluctant to do so."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Planning for Migration Effort Is Incomplete", "paragraphs": ["Given the multi-billion-dollar commitment and many technical and  operational challenges with the migration initiative, it is critical that DOD  have effective plans to guide and manage system development. These  would include such things as a comprehensive architecture, migration plan,  and investment strategy. However, even though it initiated DCGS in 1998  and is fielding new intelligence systems, DOD is still in the beginning stages  of this planning. It is now working on an enterprise architecture, a high  level concept of operations for the processing of intelligence information,  and an overarching test plan, and it expects these to be done by July 2003.  DOD has not yet focused on an investment strategy or on a migration plan  that would set a target date for completing the migration and outline  activities for meeting that date. By fielding systems without completing  these plans, DOD is increasing the risk that DCGS systems will not share  data as quickly as needed by the warfighter."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Planning Elements Essential to Success of DOD\u2019s Migration Effort", "paragraphs": ["Successfully moving toward an interoperable family of ground-surface- based processing systems for intelligence data is a difficult endeavor for  DOD. The systems now in place are managed by many different entities  within DOD. They are involved in a wide range of military operations and  installed on a broad array of equipment. At the same time, they need to be  made to be compatible and interoperable. DOD\u2019s migration must also fit in  with long-term goals for achieving information superiority over the enemy.  Several elements are particularly critical to successfully addressing these  challenges. They include an enterprise architecture, or blueprint, to define  the current and target environment for ground-based processing systems; a  road map, or migration plan to define how DOD will get to the target  environment and track its progress in doing so; and an investment strategy  to ensure adequate resources are provided toward the migration. Each of  these elements is described in the following discussions.", "Enterprise architecture. Enterprise architectures systematically and  completely define an organization\u2019s current (baseline) or desired  (target) environment. They do so by providing a clear and  comprehensive picture of a mission area\u2014both in logical (e.g.,  operations, functions, and information flows) terms and technical (e.g.,  software, hardware, and communications) terms. If defined properly,  enterprise architectures can assist in optimizing interdependencies and  interrelationships among an organization\u2019s operations and the  underlying technology supporting these operations. Our experience  with federal agencies has shown that attempting to define and build  systems without first completing an architecture often results in  systems that are duplicative, not well integrated, and unnecessarily  costly to maintain and interface, and do not optimize mission  performance. DOD also recognizes the importance of enterprise  architectures and developed a framework known as the Command,  Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and  Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Architecture Framework for its components to  use in guiding efforts similar to DCGS. DOD\u2019s acquisition guidance also  requires the use of architectures to characterize interrelationships and  interactions between U.S., allied, and coalition systems.", "Migration plan or road map. Given the size and complexity of DCGS, it  is important that the migration be planned in convenient, manageable  increments to accommodate DOD\u2019s capacity to handle change. At a  minimum, a plan would lay out current system capabilities, desired  capabilities, and specific initiatives, programs, projects, and schedules  intended to get DOD and the services to that vision. It would also define  measures for tracking progress, such as testing timeliness and the status  of modifications, roles and responsibilities for key activities, and  mechanisms for enforcing compliance with the migration plan and  ensuring that systems conform to technical and data standards defined  by the architecture. Such plans, or road maps, are often developed as  part of an enterprise architecture.", "Investment strategy. To ensure the migration is successfully  implemented, it is important to know what funds are available\u2014for the  initial phases of migration, for interoperability testing, and for transition  to the target architecture. It is important as well to know what  constraints or gaps need to be addressed. By achieving better visibility  over resources, DOD can take steps needed to analyze its migration  investment as well as funding alternatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Is Developing an Architecture", "paragraphs": ["DOD is in the process of developing an architecture for DCGS.

The architecture will also include a high-level concept of operations.", "The architecture will to also reflect DOD\u2019s future plans to develop a  web-based intelligence information network. This network would  substantially change how intelligence information is collected and analyzed  and could therefore substantially change DOD\u2019s requirements for DCGS.  Currently, ground-surface-based systems process intelligence data and then  disseminate processed data to select users. Under the new approach,  unprocessed data would be posted on a Web-based network; leaving a  larger range of users to decide which data they want to process and use.  DOD has started implementing its plans for this new network but does not  envision fully implementing it until 2010-2015.", "In addition, DOD has created a DCGS Council comprised of integrated  product teams to oversee the migration. A team exists for each type of  intelligence (imagery, signals, measurement, and signature); test and  evaluation; and infrastructure and working groups to study specific issues.", "In tandem with the architecture, DOD has also issued a capstone  requirements document for the migration effort. This document references  top-level requirements and standards, such as the Joint Technical  Architecture with which all systems must comply. DOD is also developing  an overarching test plan called the Capstone Test and Evaluation Master  Plan, which will define standards, test processes, test resources, and  responsibilities of the services for demonstrating that the systems can  work together and an operational concept for processing intelligence  information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Planning Gaps Raise Risks", "paragraphs": ["An enterprise architecture and overarching test plan should help ensure  that the ground-surface-based processing systems selected for migration  will be interoperable and that they will help to achieve DOD\u2019s broader goals  for its intelligence operations. But there are gaps in DOD\u2019s planning that  raise risks that the migration will not be adequately funded and managed.", "First, the planning process itself has been slower than DOD officials  anticipated. By the time DOD expects to complete its architecture and  testing plan, it will have been proceeding with its migration initiative for  4 years. This delay has hampered DOD\u2019s ability to ensure  interoperability in the systems now being developed and deployed.", "Second, DOD still lacks a detailed migration plan that identifies which  systems will be retained for migration; which will be phased out; when  systems will be modified and integrated into the target system; how the  transition will take place\u2014how efforts will be prioritized; and how  progress in implementing the migration plan and architecture will be  enforced and tracked. Until DOD puts this in place, it will lack a  mechanism to drive its migration. Moreover, the DCGS Council will lack  a specific plan and tools for executing its oversight.", "Third, DOD has not yet developed an integrated investment strategy for  its migration effort that would contemplate what resources are available  for acquisitions, modifications, and interoperability testing and how  gaps in those resources could be addressed. More fundamentally, DOD  still lacks visibility over spending on its intelligence systems since  spending is spread among the budgets of DOD\u2019s services and  components. As a result, DOD does not fully know what has already  been spent on the migration effort, nor does it have a means for making  sure the investments the services make in their intelligence systems  support its overall goals; and if not, what other options can be employed  to make sure spending is on target.", "DOD officials agreed that both a migration plan and investment strategy  were needed but said they were concentrating first on completing the  architecture, test plan, and the operational concept."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Process for Certifying Intelligence Systems As Interoperable Is Not Working Effectively", "paragraphs": ["DOD has a process in place to test and certify that systems are  interoperable, but it is not working effectively for ground-surface-based  intelligence processing systems.

DOD relies on the Joint  Interoperability Test Command (JITC, part of the Defense Information  Systems Agency) to certify systems. In conducting this certification, JITC  assesses whether systems can interoperate without degrading other  systems or networks or being degraded by them; the ability of systems to  exchange information; the ability of systems to interoperate in joint  environments without the use of unacceptable workaround procedures or  special technical interfaces; and the ability of systems to interoperate while  maintaining system confidentiality and integrity. In doing so, JITC reviews  testing already conducted as well as assessments prepared by independent  testing organizations. It may also conduct some of its own testing. The  results are then submitted to the Joint Staff, who validate the system\u2019s  certification. Systems are generally certified for 3 years\u2014after which they  must be re-certified.", "The certification is funded by the system owner\u2014whether it is a service or  DOD agency. The cost depends on the size and complexity of a system and  generally requires 10 percent of funding designated for testing and  evaluation. Generally, certification costs are small relative to the total cost  of a system. The cost to certify the Army\u2019s $95 million Common Ground  Station, for example, was $388,000.", "To help enforce the certification process, DOD asked 4 key officials (the  Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics; the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications,  and Intelligence; the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation; and the  Director, Joint Staff) in December 2000 to periodically review systems and  to place those with interoperability deficiencies on a \u201cwatch list.\u201d This  designation would trigger a series of progress reviews and updates by the  program manager, the responsible testing organization, and JITC, until the  system is taken off the list.
