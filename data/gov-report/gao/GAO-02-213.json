In fiscal year 1999, FTA established a competitive selection process involving the evaluation of grant applications against published criteria, as well as the scoring and ranking of applications against each other on the basis of those evaluations. FTA selected and funded the highest ranked projects. FTA selects program grantees on an annual basis and makes no commitment for funding for more than 1 year.

The Chesapeake Bay Agency on Aging and the Richmond (VA) Transit Authority stated that these service disruptions caused a loss of credibility with their clientele and cost some passengers their jobs.

This language designated specific dollar amounts for grants to states, localities, and organizations.

It directs the Secretary to conduct a national solicitation for grant applications, and it requires that grantees be selected on a competitive basis. Although the statute does not define the phrase \u201ccompetitive basis,\u201d it does identify several factors for the Secretary to consider in awarding grants, including the percentage of welfare recipients in the population of the area to be served, the need for additional services, and the degree of coordination with existing transportation service providers. In implementing TEA-21, FTA combined the statutory factors into the four essential elements referenced in its March 2000 request for grant applications and assigned points to each, on the basis of relative importance. In December 2000, we concluded that FTA\u2019s program guidance and practices of evaluating and comparing program applicants were appropriate for helping to ensure that grantees would be competitively selected on a consistent basis.", "The fiscal year 2000 and 2001 appropriations acts for the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies made specified amounts available for the award of Job Access grants under section 3037. Although the conference reports accompanying those acts contained language designating entities for project funding, the designations were not carried over into the appropriations acts. It is well established that conference report language and other legislative history, indicating how funds should be spent, do not impose legally binding requirements; nor does legislative history supersede or repeal existing statutory requirements. Accordingly, FTA had no authority to use a noncompetitive process for the selection of Job Access grantees, including those designated in the conference reports.", "In response to our inquiries concerning FTA\u2019s legal justification for its practices in fiscal years 2000 and 2001, FTA officials emphasized that\u2014 notwithstanding the designations in the conference reports\u2014only those applications meeting the eligibility criteria in section 3037 were awarded grants and that projects of questionable eligibility were specifically reviewed by the Office of Chief Counsel to ensure eligibility. FTA officials also said that the selection of Job Access projects reflected the requirement of section 3037 to allocate 60 percent of the available funds to large urban areas, 20 percent to mid-sized urban areas, and 20 percent to rural areas. According to Job Access program officials, including the Coordinator, FTA determined how many of the projects from entities identified in the conference reports fell into each funding category. FTA set aside funds for these projects in anticipation of awarding them grants. FTA then awarded grants with the remaining funds in each funding category to projects selected under the competitive process. FTA acknowledged that it did not undertake any effort to compare applications from entities identified in the conference reports to other applications for Job Access funds.

According to DOT officials, FTA solicited applications through a broad agency announcement published in the Federal Register, and letters addressed to entities identified in appropriations report language. DOT agrees that report language and other legislative history indicating how funds should be spent do not impose legally binding requirements, nor supersede or repeal statutory requirements. However, it also emphasizes that the statutory language does not define the term \u201ccompetitive selection,\u201d leaving that to agency discretion. According to DOT officials, the agency employed separate competitive selection processes in fiscal years 2000 and 2001 for evaluating applications received in response to the different solicitation methods. DOT indicated that both pools of applicants were required to meet all statutory criteria for award. DOT maintains that both selection methods were competitive and represent a reasonable exercise of agency discretion in complying with applicable statutory requirements for nationwide solicitation and competitive selection, while taking into account congressional views, as expressed in appropriations report language.", "DOT also stated that the draft report could benefit by more fully discussing the results of GAO\u2019s survey. For example, DOT noted that 85 percent (132 of 155 respondents) were satisfied with the program, while 12 percent (19 of 155) had no opinion, and only 3 percent (4 of 155) were dissatisfied. DOT maintains that this high level of satisfaction among its partners clearly demonstrates FTA\u2019s effective implementation of this very important program.", "We agree that Congress left the determination of exactly how to implement the requirement of TEA-21 to select grantees \u201con a competitive basis\u201d to FTA\u2019s discretion. However, we do not agree that FTA employed competitive methods in selecting all Job Access grantees during this period or that the two-track approach it adopted in implementing the Job Access program represented a reasonable exercise of agency discretion. As noted in this report, the competitive selection of grantees necessarily requires a comparison of applications for available funding against each other, rather than a mere determination that they meet the criteria for award. Although DOT asserted that FTA used a competitive selection process for entities identified in the conference reports accompanying the fiscal year 2000 and 2001 appropriations acts, DOT officials also stated that FTA did not compare applications from entities designated in these conference reports, either to each other or to applications from entities that were not so designated. Applications from entities designated in the conference reports were neither scored nor ranked but were selected on the basis of the conference report language. FTA\u2019s public notices support this characterization of FTA\u2019s approach. These notices did not describe FTA\u2019s process for those entities identified in the conference reports as \u201ccompetitive\u201d; rather, they distinguished between funds \u201creserved for specific projects\u201d and funds \u201cavailable for competitive award.\u201d Importantly, FTA\u2019s description of its Job Access formula proposal clearly stated with reference to the fiscal year 2000 and 2001 conference reports that \u201cearmarking of funds does not allow for projects to emerge from a competitive process.\u201d Therefore, DOT has not provided us with any basis to agree with its view that projects for entities identified in conference reports were competitively selected or to change our recommendation.", "Regarding DOT\u2019s comments concerning the results of our survey of fiscal year 1999 Job Access grantees, we have incorporated additional information about the survey in our report.

In addition, in proposing the allocation of Job Access funds by formula, FTA stated that the funding designations resulted in many highly worthy applicants not receiving funding and pointed out that such designations did not allow some projects to emerge successfully from a competitive process.

This report examines (1) how DOT implemented the Job Access program in fiscal years 2000 and 2001, including its response to funding designations in conference reports in those fiscal years; (2) the impact on the program of DOT\u2019s response to the funding designations; and (3) whether the manner in which DOT interpreted and applied the conference report funding designations in fiscal years 2000 and 2001 was consistent with applicable statutory requirements.", "To describe FTA\u2019s continued implementation of the Job Access program in fiscal years 2000 and 2001, we obtained and analyzed documents and interviewed FTA officials about the agency\u2019s solicitation, selection, and award procedures and how these were implemented. We also asked agency management to explain any changes made in the implementation of the program for projects selected in fiscal years 2000 and 2001.", "We examined the consequences of changes in the manner in which FTA selected Job Access proposals by obtaining and analyzing FTA\u2019s records regarding projects selected for award during fiscal years 1999 through 2001, including the operating status of the associated projects during those years and those projects that were withdrawn. In addition, we conducted a mail survey of the fiscal year 1999 grantees. (See app. III for the questionnaire and the results.) FTA identified 186 Job Access projects for fiscal year 1999. We mailed questionnaires to each of these grantees and received responses from 155 of them\u2014a response rate of 83 percent as of September 30, 2001.", "To examine the legality of FTA\u2019s approach to the solicitation and selection of grantees in fiscal years 2000 and 2001, we reviewed TEA-21, the appropriations acts for fiscal years 2000 and 2001, and applicable case law. We also obtained the views of cognizant agency officials. Specifically, we asked FTA about its legal justification for its approach to implementing the Job Access program regarding entities identified in the conference reports accompanying recent DOT appropriations acts.
