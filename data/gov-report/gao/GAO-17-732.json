GAO identified four primary methods to estimate costs, each with limitations: 1) measuring effects on markets, 2) using jury awards, 3) surveying the public for its willingness to pay to reduce crime, and 4) calculating individual categories of cost to develop a total cost. Experts stated that current methodologies are inadequate to fully estimate costs and that they face numerous challenges in developing estimates, such as the value of intangible costs of crime. As a result, research has produced widely varying and inconsistent estimates on the costs of crime.", "Experts provided five broad areas they believe warrant further study to improve understanding of the costs of crime: 1) costs of crimes not reported to law enforcement agencies, 2) costs of punishment and incarceration, 3) costs of recidivism, 4) costs of potential bias in the administration of justice, and 5) uncertainty of cost estimates.

However, in addition to the costs of the criminal justice system, there are  many other financial and nonfinancial effects of crime that researchers  consider when estimating the total cost of crime in the United States.  These can include costs such as the replacement of damaged property,  changes in people\u2019s behavior to avoid crime, and the medical care to treat  victims\u2019 injuries. Research has estimated varying annual costs of crime,  including totals of $690 billion, $1.57 trillion, and $3.41 trillion. While  such a range indicates that researchers use various methods and  information to estimate crime costs, the results all underscore the  magnitude of crime\u2019s effect on society.", "Research indicates that to best understand the cost of crime, estimates  should consider both the financial and non-monetary effects of crime\u2014 such as the impact on quality of life, increasing fear in a community, or  the indirect effects such as people\u2019s change in behavior in response to  crime. Some researchers have concluded that crime\u2019s most costly factors  stem from these less tangible effects. For example, an estimate published  in 1996 on the cost of property loss and damage resulting from arson was  almost $35,000 per incident. However, once researchers considered the  arson victim\u2019s injuries and lost quality of life in the aftermath of an  incident, the average cost per incident increased to over $300,000, with  intangible costs accounting for about 75 percent of the total.", "You asked us to examine issues related to estimating the costs of crime  committed in the United States.

However, not all experts who responded to the  survey chose to answer all questions. We also reviewed literature from  academic experts, think tanks, and research identified by government  agencies. We analyzed 27 articles representing different analytical  perspectives, such as the types of crime studied, various methods and  assumptions considered, and the bearers of costs resulting from crime  and its effects in the community. Our review focused exclusively on costs  of crime committed in the United States or borne by victims in the United  States. We limited the scope of our work by looking at studies published  since 1996, which is when a key study that is frequently cited by other  studies was published. To select the list of articles, we obtained input  from federal officials and our group of experts, and independently  assessed the articles to ensure the studies used sound and reliable  methods. While we did not conduct a comprehensive study of the costs of  crime, we believe that the input from our identified experts and studies is  sufficient to provide an overview and identify general challenges,  limitations, and benefits of the topics and general methods used when  estimating the cost of crime.", "We supplemented our review of expert opinion and cost of crime literature  with interviews of DOJ officials.

While cost of crime estimates may focus on serious \u201cstreet crimes,\u201d a  broader cost of crime measure can include any illegal activities with a  criminal sanction or penalty. Such crimes include felonies and  misdemeanors, and may include both reported and unreported criminal  activity. Definitions of crime may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

When estimating costs of crime, researchers consider the effects that  occur to individuals, households, communities, and to local and state  governments, and the federal government. Researchers have developed  a variety of terms to characterize the numerous effects on costs of crime.  While not all researchers use the same terminology to analyze costs,  studies generally consider the following elements:", "Tangible costs: Tangible costs are those where the effect can be  valued by observing product or service transactions that arise in  response to or in anticipation of criminal activity. Such costs include  the value of damaged property, medical care to treat injuries, and  costs to install alarm systems to avoid crime.", "Intangible costs: Intangible costs result from negative effects of crime,  but the effects do not have directly observed market values. Such  costs from crime include lost quality of life as a result of victimization,  fear in the community, or avoidance behaviors to reduce the likelihood  of being victimized.", "Timing of the cost in relation to the crime: While the most recognized  costs of crime are those that occur as a direct consequence of the  crime, such as the cost to recover from crime-related injuries,  researchers consider secondary consequences of crime as well. Such  consequences may occur before or after a particular crime occurs.  For example, some costs of crime occur in anticipation of crime, for  instance to avoid victimization. Other costs occur as a response to  crime, such as the cost of judicial proceedings or the costs to  incarcerate offenders.", "Who bears the cost: Crime costs can be borne by individuals, such as  the victim or the victim\u2019s family, employers or businesses, and broader  society, such as when public property is destroyed. Societal costs can  also take the form of taxpayer funds for crime prevention or criminal  justice system expenses.

The FBI releases  national and subnational crime statistics from the UCR Program in  annual publications titled Crime in the United States. To collect data  for the UCR Program, the FBI uses two systems: the traditional  Summary Reporting System (SRS) and the newer National Incident- Based Reporting System (NIBRS). Law enforcement agencies that  use the SRS provide data on reported crime offenses in the 10 crime  categories. Law enforcement agencies opting to use the NIBRS can  provide greater detail on a wider array of reported offenses than they  can through the SRS, while still having the capability to report  offenses in the 10 crime categories. According to the FBI, the UCR  Program covers almost 98 percent of the American population.", "National Crime Victimization Survey  (NCVS)  The NCVS was first administered in 1973.  The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS)  manages the survey questions in the NCVS  and publishes the findings from the survey. In  the most recent year, about 95,800  households and 163,900 persons 12 or older  participated.  Once selected, households  remain in the sample for 3 years, and eligible  persons in these households are interviewed  every 6 months either in-person or over the  phone for a total of seven interviews. BJS  works in concert with the Bureau of the  Census, which is the agency that administers  the survey. BJS designed the survey to  answer questions about the effectiveness of  policing and law enforcement. It has been the  basis for better understanding criminal  victimization in the United States.   Over the years, NCVS has grown in its scope  to collect information on different forms of  victimization. For instance, in response to the  Crime Victims with Disabilities Awareness Act,  Pub. L. No. 105-301, 112 Stat. 2838 (1998),  the NCVS began producing measures of the  nature of crimes against individuals with  developmental disabilities.

To collect survey information,  the BJS developed a series of questions for interviewers to ask of  household members ages 12 and above. While varying definitions of  certain crimes may affect how law enforcement agencies report them  in the UCR Program, the NCVS avoids using crime-type labels and  legalistic language as much as possible. Instead, survey respondents  describe the contextual factors of an incident. BJS analysts use these  contextual factors to estimate national crime victimization rates.  Further, BJS designed the NCVS to be able to capture multiple  elements of a crime, instead of information on the most severe  offense. Whereas, based on the UCR SRS hierarchical coding rules,  law enforcement agencies will only report a rape that occurred during  a burglary as an incidence of rape in the SRS. However, the NCVS  can identify multiple offenses that occur during one incident. Thus, the  NCVS is less likely to underestimate crime rates for certain crime only  because a crime occurred in conjunction with a more severe crime.

This approach  compares property values or wages across safer and less safe  environments to determine how people implicitly value risk of injury or  victimization to determine the effect crime has on market prices.", "Benefits: Research studies we reviewed and the experts we  surveyed noted that an advantage of this approach is that by  looking at what the public has actually paid for real estate property  or received in wages for riskier job occupations, the study\u2019s results  reflect market-based decisions. As a result, estimated costs  correspond to people\u2019s actual behaviors rather than how they may  respond to a hypothetical scenario in a survey.", "Limitations: Critics observed that the differences in real estate  values may reflect factors other than crime such as neighborhood  socioeconomic status or the quality of schools, among others. In  addition, they note that using this method may not estimate costs  for crimes where the crime is widespread or conducted in virtual  space, such as online fraud. Further, one study noted that those  who select high-risk occupations may not be representative of the  average individual and thus may have selected the occupation  based on factors other than the risk of injury or death. Therefore,  wages for these occupations may not reflect the value the general  population places on injury or death. Also, one expert explained  that this approach assumes that people have full information  about crime risks in different neighborhoods or the risks  associated with different occupations and have the ability to move  or change jobs given those risks.", "Using jury awards to estimate victimization costs. This approach  uses jury awards in civil personal injury cases to derive a monetary  value of intangible harms such as pain, suffering, and lost quality of  life as a result of crime victimization.", "Benefits: According to literature and experts, an advantage of  this approach is that jury awards represent actual estimates of  value to victims for specific crimes rather than responses to  hypothetical scenarios.", "Limitations: Critics have cautioned that this approach may be  unreliable because it is not clear that jury awards are  consistent, unbiased across cases, or are representative of the  damages incurred for every related crime. Further, they noted  that jury awards are per victim and not necessarily per  victimization because victims may suffer multiple crimes or a  repetition of the same crime. As a result, the awarded amount  may not reflect a cost for one criminal act. Critics also  mentioned that estimates using jury awards may include  amounts where the crime committed was accidental or not  intentional, even though the events may result in similar  physical harms as a premeditated or intentional act\u2014for  instance a broken bone. However, as one study noted,  individuals suffering harm from certain crimes may experience  more psychological trauma from an intentional act than from  an unpremeditated crime.", "Using surveys to estimate what the public is willing to pay to  reduce crime. This approach uses surveys to estimate the monetary  value that respondents are willing to pay to achieve or avoid a certain  outcome such as reducing neighborhood crime or avoiding death or  disability. For example, a 2004 study asked survey respondents how  much they would be willing to pay to reduce violent crimes in their  community and found that households would pay an additional $100  to $150 per year to reduce specific violent crimes\u2014such as assault or  armed robbery\u2014by 10 percent.", "Benefits: Studies and experts believe that this approach captures  both tangible and intangible costs and estimates a total cost of a  specific crime without the concern of overlapping cost categories  (for instance, the possible overlap between pain and suffering  costs and the costs related to psychological treatment after a  crime). In addition, 6 of 14 experts who provided comment on this  approach said it may provide accurate estimates under certain  conditions when researchers design the survey carefully. Further,  studies we reviewed consider this method to be closer to  economic conditions because respondents are weighing their  responses as they consider their own resources.", "Limitations: Critics of the method have stated that the approach  may overestimate the cost of crime by looking at the self-reported,  hypothetical preferences of the respondents rather than the  actual, observable behavior where individuals must weigh their  choices among competing demands and limited resources. In  addition, according to some studies and experts, survey  respondents\u2019 perception of the risk of crime in their neighborhood  may not align with the actual risk. As such, the amounts they are  willing to pay to reduce crime may be higher than they would be if  the respondents had a better understanding of the actual risk.  Finally, the studies note that individuals\u2019 willingness to pay to  reduce crime may vary depending on respondents\u2019 race or income  level. Specifically, one 2004 study found that the willingness to  pay was lower for low-income respondents, although they are at a  higher risk of becoming a crime victim. The study concluded that  the ability to pay and other factors outweighed fear of crime risk.", "Calculating categories of costs separately to develop a total  cost. This approach identifies the cost categories associated with one  or multiple crimes\u2014such as medical costs or criminal justice costs\u2014 and estimates a monetary value for the individual cost categories to  develop a total estimate, either by crime or for all crime. For  example, researchers using this approach may estimate the cost of  assault by identifying the various harms attributed to assault, such as  physical injuries resulting from assaults. They then obtain data to  measure the cost of identified harms, such as medical administrative  data to estimate costs for treating injuries from an assault, or law  enforcement agencies\u2019 caseload information to estimate the costs for  police to respond to and investigate assaults.", "Benefits: Experts and studies stated that this approach helps develop  estimates for a variety of specific cost components, and allows  researchers to estimate costs by crime as well as determine the total  costs of crime. For example, of the 12 experts we surveyed who  provided their opinion on the use of this method, 7 stated that it  provides transparency and specificity in the types of costs included in  the estimates.", "Limitations: Critics have stated that this approach may provide a  limited view of the costs of crime and may exclude intangible costs  such as fear of crime. Further, of the 12 experts we surveyed who  provided comment on the use of this approach, 4 said its ability to  provide accurate and reliable estimates depend on certain conditions,  such as clarity on what costs are and are not included.", "Experts we surveyed indicated that there are longstanding divisions in the  research community on how to approach estimating the cost of crime, in  part because of the limitations associated with each method. For  instance, 11 of the 14 experts we surveyed who commented on the  reliability of at least one of the four approaches said that they had serious  concerns with the reliability of one or more approaches to estimate costs.

FBI stated  that they plan to phase out SRS and  make NIBRS the primary system for  reporting crime offenses by 2021.", "In a recent report on modernizing crime statistics, the National Academies  identified multiple limitations in the UCR Program and the NCVS. For  example, the UCR Program and the NCVS focus on a more traditional  conception of crime, and the definitions of crime used for collecting data  have changed little since the programs were first established. For  instance, while the National Academies report stated that the programs  provide detailed information on \u201cstreet crimes\u201d \u2013 violent and property  crime categories, they do not provide the same extent of information on  other concepts of crime, such as white-collar or cyber-related crimes. The  National Academies reported that the programs\u2019 focus on street crime has  limited the public\u2019s perception of what constitutes a crime. Since, the UCR  Program and the NCVS do not regularly report estimates on the  magnitude of cybercrime, for instance, news media and policy makers  may not consider cybercrime as concerning of a problem as street crime.  However, our review of the research indicated that other crimes like  cybercrime may occur frequently and could pose significant societal  costs, but systematic information on these types of crimes is not  available.", "The National Academies report and experts we surveyed also identified  limitations about how the UCR Program and the NCVS collect and report  on crime statistics that may affect cost of crime estimates. For instance,  the National Academies reported that while the UCR Program has a high  overall participation rate from law enforcement agencies, individual  agencies may not always provide responses for some crime types, such  as arson, which makes estimates for these crimes less reliable. Experts  we surveyed also identified some concern with the reliability of some  UCR crime information.", "Further, the National Academies reported that while FBI\u2019s UCR NIBRS  program provides greater detail on crime incidence, law enforcement  agencies have been slow to adopt the program\u2019s standards. According to  the FBI, only 28 percent of the total crimes reported in the UCR are from  agencies using NIBRS standards. Therefore, researchers cannot use  NIBRS data to estimate the magnitude of crime nationwide without using  supplemental data sets. Specifically, the two cost of crime experts we  surveyed who discussed NIBRS challenges stated that because NIBRS is  not nationally generalizable, it has limited use for estimating costs.", "Regarding the NCVS, the National Academies report and experts we  surveyed stated that while the NCVS methodology provides national  statistics, it has limited use when researchers want to develop state-level  or other subnational cost estimates. This is because the NCVS is  designed to provide national-level estimates, and is best suited for such  analysis. However, cost of crime researchers value crime statistics that  can provide more precise estimates of crime for studying state or other  subnational costs.", "Despite the challenges associated with determining the magnitude of  crime, researchers have developed methods to use federal crime data in  some cost of crime estimates. Specifically, all nine experts we surveyed  who provided a response stated that the cost of crime literature has  developed methods for addressing and mitigating concerns when using  the crime data. Based on information from these experts and our review  of the cost of crime literature, we identified three general approaches to  address limitations with crime data:", "Using multiple datasets: In our analysis of crime estimates, we  found examples of researchers using multiple data sources to identify  crime rate and severity. For instance, in one estimate on career  criminal costs, a researcher conducted offender surveys and  supplemented information from criminals\u2019 rap sheets to estimate all  crimes committed for each offender in the study. In another example  that estimated the cost of intimate partner violence, researchers used  information from the National Violence Against Woman Survey, UCR  information, and U.S. Census population data to estimate crime  rates.", "Employing various methodological techniques: Estimates may  use different techniques to overcome challenges in the magnitude of  crime. For instance, one expert we surveyed multiplied victimization  rates estimated using victim surveys to fill perceived gaps in police- reported crime incidence data. Another study estimated fatal crimes  by reviewing national vital statistics instead of UCR homicide  information. In addition, two experts we surveyed stated that some  methodological approaches may not require crime magnitude data to  generate estimates. For example, one expert stated that many studies  that use surveys to estimate the public\u2019s willingness to pay to reduce  crime develop their estimates on the basis of the public\u2019s perception  of crime and not the actual magnitude of crime. For instance,  researchers who conduct some public surveys may not inform the  respondents about the actual crime rates. However, they ask  respondents what they are willing to pay for a 10 percent decrease in  crime and rely on the individual respondents to infer what the  magnitude of crime may be.", "Communicating assumptions: Research articles regularly  communicate data limitations about the approach and assumptions  they used in the study. One expert we surveyed indicated that  researchers must clearly communicate their assumptions when  developing estimates. Doing so makes it easier for other researchers  to test these assumptions and refine their methods in future cost  estimates. For instance, one article studying juvenile crime costs in  urban areas reported that, in order to use a specific dataset to  estimate crime among children ages 7 to 17, researchers assumed  that the severity of assaults committed by juveniles is equal to the  average severity of assaults in general, including assaults committed  by adults. However, the authors point out evidence that the severity  for younger children may be more limited compared to other age  groups and adults. By providing the assumptions underlying cost of  crime estimates, future researchers can test accuracy of the estimates  and determine how limitations may be overcome."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges Monetizing Costs", "paragraphs": ["We identified various challenges with estimating the costs of the effects of  crime. Specifically, 5 of 16 experts we surveyed argued and the research  we reviewed confirmed that the lack of reliable data is a key issue that  challenges researchers\u2019 ability to monetize costs. For instance, our review  found that often researchers focused on certain costs because data were  available to estimate them. However, the studies often stated that the  estimated monetized value excluded certain crimes or certain types of  costs because researchers believed they could not estimate such costs  reliably. As a result, much of the research noted that the identified costs  were likely underestimates of the total monetized value of crime.", "Distinction Between Tangible and  Intangible Costs of Crime  Tangible costs: A measure of the negative  effect of crime where the amount represents a  good or service with an existing market value.  Examples of tangible costs include medical  treatment from injuries, the value of replacing  damaged or stolen property, or lost wages  because of missed workdays.  Intangible costs: A measure of the negative  effect of crime for which there is no existing  market to buy or trade such effects. Examples  of intangible costs include pain and suffering,  lost quality of life, and avoiding otherwise  enjoyable activities or places.", "Based on both our review of the literature and information provided by  experts, estimating the intangible costs of crime is conceptually more  difficult than estimating the tangible costs. For instance, 8 of 15 experts  we surveyed agreed that estimates of tangible costs are more accurate  and reliable compared to intangible costs. However, a common concern  in our review of cost estimate studies was that research must consider  the intangible costs of crime because they are likely much greater than  the tangible costs.", "While researchers believed that estimating intangible costs is important,  we found that the research community is divided about which methods to  use and whether identified methods may accurately estimate intangible  costs. For example, we found in our literature review objections to using  jury awards altogether because awards from juries did not adequately  conform to market rules. For instance, jury awards did not consider  scarcity of resources like a common market would. Researchers have  also criticized using jury awards because awards are likely not  determined when the crime occurred or may have been awarded to have  a punitive effect rather than just to compensate victims. Further, of the 13  experts surveyed who provided their opinion on the use of this method, 8  stated that jury awards are not generalizable and may be biased based  on factors that are not related to the crime\u2014for instance, the race of the  victim or defendant, or the expertise of the defense or prosecution. They  said that such bias should be excluded when estimating the cost of a  victim\u2019s pain and suffering.", "Our literature review found that certain tangible costs can be a challenge  to estimate because of the lack of sufficiently reliable data. For example,  one study found that there is limited information about victims\u2019 out-of- pocket expenses resulting from crime they experienced. Specifically, the  study found that the NCVS was the primary source of information for  researchers to estimate victims\u2019 out-of-pocket expenses. However, the  NCVS only collects information on victim expenses incurred over the  course of the 6 months prior to the time being surveyed. As a result,  NCVS reports would likely only include short-term expenses and would  not capture costs such as long-term mental health care or expenses  incurred to avoid further victimization, which could be substantial. Thus,  researchers would need to identify additional sources of information to  calculate longer term out-of-pocket expenses for victims. suggested that there is no national  database that collects information on  psychological harm. In addition, while the  National Crime Victimization Survey  collects medical cost information for  physical injuries, it does not cover mental  health treatment.", "Excluding certain affected populations.", "Studies may rely on non-representative  sampling and self-reported information  that may affect the reliability of the  estimate. For example, one 2003 study  we reviewed focused only on the cost of  intimate partner violence to women,  because the study determined such data  for the cost to men was unreliable.  Therefore, the total costs were likely an  underestimate.", "To mitigate the various challenges and limitations with certain methods  and data sources, researchers conduct numerous steps and use differing  approaches to estimate difficult costs, such as psychological injury (see  text box). As researchers increase steps and assumptions in their  methodologies, they add more complexity and wider levels of uncertainty.  As a result of this uncertainty, researchers may develop cost estimates  with wide ranges that are highly sensitive to changes in those  assumptions. For example, one study estimated the annual cost of  premature death from methamphetamine usage at about $4.9 billion.  However, the research indicates that the costs could be between $876  million and $14.3 billion when considering uncertainties with each  assumption in the estimate. In other words, while the study found the cost  of premature death from methamphetamine usage was $4.9 billion, the  real cost could be about 20 percent of this amount, or it could be almost 3  times larger than estimated. See figure 2 below."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Disagreement on How to Address Challenges Estimating the Costs of Crime Leads to Varying Estimates of Costs", "paragraphs": ["Researchers have disagreed on the most appropriate ways to estimate  costs because, as previously stated, some costs are difficult to monetize.  Such disagreement and the use of extensively different sets of  methodologies and assumptions result in widely ranging estimates on  costs. Further, researchers include different types of costs in their  estimates. For example in figure 3, we selected seven studies from our  literature review that estimated costs related to fatal crime. Each study  has a different purpose and employs differing methods, data, and  assumption. Hence, estimates for fatal crimes ranged from about  $580,000 to about $19.4 million in six of the articles, either per  victimization or per crime conducted by a career criminal. In addition, the  seventh study focused on a single cost category, specifically the mental  health costs to treat affected loved ones or witnesses of murder.", "Experts GAO surveyed generally agreed that it is difficult to measure the  cost of crime precisely. However, in response to our findings on the  differing estimates on the costs of crime, two experts noted that while cost  of crime estimates vary widely, the range in estimates does not  necessarily indicate that the studies are either flawed or unreliable for  their purposes or for policymaking. For instance, estimates on the cost  per homicide vary, as noted above. However, the estimated costs for  homicide generally confirm that cost per crime is in the millions of dollars,  even when researchers use unrelated methodologies to develop their  estimates. Additionally, one expert noted that despite using different  methods to estimate the costs of crime, he believes there is general  agreement about which crimes cost more based on their severity\u2014that is  crimes like murder, aggravated assault, and rape, are generally more  expensive than crimes like burglary and vehicle theft. Moreover, another  expert stated that estimates of certain costs of crime such as intangible  costs are subjective in nature. One expert also indicated that, although  cost estimates can vary widely, they can still be useful for researchers  and other users, as long as the estimates carefully describe what the  costs represent\u2014including the units of analysis\u2014and users are mindful of  the limitations associated with the methodologies and assumptions used  to develop the estimates."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Experts Identified Approaches that Could Improve the Understanding of the Cost of Crime and Its Use in Policy Discussions", "paragraphs": ["Experts we surveyed for this report provided five broad topic areas that  may help improve the understanding of the cost of crime. They stated that  there is growing interest in researching additional topics, such as the  costs of incarceration. Further, experts noted that researchers could  refine their estimates by combining different methodological approaches.  Experts also stated that researchers and policymakers should avoid  viewing the cost of crime in isolation from specific policy goals or  scenarios. Rather, experts stated that researchers and policymakers  should view the cost of crime under different policy scenarios to help  policymakers determine how to achieve the desired outcomes and  efficiently use limited resources."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Experts Identified Additional Topics and Methods that Cost of Crime Researchers Should Explore", "paragraphs": ["As part of our survey, we asked all 17 experts to independently identify  topics of interest that they believed needed additional research or  methods to improve estimates of the cost of crime. The experts we  surveyed have expertise in a range of disciplines and fields of study and,  as such, volunteered topics of interest based on their own unique  perspectives of the cost of crime. We did not try to arrive at a consensus  among the experts.", "These additional topics included the following:  Cost of crimes not traditionally reported in the FBI\u2019s UCR.  According to studies we reviewed, researchers have primarily  studied the costs associated with street crimes reported in the  traditional UCR SRS. One expert noted that the standardized  definition of these crimes across the United States helps improve  the accuracy of the cost estimates for these crimes. However, six  experts we surveyed said that cost of crime research should  expand to study the costs of other crimes not captured in the  traditional UCR system, such as unlawful drug use, regulatory  offenses, cybercrime, and white-collar crime. Three of these  experts said that the challenge estimating the cost of these crimes  is the lack of data on the magnitude of these crimes. For instance,  while one researcher conjectured that white-collar crime could  cost more than all street crime, according to studies we reviewed,  little is known about the cost of white-collar crimes. One study  indicated that while such economic crimes have serious  consequences that far exceed the financial dollar loss, there is  little systematic evidence about the magnitude of these losses.  Further, according to another study we reviewed, criminal activity  has evolved with technological advancements, such as the  widespread use of the Internet. Internet-perpetrated crimes like  credit card theft and cyber attacks on computer infrastructure  present unique challenges that require researchers to develop  different approaches to analyzing the magnitude of these crimes  and estimating their cost. For example, Internet-perpetrated  crimes may require separate counts of offenders, victims, and  financial losses because a few offenders can potentially affect  millions of victims in one coordinated attack, such as when a  security breach occurs and personal information is stolen.", "Cost of punishment and incarceration. Seven experts we  surveyed identified the cost of punishment and incarceration upon  the offender, the offender\u2019s family, and the offender\u2019s children as a  significant cost to society that needs to be better understood.  Experts also identified these costs as a growing area of interest to  researchers. In our review of research studies, we found that  researchers have historically focused on estimated costs that  were a direct consequence of a crime, such as victimization costs  or the amount spent on the corrections system. According to one  of the studies, previous estimates of the cost of incarceration have  only included the cost of administering the corrections systems,  such as how much it costs to run a prison. Only recently have  researchers turned to estimating additional categories of costs  associated with incarceration, including", "Costs to the offender: these include the effects of incarceration  on an offender\u2019s health, employment, and earnings after being  released from prison;", "Costs to the offender\u2019s family: these include the loss of income  due to incarceration and the impact upon the offender\u2019s family  in terms of housing stability and reliance on public assistance;  and", "Costs to the offender\u2019s children: these include the  intergenerational costs such as potential increased criminal  activity and lowered educational attainment for children who  had incarcerated parents.", "According to six experts we surveyed and studies we reviewed,  these spillover costs of incarceration may be substantial, and  ignoring them can lead to underestimating the cost of crime and  the cost of incarceration. Further, these studies and two of the  experts mentioned that policymakers should incorporate the full  cost of incarceration, which includes the cost to offenders and the  offender\u2019s families, while weighing the costs and benefits of  criminal justice policies and alternatives, such as setting prison- sentencing guidelines.", "Defining Recidivism  Recidivism refers to a person\u2019s relapse into  criminal behavior, often after the person  received sanctions or undergoes intervention  for a previous crime, such as imprisonment.  Recidivism is measured by criminal acts that  resulted in rearrest, reconviction, or return to  prison with or without a new sentence during  a three-year period following the prisoner's  release.   Department of Justice studies have found  high rates of recidivism among released  prisoners. For example, one study found that  about two-thirds of released prisoners were  rearrested within 3 years of release. Non- violent offenders were the most likely to be  rearrested.", "Cost of recidivism. According to the research we reviewed on  the cost of recidivating offenders, there are few studies available  on the monetary costs of crimes committed by released inmates.  However, other aspects of recidivism are more well known, such  as predictors of recidivism and options to improve the outcomes of  former inmates to reduce recidivism. One expert we surveyed said  it is important to understand the cost of recidivating offenders  within the context of what type of conditions the recidivating  offender was released (e.g., parole supervision or unconditional  release) to help evaluate the effectiveness of interventions.  Another expert said that estimating recidivism costs is important to  help measure the effect that different interventions may have on  reintegrating former inmates into society and reducing the costs of  further criminal activity from released inmates. Further, one expert  said it is important to understand common characteristics among  offenders that lead to higher crime costs over the course of their  lives so that society can intervene early and prevent these costs  from occurring. For example, we identified in our literature review  that some repeat offenders, referred to as career criminals, are  responsible for a significant portion of the cost of crime compared  to first-time offenders.", "Cost of potential bias in the administration of justice. Four  experts we surveyed independently identified the need to better  understand the cost of potential racial and socioeconomic bias in  the administration of justice, such as the cost to society of racial  bias in who is incarcerated or comes into contact with the criminal  justice system. Research studies identified by DOJ or experts we  surveyed indicate that there is a significant cost resulting from  such bias. For example, according to these studies, racial  minorities\u2014namely black and Hispanic people\u2014disproportionately  come into contact with police and are incarcerated compared to  non-Hispanic white people. These research studies also stated  that increased criminal justice system contact is associated with  lower levels of political participation, family stability, high school  completion, and future earnings, which can further marginalize  these minority groups.", "Uncertainty of cost of crime estimates. Three experts we  surveyed said that the research community should exert greater  effort into estimating the uncertainty of cost of crime estimates,  such as confidence intervals or standard error estimates.  According to studies we reviewed, most cost of crime estimates  are a single dollar value without a range to show the associated  uncertainty of the estimate. However, both experts and our review  of research point to considerable uncertainty for some cost  estimates, such as the estimated dollar value of a victim\u2019s pain  and suffering. One expert said that a cost of crime estimate  without a range\u2014such as a confidence interval\u2014gives a false  appearance of accuracy.", "The experts we surveyed also described data and methods to improve  estimates of the cost of crime:  Better incorporating existing data in approaches to estimate  costs. Three experts we surveyed pointed out existing available  data sets, such as the National Survey on Drug Use and Health,  which could be used for further research on the costs of drug- related crime and the health costs of incarceration. Two experts  also suggested that researchers could make better use of  government and organizational administrative data, such as  budgets for police departments, prisons, and courts, to estimate  the taxpayer and government costs of crime. These data provide  direct estimates of the costs of crime related to government  spending.", "Improving existing methods. Experts we surveyed identified  ways to improve upon existing methods currently used to estimate  the cost of crime. Specifically, two experts described new survey  approaches such as leveraging federal jury pools as survey  respondents or adding questions to existing national surveys to  better understand the effect of crime and recidivism on offenders\u2019  health and the utilization of the public health systems. Another  expert suggested combining methods and data, such as  combining survey information with government budget data, to  improve the accuracy of cost of crime estimates. Another expert  suggested that researchers should take advantage of studying  states or other jurisdictions as they change criminal justice policies  or when they start new crime reduction or prevention programs in  order to help refine estimates of the cost of crime. For instance,  researchers could measure the effects and associated costs when  a municipality establishes a new prisoner reentry program. Last,  three experts suggested establishing a process, such as a federal  agency initiating a competition or commissioning a broad group of  experts, to develop new ideas and methods for estimating the cost  of crime.", "Establishing an authoritative organization. Two experts we  surveyed suggested establishing an authoritative organization,  such as a standing science advisory committee or an ongoing  panel of experts, to provide guidance and best practices on  estimating the cost of crime or to rethink and improve upon the  current standards for estimating the cost of crime. One of these  experts indicated that this type of authoritative organization may  be able to help resolve the debate, as mentioned previously, over  the validity of methods used to estimate the costs of crime."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Experts Identified the Need to Link Cost of Crime Estimates to Specific Policies", "paragraphs": ["According to experts we surveyed and studies we reviewed, estimating  the cost of crime without a specific policy context may not be especially  helpful. Rather, three experts stressed the importance of using estimates  of the cost of crime within the context of comparing alternative policies to  achieve public policy outcomes, such as comparing the costs and  benefits of releasing inmates to paroled supervision versus unconditional  release to help reintegrate former inmates into society. Of the 12 experts  who discussed the utility of cost of crime research to policymaking, 10  experts believed that comparing the costs or costs and benefits of  criminal justice policies could be useful to policymakers.

Policymakers then used the  evaluation results to inform their decision on which programs to fund in  order to achieve the desired policy outcome, such as reducing juvenile  crime, among others.

Two of our analysts  independently screened these studies and determined whether it met the  scope of our review. A third analyst reconciled any differences in the  screening process. An economist and methodologist on our staff  independently assessed the studies to ensure that the chosen articles  used sound and reliable methods. Based on this process, we chose 27  articles to analyze for our review. While these articles do not represent  the universe of crime cost estimates, we believe they are suitable for our  purposes to provide an overview of the general cost estimation methods;  highlight various limitations, challenges, and disagreements among  researchers; and are a reasonable basis for discussing the general state  of the cost of crime literature.", "To analyze the selected 27 articles, we developed a data collection  instrument. One analyst coded and another analyst reviewed this coding  to ensure consistency. An economist reconciled any differences that the  coders could not address. Articles were coded to identify (1) the various  estimates in the document, (2) the crimes associated with the estimate,  (3) the cost category as identified in the estimate, (4) the bearer of the  cost, (5) the methodologies used generally in the article and for the  separate cost categories, (6) the mentioned challenges and limitations  with the estimates and methods, (7) any challenges and limitations with  other identified estimates and methods, and (8) the mentioned  implications of the research and areas for future study. To analyze the  challenges, limitations, and implications, we created various categories  based on themes in the research using an iterative process. We assigned  each sentence or group of sentences to one of these categories. We  analyzed the information within these themes to obtain insight on broader  concepts identified throughout the literature. To ensure consistency, a  second analyst also assigned themes separately. A third analyst  addressed any disagreements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Identifying the Methods, Benefits, and Limitations to Estimate Costs", "paragraphs": ["To address our first objective on how experts estimate the cost of crime,  we identified key approaches used by reviewing the estimates and  methods present in the cost of crime literature. We then characterized  these methods and presented them to our experts in the survey. We  asked in the questionnaire if there were other methods we should include  in our analysis. Experts generally agreed with our characterization of the  approaches. However, experts did identify less frequently used methods  that we excluded. For example, experts identified a method used by other  countries that focus on physical harm from injury as well as a budget- based method that was consistent with an approach we identified in this  report.", "To identify the benefits, challenges, and limitations associated with each  approach, we surveyed the experts to obtain their opinion. We  supplemented expert responses with examples we identified from our  analysis of the literature research. We focused our discussion of the  benefits, challenges, and limitations to those that experts identified most  frequently.", "During our review, experts and the cost of crime literature highlighted two  federal programs that measure the magnitude of crime, the FBI\u2019s Uniform  Crime Reporting (UCR) Program and the DOJ\u2019s Bureau of Justice  Statistics (BJS) National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). We  reviewed documentation about these data collection efforts and  interviewed FBI and BJS officials to obtain information about their  purposes, and the challenges and limitations associated with the  methodologies each uses. While these programs long preceded the  beginning date for our literature review, we focused on FBI\u2019s and BJS\u2019s  recent efforts to measure crime. For instance, we identified current efforts  that FBI and BJS have taken to encourage fuller participation in the UCR  National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). Further, we asked  BJS and FBI about the study they recently commissioned the National  Academies to conduct on modernizing crime statistics.", "For the purposes of this report, we focused our analysis on the key  characteristics of each data collection effort, rather than the actual data  itself. We performed this work to understand the potential effect, if any, of  federal crime level data\u2019s structure and composition on cost of crime  estimates. We compiled a set of characteristics of the federal data  collection efforts in our review. We then matched these characteristics to  associated expert comments and conclusions drawn in the literature in  order to understand the benefits and challenges of using such data for  cost of crime estimates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Identifying Additional Topics and Methods for Future Research", "paragraphs": ["To respond to the second objective to identify actions experts considered  to improve the understanding and use of costs of crime research, we  analyzed expert responses from our survey.

To do this,  we identified thematic categories in the experts\u2019 responses and assigned  each sentence or group of sentences to one of these categories. We  analyzed the experts\u2019 responses within these themes to obtain insight on  a specific questionnaire question or to obtain information on a broader  crosscutting concept.

Instead, we focused on those opinions that experts mentioned  more frequently. We also did not include suggestions where we had  already discussed specific challenges and limitations. For instance, two  experts mentioned improving federal data collection efforts such as the  UCR Program and the NCVS. However, we dedicated a section of the  report to discuss the concerns using these data in cost of crime estimates  and determined it was unnecessary to highlight these suggestions a  second time.
