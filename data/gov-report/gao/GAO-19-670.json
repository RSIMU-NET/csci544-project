Each year, VHA allocates about two-thirds of funds for general patient care\u2014known as general purpose funds\u2014using two, main allocation models. The first model allocates general purpose funds to each VISN and a second model then allocates these funds to the medical centers that report to each VISN. These models are based on patient workload\u2014that is, the number and type of veterans served and the complexity of care provided. VHA allocates its remaining one-third of funds\u2014known as specific purpose funds\u2014to program offices that manage various, specific programs, such as community care and prosthetics. Program offices, in turn, allocate these funds directly to medical centers using different methodologies, including a workload-based model for community care. GAO found the following weaknesses in VHA's processes for allocating funds:", "VHA's allocation models do not use workload data from the most recently completed fiscal year. For example, the fiscal year 2019 allocation levels determined by the models were based on data from fiscal years 2013 through 2017 but did not include data from fiscal year 2018. The models do not use more recent data because officials believed that doing so would not significantly affect allocations. By not using the most recent data available when it makes final allocations, VHA's allocations may not accurately reflect medical centers' funding needs if they experience workload changes. For example, from fiscal years 2017 through 2018, 34 medical centers had patient workload growth of over 3 percent, and 9 experienced a decline of over 3 percent, which was not reflected in the fiscal year 2019 allocations.", "VISNs are allowed to make adjustments to allocated funding levels determined by the models and must submit written explanations for doing so according to VHA guidance. However, VHA officials did not adequately review adjustments for fiscal year 2019 to ensure adjustments were documented. Specifically, VHA officials did not provide evidence they sought an explanation for adjustments made by two VISNs that provided no written explanation for their adjustments. Furthermore, GAO also found that VHA guidance does not require VISNs to explain how they determined adjustment amounts and why they made them. Without requiring this information, VHA cannot ensure that these adjustments lead to efficient use of funds.", "Once VISNs have made adjustments to allocated funding levels and funds are distributed to VISNs and medical centers, VHA uses multiple mechanisms to monitor the balance of funds. Throughout the year, VHA redistributes funds across the VA health care system to address unfunded needs and surpluses that are identified. However, GAO found that VHA does not adequately monitor the redistribution of allocated funds between VISNs and medical centers. VHA does not require VISNs to provide explanations for redistributions and does not review the amount redistributed. As a result, VHA does not know the extent to which redistributions deviate from workload-based allocations and if VISNs and medical centers are operating efficiently."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making five recommendations including that VHA use workload data from the most recently completed fiscal year to allocate funds; take steps to review adjustments; revise existing guidance to require VISNs to provide information on adjustment amounts and the reasons for doing so; and require VISNs to provide explanations for redistributions of allocated funds between VISNs and medical centers and then review the amounts redistributed.

According to VHA officials, PWW establishes an equitable measure of workload among medical centers  that vary significantly in their geographic location, and types and costs of  services provided. Furthermore, PWW lessens the impact of cost  differences between medical centers, by recognizing the varying costs  and levels of resource intensity associated with providing care for each  patient at each medical center.

Specifically, officials from the Office of Community Care told us  that they monitor the use of community care funds by comparing actual  obligations to planned obligations based on authorized community care.  According to VHA officials, as of February 2019, VHA was in the process  of developing an updated process to monitor the use of community care  funds, which\u2014starting in fiscal year 2019\u2014were obligated at the time of  claim payment rather than when care in the community was authorized.  The other four VHA program offices we reviewed monitor the use of the  funds they manage by generating a monthly or quarterly budget status  report that compares each medical center\u2019s actual obligations against  their planned obligations.

We identified the following instances  in which allocated funds are redistributed:", "VHA officials told us that VHA\u2019s Office of Finance redistributes any  surplus general purpose and specific purpose funds to medical  centers based on VHA priorities and to address needs identified by  VISNs. These officials said that these redistributions typically occur  after the middle of the fiscal year. As of June 2019, according to VHA  officials, one VISN had identified unfunded needs to VHA, but the  VISN was working on addressing the funding needs using its own  internal resources. Officials from another VISN told us that the VISN  anticipated unfunded needs, but had not made a request to VHA for  additional funds as of the end of May 2019.", "VISNs may also exchange funds with other VISNs. For example, if a  VISN has excess medical facilities funds but a shortage of medical  services funds, the VISN may exchange these funds with another  VISN that has excess medical services funds but a shortage of  medical facilities funds. According to VHA officials, VISNs must  inform VHA about these exchanges of funds, but are not required to  provide an explanation and do not require VHA approval for the  exchanges.", "VHA officials told us that VISNs also have the flexibility to redistribute  funds throughout the year from medical centers within their VISN that  are experiencing a funding surplus to ones with unfunded needs.  However, VISNs are not required to inform VHA about these  redistributions and are not required to provide an explanation or get  approval from VHA. For example, officials at one medical center told  us that in recent years, its VISN redistributed an average of $15  million per year above allocated funding levels to this medical center  to address unfunded needs.", "While the redistribution of funds throughout the year gives VHA flexibility  to move funds where they are needed, VHA\u2019s Office of Finance does not  adequately monitor these redistributions. Specifically, VHA\u2019s Office of  Finance does not require VISNs to identify the reasons why they  redistribute funds between VISNs and medical centers, and a VHA Office  of Finance official told us VHA does not examine the amount of funds that  are redistributed. For example, VHA\u2019s Office of Finance could not provide  us the total amount of redistributions that occurred throughout fiscal year  2018. As a result, VHA\u2019s Office of Finance does not know why VISNs  redistributed funds and the extent to which redistributions resulted in a  deviation from VHA\u2019s workload-based allocation levels.

Without requiring VISNs to provide this information  and without requiring VHA to document the results of its review of the  redistributions, VHA cannot ensure that these redistributions align with  VHA\u2019s workload-based allocation of funds.

Accordingly, it is critical that VHA closely  monitor and account for how its funds are allocated to VA medical centers  and redistributed throughout the year to help ensure the most efficient  use of funds. Especially as the number of veterans eligible to receive care  from a community provider potentially expands, it will be important for  VHA to ensure allocated funding levels accurately reflect individual  medical center funding needs.", "However, VHA has opportunities to strengthen its processes for allocating  and monitoring funds distributed across its health care system. VHA could  improve how it allocates funds to its VISNs and medical centers if it were  to use the most up-to-date workload data available as part of its allocation  models. This would allow VHA to account for significant changes in  workload from year-to-year. VHA could also improve how it monitors  VISN adjustments to medical center allocation levels as well as  redistributions that may occur after medical centers receive their  allocations. While these adjustments and redistributions afford flexibility  and may be appropriate in certain circumstances, VHA does not have the  information it needs to monitor these changes to ensure that they are  appropriate and consistent with department goals. Specifically, VHA does  not require VISNs and medical centers to provide information on how they  determined the amount and reasons for adjustments, nor does VHA  require VISNs\u2014in conjunction with medical centers\u2014 to develop and  submit an approach to improve efficiency at medical centers with  declining workload, such as adjusting the level of services offered.  Additionally, VHA does not require VISNs to identify the reasons why they  redistribute funds between VISNs and medical centers after allocations  have been made, and VHA does not document its review of these  redistributions.
