This is an approach  used in some other countries: delegate to the administration the  authority to borrow such sums as necessary to fund implementation of  the laws duly enacted by Congress and the President. Since the laws  that affect federal spending and revenue and so create the need for  debt already require adoption by the Congress, Congress would still  maintain control over the amount of federal borrowing.", "We did not endorse a specific option but we did recommend that  Congress consider alternative approaches that better link decisions about  the debt limit with decisions about spending and revenue at the time  those decisions are made.", "Some of the experts also supported replacing the debt limit with a fiscal  rule imposed on spending and revenue decisions. The federal  government has enacted such fiscal rules in the past. For example, the  Budget Control Act of 2011 enacted limits on discretionary spending,  which are enforced by additional spending cuts if those limits are  breached (known as a sequester). Congress could consider additional  fiscal rules to frame and control the overall results of spending and  revenue decisions. Such rules could limit spending or affect other areas  of the budget such as overall debt or annual deficits.

The foundation of reliable  statistical sampling estimates is a complete, accurate, and valid  population from which to sample. As of October 2016, DOD was still  developing key quality assurance procedures to ensure the completeness  and accuracy of sampled populations. Therefore, DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2016  improper payment estimates, including its estimate for the DFAS  Commercial Pay program, may not be reliable. DFAS Commercial Pay\u2019s  reported program outlays are significant\u2014approximately $249 billion for  fiscal year 2016. Consequently, a small change in the program\u2019s  estimated error rate could result in a significant change in the dollar value  of its improper payment estimate.", "Further, flexibility in how agencies are permitted to implement improper  payment estimation requirements can contribute to inconsistent or  understated estimates. For example, in February 2015, we reported that  DOD uses a methodology for estimating TRICARE improper payments  that is less comprehensive than the methodology the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) used for Medicare. Though the  programs are similar in that they pay providers on a fee-for-service basis  and depend on contractors to process and pay claims, TRICARE\u2019s  methodology does not examine the underlying medical record  documentation to discern whether each sampled payment was supported  or whether the services provided were medically necessary. On the other  hand, Medicare\u2019s methodology more completely identifies improper  payments beyond those resulting from claim processing errors, such as  those related to provider noncompliance with coding, billing, and payment  rules.", "As a result, the estimated improper payment error rates for TRICARE and  Medicare are not comparable, and TRICARE\u2019s error rate is likely  understated. In addition, corrective actions for TRICARE improper  payments do not address issues related to medical necessity errors\u2014a  significant contributor to Medicare improper payments. We recommended  that DOD implement a more comprehensive TRICARE improper payment  methodology and develop more robust corrective action plans that  address the underlying causes of improper payments. In October 2016,  DOD requested proposals for claim record reviews\u2014including medical  record reviews\u2014to begin the process of incorporating medical record  reviews in its methodology for calculating improper payment rates.", "Since fiscal year 2011, IPERA has required agencies\u2019 IGs to annually  report on the respective agencies\u2019 compliance under the act. IGs at 15  of the 24 CFO Act agencies found their respective agencies to be  noncompliant under IPERA for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, the highest  total since IGs began their annual compliance reviews. Although  noncompliance has occurred across all six of the criteria listed in IPERA,  the most common issues are noncompliance related to reporting and  meeting improper payment reduction targets or reporting an error rate  below 10 percent. Continued noncompliance further highlights the need  for additional efforts to reduce improper payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strategies for Reducing Improper Payments", "paragraphs": ["Agencies can use detailed root cause analysis and related corrective  actions to implement preventive and detective controls to reduce  improper payments. Collaboration with other relevant entities can also  assist federal agencies in reducing improper payments.", "Root cause analysis is key to understanding why improper payments  occur and developing effective corrective actions to prevent them. In  2014, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) established new  guidance to assist agencies in better identifying the root causes of  improper payments and assessing their relevant internal controls.  Agencies across the federal government began reporting improper  payments using these more detailed root cause categories for the first  time in their fiscal year 2015 financial reports. Further identification of the  true root causes of improper payments can help to determine the  potential for fraud. Figure 10 shows the root causes of government-wide  improper payments for fiscal year 2016, as reported by OMB. We will  continue to focus on agencies\u2019 efforts to both identify the root causes and  take appropriate actions to reduce improper payments.", "Implementing strong preventive controls can serve as the frontline  defense against improper payments. When agencies proactively prevent  improper payments, they increase public confidence in program  administration and they avoid the difficulties associated with the \u201cpay and  chase\u201d aspects of recovering overpayments. Examples of preventive  controls include up-front eligibility validation through data sharing,  predictive analytic technologies, and program design review and  refinement. For example, we have made the following recommendations  and matters for congressional consideration to improve preventive  controls in various programs.", "Use of the Do Not Pay (DNP) working system. Established by OMB  and hosted by Treasury, the DNP working system is a web-based,  centralized data-matching service that allows agencies to review  multiple databases\u2014such as data on deceased individuals and  entities barred from receiving federal awards\u2014before making  payments. In October 2016, we found that the 10 agencies we  reviewed used the DNP working system in limited ways, in part  because OMB had not provided a clear strategy and guidance. Only  2 of these 10 agencies used the DNP working system on a preaward  or prepayment basis for certain types of payments. Because the DNP  working system offers a single point of access to multiple databases,  agencies may be able to streamline their existing data matching  processes. Among other things, we recommended that OMB develop  a strategy\u2014and communicate it through guidance\u2014for whether and  how agencies should use the DNP working system to complement or  streamline existing data matching processes. OMB generally agreed  with the concept of developing a strategy and said it would explore the  concept further.", "Further, we found that the death records offered through the DNP  working system do not include state-reported death data. The Social  Security Administration (SSA) officials stated that sharing its full death  file\u2014which includes state-reported death data\u2014would require an  amendment to the Social Security Act. We suggested that Congress  amend the Social Security Act to explicitly allow SSA to share its full  death file with Treasury for use through the DNP working system.  Sharing the full death file through the DNP working system would  enhance efforts to identify and prevent improper payments.", "Expanded error correction authority. IRS has the authority to  correct some calculation errors and check for other obvious  noncompliance such as claims for a deduction or credit that exceed  statutory limits. We have suggested to Congress that such authority  be authorized on a broader basis rather than on a piecemeal basis  and that controls may be needed to help ensure that this authority is  used properly. Also, Treasury has proposed expanding IRS\u2019s \u201cmath  error\u201d authority to \u201ccorrectible error\u201d authority to permit it to correct  errors in cases where information provided by the taxpayer does not  match information in government databases, among other things.

In  April 2016, we found that CMS could improve its claim review  programs by conducting additional prepayment reviews.  Using  prepayment reviews to deny improper claims and prevent  overpayments is consistent with CMS's goal to pay claims correctly  the first time. It can also better protect Medicare funds because not all  overpayments can be collected. A recovery auditor (RA) is one type of  claim review contractor that CMS uses, and in 2013 and 2014, 85  percent of RA claim reviews were postpayment. Because CMS is  required by law to pay RAs contingency fees from recovered  overpayments, the RAs can only conduct prepayment reviews under a  demonstration.  From 2012 through 2014, CMS conducted a  demonstration in which the RAs conducted prepayment reviews and  were paid contingency fees based on claim denial amounts. CMS  officials considered the demonstration a success. However, CMS has  not requested legislation that would allow for RA prepayment reviews  by amending existing payment requirements and thus may be missing  an opportunity to better protect Medicare funds.", "We recommended that CMS seek legislative authority to allow RAs to  conduct prepayment claim reviews. HHS did not concur with this  recommendation, stating that CMS has implemented other programs  as part of its efforts to move away from the \"pay and chase\" process  of recovering overpayments. We continue to believe that seeking  authority to allow RAs to conduct prepayment reviews is consistent  with CMS's strategy to pay claims properly the first time.", "Although preventive controls remain the frontline defense against  improper payments, effective detection techniques can help to quickly  identify and recover those overpayments that do occur. Detective controls  play a significant role not only in identifying improper payments but also in  providing information on why these improper payments were made,  highlighting areas that need stronger preventive controls. Examples of  detective controls include data mining and recovery auditing. The  following are examples of recommendations we have made to improve  detective controls in various programs.", "Improvements to recovery efforts in Medicare Advantage. In April  2016, we reported that CMS needs to fundamentally improve its  efforts to recover substantial amounts of improper payments in the  Medicare Advantage program. CMS conducts two types of risk  adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to identify and correct  Medicare Advantage improper payments: national RADV activities  and contract-level RADV audits. Both types of audits determine  whether the diagnosis codes submitted by Medicare Advantage  organizations are supported by a beneficiary\u2019s medical record  documentation. Contract-level RADV audits seek to identify and  recover improper payments from Medicare Advantage organizations  and thus to deter them from submitting inaccurate beneficiary  diagnoses. However, we found that CMS does not focus its RADV  audits on the contracts with the highest potential for improper  payments and has not developed specific plans or a timetable for  including recovery auditor contractors in the contract-level RADV audit  process.", "We made several recommendations, including that CMS modify the  selection of contracts for contract-level RADV audits to focus on those  most likely to have high rates of improper payments and that CMS  develop specific plans and a timetable for incorporating a recovery  audit contractor in the Medicare Advantage program. In response to  our report, HHS concurred with the recommendations and reaffirmed  its commitment to identifying and correcting Medicare Advantage  improper payments. By implementing our recommendations, CMS  could recover hundreds of millions of dollars in improper payments by  improving its processes for auditing payments to Medicare Advantage  organizations.", "Review of federal determinations of Medicaid eligibility. In  October 2015, we reported that additional efforts were needed to  ensure that state spending is appropriately matched with federal funds  in Medicaid. States and the federal government share in the  financing of the Medicaid program, with the federal government  matching most state expenditures for Medicaid services on the basis  of a statutory formula. CMS has implemented interim measures to  review the accuracy of state eligibility determinations and examine  states\u2019 expenditures for different eligibility groups, for which states  may receive multiple federal matching rates.", "However, some states have delegated authority to the federal  government to make Medicaid eligibility determinations through the  federally facilitated exchange. CMS has excluded these states from  the reviews. This creates a gap in efforts to ensure that only eligible  individuals are enrolled into Medicaid and that state expenditures are  correctly matched by the federal government. We recommended that  CMS conduct reviews of federal Medicaid eligibility determinations to  ascertain the accuracy of these determinations and institute corrective  action plans where necessary.", "HHS has taken some steps to improve the accuracy of Medicaid  eligibility determinations, as we recommended, but has not conducted  a systematic review of federal eligibility determinations. For example,  in March 2017, HHS reported that it is reviewing federal  determinations of Medicaid eligibility in two of the nine states that  have delegated eligibility determination authority to the federal  marketplace. Although the actions HHS has taken have value, they  are not sufficient to identify erroneous eligibility determinations.  Specifically, without a systematic review of federal eligibility  determinations, the department lacks a mechanism to identify and  correct errors and associated payments.", "While federal agencies are responsible for reducing improper payments,  agencies may consider collaboration with relevant entities\u2014such as  OMB, states, state auditors, and the IG community\u2014to expand efforts to  reduce improper payments. In November 2016, we held a discussion with  various state auditors and federal agencies to identify potential  opportunities to strengthen collaboration, focusing on federal and state  initiatives related to improper payments. Further, in September 2015, we  reported on the Recovery Operations Center\u2019s (ROC) significant  analytical services, provided primarily to IGs to support antifraud and  other activities. While funding for the ROC ended in September 2015, officials from some small- and medium-sized IGs stated that they do not  have the capabilities to develop independent data analytics or pay for a  similar service, thus foregoing the ROC\u2019s capabilities.

Further, the low utilization rate of  federal strategic sourcing initiatives contracts by DOD and other  federal agencies resulted in missed opportunities to leverage buying  power. In this case, the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiatives reported  an estimated savings of $470 million between fiscal years 2011 and  2015, an overall savings rate of about 25 percent. In fiscal year 2015,  however, the seven large agencies that comprised the Leadership  Council\u2014a cohort of large federal agencies responsible for federal  strategic sourcing initiatives\u2014directed less than 10 percent of their  spending on the types of goods and services offered under federal  strategic sourcing initiatives in fiscal year 2015, resulting in a missed  opportunity to potentially have saved over $1 billion.", "DOD headquarters reductions.

To help HHS better control Medicare spending and  encourage efficient delivery of care, and to generate cost savings  from any reductions in payments to cancer hospitals that are  exempted from the PPS, we recommended that Congress consider  requiring Medicare to pay these PPS-exempt cancer hospitals as it  pays PPS teaching hospitals, or provide the Secretary of HHS with  the authority to otherwise modify how Medicare pays PPS-exempt  cancer hospitals, and provide that all forgone outpatient payment  adjustment amounts be returned to the Supplementary Medical  Insurance Trust Fund. The 21st Century Cures Act, enacted in  December 2016, slightly reduces the additional payments cancer  hospitals receive for outpatient services. However, the law keeps in  place the payment system for outpatient services that differs from how  Medicare pays PPS teaching hospitals. Moreover, the law does not  change how PPS-exempt cancer hospitals are paid for inpatient  services.

These concerns were evident in June 2015,  when VA requested additional funds from Congress because agency  officials projected a funding gap in fiscal year 2015 of about $3 billion  in its medical services appropriation account. The projected funding  gap was largely due to administrative weaknesses, which slowed the  utilization of the Veterans Choice Program in fiscal year 2015 and  resulted in higher-than-expected demand for VA\u2019s previously  established VA community care programs. To better align cost  estimates for community care services with associated obligations, in  June 2016, we reported that VA was examining options for replacing  its outdated financial information technology systems and VA has  since established a projected completion date of fiscal year 2020 for  that effort. However, VA continues to underestimate the resources it  needs to provide health care services efficiently and effectively.

We found that 54 percent of disabled  veterans receiving TDIU benefits in fiscal year 2013 were 65 years or  older. By comparison, other benefit programs, such as Social Security  Disability Insurance, consider retirement age a cause for ineligibility  and convert benefits for those reaching their full retirement age to a  Social Security retirement benefit.

Its two largest programs\u2014Old-Age and  Survivors Insurance (OASI), which provides retirement benefits, and  Disability Insurance (DI), which provides benefits to individuals who  cannot work because of a disability\u2014together paid out more than $905  billion in fiscal year 2016.", "Benefits provided under these programs are subject to several provisions  that offset benefits for individuals who receive both Social Security  benefits and similar benefits under another program, such as state and  local pensions or workers\u2019 compensation. In some of these cases, SSA is  required to offset or reduce the amount it pays to account for these other  benefits. We have reported that SSA could take additional steps to better  enforce these rules and avoid paying duplicative benefits.", "Social Security offsets. SSA needs accurate information from state  and local governments on retirees who receive pensions from  employment not covered under Social Security. SSA needs this  information to fairly and accurately apply the Government Pension  Offset (GPO), which generally applies to spouse and survivor  benefits, and the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP), which applies  to retirement and disability benefits. Congress could consider giving  IRS the authority to collect the information that SSA needs on  government pension income to administer the GPO and the WEP  accurately and fairly. Implementing this action could save $2.4 billion  to $7.9 billion over 10 years, if enforced both retrospectively and  prospectively, based on estimates from CBO and SSA. The estimated  savings would be less if SSA only enforced the offsets prospectively  as it would not reduce benefits already received.", "Disability and unemployment benefits. Current law does not  preclude the receipt of overlapping DI and Unemployment Insurance  (UI) benefits. We previously found that 117,000 individuals received  concurrent cash benefit payments, in fiscal year 2010, from these  programs totaling more than $850 million. In 2014, we reported that  Congress should consider passing legislation to require SSA to offset  DI benefits for any UI benefits received in the same period. As of  March 2017, legislation had not been enacted. Several bills, including  the Social Security Disability Insurance and Unemployment Benefits  Double Dip Elimination Act, were introduced in the 114th Congress  that would have prevented concurrent receipt of SSA DI and UI  benefits, as we suggested in our 2014 report. If new legislation is  introduced in the 115th Congress and enacted, the change could save  $1.9 billion over 10 years in the DI program, according to CBO.", "SSA\u2019s DI program requires beneficiaries to meet certain medical and  financial requirements in order to maintain eligibility for benefits. We have  identified a number of opportunities for SSA to save money by improving  its ability to determine whether beneficiaries have regained the ability to  work, and if working, gather information on wages to avoid improper  payments to beneficiaries earning above program limits.", "Disability Insurance overpayments. DI overpayments often result  when a beneficiary returns to work and starts earning income above a  certain level, but the earnings activity is not properly reported to or  processed by SSA. We estimated that SSA overpaid individuals $11.5  billion during fiscal years 2005 through 2014 because their work  activity resulted in earnings that exceeded program limits. SSA may  waive overpayments under some circumstances, in which case  collection of the debt is terminated, and allows flexibility to  administratively waive low dollar amounts.", "In October 2015, we identified several weaknesses in SSA\u2019s process  for handling work reports and waivers, and we made several  recommendations\u2014including that SSA study the costs and benefits of  automated reporting options to enhance the ease and integrity of the  work reporting process and take additional steps to ensure  compliance with waiver policies, including updating its Debt  Management System to ensure waivers over $1,000 are not  improperly waived. SSA agreed with this recommendation. Regarding  work reporting, SSA was drafting business processes as of March  2017 to (1) build an Internet and telephone wage reporting system for  DI beneficiaries and (2) contract with third-party payroll providers to  receive monthly earnings data that will allow SSA to automatically  make benefit adjustments. Until these new processes are  implemented, the incidence of overpayments will likely remain high  due to the lack of convenient reporting options for beneficiaries, failure  of beneficiaries to self-report, and SSA processing errors. Regarding  waivers, SSA had not updated its Debt Management System as of  March 2017, and commented that it lacks the funds to do so. Fully  implementing these recommendations would help prevent the loss of  billions of dollars, by preventing overpayments in the first place, as  well as improper waivers of overpayments, once they occur.", "Disability reviews. SSA is generally required to conduct continuing  disability reviews (CDR) to determine whether DI and Supplemental  Security Income recipients remain eligible for benefits based on their  medical condition and ability to work. In February 2016, we reported  that SSA\u2019s process for targeting CDRs does not maximize potential  savings for the government. We recommended that SSA further  consider cost savings when prioritizing reviews. SSA partially agreed  with our recommendation, stating that, although it could do more to  increase the return on its CDRs, the agency\u2019s statistical models and  prioritization process already do much of what was recommended.  However, we believe that SSA could refine its prioritization process by  factoring in actuarial considerations in addition to its existing statistical  models. SSA had not taken action as of February 2017. If SSA further  incorporates cost savings into its process for prioritizing CDRs to  conduct, the agency could realize greater savings by targeting cases  with the highest average potential savings among those with the  highest likelihood of benefit cessation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Office of Management and Budget", "paragraphs": ["Many of the results the federal government seeks to achieve require the  coordinated effort of more than one federal agency, level of government,  or sector.

Between fiscal years 2011 through  2015, federal agencies spent almost $2 billion through OMB\u2019s federal  strategic sourcing initiatives and achieved an estimated $470 million  in savings. Implementing our recommendations related to federal  acquisitions would help agencies achieve significant savings. In 2016,  we found that OMB and the General Services Administration needed  to take actions to hold federal agencies more accountable for the  results of federal strategic sourcing initiatives. For example, the  seven largest federal agencies that comprised the Leadership  Council\u2014a cohort of large federal agencies responsible for federal  strategic sourcing initiatives governance\u2014directed less than 10  percent of their spending on the types of goods and services offered  under the federal strategic sourcing initiatives in fiscal year 2015. As a  result, they missed the opportunity to potentially have saved $1 billion.  OMB generally agreed with these recommendations. It is important  that OMB continue to expand this approach to other high-spend  categories in a timely fashion to help agencies reap billions of dollars  in potential savings.", "Information technology investment portfolio management.  Federal agencies spend billions of dollars each year to meet their  increasing demand for information technology (IT). In March 2012,  OMB launched an initiative, referred to as PortfolioStat, to maximize  the return on IT investments across the government\u2019s  portfolio. PortfolioStat is designed to assist agencies in assessing the  current maturity of their IT investment management process, making  decisions on eliminating duplicative investments, and moving to  shared solutions (such as cloud computing) within and across  agencies.", "In 2013, we made several recommendations to OMB regarding the  PortfolioStat initiative. For example, we recommended that OMB  direct the Federal Chief Information Officer to improve transparency of  and accountability for PortfolioStat by publicly disclosing planned and  actual data consolidation efforts and related cost savings by agency.  While OMB disagreed with the recommendation, as of March 2017,  OMB had taken steps to improve transparency of and accountability  for PortfolioStat by displaying actual data consolidation savings data  on the federal information technology dashboard. However, OMB  stated that it does not track planned cost savings and cost avoidance  figures and did not provide any plans to do so. OMB\u2019s continued  attention in addressing this recommendation and our government- wide high-risk area Improving the Management of IT Acquisitions and  Operations is essential to enabling agencies to demonstrate progress  in improving their portfolios of IT investments. Improving the  transparency and accountability for PortfolioStat by publicly disclosing  both planned and actual data consolidation efforts and related cost  savings by agency would provide stakeholders, including Congress  and the public, a means to monitor agencies\u2019 progress and hold them  accountable for reducing duplication and achieving cost savings. Fully  implementing the actions in this area could result in billions of dollars  in additional savings.", "Federal data center consolidation. Over time, the federal  government's increasing demand for IT has led to a dramatic rise in  the number of federal data centers (defined as data processing and  storage facilities over 500 square feet with strict availability  requirements) and a corresponding increase in operational costs. In  2011, we identified the need for OMB to work with agencies to  establish goals and targets for consolidation (both in terms of cost  savings and reduced data centers), maintain strong oversight of the  agencies' efforts, and look for consolidation opportunities across  agencies. Since 2011, OMB has taken steps to look for data center  consolidation opportunities across agencies; however, continued  evidence of agencies not fully reporting their savings demonstrates  the importance of OMB's continued oversight.", "As of March 2017, agencies collectively reported having 10,058 data  centers, of which 4,679 were reported closed. Agencies also reported  that they planned to close another 1,358 data centers\u2014for a total of  6,037 closed\u2014by the end of fiscal year 2019. The agencies reported  achieving approximately $2.8 billion in cost savings or avoidances  from their data center consolidation and optimization efforts from fiscal  year 2012 through 2016. Further, as of December 2016, agencies  were planning a total of approximately $378 million in cost savings  between fiscal years 2016 and 2018\u2014significantly less than OMB's  $2.7 billion cost savings goal for agencies to achieve by the end of  fiscal year 2018. Of the recommendations that we made to 10  agencies in March 2016 to complete their planned data center cost  savings targets for fiscal years 2016 through 2018, all remain open.

Many activities, such as maintaining  roads and responding to natural disasters can depend on critical  analysis of geospatial information. Further, multiple federal agencies  may provide services at the same geographic locations and may  independently collect similar geospatial information about those  locations.", "In 2012, we recommended that OMB develop a mechanism, or modify  existing mechanisms, to identify and report annually on all geospatial- related investments, including dollars invested and the nature of the  investment. In responding to the recommendation at the time of the  report, OMB noted that it developed new analysis tools and updated  its models to improve its ability to identify and report on geospatial- related investments. As of March 2017, OMB has made progress in  developing a way to identify and report annually on all geospatial- related investments, but has not completed its efforts.

In 2010, an estimated one in six  working-age Americans reported having a disability, and the federal  government obligated more than $4 billion in fiscal year 2010 for  employment-related supports for people with disabilities. Lack of  coordination is, in part, why federal disability programs have remained  on our high-risk list since 2003.
