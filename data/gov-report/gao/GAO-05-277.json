Of $18.6 billion in excess commodity disposals in fiscal years 2002 and 2003, $2.5 billion were reported to be in new, unused, and excellent condition. DOD units reutilized only $295 million (12 percent) of these items. The remaining $2.2 billion (88 percent) includes significant waste and inefficiency because new, unused, and excellent condition items were transferred and donated outside of DOD, sold for pennies on the dollar, or destroyed. DOD units continued to buy many of these same items. GAO identified at least $400 million of commodity purchases when identical new, unused, and excellent condition items were available for reutilization. GAO also identified hundreds of millions of dollars in reported lost, damaged, or stolen excess property, including sensitive military technology items, which contributed to reutilization program waste and inefficiency. Further, excess property improperly stored outdoors for several months was damaged by wind, rain, and hurricanes. To illustrate continuing reutilization program waste and inefficiency, GAO ordered and purchased at little or no cost several new and unused excess commodities that DOD continued to buy and utilize, including tents, boots, power supplies, circuit cards, and medical supplies. GAO paid a total of $1,471, including tax and shipping cost, for these items, which had an original DOD acquisition cost of $68,127. Root causes for reutilization program waste and inefficiency included (1) unreliable excess property inventory data; (2) inadequate oversight and physical inventory control; and (3) outdated, nonintegrated excess inventory and supply management systems. Procurement of inventory in excess of requirements also was a significant contributing factor. Improved management of DOD's excess property could save taxpayers at least hundreds of millions of dollars annually."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report responds to your request that we assess the overall economy  and efficiency of the Department of Defense (DOD) program for  reutilization (reuse) of excess property.

Specifically, our November 2003 report identified several examples  that showed that at the same time DOD excessed biological equipment  items in good or excellent condition and sold many of them to the public  for pennies on the dollar, it was purchasing the same or similar items.  In  addition, at a June 2002 hearing on ineffective and inefficient DOD business  processes before the Subcommittee on National Security, Veterans Affairs  and International Relations, House Committee on Government Reform, we  testified that the lack of asset visibility over the Joint Service Lightweight  Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST) resulted in DOD units sending JSLIST  to Defense Reutilization and Marketing Offices (DRMO) as excess.  DRMOs  then issued coats and trousers to other federal agencies, scrapped some of  these items, and sent other JSLIST to a government liquidation contractor,  while at the same time procuring hundreds of thousands of new garments  in response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.

In reporting on the  results of our work, you asked us to provide detailed examples of any  waste and inefficiency and the related causes.  As agreed with your offices,  our audit focused on identifying new, unused, and excellent condition  excess commodity inventory activity during fiscal years 2002 and 2003  and determining whether the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) purchased  identical items instead of reutilizing the available excess items in Defense  Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS) inventory.", "To identify potential waste and inefficiencies, we analyzed the universe of  recorded fiscal year 2002 and 2003 transactions on excess DOD commodity  turn-ins and disposals and DLA commodity purchases.  We compared DOD  reutilization of excess new, unused, and excellent condition commodities  to transfers, donations, public sales, and destruction of excess  commodities.  We also compared DOD commodity purchases to identical  excess items in new, unused, and excellent condition to determine whether  DOD made unnecessary purchases instead of reutilizing available excess  items.  To determine the causes of identified waste and inefficiency, we  tested and evaluated controls for assuring the reliability of data and  information used for reutilization decision making and safeguarding excess  property.  We also assessed the effectiveness of current and planned supply  and excess inventory management systems and processes for reutilization  of excess property.", "You also asked us to illustrate the details of our analysis of fiscal year 2002  and 2003 waste and inefficiency by identifying specific examples and  performing case study investigations of the details of these examples.

In carrying out its mission, DLA manages inventory  valued at about $83 billion, consisting of more than 5 million consumable  (expendable) items, including commodities such as fuel, food, clothing and  other textiles, medical supplies, industrial use items, and spare and repair  parts supporting over 1,400 weapon systems.  DLA also buys and  distributes hardware and electronic items that are used in maintenance and  repair of equipment and weapons systems.  In fiscal years 2002 and 2003,  DLA expenditures related to sales and services amounted to over $46.5  billion, including about $36 billion for commodity purchases and about  $600 million for DRMS excess property disposal services.  DLA and DRMS  operate under the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund.  DLA is financed  through user charges to cover costs, and DRMS is financed through user  charges and excess property and scrap sale proceeds.

Defense Supply Center item managers initiate commodity  procurements based on military unit requirements for materiel and  supplies and military unit requisitions (supply orders).  Supply center item  managers consolidate the requirements and work with buyers to procure  requested items.  Items for which there are immediate needs are delivered  directly to a military unit by the commercial vendor, and items needed to  support anticipated operations (referred to as the requirements objective)  are stored at DLA supply depots for later issue.  The DLA Defense  Distribution Center uses a total of 26 DLA supply depots located  throughout the United States and Europe, as well as in Guam and Kuwait,  to store commodities and other items that are classified by over 5 million  different NSNs.  This inventory includes commodities, such as clothing and  other textiles; electronics; industrial, general, and construction supplies;  subsistence items; and medical supplies and equipment.

In accordance with federal regulations governing  property management and department policy in DOD 4160.21-M, Defense  Materiel Disposition Manual, DOD agencies and military services are  responsible for determining whether property they hold is considered  excess.  Federal regulations also require executive agencies to ensure that  personal property not needed by their activity is offered for use elsewhere  within the agency.  In accordance with federal regulations, DOD 4160.21-M,  chapter 5, calls for reutilization of excess property to the extent feasible to  fill existing needs and to satisfy additional needs before initiating new  procurement or repair.  All DOD activities are required to screen available  excess assets to identify items that could satisfy valid needs, and the  military services have programs for reutilizing property by redistributing  excess property across their units to meet ongoing operational needs.  DLA  has overall responsibility for property that is excess to military and DOD  units.  DLA has placed responsibility for excess property disposals with  DRMS.", "When a military service or DOD agency has property that it no longer  needs, it turns the property over to a DRMS field warehouse location\u2014or  reutilization facility\u2014referred to as a DRMO.

Reported  excess property turn-ins are entered into the DRMS Automated  Information System (DAISY).  DRMS then posts descriptive information  about the excess property to a Web page that lists property that is available  for reutilization by DOD units and specially designated programs, transfer  to federal agencies, and donation to states.  DRMS has two organizational  elements that manage and oversee excess property disposals.  DRMS  National is responsible for daily operations inside the continental United  States.  DRMS International is responsible for daily DRMS activities located  outside the continental United States.  DRMS International has field offices  in Belgium, Germany, Guam, Hawaii, Italy, Japan, Korea, Portugal, Spain,  Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom, and  it supports the task force in the Balkans.", "During fiscal years 2002 and 2003, the military services, DLA supply depots,  and DOD agencies turned in excess commodities with a reported  acquisition value of approximately $31 billion and disposed of excess  property valued at $18.6 billion.  This property included everything from  office equipment, medical supplies, and clothing to scrap from naval ships,  military equipment, and hazardous materials.  The condition of the  property ranges from being well-used or damaged property that has little  value to new, unused items that sometimes are still in the original  manufacturer\u2019s packaging.", "DRMS bills DOD units and other federal agencies for disposal services  based on turn-in volume.

Based on the item type  and condition, a decision is made as to whether the item should be made  available for reutilization.  For excess property in new, usable, or  repairable condition, redistribution from one DOD unit to another allows  the government to make full use of its resources, avoids unnecessary  procurement of property, and results in economy and efficiency of  operations.

Special  programs consist of entities that directly support DOD\u2019s mission,  customers that have statutory authorization to receive excess DOD  property, and customers that have been specially designated by DOD to  receive excess property items.  Special programs share screening priority  with DOD, and DRMS accounts for special program requisitions of DOD  excess property as DOD reutilization.  A description of the special  programs is included in appendix IV.", "If excess property is still available after the DOD and special program  screening period (the end of the first 21 days), the property is made  available for transfer to other federal agencies through the GSA Federal  Disposal System (FEDS) Web site known as GSAXcess for a 21-day period.   Excess DOD property is available to DOD agencies during the GSA federal  agency screening phase.

However, our analysis of transaction data and our  tests of controls for inventory accuracy indicate that the magnitude of  waste and inefficiency could be much greater due to military units  improperly downgrading condition codes of excess items that are in new,  unused, and excellent condition to unserviceable and the failure to  consistently record NSNs needed to identify like items.

Further, as  discussed later in this report, improper downgrading of condition codes to  unserviceable could also result in an understatement of the magnitude of  unnecessary purchases.

We received one power  supply unit on September 30, 2004, and the other power supply unit on  October 6, 2004.  According to the manufacturer, these power supply units  are part of a super-high-frequency electronics surveillance system, which is  designed to listen and identify radio frequencies. The power supply units  convert AC power to DC voltage to provide power to the assemblies inside  the surveillance system.", "We contacted the Navy inventory control point program manager to inquire  about the use of the power supply units that we had identified.  The  program manager explained that both of the power supply units are  currently used in the electronic warfare system of the Seawolf fast attack  nuclear submarine.  The Navy official stated that although DLA is not  currently purchasing these items due to a planned upgrade in technology,  the Navy has a very small number of these power supply units in inventory  and the items remaining at the DLA supply depot should not have been  excessed because they may be needed before the technology upgrade is  completed.

On September 30, 2004, we  purchased several pairs of excess new, unused extreme cold weather boots  over the Internet at govliquidation.com.  The sales advertisement listed an  acquisition cost of $3,900 for approximately 30 pairs of the boots.  We paid  a total of $483, including buyer\u2019s premium, tax, and transportation cost, to  acquire the extreme cold weather boots.  According to a Stockton DRMO  official, the boots were found at the DRMO without identifying paperwork,  and DRMO personnel entered them in excess property inventory in April  2004.  The boots were advertised as being in H condition (unserviceable,  condemned condition).  However, the photograph on the  govliquidation.com Web page showed that the manufacturer\u2019s product label  was still tied to the laces of the boots and that the soles of the boots had no  wear, indicating that they had not been worn.  When we received the boots  on October 12, 2004, we determined that we had, in fact, purchased a total  of 42 pairs of cold weather boots of which 37 pairs were in new, unused  condition.  We paid about $12 per pair for the 42 pairs of boots, which have  a listed acquisition cost of $135 per pair.", "Shortly after we purchased the excess cold weather boots, the DLA item  manager told us that she recently placed an order with the vendor to  purchase 31,420 pairs of these same boots, including 1,360 of the sizes of  boots that we purchased.  Further, the DLA technician responsible for  these boots told us that the boots have a shelf life of up to 15 years.   According to the DLA technician, the boots should be inspected after the  first 5 years and then inspected every 2 years after that for a total of six  inspections in 15 years.  After 15 years from date of manufacture these  boots would have surpassed their useful life.  All of the boots we purchased  were less than 5 years old.  The DLA technician told us that none of these  boots have been recalled, and they are considered excellent boots that are  rated to 60 degrees below zero.

We purchased several new, unused shelter half-tents  over the Internet from govliquidation.com on August 26, 2004.  We paid  $548, including buyer\u2019s premium, tax, and shipping cost, to acquire the  excess DOD shelter half-tents, which had a listed acquisition value of  $2,122.  Shelter half-tents can be carried by individual soldiers and must be  joined together to form a tent that will house two soldiers.  The tents were  listed in H condition (unserviceable, condemned condition).  However, the  advertisement on the liquidation contractor\u2019s Web page stated that some of  the tents were new and in original boxes, and the photograph on the sales  Web page showed that most of the tents were in the original manufacturer\u2019s  packages.  Upon receipt of the tents, we determined that we had, in fact,  purchased 21 new, unused tents and 6 additional tents that were used, but  appeared to be in good condition.  At the time we purchased the shelter  half-tents, the DLA item manager told us that none remained in stock.  DLA  data showed that the Defense Supply Center, Philadelphia, placed an order  for 35,000 of these tents at a cost of about $2.5 million.

On September 30, 2004, we purchased three new,  unused excess DOD gasoline burner units over the Internet from  govliquidation.com.  We paid $164, including buyer\u2019s premium, tax, and  shipping cost, to acquire the gasoline burners, which had a listed  acquisition value of $1,857.  The gasoline burners, which were turned in as  excess by the California Army National Guard in San Luis Obispo,  California, were advertised as \u201cstill in box, have never been used.\u201d   According to the DLA item manager, a gasoline burner unit can be used on  the battlefield as either a heat source or as a stove for cooking.  The item  manager told us that the units also could be used as stand-alone  field/camping stoves, but would need a grate, or cooking surface over the  burner.  The item manager explained that DLA purchased thousands of  these units several years ago, and they are continuing to be issued from  supply inventory and used by deployed troops.  According to item manager  data, DOD units purchased 471 of these same gasoline burner units from  DLA in fiscal year 2004.  The item manager told us that there are currently  9,500 of these units in inventory and provided data that showed DLA has  continued to issue gasoline burners to military units.  Figure 11 is a  photograph of one of the new, unused excess DOD gasoline burner units  that we purchased over the Internet from govliquidation.com in September  2004.  At the end of our audit in February 2005, we noted continuing  liquidation sales of excess DOD gasoline burner units.", "Portable oropharyngeal suction apparatus.  On October 7, 2004, we  purchased a new, unused portable suction apparatus for the minimum bid  of $35.  We paid a total of $105 for the suction apparatus, including buyer\u2019s  premium, tax, and shipping, compared to the acquisition cost of $1,141.   The suction apparatus runs on electrical or battery power and is designed  for use in aspirating blood and other fluids in emergency treatment of  unconscious or injured personnel in desert, tropic, or artic environments.   The suction apparatus, which was turned in as excess by a U.S. Air Force  Reserve unit at the March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, California, was  coded as being in F condition (unserviceable, repairable condition).   However, the photograph of the suction apparatus showed the tubing to be  sealed in the original package\u2014indicating that the suction apparatus had  not been used.  Documentation we obtained from the DLA item manager  showed that during fiscal year 2004, DLA purchased 627 of these same  suction apparatuses, with a total acquisition cost of $490,439, for issue to  military units.  Our in-house medical expert inspected the suction  apparatus and confirmed that it had not been used.  He said that the design  has not changed for many years, and the only issue with regard to  serviceability would be whether the battery needed to be replaced.

However, we found that DRMS management  has not enforced this requirement.  Further, Army, Navy, and Air Force  officials told us that unreliable data are a disincentive to reutilization  because of the negative impact on their operations.  DLA item managers  told us that because military units have lost confidence in the reliability of  data on excess property reported by DRMS, for the most part, they have  requested purchases of new items instead of reutilizing excess items.   Military users also cited examples of damage to excess items during  shipment that rendered the items unusable.

Our physical existence tests included  whether a turn-in recorded in inventory could be physically located, timely  recording of transactions, and verification of item description and quantity.", "Table 4 shows the overall results of our statistical sampling tests at five  DRMOs and five DLA supply depots.  The specific criteria we used to  conclude on the effectiveness of DRMO and DLA depot inventory controls  at the tested locations are included in appendix V.", "Key types of data reliability errors that we found include the following.", "Existence errors.  Missing turn-ins in our statistical sample included  entire turn-ins of excess commodity items, such as sleeping bags, cold  weather clothing, wet weather parkas, chemical and biological  protective suits, a computer, and monitors.  DRMO officials could not  locate documentation to show whether the missing turn-ins had been  reutilized, transferred, sold, or destroyed.  Because many items from our  statistical sample could not be found, the issue of lost, missing, and  stolen property is significant, as discussed later.", "Quantity errors.  Separate from missing turn-ins, quantity errors  involved items that exceeded or fell short of quantities recorded on a  turn-in transaction.  Shortages represent items that appeared to be  available but were missing.  Because DRMO personnel do not always  verify quantities at the time excess items are received and recorded into  excess inventory, they cannot determine whether missing quantities are  errors or if they represent items that are lost, missing, or stolen.   Quantity shortages included cold weather, wet weather, and camouflage  clothing; field packs; chemical and biological protective suits and  gloves; and computer keyboards.", "Lack of timely transaction recording.  DRMO personnel did not always  record transactions to reflect events, such as changes in warehouse  location and shipments to customers or disposal contractors within 7  days.  Based on our screening and inventory testing experience, when  time is wasted looking for such items, customers can become frustrated,  leading to possible loss of future orders.  Excess property users told us  that they spend a lot of time visiting DRMO warehouses to locate and  inspect excess items before they submit requisitions for them.", "Inaccurate item descriptions.  Our statistical sample identified several  turn-in transactions involving items that were different from the types of  items recorded in the inventory records.  Item description errors  included erroneous item names and stock numbers.  For example, we  found three instances at one DRMO where turn-ins of computer  keyboards were listed in excess inventory records as speakers and one  instance at another DRMO where speakers were recorded as keyboards.   Our sample also identified one women\u2019s coat and one men\u2019s coat that  were recorded in excess inventory as two women\u2019s coats and items that  were recorded as wet weather trousers and camouflage trousers when  the turn-in boxes contained multiple items, including wet weather  trousers and parkas, camouflage pants, shirts, and coats, and flyer\u2019s  coveralls.  When batched items are recorded as one type of item, only  the NSN for those items is listed in inventory.  As a result, a customer  could order what he or she believed to be the listed quantity of the  named item but instead receive various quantities of multiple types of  items.", "Inaccurate condition coding.  Our statistical sample found condition  code error rates that ranged from 5 percent at one DRMO to 22 percent  at two other DRMOs that we tested.  We based our determinations of  condition coding accuracy on physical observation of condition with  regard to the broad categories of serviceable and unserviceable rather  than testing specific coding within these categories, which could have  resulted in an even higher error rate.  Our sample identified numerous  examples of new, unused excess inventory items that were incorrectly  coded as being in unserviceable condition, including cold weather  boots, cold weather undershirts, military trousers, women\u2019s blue dress  uniforms, compressor parts kits, wet weather parkas, and fragment  body armor.  In addition to items in our statistical sample, we observed  numerous other new, unused items in DRMO warehouses and at  liquidation sales locations that were coded as unserviceable, including  desert combat boots, camouflage clothing, computer equipment, and  aircraft parts.

The errors in excess  inventory identified in our statistical samples, screening observations, and  case studies were caused by inaccurate turn-in documentation submitted  by military unit turn-in generators and the failure of DRMO personnel to  inspect excess items, verify turn-in documents, and correct identified  errors.  DRMS policy requires DRMO personnel to inspect excess items  upon receipt and challenge or change incorrect data.  However, DRMO  personnel told us that they were not able to verify excess property receipts  when faced with large turn-in volumes and processing backlogs.  Further, a  provision in this same policy allows DRMO managers who are faced with  heavy turn-in volume to waive the requirement to verify quantity counts, if  the time required to count the property is not justified, and instead use  turn-in generator counts.  The policy limits exceptions to (1) batched turn- ins of multiple types of items, (2) large quantities of small items in other  than the original package, and (3) large quantities of items in the original  package where box counts can be used.  However, officials at two of the  five DRMOs we tested\u2014the DRMOs with the highest data reliability error  rates\u2014cited this policy and told us that they accept turn-in generator  information and do not verify excess property turn-in data.", "In addition, our statistical sample identified one instance where DRMS  headquarters officials did not provide guidance on how to correct  erroneous turn-in documentation related to a June 30, 2004, Navy turn-in of  six new, unused Level III biological safety cabinets with a total acquisition  cost of $120,000.  The Navy unit improperly used a local stock number  (LSN) to describe the safety cabinets on the turn-in document and a  demilitarization code that indicated there were no restrictions on the  disposal of these items.  However, Level III safety cabinets are subject to  trade security controls, and therefore, they are required to be identified by  an NSN or other information which accurately describes the item, the end  item application, and the applicable demilitarization code.  Although  Norfolk DRMO personnel advised DRMS officials of the need to correct the  turn-in document errors in July 2004, at the time we finalized our draft  report in early February 2005, DRMS had not taken action to authorize the  DRMO to correct these errors so that the safety cabinets could be identified  for reutilization within DOD.  Further, we found that as of the end of our  audit in February 2005, the safety cabinets had not been posted to the  DRMS reutilization Web page as excess property available for reutilization.   Figure 13 shows a photograph of one of the Level III cabinets.", "Improper downgrading of condition codes.  The incorrect recording of  unserviceable condition codes for items that are in serviceable condition,  particularly items in new, unused condition, makes it unlikely that they will  be selected for reutilization.  For example, all of the new, unused excess  DOD commodity items that we purchased over the Internet were  incorrectly coded as unserviceable.  As noted previously in our case study  discussions, all of the items that we purchased were items that military  units continued to purchase, use, or both.  As shown in table 5, our DRMO  tests found that most errors related to items that were incorrectly reported  to be in unserviceable condition.", "As shown in table 5, we found numerous instances where DOD units  improperly downgraded the condition codes of items that were no longer  serviceable to them, either because they did not want these items or  because the items were being replaced by new technology, even though in  many cases these items were new and unused.  Our statistical tests and our  case studies showed that many times the items that military units coded as  unserviceable were serviceable and very adequate for use by others.", "Inconsistent recording of NSNs.  The failure to consistently record  NSNs to commodity purchase and excess inventory records prevents the  identification of like items for reutilization and, therefore, may result in  unnecessary purchases.  Although DLA records NSNs for most purchases  that are stored in DLA supply depot inventory, it does not record NSNs for  items purchased from prime vendors for direct delivery to DOD  customers.  For example, as noted previously, we determined that DLA  buyers and item managers did not record NSNs for 87 percent of the nearly  $5.7 billion in medical commodity purchases by military units during fiscal  years 2002 and 2003.  According to DLA officials, prime vendor catalogs  identify products by part number or model number rather than NSN.  This  issue will become more significant as DLA expands its use of prime  vendors to other commodity groups.", "The failure to record NSNs to turn-in transactions prevents item managers  from identifying these items for reutilization at the time purchase decisions  are made.  For example, our in-house scientists who often meet with DOD  scientists at the U.S. Army Biological Warfare Research Center at the  Dugway Proving Ground learned that the DOD scientists were planning to  purchase a Level III safety cabinet and informed them of the availability of  the six Level III safety cabinets at the Norfolk DRMO.  The DOD scientists  told us that they were unaware the Navy had excessed the safety cabinets  and said that they could use all six of them.  We subsequently confirmed  that the DOD scientists at Dugway had requisitioned the six Level III safety  cabinets for reutilization.", "Our analysis showed that LSNs were recorded for about 41 percent of fiscal  year 2002 and 2003 excess property turn-ins.  LSNs are appropriate  identifiers for local purchases and one-of-a kind items.  However, our  statistical samples and case studies showed that military unit turn-in  generators had recorded LSNs to items that should have been identified  with NSNs to avoid the time and effort necessary to identify and record  NSNs.  For example, LSNs were recorded for excess military clothing in  our Columbus DRMO sample and the cold weather boots that we  purchased over the Internet even though these items have labels that  showed the assigned NSNs.", "DOD has efforts under way to promote the use of unique product  identifiers other than NSNs by commercial vendors and small business  firms.  Regardless of the mechanism used to identify standard items, to  assure an effective excess property reutilization program, DOD will need to  consistently record NSNs, product numbers, or other unique item  identification in its purchase, supply, and excess inventory records.", "Human capital weaknesses.  We found that human capital issues related  to imbalances between staffing and workload at DRMOs and inadequate  training of military turn-in generators contributed to unreliable data and  associated waste and inefficiency.  Based on our interviews of DRMO  officials, our statistical tests of DRMO inventory, and our review of  available DRMS workload data for the five DRMOs we tested, we  concluded that data reliability was directly affected by the availability of  DRMO staff qualified to process excess property receipts.  For example,  DRMS data for the last 8 months of fiscal year 2004 showed the three  DRMOs we visited that attempted to verify turn-in documentation\u2014 Norfolk, Hill, and Stockton\u2014experienced backlogs in receipt processing  and significant use of overtime hours.  In contrast, we found that the two  DRMOs that did not verify receipts worked few, if any, overtime hours and  had significantly fewer backlogs than the other three DRMOs.  As noted  previously, these two DRMOs also had high excess property inventory error  rates.", "We also found a lack of detailed guidance on the proper assignment of  condition codes.  DRMS condition code guidance consists of a list of supply  and disposal condition codes and brief definitions of each condition code.   DRMS has not developed detailed narrative guidance with explanations  and examples of how to apply these codes.  However, we also found that  the military services are not correctly using the listed supply and disposal  condition codes on their excess property turn-in documents.  For example,  when military units assigned supply condition codes indicating that new,  unused items were unserviceable or condemned, they also used the  disposal condition code for repairable, rather than the code for new,  unused.  Military units had differing views about whether unserviceable  condition meant that items were unserviceable for their purposes or  unserviceable to anyone.  As a result, we found that items in the same  condition would be coded serviceable by one military unit and  unserviceable by another.  In addition, our analysis of turn-ins of  unserviceable items found a lack of training, guidance, and supervision at  one Navy unit.  For example, Navy officials at the North Island Naval  Aviation Depot told us that the employee responsible for sending their  excess property to the DRMO had never received formal training on  disposal policies and procedures.  Further, the officials told us that they did  not have any manuals or written procedures that explained excess property  turn-in procedures.  As a result, the employee assigned condition codes H  (unserviceable, condemned) or S (scrap) to all excess property turn-ins.", "We contacted GSA\u2019s Director of Personal Property Management Policy to  discuss the proper assignment of federal agency condition codes.  The GSA  Policy Director explained that DOD uses unique supply condition codes  that are a combination of federal agency codes established by GSA and its  own codes for identifying serviceable and unserviceable property.  (App. III  lists and defines the GSA and DOD condition codes.)  The GSA Director  told us that unreliable federal agency condition codes, including DOD  condition codes, have presented a problem in GSA\u2019s program for utilization  of excess federal agency property within the federal government.  For  example, he noted that federal agency officials have told GSA that they  cannot rely on condition codes assigned to excess property, and this had an  impact on the effectiveness of GSA\u2019s efforts to promote the use of excess  DOD property within the federal government.", "We also found that the condition codes established by GSA do not provide  for the identification of items that are nearly new, with little or no evidence  of use.  Because such items are not new and unused, they would be coded  the same as items that may be well used and need minor repair.  Further,  the GSA codes do not provide for identification of items that are new and  unused but technically obsolete to the current owner.  The GSA Policy  Director noted that because of the federal government\u2019s increased reliance  on technology, the need to identify obsolete items is becoming a  governmentwide excess property disposal issue.

Reported losses include lost, damaged, and stolen items and adjustments  for recordkeeping errors.  We determined that the loss summary reports do  not include all known losses.  For example, only one of the nine turn-ins in  our statistical sample that included missing items that were subject to  demilitarization controls was included in the fiscal year 2004 loss summary  reports.  Further, missing quantities are generally reported as adjustments  rather than lost or stolen items.", "According to DRMS data, of the total $62 million in reported fiscal year  2004 losses, the Warner Robins DRMO reported $22 million and the four  DRMS demilitarization centers reported over $17 million.  In addition,  reported fiscal year 2004 losses at the contractor-operated Meade DRMO  included over 1,000 turn-ins with a reported acquisition value of over $3  million dollars.  Although the DRMO contract provides for fines of $2,500  per incident of loss if negligence is proven, we learned that contractor  negligence could not be proven due to documented security weaknesses at  the Meade DRMO.  Uncorrected security weaknesses leave the Meade  DRMO vulnerable to theft.", "Further, while DRMO loss reports require that a reason code be specified,  we found that the reasons for nearly all (99.8 percent) of the reported  DRMO losses for fiscal years 2002 through 2004 related to unknown  reasons (76.6 percent) and unverified adjustments for bookkeeping and  data-entry errors (23.2 percent).  As a result, DRMS has no assurance of the  extent to which theft may have occurred and gone undetected.

Missing items in our DLA depot statistical samples  included the following:    Two classified radio frequency amplifiers, a printed circuit board that is  subject to trade security controls, and a circuit card assembly that  required demilitarization (destruction) when no longer needed by DOD  at DLA\u2019s Norfolk supply depot.", "Trade security-controlled aircraft parts, including 17 aircraft landing  gear drag link assemblies, 6 landing gear upper manifolds, and 3 cylinder  and piston units used in aircraft landing gear at DLA\u2019s Hill supply depot.", "Six computer controllers and a circuit card used in Army, Navy, and Air  Force communications at DLA\u2019s San Joaquin supply depot.", "We also obtained DRMS data on DLA supply depot reports of excess  property losses, including missing and damaged property and unverified  adjustments.  As shown in table 6, reported DLA supply depot losses  totaled $276 million for fiscal years 2002 through 2004.  Of this amount,  nearly $192 million related to excess property items that were subject to  demilitarization and trade security controls.  The summary reports that we  obtained did not identify the reasons for most of the reported DLA supply  depot losses.  According to DRMS data, 18 DLA supply depots reported a  total of $114 million in fiscal year 2004 excess property losses.  Two supply  depots reported 72 percent of these losses, including the DLA Oklahoma  City supply depot with reported losses of 213,950 items totaling $41 million  and DLA\u2019s Warner Robins supply depot with reported losses of 4,911 items  totaling $40 million.  In addition, the San Diego and Tobyhanna DLA supply  depots each reported about $6 million in fiscal year 2004 excess property  losses.

Because all  liquidation sales are final, buyers have no recourse when property is  damaged subsequent to sale or is not in the advertised condition.  As a  result, customers who have lost money on bids related to damaged and  unusable items might not bid again, or they may scale back on the amount  of their bids in the future, affecting both the volume of excess DOD items  liquidated and sales proceeds.  The property damage that we observed at  liquidation contractor sales locations is primarily the result of DRMS  management decisions to send excess DLA supply depot property to two  national liquidation sales locations without assuring that its contractor had  sufficient human capital resources and warehouse capacity to process,  properly store, and sell the volume of property received.", "Although DRMS headquarters officials were aware of this problem and  made numerous visits to the Huntsville sales location beginning in January  2004, actions taken to address this problem have been inadequate.  In  addition, poorly maintained contractor warehouse facilities at one  liquidation sales location resulted in severe water damage to excess DOD  bandages and medical supply items that we purchased over the Internet at  govliquidation.com.  The DRMS liquidation sales contract and Web page  conditions of sale state that DRMS is responsible for providing and  maintaining the warehouse facilities used by the contractor.", "Property damage at the Huntsville, Alabama, liquidation sales  location.   In November 2004, we investigated reports of damage related to  improper outside storage of excess items at the Huntsville, Alabama,  liquidation sales location.  In June 2003, DRMS initiated a recycle control  point  process, referred to as RCP, for DLA supply depots, whereby excess  property remains in the depot warehouses during the reutilization  screening process.  At the end of the screening phase, property that does  not require demilitarization by destruction or mutilation is to be shipped to  one of two liquidation contractor national sales locations\u2014Huntsville,  Alabama, for DLA depots west of the Mississippi River and Norfolk,  Virginia, for DLA depots east of the Mississippi.  We determined that DRMS  continued to send excess DLA supply depot property to the Huntsville sales  location even though it was apparent after the first 6 months of shipments  that the Huntsville location lacked the capacity to handle the large volume  of property received from the DLA depots.  For example, in early June  2004, the Area Manager for the Huntsville DRMO inspected the liquidation  contractor\u2019s warehouses and found that excess property had filled at least  one contractor warehouse building entirely, blocking doors and fire  extinguishers.  The Area Manager advised contractor officials that this  situation would not be viewed favorably during the joint safety, fire, and  environmental inspection anticipated within the near future.  In response,  contractor officials removed sufficient property from the building to meet  fire and safety regulations.  As a result, numerous excess DOD property  items were relocated outside to an unpaved lot about the size of a football  field and covered with a number of blue plastic tarps.  Most of these items  were new and unused spare parts and electronic items received from DLA  supply depots.  In addition, wood furniture and metal file cabinets that  were transferred to the contractor for liquidation sale by the co-located  Huntsville DRMO were stored outside without any protection from the  weather.", "According to DRMO officials, DRMS headquarters officials had visited the  Huntsville sales location in March 2004; a second time in June 2004, when  the property was placed on the outside lot; and again in September 2004, to  observe the extent of the overflow.  Despite the known risk of damaged  and lost property, the volume of excess DLA depot property continued until  September 2004, when DRMS headquarters made a decision to divert  shipments from three western DLA supply depots to the Norfolk, Virginia,  liquidation sales location.  However, property continued to be stored  outside until the week of October 18, 2004, when DRMS officials visited the  Huntsville sales location.  By that time, numerous property items had  received extensive damage due to sun, wind, rain, and storms, including  four hurricanes\u2014Charlie, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne\u2014and tropical storms  Bonnie and Matthew.  DRMS officials disposed of some items and placed  other items inside the warehouse.  In addition, the Huntsville DRMO  manager told us that wood computer furniture and filing cabinets that were  in good condition at the time the DRMO turned them over to the liquidation  contractor had been stored outside unprotected from weather.  Because  most of the furniture was ruined and the filing cabinets were rusted, they  were sent to the landfill or sold as scrap.  Figure 14 shows the outside  location of the wood computer cabinets and other items in July 2004 when  they were advertised for sale.", "Our inspection of the remaining damaged property identified numerous  boxes that were missing property labels or had labels and shipping  documentation that were illegible due to exposure to sun, wind, and rain.   The missing documentation presents a significant problem because the  sales contractor does not record receipts of excess DOD property in its  sales inventory until items are processed for sale, which may not occur  until several months after the items are received.  DRMS officials told us  that they are attempting to reconcile excess property shipments to  liquidation contractor inventory.  However, because excess property  receipts were not recorded in sales inventory and property labels are  missing or illegible, it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to fully  reconcile sales inventory to excess property receipts.  The photograph in  figure 15 shows wooden boxes that have lost their property labels and are  turning black due to rot.", "Property subject to damage at the Norfolk, Virginia, liquidation  sales location.  On December 2, 2004, we visited the Norfolk liquidation  contractor sales location to determine whether DRMS action to resolve the  capacity problems at the Huntsville sales location by diverting property to  Norfolk, Virginia, had resulted in capacity problems at that location.  We  observed hundreds of cardboard and wooden boxes containing excess  DOD property that were stored outside under blue plastic tarps and in  shrink-wrapped stacks on pallets.  Upon inspection, we noted that many of  the boxes were already water-damaged.  The photograph in figure 16 shows  cardboard boxes stored outside at the Norfolk, Virginia, sales location that  evidence weather damage in terms of peeling property labels and water  marks.", "Damage to GAO purchase of bandages and medical supplies.  Our  October 7, 2004, Internet purchase of bandages and medical supplies from  govliquidation.com suffered water damage because DRMS failed to  adequately maintain the liquidation contractor\u2019s Norfolk facilities.  Our  purchase included numerous usable items in original manufacturer  packaging, including 35 boxes of bandages, 31 boxes of gauze sponges and  surgical sponges, 12 boxes of latex gloves, and 2 boxes of tracheostomy  care sets.  We paid a total of $167, including buyer\u2019s premium, tax, and  transportation cost, for these items, which had a reported total acquisition  cost of $3,290.  However, the following week, when we arrived at the  liquidation contractor\u2019s Norfolk, Virginia, sales location to pick up our  purchase, it was raining and the roof on the contractor\u2019s warehouse  building was leaking.  The boxes containing the items we had purchased  had become wet, and water dripped from some of the boxes when  contractor personnel loaded them into our rental truck.  The photograph in  figure 17 illustrates the damaged condition of the items we purchased.   Most of the cardboard storage boxes were deteriorating as a result of water  damage, and items inside the boxes were wet.", "Although the sales lot containing the bandages and medical supplies that  we purchased was advertised as 4 pallets of items, it actually consisted of  13 pallets.  The truck we rented would not accommodate all 13 pallets of  items.  The liquidation contractor sales representative told us that we could  take as much as we could accommodate, and the contractor would resell  the remaining items, even though the boxes on the remaining 8 pallets of  bandages and medical supplies were also wet.", "We found that customers who find that the property they purchased is  damaged have no recourse.  Further, the liquidation contractor\u2019s terms of  sale provide no incentive for safeguarding property held for sale.  For  example, under the contractor\u2019s terms of sale, all sales are final and items  are sold in \u201cas is\u201d condition.  The liquidation sales contractor disclaims all  warranties, express and implied, without limitation, including loss or  liability resulting from negligence.  Credit card account numbers must be  provided at the time a bid is made, and the sales cost, buyer premium, and  sales tax, if applicable, are immediately charged to the winning bidder."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Outdated, Nonintegrated Systems Impair Economy and Efficiency", "paragraphs": ["Inefficient, nonintegrated excess inventory and supply management  systems lack controls necessary to prevent waste and inefficiency in the  reutilization program.  For example, because the DRMS Automated  Inventory System (DAISY) and DLA\u2019s Standard Automated Materiel  Management System (SAMMS) are outdated and nonintegrated, they do not  share information necessary to (1) identify and alert DLA item managers of  excess property that is available to fill supply orders and (2) prevent  purchases of new items when A-condition excess items are available for  reutilization.  We have continued to report that long-standing weaknesses  with DLA\u2019s inventory systems related to outdated, nonintegrated legacy  systems and processes result in DOD and military units not knowing how  many items they have and where these items are located.  DLA has  acknowledged serious deficiencies in its automated inventory management  systems. Although DLA has an effort under way to replace SAMMS with the  Business Systems Modernization (BSM) and DRMS has a Reutilization  Modernization Program (RMP) under way to upgrade DAISY, so far these  have been separate, uncoordinated efforts and they do not adequately  address identified process deficiencies.   Also, while the systems  improvement efforts are intended to integrate supply and excess inventory  systems to support the reutilization program, they are not focused on  resolving long-standing problems related to unreliable condition code data  and incomplete data on NSNs.

For example,  DRMS moves all excess property through the same 49-day screening and  disposal process rather than identifying A-condition items that are  currently being purchased, stocked and issued, or both to military units and  designating these items for reutilization.  Instead, as previously discussed,  DRMS transferred, donated, sold, and destroyed hundreds of millions of  dollars of A-condition excess items that the military services continued to  purchase and utilize.", "In addition, we found that the current process for identifying excess  property that is available to fill supply orders is cumbersome, time- consuming, and involves significant human intervention.  For example,  under the current process, if an item manager wants to use excess items to  fill a supply order, the item manager must query DAISY to determine  whether excess items are available to fill the supply order.  If excess items  are available, the item manager would then need to contact one or more  DRMOs where the excess property is located and ask DRMO personnel to  physically verify the item description, quantity, and condition.  If the excess  items meet the customer\u2019s requirements, the item manager prepares a  requisition form and submits it to the DRMO(s).  If the item does not  require technical inspection or testing, the DRMO processes the order and  ships the excess items to the customer.  However, if the item is electronic  and requires technical inspection and testing, or both, it must be sent to a  DLA supply depot where these functions can be performed before the item  is shipped to the customer.", "Military unit officials told us that due to inefficiencies in this process,  including shipment delays of up to several weeks and unreliable DRMS  data on quantities and condition codes, they prefer to order new items  rather than attempting to reutilize excess property available at DRMOs.   Figure 18 illustrates the current nonintegrated DLA inventory systems  environment.", "According to DLA officials, the planned BSM and RMP excess property  reutilization systems are intended to be integrated when fully implemented  in 2009.  The objective of the integrated design is to provide DLA buyer and  item manager visibility over excess property available for reutilization and  permit the buyer to fill a supply order with these items instead of  purchasing new items.  However, we are concerned that these efforts may  not resolve the long-standing data reliability problems inherent in the  current systems and processes.  Our November and December 2004  discussions with DLA and DRMS systems officials revealed that they were  unaware of the magnitude of errors in condition coding that incorrectly  recorded new and unused items as unserviceable and the extent of  inconsistent recording of NSNs in commodity purchases and excess  inventory records.   Further, the officials had not yet coordinated to identify  key data elements for identifying excess property that should be reutilized.", "We also found that DLA and DRMS systems officials had not yet fully  considered building controls into the new business systems that would  help enforce the policy to reutilize available excess property in new,  unused, and excellent condition before purchasing new items.  For  example, under the current systems environment, item managers and  military units can choose to purchase new items rather than reutilizing  available new, unused, and excellent condition excess items.  In order to  avoid this problem in the planned systems environment, DLA would need  to include edit controls that would reject a purchase transaction or  generate an exception report for review and approval when such items are  available for reutilization but are not selected.", "We discussed our concerns with DLA officials.

With regard to the 5  recommendations on which DOD partially concurred, DOD\u2019s stated actions  address all 5 of them.  We view these actions as being generally responsive  to the intent of our recommendations.  The partial concurrences relate to  plans for alternative actions, actions already initiated in response to our  audit, and increased attention to existing processes.  DOD\u2019s explanation for  the partial concurrences and our response follows.", "DOD stated that DRMS will use an alternative action to address our  recommendation that it assess the adequacy of human capital resources  and take appropriate action to assure that excess property receipts are  verified and processed accurately and timely.  DOD stated that DRMS will  use its staffing model to determine the staffing needs by receipt workload  and adequately staff its DRMOs.  DOD also stated that DRMS is using  contract hires to supplement DRMO staff, as needed.  We view these  actions as responsive to our recommendation.  However, as a part of its  actions on our recommendation, DRMS also should provide adequate  supervision and monitoring to assure that excess property receipts are  verified when received and entered into DRMO inventory.  We have  modified our recommendation to emphasize this point.  These actions will  help to provide accountability for excess property and avoid the need for  subsequent adjustments, including an excessive number of write-offs for  inventory shortages.", "DOD noted the merits of existing processes related to our recommendation  to develop a mechanism for linking prime vendor purchase transactions to  NSNs or other unique product identification.  DOD stated that DOD  directives require turn-in generators to provide a description of item(s) on  a turn-in document for which local stock numbers are listed.  DOD also  noted that bringing unused items back into DLA supply stock would negate  warehousing and distribution savings achieved through using prime vendor  direct shipments to DOD customers.  In addition, DOD stated that assigning  NSNs to nonstocked commercial items would significantly increase item  costs and run counter to the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994  preference for commercial purchases.  As discussed in our report, DOD  already has efforts underway to promote the use of unique product  identifiers other than NSNs by commercial vendors and small business  firms.  DOD\u2019s efforts include cost benefit considerations.  Consistent with  DOD\u2019s efforts, it is important that DLA prime vendor purchase transactions  are identified to NSNs or other unique product identification to facilitate  economies through (1) volume purchasing and (2) reutilization of excess  items.", "With regard to our recommendation that DRMS develop written guidance  and formal training on the proper assignment of condition codes to excess  property turn-ins, DOD stated that the military services currently receive  formal blocks of training and are in the better position to assign the  condition codes.  DOD also referred to current DOD and DRMS guidance  on condition codes.  In addition, DOD stated that DRMS will review current  guidance to ensure the appropriate assignment of responsibilities regarding  the establishment and use of condition codes.  As discussed in our report,  our statistical tests, DRMO screening visits, case study acquisitions of  excess DOD commodity items, and interviews of DRMO, military service,  and GSA officials all indicate that significant problems exist with the  reliability of excess property condition codes.  We determined that  unreliable condition codes were caused by a lack of detailed guidance and  a failure to follow existing guidance.  For example, as noted in our report,  military services often coded items as unserviceable when they no longer  had a need for them, even though the items were in new, unused, and  excellent condition.  Therefore, written guidance and training on the  proper assignment of condition codes also is important to correcting this  problem to assure that existing misconceptions are corrected and would be  responsive to our recommendation.", "With regard to our recommendation that DRMS periodically inspect  liquidation contractor facilities and take immediate action to correct  structural impairments and other deficiencies, such as storage capacity,  DOD stated that an inspection of all liquidation contractor facilities has  been completed and periodic inspections will continue.  DOD also stated  that the only facility requiring immediate structural repair is the Norfolk,  Virginia, facility and that DRMS has issued a work order for the necessary  repairs.  DOD also stated that additional storage options are being regularly  evaluated by the contractor and DRMS.  As stated in our report, the  overflow of excess property at the Huntsville liquidation sales location was  a long-term, uncorrected problem, which resulted in a significant  breakdown in accountability and physical inventory control over excess  property.  It is important that timely and appropriate solutions be identified  and implemented to prevent this problem in the future.  The actions that  DOD highlighted in its letter are responsive to our recommendation.", "Finally, DOD stated that actions have already been taken to respond to our  recommendation that DRMS consider available options and implement an  interim process for identifying turn-ins of excess new, unused, and  excellent condition items that could be reutilized to avoid unnecessary  purchases in the existing systems environment.  DOD enumerated  initiatives implemented during 2004 and early 2005 that improve the  visibility of excess property listed on DRMS\u2019s Web page.  In addition, DOD  stated that DRMS will work with DLA item managers on the best  methodology to provide visibility of A-condition excess property.   Notwithstanding the improvements in DRMS\u2019s Web page, the overall  commodity purchasing process has not changed, and DLA continues to  make commodity purchases without considering the availability of  identical A-condition excess commodities.  Achieving the economy and  efficiency contemplated by federal regulations and DOD policy is  dependent upon identifying continuing commodity purchases and having  the ability to match these items to A-condition excess property and hold it  for reutilization.
