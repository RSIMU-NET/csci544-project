Today, DOD faces financial management  problems that are pervasive, complex, long-standing, and deeply rooted in  virtually all business operations throughout the department. DOD\u2019s  financial management deficiencies, taken together, represent the single  largest obstacle to achieving an unqualified opinion on the U.S.  government\u2019s consolidated financial statements. To date, none of the  military services or major DOD components have passed the test of an  independent financial audit because of pervasive weaknesses in financial  management systems, operations, and controls.", "Overhauling financial management represents a major management  challenge that goes far beyond financial accounting to the very fiber of the  department\u2019s range of business operations and management culture.  Previous administrations over the past several decades have tried to  address these problems in various ways but have largely been  unsuccessful. In this regard, on September 10, 2001, Secretary of Defense  Rumsfeld announced a broad initiative intended to \u201ctransform the way the  department works and what it works on\u201d that he estimated could save  5 percent of DOD\u2019s budget\u2014or an estimated $15 to $18 billion annually.  The Secretary recognized that transformation would be difficult and  expected the needed changes would take 8 or more years to complete.", "The President\u2019s Management Agenda includes improved financial  management performance as one of his five governmentwide management  goals. In addition, in August 2001, the Principals of the Joint Financial  Management Improvement Program\u2014the Secretary of the Treasury, the  Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Director of the  Office of Personnel Management, and I, in my role as the Comptroller  General\u2014began a series of quarterly meetings that marked the first time  all four of the Principals had gathered together in over 10 years. To date,  these sessions have resulted in substantive deliberations and agreements  focused on key issues such as better defining measures for financial  management success. These measures include being able to routinely  provide timely, reliable, and useful financial information and having no  material internal control weaknesses. Success on these measures will be a  significant challenge to DOD. The Principals plan to invite Defense  Comptroller Zakheim to their upcoming April 2002 meeting to discuss the  department\u2019s transformation effort and to begin a constructive  engagement with DOD on this important initiative.", "With the events of September 11, and the federal government\u2019s short- and  long-term budget challenges, it is more important than ever that DOD  effectively transform its business processes to ensure it gets the most from  every dollar spent. The department must be able to effectively account for  the funding it receives and carry out its stewardship responsibilities for  the vast amount of equipment and inventories used in support of military  operations. Even before the events of September 11, increased  globalization, changing security threats, and rapid technological advances  were prompting fundamental changes in the environment in which DOD  operates. These trends place a premium on increasing strategic planning,  enhancing results orientation, ensuring effective accountability,  transparency, and using integrated approaches. Six of the 22 areas on  GAO\u2019s governmentwide \u201chigh-risk\u201d list are DOD program areas, and DOD  shares responsibility for 2 other high-risk areas that are governmentwide  in scope. Central to effectively addressing DOD\u2019s financial management  problems will be the understanding that these eight areas are interrelated  and cannot be addressed in an isolated, stovepiped, or piecemeal fashion.", "The recent success of our forces in Afghanistan has again demonstrated  the unparalleled excellence of our military forces. This same level of  excellence is not yet evident in the department\u2019s financial management  and other business processes. This is particularly problematic because  effective financial management operations are critical to achieving the  department\u2019s mission in a reasonably economical, efficient, and effective  manner and providing reliable, timely financial information on a routine  basis to support management decision-making at all levels throughout  DOD. This will also be critical in order to enhance overall transparency  and accountability. Success in this area will also serve to free-up resources  that can be redeployed to enhance readiness, improve the quality of life for  our troops and their families, and reduce the gap between wants and  available funding in connection with major weapon systems.", "Today, I will provide my perspectives on (1) how Defense got where it is  today and the underlying causes of the department\u2019s longstanding inability  to effectively reform its financial management and other business systems  and processes and (2) the keys to successfully carrying out the Secretary\u2019s  business process transformation and DOD\u2019s plans and actions to date.

These  problems adversely affect DOD\u2019s ability to control costs, ensure basic  accountability, anticipate future costs and claims on the budget, such as  for health care, weapon systems, and environmental liabilities, measure  performance, maintain funds control, prevent fraud, and address pressing  management issues.", "Problems with the department\u2019s financial management operations go far  beyond its accounting and finance systems and processes. The department  continues to rely on a far-flung, complex network of finance, logistics,  personnel, acquisition, and other management information systems\u2014  80 percent of which are not under the control of the DOD Comptroller\u2014  to gather the financial data needed to support day-to-day management  decision-making. This network was not designed, but rather has evolved  into the overly complex and error-prone operation that exists today,  including (1) little standardization across DOD components, (2) multiple  systems performing the same tasks, (3) the same data stored in multiple  systems, (4) manual data entry into multiple systems, and (5) a large  number of data translations and interfaces which combine to exacerbate  problems with data integrity. DOD determined, for example, that efforts to  reconcile a single contract involving 162 payments resulted in an estimated  15,000 adjustments.", "Many of the department\u2019s business processes in operation today are mired  in old, inefficient processes and legacy systems, some of which go back to  the 1950s and 1960s. For example, the department relies on the  Mechanization of Contract Administration Services (MOCAS) system to  process a substantial portion of DOD contract payment transactions for all  DOD organizations, which totaled about $78 billion in fiscal year 2001.  When MOCAS was first implemented in 1968, \u201cmechanization\u201d was a high  tech word. Past efforts to replace MOCAS have failed. Most recently, in  1994, DOD began acquiring the Standard Procurement System (SPS) to  replace the contract administration functions currently performed by  MOCAS. However, our July 2001 and February 2002 reporting on DOD\u2019s  $3.7 billion investment in SPS showed that this substantial investment was  not economically justified and raised questions as to whether further  investment in SPS was justified. For the foreseeable future, DOD will  continue to be saddled with MOCAS.", "Moving to the 1970s, we, the Defense Inspector General, and the military  service audit organizations, issued numerous reports detailing serious  problems with the department\u2019s financial management operations. For  example, between 1975 and 1981, we issued more than 75 reports  documenting serious problems with DOD\u2019s existing cost, property, fund  control, and payroll accounting systems. In the 1980s, we found that  despite the billions of dollars invested in individual systems, these efforts  too fell far short of the mark, with extensive schedule delays and cost  overruns. For example, in 1989, our report on eight major DOD system  development efforts\u2014including two major accounting systems\u2014under  way at that time, showed that system development cost estimates doubled,  two of the eight efforts were abandoned, and the remaining six efforts  experienced delays of from 3 to 7 years.", "Beginning in the 1990s, following passage of the Chief Financial Officers  (CFO) Act of 1990, there was a recognition in DOD that broad-based  financial management reform was needed. Over the past 12 years, the  department has initiated several departmentwide reform initiatives  intended to fundamentally reform its financial operations as well as other  key business support processes, including the Corporate Information  Management initiative, the Defense Business Operations Fund, and the  Defense Reform Initiative. These efforts, which I will highlight today, have  proven to be unsuccessful despite good intentions and significant effort.  The conditions that led to these previous attempts at reform remain  largely unchanged today.", "Corporate Information Management. The Corporate Information  Management (CIM), initiative, begun in 1989, was expected to save billions  of dollars by streamlining operations and implementing standard  information systems. CIM was expected to reform all DOD\u2019s functional  areas, including finance, procurement, material management, and human  resources through consolidating, standardizing, and integrating  information systems. DOD also expected CIM to replace approximately  2,000 duplicative systems. Over the years, we made numerous  recommendations to improve CIM\u2019s management, but these  recommendations were largely not addressed. Instead, DOD spent billions  of dollars with little sound analytical justification. We reported in 1997,that 8 years after beginning CIM, and spending about $20 billion on the  initiative, expected savings had yet to materialize. The initiative was  eventually abandoned.", "Defense Business Operations Fund. In October 1991, DOD established  a new entity, the Defense Business Operations Fund by consolidating nine  existing industrial and stock funds and five other activities operated  throughout DOD. Through this consolidation, the fund was intended to  bring greater visibility and management to the overall cost of carrying out  certain critical DOD business operations. However, from its inception, the  fund was plagued by management problems. In 1996, DOD announced the  fund\u2019s elimination. In its place, DOD established four working capital  funds. These new working capital funds inherited their predecessor\u2019s  operational and financial reporting problems.", "Defense Reform Initiative (DRI). In announcing the DRI program in  November 1997, the then Secretary of Defense stated that his goal was \u201cto  ignite a revolution in business affairs.\u201d DRI represented a set of proposed  actions aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of DOD\u2019s  business operations, particularly in areas that have been long-standing  problems\u2014including financial management. In July 2000, we reportedthat while DRI got off to a good start and made progress in implementing  many of the component initiatives, DRI did not meet expected timeframes  and goals, and the extent to which savings from these initiatives will be  realized is yet to be determined. GAO is currently examining the extent to  which DRI efforts begun under the previous administration are continuing.", "The past has clearly taught us that addressing the department\u2019s serious  financial management problems will not be easy. Early in his tenure,  Secretary Rumsfeld commissioned a new study of the department\u2019s  financial management operations. The report on the results of the study,  Transforming Department of Defense Financial Management: A Strategy  for Change, was issued on April 13, 2001. The report recognized that the  department will have to undergo \u201ca radical financial management  transformation\u201d and that it would take more than a decade to achieve. The  report concluded that many studies and interviews with current and  former leaders in DOD point to the same problems and frustrations, and  that repetitive audit reports verify systemic problems illustrating the need  for radical transformation in order to achieve success. Secretary Rumsfeld  further confirmed the need for a fundamental transformation of DOD in  his \u201ctop-down\u201d Quadrennial Defense Review. Specifically, his September  30, 2001, Quadrennial Defense Review Report concluded that the  department must transform its outdated support structure, including  decades old financial systems that are not well interconnected. The report  summed up the challenge well in stating: \u201cWhile America\u2019s business have  streamlined and adopted new business models to react to fast-moving  changes in markets and technologies, the Defense Department has lagged  behind without an overarching strategy to improve its business practices.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Underlying Causes of Financial and Related Business Process Reform Challenges", "paragraphs": ["As part of our constructive engagement approach with DOD, I met with  Secretary Rumsfeld last summer to provide our perspectives on the  underlying causes of the problems that have impeded past reform efforts  at the department and to discuss options for addressing these challenges.  There are four underlying causes a lack of sustained top-level leadership and management accountability for deeply embedded cultural resistance to change, including military service  parochialism and stovepiped operations; a lack of results-oriented goals and performance measures and  monitoring; and  inadequate incentives for seeking change."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Lack of Leadership and Accountability", "paragraphs": ["Historically, DOD has not routinely assigned accountability for  performance to specific organizations or individuals that have sufficient  authority to accomplish desired goals. For example, under the CFO Act, it  is the responsibility of agency CFOs to establish the mission and vision for  the agency\u2019s future financial management. However, at DOD, the  Comptroller\u2014who is by statute the department\u2019s CFO\u2014has direct  responsibility for only an estimated 20 percent of the data relied on to  carry out the department\u2019s financial management operations. The  department has learned through its efforts to meet the Year 2000  computing challenge that to be successful, major improvement initiatives  must have the direct, active support and involvement of the Secretary and  Deputy Secretary of Defense. In the Year 2000 case, the then Deputy  Secretary of Defense was personally and substantially involved and played  a major role in the department\u2019s success. Such top-level support and  attention helps ensure that daily activities throughout the department  remain focused on achieving shared, agency-wide outcomes. A central  finding from our report on our survey of best practices of world-class  financial management organizations\u2014Boeing, Chase Manhattan Bank,  General Electric, Pfizer, Hewlett-Packard, Owens Corning, and the states  of Massachusetts, Texas and Virginia\u2014was that clear, strong executive  leadership was essential to (1) making financial management and  entitywide priority, (2) redefining the role of finance, (3) providing  meaningful information to decision-makers, and (4) building a team of  people that deliver results.", "DOD past experience has suggested that top management has not had a  proactive, consistent, and continuing role in building capacity, integrating  daily operations for achieving performance goals, and creating incentives.  Sustaining top management commitment to performance goals is a  particular challenge for DOD.

In 1997, the department established a  Defense Management Council\u2014including high-level representatives from  each of the military services and other senior executives in the Office of  the Secretary of Defense\u2014which was intended to serve as the \u201cboard of  directors\u201d to help break down organizational stovepipes and overcome  cultural resistance to changes called for under DRI.

Cultural  resistance to change has impeded reforms in not only financial  management, but also in other business areas, such as weapon system  acquisition and inventory management. For example, as we reported last  year, while the individual military services conduct considerable analyses  justifying major acquisitions, these analyses can be narrowly focused and  do not consider joint acquisitions with the other services. In the inventory  management area, DOD\u2019s culture has supported buying and storing  multiple layers of inventory rather than managing with just the amount of  stock needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unclear Goals and Performance Measures", "paragraphs": ["Further, DOD\u2019s past reform efforts have been handicapped by the lack of  clear, linked goals and performance measures.

In some cases, DOD had not yet  developed appropriate strategic goals, and in other cases, its strategic  goals and objectives were not linked to those of the military services and  defense agencies.", "As part of our assessment of DOD\u2019s Fiscal Year 2000 Financial  Management Improvement Plan, we reported that, for the most part, the  plan represented the military services\u2019 and Defense components\u2019  stovepiped approaches to reforming financial management, and did not  clearly articulate how these various efforts will collectively result in an  integrated DOD-wide approach to financial management improvement. In  addition, we reported the department\u2019s plan did not have performance  measures that could be used to assess DOD\u2019s progress in resolving its  financial management problems. DOD officials have informed us that they  are now working to revise the department\u2019s approach to this plan so that it  in future years\u2019 updates it will reflect a more strategic, department-wide  vision and tool for financial management reform.", "The department faces a formidable challenge in responding to  technological advances that are changing traditional approaches to  business management as it moves to modernize its systems. For fiscal year  2001, DOD\u2019s reported total information technology investments of almost  $23 billion, supporting a wide range of military operations as well as its  business functions. As we have reported,while DOD plans to invest  billions of dollars in modernizing its financial management and other  business support systems, it does not yet have an overall blueprint\u2014or  enterprise architecture\u2014in place to guide and direct these investments. As  we recently testified, our review of practices at leading organizations  showed they were able to make sure their business systems addressed  corporate\u2014rather than individual business unit\u2014objectives by using  enterprise architectures to guide and constrain investments.

Traditionally, DOD has focused on  justifying its need for more funding rather than on the outcomes its  programs have produced. DOD generally measures its performance by the  amount of money spent, people employed, or number of tasks completed.  Incentives for DOD decisionmakers to implement changed behavior have  been minimal or nonexistent. Secretary Rumsfeld perhaps said it best in  announcing his planned transformation at DOD, \u201c\u2026there will be real  consequences from, and real resistance to, fundamental change.\u201d", "This underlying problem has perhaps been most evident in the  department\u2019s acquisition area. In DOD\u2019s culture, the success of a  manager\u2019s career has depended more on moving programs and operations  through the DOD process rather than on achieving better program  outcomes. The fact that a given program may have cost more than  estimated, took longer to complete, and did not generate results or  perform as promised was secondary to fielding a new program. To effect  real change, actions are needed to (1) break down parochialism and  reward behaviors that meet DOD-wide and congressional goals,  (2) develop incentives that motivate decisionmakers to initiate and  implement efforts that are consistent with better program outcomes,  including saying \u201cno\u201d or \u201cpulling the plug\u201d on a system or program that is  failing, and (3) facilitate a congressional focus on results-oriented  management, particularly with respect to resource allocation decisions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Keys to Fundamental DOD Financial Management Reform", "paragraphs": ["As we testified in May 2001, our experience has shown there are several  key elements that, collectively will enable the department to effectively  address the underlying causes of DOD\u2019s inability to resolve its long- standing financial management problems.

Consequently, both long-term actions focused on the Secretary\u2019s  envisioned business transformation, as well as short-term actions, focused  on improvements within existing systems and processes, will be critical  going forward. Short-term actions in particular will be critical if the  department is to achieve the greatest possible accountability over existing  resources and more reliable data for day-to-day decision-making while  longer term systems and business process reengineering efforts are under  way.", "Beginning with the Secretary\u2019s recognition of a need for a fundamental  transformation of the department\u2019s business processes, and building on  some of the work begun under past administrations, DOD has taken a  number of positive steps in many of these key areas.

For example, we have  reported that many of DOD\u2019s financial management shortcomings were  attributable in part to human capital issues. The department does not yet  have a strategy in place for improving its financial management human  capital.

Such a results-oriented focus is also consistent with an important lesson  learned from the department\u2019s Year 2000 experience. DOD\u2019s initial Year  2000 focus was geared toward ensuring compliance on a system-by-system  basis and did not appropriately consider the interrelationship of systems  and business areas across the department. It was not until the department,  under the direction of the then Deputy Secretary, shifted to a core mission  and function review approach that it was able to achieve the desired result  of greatly reducing its Year 2000 risk.", "Since the Secretary has established an overall business process  transformation goal that will require a number of years to achieve, going  forward, it will be especially critical for managers throughout the  department to focus on specific measurable metrics that, over time,  collectively will translate to achieving this overall goal. It will be important  for the department to refocus its annual accountability reporting on this  overall goal of fundamentally transforming the department\u2019s financial  management systems and related business processes to include  appropriate interim annual measures to track progress toward this goal.", "In the short term, it will be important to focus on actions that can be taken  using existing systems and processes. Establishing interim measures to  both track performance against the department\u2019s overall transformation  goals and facilitate near term successes using existing systems and  processes will be critical. The department has established an initial set of  metrics intended to evaluate financial performance, and reports that it has  seen improvements. For example, with respect to closed appropriation  accounts, DOD reported during the first 4 months of fiscal year 2002, a  reduction in the dollar value of adjustments to closed appropriation  accounts of about 51 percent from the same 4-month period in fiscal year  2001. Other existing metrics concern cash and funds management,  contract and vendor payments, and disbursement accounting. DOD also  reported that it is working to develop these metrics into higher level  measures more appropriate for senior management. We agree with the  department\u2019s efforts to expand the use of appropriate metrics to guide its  financial management reform efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incentives and Consequences", "paragraphs": ["Another key to breaking down parochial interests and stovepiped  approaches that have plagued previous reform efforts will be establishing  mechanisms to reward organizations and individuals for behaviors that  comply with DOD-wide and congressional goals. Such mechanisms should  be geared to providing appropriate incentives and penalties to motivate  decisionmakers to initiate and implement efforts that result in  fundamentally reformed financial management and other business support  operations.", "In addition, such incentives and consequences will be essential if DOD is  to break down the parochial interests that have plagued previous reform  efforts. Incentives driving traditional ways of doing business, for example,  must be changed, and cultural resistance to new approaches must be  overcome. Simply put, DOD must convince people throughout the  department that they must change from \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d systems and  practices or they are likely to face serious consequences, organizationally  and personally."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Enterprise Architecture", "paragraphs": ["Establishing and implementing an enterprisewide financial management  architecture will be essential for the department to effectively manage its  large, complex system modernization effort now underway. The Clinger- Cohen Act requires agencies to develop, implement, and maintain an  integrated system architecture. As we previously reported, such an  architecture can help ensure that the department invests only in  integrated, enterprisewide business system solutions and, conversely, will  help move resources away from non-value added legacy business systems  and nonintegrated business system development efforts. In addition,  without an architecture, DOD runs the serious risk that its system efforts  will result in perpetuating the existing system environment that suffers  from systems duplication, limited interoperability, and unnecessarily  costly operations and maintenance. In our May 2001 report, we pointed  out that DOD lacks a financial management enterprise architecture to  guide and constrain the billions of dollars it plans to spend to modernize  its financial management operations and systems.", "DOD has reported that it is in the process of contracting for the  development of a DOD-wide financial management enterprise architecture  to \u201cachieve the Secretary\u2019s vision of relevant, reliable and timely financial  information needed to support informed decision-making.\u201d Consistent  with our previous recommendations in this area, DOD has begun an  extensive effort to document the department\u2019s current \u201cas-is\u201d financial  management architecture by inventorying systems now relied on to  carryout financial management operations throughout the department.  DOD has identified 674 top-level systems and at least 997 associated  interfaces thus far and estimates that this inventory could include up to  1,000 systems when completed.", "While DOD\u2019s beginning efforts at developing a financial management  enterprise architecture are off to a good start, the challenges yet  confronting the department in its efforts to fully develop, implement, and  maintain a DOD-wide financial management enterprise architecture are  unprecedented. Our May 2001 reportdetails a series of recommended  actions directed at ensuring DOD employs recognized best practices for  enterprise architecture management. This effort will be further  complicated as the department strives to develop multiple enterprise  architectures across its various business areas. For example, in June 2001,  we recommendedthat DOD develop an enterprise architecture for its  logistics operations. As I discussed previously, an integrated reform  strategy will be critical. In this context, it is essential that DOD closely  coordinate and integrate the development and implementation of these, as  well as other, architectures. By following this integrated approach and our  previous recommendations, DOD will be in the best position to avoid the  serious risk that after spending billions of dollars on systems  modernization, it will continue to perpetuate the existing systems  environment that suffers from duplication of systems, limited  interoperability, and unnecessarily costly operations and maintenance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Monitoring and Oversight", "paragraphs": ["Ensuring effective monitoring and oversight of progress will also be a key  to bringing about effective implementation of the department\u2019s financial  management and related business process reform. We have previously  testifiedthat periodic reporting of status information to department top  management, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Congress,  and the audit community was another key lesson learned from the  department\u2019s successful effort to address its Year 2000 challenge.", "Previous Financial Management Improvement Plans DOD submitted to the  Congress have simply been compilations of data call information on the  stovepiped approaches to financial management improvements received  from the various DOD components. It is our understanding that DOD plans  to change its approach and anchor its plans in an enterprise system  architecture. If the department\u2019s future plans are upgraded to provide a  department-wide strategic view of the financial management challenges  facing the DOD along with planned corrective actions, these plans can  serve as an effective tool not only to help guide and direct the  department\u2019s financial management reform efforts, but a tool for  oversight. Going forward, this Subcommittee\u2019s annual oversight hearings,  as well the active interest and involvement of other cognizant defense and  oversight committees in the Congress, will continue to be key to  effectively achieving and sustaining DOD\u2019s financial management and  related business process reform milestones and goals.", "Given the size, complexity, and deeply engrained nature of the financial  management problems facing DOD, heroic end-of-the year efforts relied on  by some agencies to develop auditable financial statement balances are  not feasible at DOD. Instead, a sustained focus on the underlying problems  impeding the development of reliable financial data throughout the  department will be necessary and is the best course of action. I applaud  the proposals spearheaded by the Senate Armed Services Committee, and  subsequently enacted as part of the fiscal year 2002 National Defense  Authorization Act, to provide a framework for redirecting the  department\u2019s resources from the preparation and audit of financial  statements that are acknowledged by DOD leadership to be unauditable to  the improvement of DOD\u2019s financial management systems and financial  management policies, procedures and internal controls. Under this new  legislation, the department will also be required to report to the Congress  on how resources have been redirected and the progress that has been  achieved. This reporting will provide an important vehicle for the  Congress to use in assessing whether DOD is using its available resources  to best bring about the development of timely and reliable financial  information for daily decisionmaking and transform its financial  management as envisioned by the Secretary of Defense."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
