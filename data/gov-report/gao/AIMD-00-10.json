Reported estimates of improper payments total billions of dollars  annually. Viewed in the simplest context, improper payments are an  inefficient use of taxpayers\u2019 funds. Specifically, for programs with  legislative or regulatory eligibility criteria, improper payments indicate that  agencies are spending more than necessary to meet program goals.  Conversely, for programs with fixed funds, any waste of federal funds  translates into serving fewer recipients or accomplishing less  programmatically than could be expected.", "Because of concerns regarding improper payments in light of the projected  future growth of federal expenditures, you asked us to (1) quantify, where  possible, amounts reported by agencies as improper payments in their  fiscal year 1998 financial statements prepared pursuant to the Chief  Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act), (2) identify additional types of  federal programs at risk of disbursing improper payments, (3) determine  reported causes of improper payments prevalent across government, and  (4) assess the extent to which agencies are addressing improper payments  in their performance plans under the Government Performance and Results  Act of 1993 (Results Act).

Because of its size, complexity, weak control environment, and  insufficient preventive controls, the federal government risks disbursing  improper payments. Agency-specific studies and audits have indicated that  improper payments are a widespread and significant problem. They occur  in a variety of programs and activities including those involving contract  management, financial assistance benefits\u2014such as Food Stamps and  Veterans Benefits\u2014and tax refunds. However, some overpayments, by their  nature, are not considered improper payments, such as routine contract  price adjustments.", "Legislative efforts have focused on improving the federal government\u2019s  control environment. For example, under the Federal Managers\u2019 Financial  Integrity Act of 1982 and the Federal Financial Management Improvement  Act of 1996, agency managers are responsible for ensuring that adequate  systems of internal controls are developed and implemented. An adequate  system of internal controls, as defined by the Comptroller General\u2019s  internal control standards, which are issued pursuant to the Financial  Integrity Act, should provide reasonable assurance that an agency is  effectively and efficiently using resources, producing reliable financial  reports, and complying with applicable laws and regulations. Accordingly,  cost-effective internal controls should be designed to provide reasonable  assurance regarding prevention of or prompt detection of unauthorized  acquisition, use, or disposition of an agency\u2019s assets.", "Recent legislation has provided an impetus for agencies to systematically  measure and reduce the extent of improper payments. For example, with  the advent of the CFO Act, GMRA, and the Results Act, agencies are  challenged to increase attention on identifying and addressing improper  payments. The CFO Act, as expanded by GMRA, requires 24 major  departments/agencies to prepare and have audited agencywide financial  statements, which are intended to report an agency\u2019s stewardship over its  financial resources\u2014including how it expended available funds. The Office  of Management and Budget\u2019s Bulletin 97-01, Form and Content of Agency  Financial Statements, provides implementing guidance on these CFO Act  requirements. In addition, the CFO Act sets expectations for agencies to  routinely produce sound cost and operating performance information.  Effective implementation of this requirement would enable managers to  have timely information for day-to-day management decisions. The CFO  Act also requires OMB to prepare and annually revise a governmentwide 5- year financial management plan and status report that discusses the  activities the executive branch plans to and has undertaken to improve  financial management in the federal government. Additionally, each agency  CFO is responsible for developing annual plans to support the  governmentwide 5-year financial management plan.", "The Results Act seeks to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the  federal government by requiring that agencies develop strategic and annual  performance goals and report on their progress in achieving these goals.  Agency strategic plans are required to include the agency\u2019s mission  statement; identify long-term general goals, including outcome-related  goals and objectives; and describe how the agency intends to achieve these  goals. Agencies are required to consult with the Congress when developing  their strategic plans and consider the views of other interested parties. In  their annual performance plans, agencies are required to set annual goals,  covering each program activity in an agency\u2019s budget, with measurable  target levels of performance. Agencies are also required to issue annual  performance reports that compare actual performance to the annual goals.", "Together, these plans and reports are the basis for the federal government  to manage for results. The Results Act is supported by the development of  federal cost accounting standards under the CFO Act, which require  agencies to identify the costs of government activities. These standards  can lead to and support linking costs with achieving performance levels.  This can give managers information for assessing the full costs of goods,  services, and benefits compared to program outputs and results. Such  information can provide the basis for agencies to develop performance  goals to monitor and track improper payments as well as strategies for  preventing such future disbursements.", "The risk of improper payments and the government\u2019s ability to prevent  them will continue to be of concern in the future. Under current federal  budget policies, as the baby boom generation leaves the workforce,  spending pressures will grow rapidly due to increased costs of Medicare,  Medicaid, and Social Security. Other federal expenditures are also likely  to increase. Thus, absent improvements over internal controls, the  potential for additional or larger volumes of improper payments will be  present. Figure 1 illustrates the reported and projected trends in federal  expenditures, excluding interest on the public debt, for fiscal years 1978  through 2004.", "Historically, the recovery rates for certain programs identified as having  improper payments have been low.

We supplemented our review  with IG reports from CFO Act agencies and other information obtained  from a variety of sources, such as agency studies. In addition, we reviewed  these data sources to discern the causes of improper payments. For the  nine agencies that reported improper payments in their financial statement  reports, we reviewed the agencies\u2019 Results Act performance plans for fiscal  year 2000 to determine the extent to which the plans addressed improper  payments. We relied on recent GAO reports and guidance to consider any  impact from potential Year 2000 computing problems on improper  payments. In selected cases, we interviewed agency CFO and IG personnel.  Because of the nature of improper payments, our review would not capture  all reported instances of such payments. As requested, relevant GAO  reports covering our work in these areas for the past 4 fiscal years are  listed at the end of this report.", "To gather information on existing financial statement and performance  reporting criteria, we reviewed relevant professional literature, including  the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants\u2019 Codification of  Statements on Auditing Standards and the Federal Accounting Standards  Advisory Board\u2019s (FASAB) Statements of Federal Financial Accounting  Concepts and Standards.

Nine  agencies have taken the initiative to disclose improper payments for 17 of  their programs in their financial statement reports, which has resulted in  the disclosure of important information for oversight and decision-making.  At the same time, the methodologies used by some agencies to estimate  improper payments do not always result in complete estimates, and many  other agencies have not even attempted to identify or estimate improper  payments. As a result, the full extent of improper payments  governmentwide is largely unknown, which hampers efforts to reduce such  payments. Ascertaining the full extent of improper payments  governmentwide is critical to determining related causes.

For fiscal year 1998, HHS, USDA, and HUD  collectively reported improper payments of $14.9 billion as part of their  program expenses in their financial statement reports. HHS\u2019 estimated  improper Medicare benefit payments constitute $12.6 billion of this  amount, which represents 7.1 percent of the $177 billion in Fee-for-Service  payments processed in fiscal year 1998. USDA disclosed $1.4 billion in food  stamp overissuances or approximately 7 percent of its annual program cost  of $20.4 billion. HUD\u2019s excess housing subsidy payments totaled $857 million, or 4.6 percent of its rental assistance payments for this $18.6  billion program. These agencies have made significant progress in  estimating and reporting improper payments for these programs by  implementing methodologies that use statistical sampling. However,  implementing a statistically valid methodology will pose challenges to  agencies for certain programs.", "The disclosure methods used by HHS, USDA, HUD, and the other six  agencies varied. Some agencies, such as the Social Security Administration  (SSA), reported known improper payments as receivables and provided  explanatory disclosures in the notes accompanying their financial  statements. Other agencies disclosed explanatory information in other  sections of their financial statement reports, such as in management\u2019s  discussion and analysis or in supplemental data sections. In addition,  reporting within agencies for different programs also varied. For example,  USDA disclosed improper payments of $1.4 billion for the Food Stamp  Program, but only acknowledged making improper payments without  providing a specific amount for its Federal Crop Insurance Corporation  (FCIC).", "Three of the nine agencies reported improper payments as expenses for 4  programs, while five agencies reported them as accounts receivable for 10  programs. Three agencies acknowledged making improper payments, but  did not quantify the dollar amounts for three programs. Eleven of the CFO  Act agencies did not report any information related to improper payments  in their financial statement reports. Such inconsistent financial reporting  makes it difficult to quantify the extent of the problem governmentwide  and indicates a need for more guidance. To address this issue, OMB is  contemplating revising its guidance to provide uniform reporting and  disclosure of improper payments by management. In addition, OMB has  made error reduction in the distribution of benefits a Priority Management  Objective, which is monitored by the OMB Director. OMB works with  agencies on an individual basis to address these issues in ways most  appropriate to the individual programs. For example, OMB is working with  ED and the Department of the Treasury to examine ways to implement new  statutory authorization for IRS verification of income of student aid  applicants, in accordance with existing tax and privacy laws.", "Table 1 lists the nine agencies and the manner in which they reported  improper payments in their fiscal year 1998 financial statement reports for  the 17 programs identified. See appendix II for a description of these  agencies and/or their programs.", "The extent of the problem for certain of these agencies\u2019 programs is  unknown because agencies are not performing comprehensive quality  control reviews to estimate the range and/or identify rates of improper  payments. For example:", "SSA reported $2.5 billion in gross receivables as overpayments related  to its Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program\u2014a $27 billion  program annually providing cash assistance to about 7 million  financially needy individuals who are aged, blind, or disabled. These  receivables consist of amounts specifically identified over multiple  years based on SSA\u2019s discussions with recipients and the results of its  efforts in matching data provided by recipients with information from  other federal and state agencies, such as IRS 1099 information, VA  benefits data, and state-maintained earnings and employment data. SSA  reports a statistically based accuracy rate for new SSI awards of 92.5  percent. However, this accuracy rate does not consider the medical  eligibility of recipients. Since the majority of SSI program dollars are  historically directed to recipients with medical disabilities, refining the  methodology to factor in any questions concerning medical risk is  critical to determining improper payments within this program.  According to SSA\u2019s year 2000 performance plan, SSA is developing a  comprehensive mechanism for quantifying dollar errors related to SSI  disability benefit payments. However, no timing for implementation has  yet been determined.", "Although HHS reported $12.6 billion in improper payments for its $177 billion Medicare Fee-for-Service program based on a statistically  valid sample, it has not attempted to estimate improper payments for  the $98 billion Medicaid program. The HHS IG reported that the Health  Care Financing Administration (HCFA)\u2014the HHS agency responsible  for overseeing the Medicaid program\u2014has no comprehensive quality  assurance program or other methodology in place for estimating  improper Medicaid payments. Administered by state agencies, Medicaid  provided health care services to approximately 33 million low-income  individuals. The IG recommended that HCFA work with the states to  develop a methodology to determine the range of improper payments in  the Medicaid program. However, developing a statistically valid  methodology to estimate Medicaid improper payments poses a  challenge. Other state-administered or intergovernmental programs also  face difficulties in developing estimates due to the variable nature of the  programs and the need to gain the cooperation of state and local  government officials nationwide. HCFA has recently drafted a strategy  for discussing this issue with states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Programs and Activities Have Improper Payments or Are at Risk", "paragraphs": ["Previous audits conducted by GAO and IGs have identified several other  agencies, such as DOD, ED, and IRS that had improper payments. As  illustrated in figure 2, between fiscal years 1994 and 1998, DOD contractors  voluntarily returned $984 million that DOD\u2019s Defense Finance and  Accounting Service (DFAS) erroneously paid them\u2014resulting from  inadvertent errors, such as paying the same invoice twice or misreading  invoice amounts. As a result, the contractors, as opposed to DOD, were  determining the existence and amount of erroneous payments. As part of  its stewardship duties, DOD is responsible for making these  determinations. However, DOD has not yet made a comprehensive estimate  of improper payments to its contractors, and there are likely more  overpayments that have yet to be identified and returned. With an annual  budget of over $130 billion in purchases involving contractors, DOD would  benefit from estimating the magnitude of improper payments.", "ED is another agency with improper payments. ED\u2019s student financial  assistance programs have been designated as high risk since our  governmentwide assessment of vulnerable federal programs began in 1990.  ED provides over $8 billion in grants to assist over 4 million students in  obtaining postsecondary education. As discussed in our January 1999  Performance and Accountability Series, ED-administered student  financial aid programs have a number of features that make them  inherently risky. They provide grants to a population composed largely of  students who would not otherwise have access to the funds necessary for  higher education. ED estimates that $78.9 million, or 1 percent, was  misspent by grantees in fiscal year 1997; however, an ED IG report  indicates that this estimate may be incomplete. A more complete estimate  would allow ED to identify areas of greater risk and target corrective  actions.", "Also, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program\u2014a refundable tax  credit available to low income, working taxpayers\u2014has historically been  vulnerable to high rates of invalid claims. During fiscal year 1998, IRS  reported that it processed EITC claims totaling over $29 billion, including  over $23 billion (79 percent) in refunds. Of the 290,000 EITC tax returns  with indications of errors or irregularities that IRS examiners reviewed,  $448 million (68 percent of the $662 million claimed) was found to be  invalid during fiscal year 1998. The IRS has not disclosed any estimated  improper payments in its financial statement reports. IRS examinations of  tax returns claiming EITC are important control mechanisms for detecting  questionable claims and providing a deterrent to future invalid claims.  However, because examinations are often performed after any related  refunds are disbursed, they are less efficient and effective than preventive  controls designed to identify invalid claims before refunds are made. OMB  has worked with IRS to start a 5-year compliance initiative to minimize  losses in this area. This initiative is intended to increase taxpayer  awareness, strengthen enforcement of EITC requirements, and research  sources of EITC noncompliance. EITC compliance efforts include a  significant focus on pre-refund fraud/error prevention and detection. For  example, the EITC compliance initiative includes recalculation of  erroneous overclaims, identification of questionable returns, and initiation  of many EITC audits, all of which should occur prior to issuing refunds.  However, our work has shown that even in cases where IRS has identified  potentially erroneous claims, it released refunds prior to completing the  reviews.", "Other types of federal programs and activities that undergo audits also risk  making improper payments. Internal control deficiencies and other  problems similar to those prevalent in programs that have acknowledged  improper payments suggest that additional federal financial assistance  programs, contract management activities, and other miscellaneous  programs may also be particularly vulnerable to disbursing improper  payments. For example, USDA\u2019s IG reported that the Natural Resources  Conservation Service (NRCS) exhibited significant control weaknesses  when determining if farmers qualified for annual payments under the  Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). CRP, which disbursed $1.7 billion in  fiscal year 1998, provides incentives and financial assistance to farmers and  ranchers to retire environmentally sensitive land from production. Due to  these control weaknesses, the USDA IG noted that CRP risked making  incorrect decisions. These incorrect decisions could result in USDA  disbursing improper payments. Without a measurement of the extent of  improper payments, it is difficult to assess the appropriate level of  management attention needed to mitigate these program risks.", "Once agencies have implemented methodologies to estimate the amount of  improper payments, they can use this information to develop error rates.  Agencies may find it useful to compute the dollar amount of errors as a  percentage of program outlays, and the number of transaction errors as a  percentage of the total number of transactions processed. Management  could then use these error rates to evaluate whether further action is  needed to address improper payments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Internal Control Weaknesses Cause Improper Payments", "paragraphs": ["Pervasive deficiencies in internal control across the federal government  result in the payment of federal funds for purposes other than those  originally intended. For example, several agencies face challenges in  ensuring adequate controls for assessing beneficiaries\u2019 initial and  continued eligibility due to ineffective data sharing and sources of  information. Also, some agencies have insufficient oversight and  monitoring mechanisms, such as site visits and reviews of appropriate  documentation, to ensure the validity of payments\u2014particularly for federal  financial assistance programs. Systems deficiencies also contribute to  improper payments when accurate or timely data are not always available  for payment decisions.

Initial and/or continued eligibility determination problems  were noted for 10 of the 17 programs that reported improper payments. For  instance, initial eligibility for HUD\u2019s Section 8 and Public Housing  programs\u2014providing $18.6 billion in rental assistance for lower income  families in fiscal year 1998\u2014is primarily based on an applicant\u2019s self- reported income. According to HUD\u2019s IG, HUD regulations require owners  and housing authorities to verify the information provided, but this process  often lacks effective controls to ensure that verifications are adequately  performed. In addition, the IG reported that recipients do not always report  complete or accurate information. Consequently, improper payments have  occurred. To improve HUD\u2019s procedures for verifying participant\u2019s income  and correct this long-standing problem, the HUD IG recommended the  following actions: (1) on-site reviews to assess first hand the housing  subsidy administrator\u2019s control environment, (2) confirmations with third  parties, and (3) computerized income verification matching to IRS and SSA  records. As discussed in our January 1999 Performance and Accountability  Series, HUD unveiled a multifaceted plan to identify households\u2019  unreported and/or underreported income in fiscal year 1998. The plan  includes steps to (1) further expand HUD\u2019s computer matching efforts, (2) strengthen recertification policies and procedures, (3) ensure that  HUD\u2019s information systems have accurate and complete data on tenants,  (4) institute penalties, and (5) perform monitoring and oversight functions.  OMB is also working with HUD in reducing payment errors in rental  assistance due to recipient underreporting of income.", "In another example, the DOL is challenged to correctly identify eligible  recipients for its Unemployment Insurance (UI) program, which in fiscal  year 1998 provided over 7 million unemployed workers with about $20  billion in temporary financial support to facilitate re-employment. The DOL  IG reported that state-administered claims offices, responsible for  determining eligibility requirements, have ineffective controls to verify  information provided by claimants. Claimants declaring themselves to be  U.S. citizens are not screened for immigration legal status, which in some  cases has resulted in improper payments. For example, ineligible  individuals, including illegal aliens, were paid millions of dollars over an  approximate 2-year time frame because states did not perform up-front  verification of social security numbers provided by claimants. OMB has  worked with DOL to secure a congressional authorization for an integrity  initiative focused on reducing benefit overpayments and improving UI tax  compliance.", "Our analysis of GAO and IG reports also showed that, as with initial  eligibility determinations, agencies\u2019 controls are insufficient to ensure the  continuing eligibility of beneficiaries for 8 of the 10 programs with  eligibility determination problems. For example, SSA is mandated to  perform reviews for continued eligibility for program benefits to aid in  preventing fraud, waste, and abuse in the Disability Insurance (DI)  program\u2014a program to provide a continuing income base for more than 6 million disabled workers and eligible members of their families. However,  acknowledged delays in performing these continuing disability reviews  have undermined the effectiveness of this control. Because SSA disburses  approximately $50 billion in disability benefit payments annually, it is  critical that these reviews be performed promptly; otherwise, beneficiaries  who are no longer eligible for this program may inappropriately receive  benefits. SSA has a multiyear plan to become current with all disability  reviews by 2002.", "Since 1996, the HUD IG has reported that HUD\u2019s housing subsidy  programs experience improper payments when beneficiaries\u2019 income  status changes and they do not notify housing authorities to adjust their  benefits. Various legal, technical, and administrative obstacles impede  housing authorities from ensuring that tenants report all income sources  during the periodic determination to assess continuing eligibility. HUD has  encouraged housing authorities to computer match with state agencies to  detect unreported income, since housing authorities lack the legislative  authority to access IRS and SSA data. However, little progress has been  made in this area, since most housing authorities do not have the systems  expertise to effectively implement this technique.", "In May 1998, the President\u2019s Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE)  issued a report to highlight the need for increased cooperation among  federal agencies in sharing income/financial resource information about  federal program beneficiaries in an effort to improve controls over  eligibility verification. For example, the report indicated that the DOL IG\u2019s  ability to ensure eligibility of Unemployment Insurance Program recipients  could be enhanced by verifying employment status of those recipients with  IRS or SSA wage records. Currently, DOL\u2019s IG must coordinate with states,  requiring subpoena authority in some cases, to obtain this information  from states. Also, governmentwide, there is no omnibus authority for  efficiently and effectively obtaining access to some data. We have work  ongoing on this issue and will report at a later date."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Oversight and Monitoring Controls Are Insufficient", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of GAO and IG reports showed that insufficient federal  monitoring and oversight of program expenditures exist in 7 of the 17  programs where agencies reported improper payments.

It includes  regular management and supervisory activities, such as periodic  comparisons of expected and actual results and reconciliation of data to its  source. Generally, activities such as site visits, reviews of progress and  financial reports filed by contractors and grantees, and reviews of  contracts and grant agreements are techniques often used by federal  officials to oversee and monitor programs.", "The lack of sufficient oversight and monitoring controls can lead to  improper payments by fostering an atmosphere that invites fraud. For  instance, both we and the HHS IG have reported that HCFA\u2019s insufficient  oversight of the Medicare program hampered it from preventing improper  Medicare payments. To fulfill its primary mission of providing health care  coverage for approximately 39 million aged individuals, Medicare pays  contractors to process claims for health care services. These contractors  are responsible for all aspects of claims administration and serve as HCFA\u2019s  front line of defense against fraud and abuse. Yet, vulnerabilities in  contractors\u2019 procedures for paying Medicare claims have provided a lax  environment. This environment permitted unscrupulous providers  opportunities to obtain additional unjustified payments. These activities  include billing for services never rendered, misrepresenting the nature of  services provided, duplicate billing, and providing services that were not  medically necessary. Although HCFA\u2019s most recent estimate of improper  payments in its $177 billion Medicare Fee-for-Service program amounted to  $12.6 billion, this estimate did not consider improper payments made as  part of another $33 billion Medicare Managed Care program. Therefore,  the impact of insufficient monitoring and oversight on improper payments  could be more extensive than current estimates indicate. To enhance  HCFA\u2019s oversight function, the HHS IG recommended that HCFA perform  risk assessments of contractor functions to identify those functions that  significantly affect the improper payment of claims. This would enable  HCFA to target areas and strengthen related controls.", "The Agency for International Development (AID), which spent $5.2 billion  in fiscal year 1998 to provide assistance to developing countries, also  suffers from insufficient monitoring and oversight. We reported that AID  does not have accurate information to ensure that its operations and  programs are being managed cost-effectively and efficiently. In addition,  AID\u2019s IG reported weaknesses in monitoring relief and rehabilitation  activities. For example, mission employees in Rwanda, who were asked to  monitor relief and rehabilitation activities, did not have basic  documentation they needed to monitor relief efforts, such as copies of  grant agreements, progress reports, and financial status reports. The  impact of this control deficiency on improper payments was not quantified.", "Based on previous GAO and IG reports, insufficient oversight and  monitoring is also present in other programs that have improper payments  but did not report them. For example, according to the ED IG, audits  performed under the Single Audit Act are ED\u2019s principal control for  ensuring that student financial assistance funds were being disbursed to  eligible students in proper amounts. However, the IG noted that ED did not  (1) ensure that all audit reports were received, (2) follow-up on problems  identified, or (3) have a systematic process in place to measure trends in  the misspending by grantees. The IG recommended that the department (1) complete the development of an ongoing process to identify  missing/delinquent audit reports, (2) take corrective actions against  delinquent audit report filers, and (3) develop a systematic methodology to  quantify costs to measure the effectiveness of monitoring efforts and  trends among institutions. The IG also recommended that the department  use a risk management model to determine how to effectively deploy  limited monitoring resources. Without this type of information, the  department is unable to make cost-benefit decisions to determine whether  to strengthen preventive internal controls."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Systems Deficiencies Exist", "paragraphs": ["Deficiencies in agencies\u2019 automated systems, or the lack of systems,  prevent personnel from accessing reliable and timely information, which is  integral to making disbursement decisions. As a result, improper payments  frequently occur because agency personnel lack needed information, rely  on inaccurate data, and/or do not have timely information. Agency systems  deficiencies have been identified in prior GAO and IG reports for 7 of the 17  programs reporting improper payments. For example, we reported that  interstate duplicate participation in the Food Stamp Program goes  undetected because there is no national system to identify participation in  more than one state. While states may currently learn of some duplicate  participation from SSA or through their own matching efforts with  neighboring states, they rely primarily on applicants and clients to  truthfully identify who resides in their households. USDA\u2019s Food and  Nutrition Service (FNS) manages the Food Stamp Program through  agreements with state agencies. Because USDA\u2019s most current annual  estimate indicates that food stamp overissuances account for over 7  percent of the program\u2019s $20 billion in annual benefit expenses, it is critical  that action be taken to strengthen systems and related controls. FNS is  considering whether to establish a central system to help ensure that  individuals participating in the Food Stamp Program are not being  improperly included in more than one state.", "System deficiencies are also a factor for agency programs that did not  disclose improper payments. For example, DOD\u2019s payment process suffers  from nonintegrated computer systems that require data to be entered more  than once in different systems, sometimes manually, which increases the  possibility of erroneous or incomplete data. Also, DOD contracts may have  from 1 to over 1,000 accounting classification reference numbers which  involve extensive data entry, also increasing the chance for errors. As  previously discussed, DOD contractors returned about $984 million  between fiscal years 1994 and 1998 to the DFAS in Columbus, Ohio, as a  result of duplicate and erroneous payments. We also reported that  pervasive weaknesses in access controls in the Air Force vendor payment  system application including inadequate separation of duties and other  internal control deficiencies resulted in fraudulent payments and left DOD  vulnerable to abuse. While no internal control system at DOD, or any other  agency, can guarantee the elimination of improper payments and the  prevention of fraud, resolving DOD\u2019s systems problems and designing  effective solutions to reduce related risks are of critical importance,  particularly since DOD expenditures comprise nearly half of the federal  government\u2019s discretionary spending. We made several recommendations  to resolve these deficiencies, such as suggesting that DOD limit vendor  payment system access levels to those appropriate for the user\u2019s assigned  duties. DOD has a number of initiatives underway to help ensure that  payments are proper\u2014including the development of a standard core  system for procurement. However, the new system is not scheduled to be  fully implemented for several years.", "Similar to DOD, ED also lacks a fully functional integrated database to  administer over $7 billion in federal student financial aid programs. As a  result, it remains vulnerable to losses because the department and schools  often do not have accurate, complete, and timely information on program  participants needed to effectively and efficiently operate and manage its  programs. We have reported that a lack of common identifiers for  students and institutions makes it difficult to track them across systems.  Because each system uses different combinations of data fields to uniquely  identify, access, and update student records, duplicate student records  have been identified in key systems. Many of ED\u2019s student financial aid  systems were developed independently over time by multiple contractors.  Consequently, ED relies on various contractors to operate its numerous  systems using different hardware and software. We recommended that  ED (1) develop and enforce a departmentwide systems architecture and (2) ensure that the developed systems architecture addresses systems  integration, common identifiers, and data standards. The Office of Student  Financial Assistance has developed its Modernization Blueprint to guide  the development of an integrated financial aid delivery system, which ED  officials stated depicts the first 3 years of a continuing process of  modernizing its system."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Program Design Issues Contribute to Improper Payments", "paragraphs": ["Often, the nature of a program can contribute to the disbursement of  improper payments.

However, strengthening business practices and  developing targets or goals for reducing improper payments can mitigate  the risk of improper payments occurring. Also, measuring progress in  relation to such targets or goals may serve as a measure of the  effectiveness of an agency\u2019s improper payment reduction program.

One example is the Medicaid program,  wherein states are responsible for determining the eligibility of  beneficiaries and disbursing related federal funds. According to HHS  regulations, states must have a payment error rate no greater than 3  percent due to errors in eligibility determinations or HHS may disallow  medical assistance payments. Another example is the Food Stamp Program  administered by state agencies under USDA regulations. In this program,  USDA may pay 50 percent of each state\u2019s cost of administering the  program. To encourage states to reduce their payment error rates, the  program includes an incentive. This incentive allows USDA to increase the  50 percent reimbursement for administrative costs, by as much as 10  percent, to a total of 60 percent based on reductions in states\u2019 error rates  below 6 percent and on other conditions.

For example, IRS\u2019 ability to successfully meet the financial  management challenges it faces must be balanced with the competing  demands placed on its resources by its customer service and tax law  compliance responsibilities. IRS is mandated to process tax refunds within  45 days of receipt of a tax return. If the refund is not processed within this  time, IRS must remit interest payments to the taxpayer. However, IRS\u2019  systems were not designed to handle this volume of information within  these time frames. Further, we reported that IRS lacks critical preventive  controls, such as comparing the information on tax returns to third-party  data such as W-2s (Wage and Tax Statements) in a timely manner. As a  result, the agency is unable to identify and correct discrepancies between  these documents that allow duplicate refunds to be issued. Although IRS  has detective (post-refund) controls in place, they often occur months after  the returns are submitted and processed. Insufficient preventive controls  expose the government to potentially significant losses due to  inappropriate disbursement of refunds.

FEMA provided over $2.2 billion in disaster relief in fiscal year 1998 to assist individuals,  families, communities, and states in responding to and recovering from  disasters, such as floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes. FEMA has set  demanding performance goals for its disaster assistance activities, from  acting within 12 hours on requests to supply disaster victims with water,  food, and shelter, to processing disaster housing applications from eligible  individuals within an average of 8 days.

Appendix III contains our assessment of the extent to which each agency  reporting improper payments addressed them in its performance plan. For  these and other agencies at risk, the first step in addressing improper  payments is to identify the magnitude of these payments.
