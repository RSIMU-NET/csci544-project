To address these objectives, GAO reviewed agency budget documents, OMB guidance, prior GAO reports, and performance plans and reports available as of January 2016 for all 24 CFO Act agencies.

Likewise, only proposed tax expenditures or those that expire are subject to review within congressional budget processes, similar to mandatory spending. Existing, non-expiring tax expenditures are not subject to such review.", "The Office and Management and Budget (OMB) and agencies have made limited progress identifying tax expenditures\u2019 contribution to agency goals. As of January 2016, 7 of the 24 Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act agencies identified tax expenditures as contributors to their agency goals\u2014as directed in OMB guidance\u2014or agency missions. The tax expenditures they identified accounted for only 11 of the 169 tax expenditures included in the President\u2019s Budget for Fiscal Year 2017, representing an estimated $31.9 billion of $1.23 trillion in forgone revenues for fiscal year 2015. Based on interviews with agencies and reviewing past GAO work, GAO found that a lack of clarity about agencies\u2019 roles leads to inaction in identifying tax expenditures that contribute to agency goals. To address this, OMB guidance previously stated that it would work with the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and other agencies to identify where tax expenditures align with agency goals. OMB removed that language in June 2015, citing capacity constraints. Without additional OMB and Treasury assistance, agencies may continue to have difficulty identifying whether, or which of, the remaining 158 tax expenditures\u2014representing $1.20 trillion in forgone revenues\u2014contribute to their goals.", "Based on an assessment of budget and tax experts\u2019 input and prior GAO work, GAO found that options to further incorporate tax expenditures into budgeting processes could help achieve various benefits; but policymakers would need to consider challenges and tradeoffs in deciding whether or how to implement them. For example, one option is to require that all, or some subset of, tax expenditures expire after a finite period. This option could result in greater oversight, requiring policymakers to explicitly decide whether to extend more or all tax expenditures. However, this option could lead to frequent changes in the tax code, such as from extended or expired tax expenditures, which can create uncertainty and make tax planning more difficult, as GAO has reported previously."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that OMB, in collaboration with Treasury, work with agencies to identify which tax expenditures contribute to agency goals.

These tax expenditures  represented an estimated total of $1.23 trillion in forgone revenue, an  amount similar to total discretionary spending. Tax expenditures often  aim to achieve policy goals similar to those of federal spending programs.  For example, some tax expenditures are intended to encourage economic  development in disadvantaged areas, finance postsecondary education,  or stimulate research and development. If well designed and effectively  implemented, tax expenditures can be an effective tool to further national  priorities.", "Our prior work has shown that tax expenditures deserve greater scrutiny.  In 1994, we reported that policymakers have few opportunities to make  explicit comparisons or trade-offs between tax expenditures and federal  spending programs. In 2005, we reported that the entire set of tools the  federal government can use to address national objectives\u2014including tax  expenditures\u2014should be subject to periodic reviews and reexamination to  ensure they are achieving their intended purposes, and are designed in  the most efficient and effective manner. In that report, we recommended  that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) take several actions to  help ensure that policymakers and the public have the necessary  information to make informed decisions, and to improve the progress  made toward exercising greater scrutiny of tax expenditures; OMB has  implemented one recommendation from the report, but has made limited  progress on the others.", "More recently, the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA)  enhanced the framework to help inform congressional and executive  branch decision making in addressing challenges the federal government  faces, including the allocation of scarce resources across spending  programs and tax expenditures.

We also coded the  extent to which agencies measured the impact of tax expenditures on  their strategic objectives, APGs, or overall mission. Our coding process  for the review involved one coder and an independent reviewer who  verified the material coded regarding tax expenditures.

We also interviewed budget and tax  experts, including current Treasury officials and OMB staff, former  congressional and OMB staff, former congressional budget directors, and  other experts from a range of policy research organizations that  represented a wide range of political views. We selected experts for our  interviews based on their published literature or having testified to  Congress on tax expenditures and federal budgeting, as well as referrals  from other experts. We considered options for further incorporating tax  expenditures into federal budgeting processes to be within scope if they  resulted in greater information or controls over tax expenditures in  processes related to executive budget formulation, congressional budget  processes, or federal evaluations that inform budget decisions. Based on  our review of the literature and interviews, as well as our previous work,  we identified five executive and five congressional budgeting options for  further review.", "To obtain greater insights into these and other options, we conducted a  one-day roundtable discussion with eleven experts on the broad benefits  and challenges of further incorporating tax expenditures into federal  budgeting processes, as well as the benefits and limitations of specific  options and issues that members of Congress would need to consider  when evaluating their merits. We selected experts for the roundtable  discussion based on their professional experiences with budget and tax  issues in various capacities, as well as on their knowledge on budget and  tax issues, as demonstrated through published articles, congressional  testimonies, and referrals from other experts.

For example, some tax expenditures  are used to provide economic relief to selected groups of taxpayers, such  as the elderly, the blind, and parents or guardians of children.  Policymakers have also long used tax expenditures as a tool to  accomplish national social and economic goals, such as encouraging  people to save for retirement, promoting home ownership or investments,  and funding certain research and development. Such goals are often  similar to those of mandatory and discretionary spending programs, and  tax expenditures may be used in combination with these types of  spending to achieve national objectives.", "The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974  identified six types of tax provisions that are considered tax expenditures  when they are exceptions to the normal tax structure, as described in  figure 1.", "The term tax expenditure has been used in the federal budget for four  decades, and the tax expenditure concept is a tool that the federal  government uses to allocate resources and achieve national priorities.

Many tax expenditures are  comparable to mandatory spending programs, for which spending is  determined by rules for eligibility, benefit formulas, and other  parameters. Other tax expenditures, such as the low-income housing  tax credit, resemble discretionary spending programs, for which Congress  appropriates specific funding each year. Nonetheless, deciding whether  a specific tax provision should be characterized as a tax expenditure is a  matter of judgment, and disagreements about classification stem from  different views about what should be included in the normal income tax  structure. For example, some argue that the distinction between tax  provisions labeled as tax expenditures, and provisions that are not, is  arbitrary; thus, labeling some provisions as tax expenditures implies that  all income inherently belongs to the government and could be taxed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fiscal Effect of Tax Expenditures", "paragraphs": ["Tax expenditures have a significant effect on overall tax rates as well as  the budget outlook.

In recent fiscal years, revenue losses from tax expenditures have  been similar to discretionary spending levels (see figure 2).", "Treasury\u2019s Office of Tax Analysis and the congressional Joint Committee  on Taxation (JCT) each annually compile their own lists of tax  expenditures and estimates of their revenue losses.

However, OMB  subsequently removed the language about working with Treasury and  agencies to align tax expenditures with agency goals in the June 2015  update to its guidance.

For example, we reported that HUD  community level data can be used to partially remedy limited IRS tax data  on Empowerment Zone (EZ) employment tax credits, which did not  identify which specific communities received EZ tax credits. However,  HUD only tracks a portion of EZ employment tax credits, and thus its data  do not completely mitigate the limitations of tax form data in identifying  which communities benefit from EZ tax credits.", "For some tax expenditures, evaluating performance may require  collecting additional tax form data.

Finally, it is difficult to measure the size of some tax  expenditures that are only loosely linked to actual tax filing data. While  the JCT and Treasury use modeling to estimate tax expenditure revenue  losses, in some cases little data are available and assumptions are made.  These broad challenges would need to be considered when assessing  how to approach the different options for further incorporating tax  expenditures into federal budgeting processes.", "Tax expenditures could be presented, for informational purposes, in the  congressional budget resolution alongside other spending by budget  function.

In 2005, when we recommended that OMB resume presenting  tax expenditures in the budget together with related spending programs,  OMB told us that the current presentation of tax expenditure  information\u2014that is, presenting tax expenditures separately from other  spending in the budget\u2014was sufficient for providing the public and  policymakers with what is useful to know about these provisions of the tax  code. In our roundtable, experts noted that tax expenditure estimates by  functional category were already included in budget documents, but also  acknowledged that having the information in different parts of budget  documents does not facilitate a side-by-side comparison.

Evaluations are studies that use  research methods to address specific questions about program  performance. In particular, evaluations can be designed to isolate the  causal impacts of programs from other external economic or  environmental conditions to assess a program\u2019s effectiveness. Treasury  does not regularly conduct evaluations of tax expenditures; rather, it  conducts some evaluations on an ad hoc basis.

However, they also noted  the potential for political influence in having any executive branch  agency conduct the evaluations, and that hiring nongovernmental  organizations to conduct these evaluations could be an alternative to  executive branch reviews. One expert suggested that a tax  expenditure commission with appointees from a balance of political  parties could identify which of these organizations would conduct  each review.", "How might policymakers address data challenges? Agencies may  not have access to confidential taxpayer data that they might need to  conduct evaluations, and existing IRS data may not be sufficient for  evaluating the efficiency, equity, and other effects of specific tax  expenditures. For these challenges with lack of access to data,  Congress has allowed some exceptions to laws limiting the disclosure  of taxpayer information to third parties. For the challenge of lack of  tax expenditure data, any party conducting an evaluation could, to  some extent, use data from other agencies or other sources, such as  public records, state agency records, and surveys, as previously  discussed. IRS could also be directed to collect more data that could  be used to evaluate a given tax expenditure, although such an effort  could increase taxpayer burden. Policymakers could also weigh the  availability of data on specific tax expenditures when deciding which  tax expenditures should or should not be evaluated.", "OMB could conduct reviews of portfolios of programs and other policy  instruments\u2014including tax expenditures\u2014used to help pursue similar  objectives. Currently, OMB generally reviews spending by agency rather  than by policy area.

For example, we previously  reported that 20 federal government entities administered 160 programs,  tax expenditures, and other tools that supported homeownership and  rental housing in fiscal year 2010. We have also previously reported that  coordinated reviews of tax expenditures with related spending programs  could help policymakers reduce overlap and inconsistencies and direct  scarce resources to the most effective or least costly methods to deliver  federal support.

In September 2015, OMB staff told us that OMB had  determined that there were no tax expenditures that were critical to  support achievement of current CAP goals. However, as new CAP  goals are established, tax expenditures may support their  achievement.

As we have reported previously, creating a  comprehensive list of federal programs along with related funding  information is critical for identifying potential duplication, overlap, or  fragmentation among federal programs or activities. GPRAMA  requires OMB to publish a list of all federal programs on a central  government-wide website. In October 2014, we reported that although  OMB and agencies have taken some initial steps to develop program  inventories with related budget and performance information, the  ensuing result has not produced a useful tool for decision making.  We made various recommendations to OMB to better present a more  coherent picture of all federal programs and ensure that the  information agencies provide in their inventories is useful to federal  decision makers. For example, one of our recommendations was that  OMB, in coordination with Treasury, develop a tax expenditure  inventory that identifies each tax expenditure and describes its  definition, purpose, and related performance and budget information;  as of November 2015, no action had been taken on that  recommendation. Such information could help agencies identify the  contributions of tax expenditures to achieving national priorities.", "Policymakers could help ensure greater coordination between the tax- writing and authorizing committees by having authorizing committees  consider new or modified tax expenditure legislation for which they have  program-related expertise.

Authorizing committees, on the other  hand, are referred proposed legislation for policy areas within their  jurisdiction, but generally do not provide direct and formal input on  legislation of related tax provisions in those policy areas.", "By being involved in developing or modifying tax expenditure legislation,  authorizing committees would have a broader picture of federal resources  being allocated to national priorities. This may further help policymakers  identify potential duplication between spending programs and tax  expenditures, and may allow for greater comparison of how well specific  policy tools help achieve a national priority. While bringing other  committees into the process of reviewing tax expenditures could be  institutionally cumbersome, having tax-writing and authorizing committees  review tax legislation may still be appropriate when a provision has both  programmatic purposes, like stimulating an activity, and tax policy  purposes, like taking into account taxpayers\u2019 ability to pay taxes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Design Consideration", "paragraphs": ["What path through committees would new tax legislation take?", "Proponents of this option suggested various ways that both tax-writing  and authorizing committees could provide input when considering  proposed tax legislation.

Policymakers would need to overcome the challenges of  treating tax expenditures on the same footing as spending  programs\u2014particularly with respect to budget controls that are  enforced. Specifically, some tax expenditure estimates are only  loosely linked to actual tax filing data. Thus, any prior-year levels of  spending for these tax expenditures are only estimates. In contrast,  spending programs are measured in obligations and outlays, which  are generally measured by the specific amounts of cash committed  and disbursed by the government, respectively. However, this  measurement challenge is not unique to tax expenditures. For  example, experts noted that credit programs are also difficult to  measure, but policymakers have made progress in measuring the  costs of these types of programs through increased scrutiny and  requirements for agencies.", "Policymakers could require that all, or some subset of, tax expenditures  expire after a finite period. This option would result in Congress  periodically considering whether to allow tax expenditures to expire or to  extend them, similar to the subset of tax expenditures that currently  expire unless extended. Most other tax expenditures are enacted  permanently and continue without change unless amended. Under Pay- As-You-Go (PAYGO) rules, this option would result in the tax-writing  committees needing to find revenues to offset the cost of extending  expiring tax expenditures. However, Congress could incorporate the  cost of extending expiring tax expenditures in its baseline revenue  estimates, thus negating the need to find offsetting revenues, or it could  waive the PAYGO rules on a case-by-case basis.
