Federal agencies and our nation\u2019s critical  infrastructures\u2014such as energy, transportation systems,  communications, and financial services\u2014are dependent on information  technology (IT) systems and electronic data to carry out operations and to  process, maintain, and report essential information. The security of these  systems and data is vital to public confidence and national security,  prosperity, and well-being.", "Many of these systems contain vast amounts of personally identifiable  information (PII), thus making it imperative to protect the confidentiality,  integrity, and availability of this information and effectively respond to data  breaches and security incidents, when they occur. Underscoring the  importance of this issue, we continue to designate information security as  a government-wide high-risk area in our most recent biennial report to  Congress\u2014a designation we have made in each report since 1997.", "The risks to IT systems supporting the federal government and the  nation\u2019s critical infrastructure are increasing as security threats continue  to evolve and become more sophisticated. These risks include insider  threats from witting or unwitting employees, escalating and emerging  threats from around the globe, steady advances in the sophistication of  attack technology, and the emergence of new and more destructive  attacks.", "In particular, foreign nations\u2014where adversaries may possess  sophisticated levels of expertise and significant resources to pursue their  objectives\u2014pose increasing risks. Rapid developments in new  technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things  (IoT), makes the threat landscape even more complex and can also  potentially introduce security, privacy, and safety issues that were  previously unknown.", "Compounding these risks, IT systems are often riddled with security  vulnerabilities\u2014both known and unknown. These vulnerabilities can  facilitate security incidents and cyberattacks that disrupt critical  operations; lead to inappropriate access to and disclosure, modification,  or destruction of sensitive information; and threaten national security,  economic well-being, and public health and safety. This is illustrated by  significant security breaches reported by the Office of Personnel  Management (OPM) in 2015 that resulted in the loss of PII for an  estimated 22.1 million individuals and, more recently, in 2017, a security  breach reported by Equifax\u2014one of the nation\u2019s largest credit bureaus\u2014 that resulted in the loss of PII for an estimated 148 million U.S.  consumers.", "At your request, my testimony updates the information security high-risk  area by identifying actions that the federal government and other entities  need to take to address cybersecurity challenges facing the nation. This  statement reflects work we conducted since the prior high-risk update  was issued in February 2017, among other things. We also plan to issue  an updated assessment of this high-risk area in February 2019.", "In conducting the work for this update, we first identified cybersecurity  areas in which the federal government has experienced challenges. To  do so, we primarily reviewed our prior work issued since the start of fiscal  year 2016 related to privacy, critical federal functions, and cybersecurity  incidents, among other areas (see appendix I for a list of our prior work).  We also reviewed recent cybersecurity policy and strategy documents  issued by the current administration, such as Executive Order 13800,  Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical  Infrastructure, the National Security Strategy, and the Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) May 2018 cybersecurity strategy. We then  analyzed these documents to determine the extent to which they included  GAO\u2019s desirable characteristics of a national strategy. We also reviewed  recent media and information security industry reports of cyberattacks  and security breaches. Based on these actions, we identified four  cybersecurity areas in which federal agencies had experience challenges.", "To identify the actions needed to address each challenge area, we  reviewed the findings of our work specific to each challenge, the status of  our prior recommendations to the Executive Office of the President and  federal agencies, and any actions taken by these entities to address our  recommendations. In reviewing the status of prior recommendations, we  also determined which recommendations had not been implemented and  what additional actions, if any, the Executive Office of the President and  federal agencies needed to take in order to address them. We then  summarized the actions needed and the status of our prior  recommendations. We also identified our ongoing work related to each  action.", "We conducted the work on which this testimony is based in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on  our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["IT systems supporting federal agencies and our nation\u2019s critical  infrastructures are inherently at risk. These systems are highly complex  and dynamic, technologically diverse, and often geographically dispersed.  This complexity increases the difficulty in identifying, managing, and  protecting the numerous operating systems, applications, and devices  comprising the systems and networks.", "Compounding the risk, federal systems and networks are also often  interconnected with other internal and external systems and networks,  including the Internet. This increases the number of avenues of attack  and expands their attack surface. As systems become more integrated,  cyber threats will pose an increasing risk to national security, economic  well-being, and public health and safety.", "Advancements in technology, such as data analytics software for  searching and collecting information, have also made it easier for  individuals and organizations to correlate data (including PII) and track it  across large and numerous databases. For example, social media has  been used as a mass communication tool where PII can be gathered in  vast amounts. In addition, ubiquitous Internet and cellular connectivity  makes it easier to track individuals by allowing easy access to information  pinpointing their locations. These advances\u2014combined with the  increasing sophistication of hackers and others with malicious intent, and  the extent to which both federal agencies and private companies collect  sensitive information about individuals\u2014have increased the risk of PII  being exposed and compromised.", "Cybersecurity incidents continue to impact entities across various critical  infrastructure sectors. For example, in its 2018 annual data breach  investigations report, Verizon reported that 53,308 security incidents  and 2,216 data breaches were identified across 65 countries in the 12  months since its prior report. Further, the report noted that cybercriminals  can often compromise a system in just a matter of minutes\u2014or even  seconds, but that it can take an organization significantly longer to  discover the breach. Specifically, the report stated nearly 90 percent of  the reported breaches occurred within minutes, while nearly 70 percent  went undiscovered for months.", "These concerns are further highlighted by the number of information  security incidents reported by federal executive branch civilian agencies  to DHS\u2019s U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT). For  fiscal year 2017, 35,277 such incidents were reported by the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) in its 2018 annual report to Congress,  as mandated by the Federal Information Security Modernization Act  (FISMA). These incidents include, for example, web-based attacks,  phishing, and the loss or theft of computing equipment.", "Different types of incidents merit different response strategies. However,  if an agency cannot identify the threat vector (or avenue of attack), it  could be difficult for that agency to define more specific handling  procedures to respond to the incident and take actions to minimize similar  future attacks. In this regard, incidents with a threat vector categorized as  \u201cother\u201d (which includes avenues of attacks that are unidentified) made up  31 percent of the various incidents reported to US-CERT. Figure 1 shows  the percentage of the different types of incidents reported across each of  the nine threat vector categories for fiscal year 2017, as reported by  OMB.", "These incidents and others like them can pose a serious challenge to  economic, national, and personal privacy and security. The following  examples highlight the impact of such incidents:  In March 2018, the Mayor of Atlanta, Georgia reported that the city  was victimized by a ransomware cyberattack. As a result, city  government officials stated that customers were not able to access  multiple applications that are used to pay bills or access court related  information. In response to the attack, the officials noted that they  were working with numerous private and governmental partners,  including DHS, to assess what occurred and determine how best to  protect the city from future attacks.", "In March 2018, the Department of Justice reported that it had indicted  nine Iranians for conducting a massive cybersecurity theft campaign  on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. According to the  department, the nine Iranians allegedly stole more than 31 terabytes  of documents and data from more than 140 American universities, 30  U.S. companies, and five federal government agencies, among other  entities.", "In March 2018, a joint alert from DHS and the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI) stated that, since at least March 2016, Russian  government actors had targeted the systems of multiple U.S.  government entities and critical infrastructure sectors. Specifically, the  alert stated that Russian government actors had affected multiple  organizations in the energy, nuclear, water, aviation, construction, and  critical manufacturing sectors.", "In July 2017, a breach at Equifax resulted in the loss of PII for an  estimated 148 million U.S. consumers. According to Equifax, the  hackers accessed people\u2019s names, Social Security numbers (SSN),  birth dates, addresses and, in some instances, driver\u2019s license  numbers.", "In April 2017, the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service  (IRS) testified that the IRS had disabled its data retrieval tool in early  March 2017 after becoming concerned about the misuse of taxpayer  data. Specifically, the agency suspected that PII obtained outside the  agency\u2019s tax system was used to access the agency\u2019s online federal  student aid application in an attempt to secure tax information through  the data retrieval tool. In April 2017, the agency began notifying  taxpayers who could have been affected by the breach.", "In June 2015, OPM reported that an intrusion into its systems had  affected the personnel records of about 4.2 million current and former  federal employees. Then, in July 2015, the agency reported that a  separate, but related, incident had compromised its systems and the  files related to background investigations for 21.5 million individuals.  In total, OPM estimated 22.1 million individuals had some form of PII  stolen, with 3.6 million being a victim of both breaches."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Information Security Included on GAO\u2019s High-Risk List Since 1997", "paragraphs": ["Safeguarding federal IT systems and the systems that support critical  infrastructures has been a long-standing concern of GAO. Due to  increasing cyber-based threats and the persistent nature of information  security vulnerabilities, we have designated information security as a  government-wide high-risk area since 1997. In 2003, we expanded the  information security high-risk area to include the protection of critical  cyber infrastructure. At that time, we highlighted the need to manage  critical infrastructure protection activities that enhance the security of the  cyber and physical public and private infrastructures that are essential to  national security, national economic security, and/or national public health  and safety.", "We further expanded the information security high-risk area in 2015 to  include protecting the privacy of PII. Since then, advances in technology  have enhanced the ability of government and private sector entities to  collect and process extensive amounts of PII, which has posed  challenges to ensuring the privacy of such information. In addition, high- profile PII breaches at commercial entities, such as Equifax, heightened  concerns that personal privacy is not being adequately protected.", "Our experience has shown that the key elements needed to make  progress toward being removed from the High-Risk List are top-level  attention by the administration and agency leaders grounded in the five  criteria for removal, as well as any needed congressional action. The five  criteria for removal that we identified in November 2000 are as follows:", "Leadership Commitment. Demonstrated strong commitment and top  leadership support.", "Capacity. The agency has the capacity (i.e., people and resources) to  resolve the risk(s).", "Action Plan. A corrective action plan exists that defines the root  cause, solutions, and provides for substantially completing corrective  measures, including steps necessary to implement solutions we  recommended.", "Monitoring. A program has been instituted to monitor and  independently validate the effectiveness and sustainability of  corrective measures.", "Demonstrated Progress. Ability to demonstrate progress in  implementing corrective measures and in resolving the high-risk area.", "These five criteria form a road map for efforts to improve and ultimately  address high-risk issues. Addressing some of the criteria leads to  progress, while satisfying all of the criteria is central to removal from the  list. Figure 2 shows the five criteria and illustrative actions taken by  agencies to address the criteria. Importantly, the actions listed are not  \u201cstand alone\u201d efforts taken in isolation from other actions to address high- risk issues. That is, actions taken under one criterion may be important to  meeting other criteria as well. For example, top leadership can  demonstrate its commitment by establishing a corrective action plan  including long-term priorities and goals to address the high-risk issue and  using data to gauge progress\u2014actions which are also vital to monitoring  criteria.", "As we reported in the February 2017 high-risk report, the federal  government\u2019s efforts to address information security deficiencies had fully  met one of the five criteria for removal from the High-Risk List\u2014 leadership commitment\u2014and partially met the other four, as shown in  figure 3.

To address these challenges, we have  identified 10 critical actions that the federal government and other entities  need to take (see figure 4). The four challenges and the 10 actions  needed to address them are summarized following the table."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Establishing a Comprehensive Cybersecurity Strategy and Performing Effective Oversight", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has been challenged in establishing a  comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and in performing effective  oversight as called for by federal law and policy. Specifically, we have  previously reported that the federal government has faced challenges in  establishing a comprehensive strategy to provide a framework for how the  United States will engage both domestically and internationally on  cybersecurity related matters. We have also reported on challenges in  performing oversight, including monitoring the global supply chain,  ensuring a highly skilled cyber workforce, and addressing risks  associated with emerging technologies. The federal government can take  four key actions to improve the nation\u2019s strategic approach to, and  oversight of, cybersecurity.", "Develop and execute a more comprehensive federal strategy for  national cybersecurity and global cyberspace. In February 2013  we reported that the government had issued a variety of strategy- related documents that addressed priorities for enhancing  cybersecurity within the federal government as well as for  encouraging improvements in the cybersecurity of critical  infrastructure within the private sector; however, no overarching  cybersecurity strategy had been developed that articulated priority  actions, assigned responsibilities for performing them, and set  timeframes for their completion. Accordingly, we recommended that  the White House Cybersecurity Coordinator in the Executive Office  of the President develop an overarching federal cybersecurity strategy  that included all key elements of the desirable characteristics of a  national strategy including, among other things, milestones and  performance measures for major activities to address stated priorities;  cost and resources needed to accomplish stated priorities; and  specific roles and responsibilities of federal organizations related to  the strategy\u2019s stated priorities.", "In response to our recommendation, in October 2015, the Director of  OMB and the Federal Chief Information Officer, issued a  Cybersecurity Strategy and Implementation Plan for the Federal  Civilian Government. The plan directed a series of actions to  improve capabilities for identifying and detecting vulnerabilities and  threats, enhance protections of government assets and information,  and further develop robust response and recovery capabilities to  ensure readiness and resilience when incidents inevitably occur. The  plan also identified key milestones for major activities, resources  needed to accomplish milestones, and specific roles and  responsibilities of federal organizations related to the strategy\u2019s  milestones.", "Since that time, the executive branch has made progress toward  outlining a federal strategy for confronting cyber threats. Table 1  identifies these recent efforts and a description of their related  contents.", "These efforts provide a good foundation toward establishing a more  comprehensive strategy, but more effort is needed to address all of  the desirable characteristics of a national strategy that we  recommended. The recently issued executive branch strategy  documents did not include key elements of desirable characteristics  that can enhance the usefulness of a national strategy as guidance for  decision makers in allocating resources, defining policies, and helping  to ensure accountability. Specifically:", "Milestones and performance measures to gauge results were  generally not included in strategy documents. For example,  although the DHS Cybersecurity Strategy stated that its  implementation would be assessed on an annual basis, it did not  describe the milestones and performance measures for tracking  the effectiveness of the activities intended to meet the stated  goals (e.g., protecting critical infrastructure and responding  effectively to cyber incidents). Without such performance  measures, DHS will lack a means to ensure that the goals and  objectives discussed in the document are accomplished and that  responsible parties are held accountable.", "According to officials from DHS\u2019s Office of Cybersecurity and  Communications, the department is developing a plan for  implementing the DHS Cybersecurity Strategy and expects to  issue the plan by mid-August 2018. The officials stated that the  plan is expected to identify milestones, roles, and responsibilities  across DHS to inform the prioritization of future efforts.", "The strategy documents generally did not include information  regarding the resources needed to carry out the goals and  objectives. For example, although the DHS Cybersecurity Strategy  identified a variety of actions the agency planned to take to  perform their cybersecurity mission, it did not articulate the  resources needed to carry out these actions and requirements.  Without information on the specific resources needed, federal  agencies may not be positioned to allocate such resources and  investments and, therefore, may be hindered in their ability to  meet national priorities.", "Most of the strategy documents lacked clearly defined roles and  responsibilities for key agencies, such as DHS, DOD, and OMB.  These agencies contribute substantially to the nation\u2019s  cybersecurity programs. For example, although the National  Security Strategy discusses multiple priority actions needed to  address the nation\u2019s cybersecurity challenges (e.g. building  defensible government networks and deterring and disrupting  malicious cyber actors), it does not describe the roles,  responsibilities, or the expected coordination of any specific  federal agencies, including DHS, DOD, or OMB, or other non- federal entities needed to carry out those actions. Without this  information, the federal government may not be able to foster  effective coordination, particularly where there is overlap in  responsibilities, or hold agencies accountable for carrying out  planned activities.", "Ultimately, a more clearly defined, coordinated, and comprehensive  approach to planning and executing an overall strategy would likely  lead to significant progress in furthering strategic goals and lessening  persistent weaknesses.", "Mitigate global supply chain risks. The global, geographically  disperse nature of the producers and suppliers of IT products is a  growing concern. We have previously reported on potential issues  associated with IT supply chain and risks originating from foreign- manufactured equipment. For example, in July 2017, we reported that  the Department of State had relied on certain device manufacturers,  software developers, and contractor support which had suppliers that  were reported to be headquartered in a cyber-threat nation (e.g.,  China and Russia). We further pointed out that the reliance on  complex, global IT supply chains introduces multiple risks to federal  agencies, including insertion of counterfeits, tampering, or installation  of malicious software or hardware.", "Earlier this month, we testified that if such global IT supply chain risks  are realized, they could jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and  availability of federal information systems. Thus, the potential exists  for serious adverse impact on an agency\u2019s operations, assets, and  employees. These factors highlight the importance and urgency of  federal agencies appropriately assessing, managing, and monitoring  IT supply chain risk as part of their agencywide information security  programs.", "Address cybersecurity workforce management challenges. The  federal government faces challenges in ensuring that the nation\u2019s  cybersecurity workforce has the appropriate skills. For example, in  June 2018, we reported on federal efforts to implement the  requirements of the Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act  of 2015. We determined that most of the Chief Financial Officers  (CFO) Act agencies had not fully implemented all statutory  requirements, such as developing procedures for assigning codes to  cybersecurity positions. Further, we have previously reported that  DHS and DOD had not addressed cybersecurity workforce  management requirements set forth in federal laws. In addition, we  have reported in the last 2 years that federal agencies (1) had not  identified and closed cybersecurity skills gaps, (2) had been  challenged with recruiting and retaining qualified staff, and (3) had  difficulty navigating the federal hiring process.", "A recent executive branch report also discussed challenges  associated with the cybersecurity workforce. Specifically, in response  to Executive Order 13800, the Department of Commerce and DHS led  an interagency working group exploring how to support the growth  and sustainment of future cybersecurity employees in the public and  private sectors. In May 2018, the departments issued a report that  identified key findings, including:  the U.S. cybersecurity workforce needs immediate and sustained  improvements;  the pool of cybersecurity candidates needs to be expanded  through retraining and by increasing the participation of women,  minorities, and veterans; a shortage exists of cybersecurity teachers at the primary and  secondary levels, faculty in higher education, and training  instructors; and  comprehensive and reliable data about cybersecurity workforce  position needs and education and training programs are lacking.", "The report also included recommendations and proposed actions to  address the findings, including that private and public sectors should  (1) align education and training with employers\u2019 cybersecurity  workforce needs by applying the National Initiative for Cybersecurity  Education Cybersecurity Workforce Framework; (2) develop  cybersecurity career model paths; and (3) establish a clearinghouse  of information on cybersecurity workforce development education,  training, and workforce development programs and initiatives.", "In addition, in June 2018, the executive branch issued a government  reform plan and reorganization recommendations that included,  among other things, proposals for solving the federal cybersecurity  workforce shortage. In particular, the plan notes that the  administration intends to prioritize and accelerate ongoing efforts to  reform the way that the federal government recruits, evaluates,  selects, pays, and places cyber talent across the enterprise. The plan  further states that, by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, all  CFO Act agencies, in coordination with DHS and OMB, are to develop  a critical list of vacancies across their organizations. Subsequently,  OMB and DHS are to analyze these lists and work with OPM to  develop a government-wide approach to identifying or recruiting new  employees or reskilling existing employees. Regarding cybersecurity  training, the plan notes that OMB is to consult with DHS to  standardize training for cybersecurity employees, and should work to  develop an enterprise-wide training process for government  cybersecurity employees.", "Ensure the security of emerging technologies. As the devices  used in daily life become increasingly integrated with technology, the  risk to sensitive data and PII also grows. Over the last several years,  we have reported on weaknesses in addressing vulnerabilities  associated with emerging technologies, including:  IoT devices, such as fitness trackers, cameras, and thermostats,  that continuously collect and process information are potentially  vulnerable to cyber-attacks;  IoT devices, such as those acquired and used by DOD employees  or that DOD itself acquires (e.g., smartphones), may increase the  security risks to the department;  vehicles that are potentially susceptible to cyber-attack through  technology, such as Bluetooth;  the unknown impact of artificial intelligence cybersecurity; and advances in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.", "Executive branch agencies have also highlighted the challenges  associated with ensuring the security of emerging technologies.  Specifically, in a May 2018 report issued in response to Executive  Order 13800, the Department of Commerce and DHS issued a report  on the opportunities and challenges in reducing the botnet threat.  The opportunities and challenges are centered on six principal  themes, including the global nature of automated, distributed attacks;  effective tools; and awareness and education. The report also  provides recommended actions, including that federal agencies  should increase their understanding of what software components  have been incorporated into acquired products and establish a public  campaign to support awareness of IoT security.", "In our previously discussed reports related to this cybersecurity  challenge, we made a total of 50 recommendations to federal agencies to  address the weaknesses identified. As of July 2018, 48 recommendations  had not been implemented. These outstanding recommendations include  8 priority recommendations, meaning that we believe that they warrant  priority attention from heads of key departments and agencies. These  priority recommendations include addressing weaknesses associated  with, among other things, agency-specific cybersecurity workforce  challenges and agency responsibilities for supporting mitigation of vehicle  network attacks. Until our recommendations are fully implemented,  federal agencies may be limited in their ability to provide effective  oversight of critical government-wide initiatives, address challenges with  cybersecurity workforce management, and better ensure the security of  emerging technologies.", "In addition to our prior work related to the federal government\u2019s efforts to  establish key strategy documents and implement effective oversight, we  also have several ongoing reviews related to this challenge. These  include reviews of:  the CFO Act agencies\u2019 efforts to submit complete and reliable  baseline assessment reports of their cybersecurity workforces;  the extent to which DOD has established training standards for cyber  mission force personnel, and efforts the department has made to  achieve its goal of a trained cyber mission force;  selected agencies\u2019 ability to implement cloud service technologies and  notable benefits this might have on agencies; and  the federal approach and strategy to securing agency information  systems, to include federal intrusion detection and prevention  capabilities and the intrusion assessment plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Securing Federal Systems and Information", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has been challenged in securing federal systems  and information.

As such, it is important that federal agencies take appropriate  steps to better ensure they have effectively implemented programs to  protect their information and systems. We have identified three actions  that the agencies can take.", "Improve implementation of government-wide cybersecurity  initiatives. Specifically, in January 2016, we reported that DHS had  not ensured that the National Cybersecurity Protection System  (NCPS) had fully satisfied all intended system objectives related to  intrusion detection and prevention, information sharing, and  analytics. In addition, in February 2017, we reported that the DHS  National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center\u2019s  (NCCIC) functions were not being performed in adherence with the  principles set forth in federal laws. We noted that, although NCCIC  was sharing information about cyber threats in the way it should, the  center did not have metrics to measure that the information was  timely, relevant and actionable, as prescribed by law.", "Address weaknesses in federal information security programs.  We have previously identified a number of weaknesses in agencies\u2019  protection of their information and information systems. For example,  over the past 2 years, we have reported that: most of the 24 agencies covered by the CFO Act had weaknesses  in each of the five major categories of information system controls  (i.e., access controls, configuration management controls,  segregation of duties, contingency planning, and agency-wide  security management);  three agencies\u2014the Securities Exchange Commission, the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Food and Drug  Administration\u2014had not effectively implemented aspects of their  information security programs, which resulted in weaknesses in  these agencies\u2019 security controls;  information security weaknesses in selected high-impact systems  at four agencies\u2014the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, OPM, and  the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2014were cited as a key reason  that the agencies had not effectively implemented elements of  their information security programs;", "DOD\u2019s process for monitoring the implementation of cybersecurity  guidance had weaknesses and resulted in the closure of certain  tasks (such as completing cyber risk assessments) before they  were fully implemented; and agencies had not fully defined the role of their Chief Information  Security Officers, as required by FISMA.", "We also recently testified that, although the government had acted to  protect federal information systems, additional work was needed to  improve agency security programs and cyber capabilities.

This infrastructure includes both  public and private systems vital to national security and other efforts, such  as providing the essential services that underpin American society. As the  cybersecurity threat to these systems continues to grow, federal agencies  have millions of sensitive records that must be protected. Specifically, this  critical infrastructure threat could have national security implications and  more efforts should be made to ensure that it is not breached.", "To help address this issue, NIST developed the cybersecurity  framework\u2014a voluntary set of cybersecurity standards and procedures  for industry to adopt as a means of taking a risk-based approach to  managing cybersecurity.", "However, additional action is needed to strengthen the federal role in  protecting the critical infrastructure. Specifically, we have reported on  other critical infrastructure protection issues that need to be addressed.  For example:", "Entities within the 16 critical infrastructure sectors reported  encountering four challenges to adopting the cybersecurity  framework, such as being limited in their ability to commit necessary  resources towards framework adoption and not having the necessary  knowledge and skills to effectively implement the framework.", "Major challenges existed to securing the electricity grid against cyber  threats. These challenges included monitoring implementation of  cybersecurity standards, ensuring security features are built into smart  grid systems, and establishing metrics for cybersecurity.", "DHS and other agencies needed to enhance cybersecurity in the  maritime environment. Specifically, DHS did not include cyber risks in  its risk assessments that were already in place nor did it address  cyber risks in guidance for port security plans.", "Sector-specific agencies were not properly addressing progress or  metrics to measure their progress in cybersecurity.", "DOD and the Federal Aviation Administration identified a variety of  operations and physical security risks that could adversely affect DOD  missions.", "We made a total of 19 recommendations to federal agencies to address  these weaknesses and others. These recommendations include, for  example, a total of 9 recommendations to 9 sector-specific agencies to  develop methods to determine the level and type of cybersecurity  framework adoption across their respective sectors. As of July 2018, all  19 recommendations had not been implemented. Until these  recommendations are implemented, the federal government will continue  to be challenged in fulfilling its role in protecting the nation\u2019s critical  infrastructure.", "In addition to our prior work related to the federal government\u2019s efforts to  protect critical infrastructure, we also have several ongoing reviews  focusing on:  the physical and cybersecurity risks to pipelines across the country  responsible for transmitting oil, natural gas, and other hazardous  liquids;  the cybersecurity risks to the electric grid; and  the privatization of utilities at DOD installations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Protecting Privacy and Sensitive Data", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has been challenged in protecting privacy and  sensitive data. Advances in technology, including powerful search  technology and data analytics software, have made it easy to correlate  information about individuals across large and numerous databases,  which have become very inexpensive to maintain. In addition, ubiquitous  Internet connectivity has facilitated sophisticated tracking of individuals  and their activities through mobile devices such as smartphones and  fitness trackers.", "Given that access to data is so pervasive, personal privacy hinges on  ensuring that databases of PII maintained by government agencies or on  their behalf are protected both from inappropriate access (i.e., data  breaches) as well as inappropriate use (i.e., for purposes not originally  specified when the information was collected). Likewise, the trend in the  private sector of collecting extensive and detailed information about  individuals needs appropriate limits. The vast number of individuals  potentially affected by data breaches at federal agencies and private  sector entities in recent years increases concerns that PII is not being  properly protected.", "Federal agencies should take two types of actions to address this  challenge area. In addition, we have previously proposed two matters for  congressional consideration aimed toward better protecting PII.", "Improve federal efforts to protect privacy and sensitive data. We  have issued several reports noting that agencies had deficiencies in  protecting privacy and sensitive data that needed to be addressed.

For example:", "The emergence of IoT devices can facilitate the collection of  information about individuals without their knowledge or consent;", "Federal laws for smartphone tracking applications have not  generally been well enforced.", "The FBI has not fully ensured privacy and accuracy related to the  use of face recognition technology.", "We have previously suggested that Congress consider amending laws,  such as the Privacy Act of 1974 and the E-Government Act of 2002,  because they may not consistently protect PII. Specifically, we found  that while these laws and guidance set minimum requirements for  agencies, they may not consistently protect PII in all circumstances of its  collection and use throughout the federal government and may not fully  adhere to key privacy principles. However, revisions to the Privacy Act  and the E-Government Act have not yet been enacted.", "Further, we also suggested that Congress consider strengthening the  consumer privacy framework and review issues such as the adequacy  of consumers\u2019 ability to access, correct, and control their personal  information; and privacy controls related to new technologies such as web  tracking and mobile devices. However, these suggested changes have  not yet been enacted.", "We also made a total of 29 recommendations to federal agencies to  address the weaknesses identified. As of July 2018, 28 recommendations  had not been implemented. These outstanding recommendations include  6 priority recommendations to address weaknesses associated with,  among other things, publishing privacy impact assessments and  improving the accuracy of the FBI\u2019s face recognition services. Until these  recommendations are implemented, federal agencies will be challenged  in their ability to protect privacy and sensitive data and ensure that its  collection and use is appropriately limited.", "In addition to our prior work, we have several ongoing reviews related to  protecting privacy and sensitive data. These include reviews of:  IRS\u2019s taxpayer authentication efforts, including what steps the agency  is taking to monitor and improve its authentication methods;  the extent to which the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Federal  Student Aid\u2019s policies and procedures for overseeing non-school  partners\u2019 protection of federal student aid data align with federal  requirements and guidance; data security issues related to credit reporting agencies, including a  review of the causes and impacts of the August 2017 Equifax data  breach;  the extent to which Equifax assessed, responded to, and recovered  from its August 2017 data breach;  federal agencies\u2019 efforts to remove PII from shared cyber threat  indicators; and how the federal government has overseen Internet privacy, including  the roles of the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal  Trade Commission, and strengths and weaknesses of the current  oversight authorities.", "In summary, since 2010, we have made over 3,000 recommendations to  agencies aimed at addressing the four cybersecurity challenges.  Nevertheless, many agencies continue to be challenged in safeguarding  their information systems and information, in part because many of these  recommendations have not been implemented. Of the roughly 3,000  recommendations made since 2010, nearly 1,000 had not been  implemented as of July 2018. We have also designated 35 as priority  recommendations, and as of July 2018, 31 had not been implemented.", "The federal government and the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure are  dependent on IT systems and electronic data, which make them highly  vulnerable to a wide and evolving array of cyber-based threats. Securing  these systems and data is vital to the nation\u2019s security, prosperity, and  well-being. Nevertheless, the security over these systems and data is  inconsistent and urgent actions are needed to address ongoing  cybersecurity and privacy challenges. Specifically, the federal  government needs to implement a more comprehensive cybersecurity  strategy and improve its oversight, including maintaining a qualified  cybersecurity workforce; address security weaknesses in federal systems  and information and enhance cyber incident response efforts; bolster the  protection of cyber critical infrastructure; and prioritize efforts to protect  individual\u2019s privacy and PII. Until our recommendations are addressed  and actions are taken to address the four challenges we identified, the  federal government, the national critical infrastructure, and the personal  information of U.S. citizens will be increasingly susceptible to the  multitude of cyber-related threats that exist.", "Chairmen Meadows and Hurd, Ranking Members Connolly and Kelly,  and Members of the Subcommittees, this completes my prepared  statement.
