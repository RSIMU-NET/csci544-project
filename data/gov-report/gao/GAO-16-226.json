This report addresses the extent to which DOD and the Coast Guard, which falls under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), have (1) developed and implemented policies to address incidents of hazing, and (2) visibility over hazing incidents involving servicemembers. GAO reviewed hazing policies; assessed data on hazing incidents and requirements for and methods used to track them; assessed the results of organizational climate surveys that included questions on hazing; conducted focus groups with servicemembers during site visits to two installations selected based on available hazing and sexual assault data, among other factors; and interviewed cognizant officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD), including each of the military services, and the Coast Guard have issued policies to address hazing, but generally do not know the extent to which their policies have been implemented. The military services' and Coast Guard's policies define hazing similarly to DOD and include servicemember training requirements. The military service and Coast Guard policies also contain guidance, such as responsibilities for policy implementation and direction on avoiding hazing in service customs and traditions, beyond what is included in DOD's policy. However, DOD and the Coast Guard generally do not know the extent to which their policies have been implemented because most of the services and the Coast Guard have not conducted oversight through regular monitoring of policy implementation. The Marine Corps conducts inspections of command hazing policy on issues such as providing servicemembers with information on the hazing policy and complying with hazing incident reporting requirements. While these inspections provide Marine Corps headquarters officials with some information they can use to conduct oversight of hazing policy implementation, they do not necessarily cover all aspects of hazing policy implementation. Without routinely monitoring policy implementation, DOD, the Coast Guard, and the military services may not have the accountability needed to help ensure efforts to address hazing are implemented consistently.", "DOD and the Coast Guard have limited visibility over hazing incidents involving servicemembers. Specifically, the Army, the Navy, and the Marine Corps track data on reported incidents of hazing, but the data are not complete and consistent due to varying tracking methods that do not always include all reported incidents. For example, until October 2015, the Army only tracked cases investigated by criminal investigators or military police, while the Navy required reports on substantiated hazing cases and the Marine Corps required reports on both substantiated and unsubstantiated cases. The Air Force and Coast Guard do not require the collection of hazing incident data, and instead have taken an ad hoc approach to compiling relevant information to respond to requests for such data. In the absence of guidance on hazing data collection, DOD and the Coast Guard do not have an accurate picture of reported hazing incidents across the services. In addition, DOD and the Coast Guard have not evaluated the prevalence of hazing. An evaluation of prevalence would provide information on the extent of hazing beyond the limited data on reported incidents, and could be estimated based on survey responses, as DOD does in the case of sexual assault. Service officials said that currently, reported hazing incidents are the primary indicator of the extent of hazing. However, data obtained through other sources suggest that hazing may be more widespread in DOD and the Coast Guard than the current reported numbers. For example, GAO analysis of organizational climate survey results from 2014 for the military services and the Coast Guard found that about 12 percent of respondents in the junior enlisted ranks indicated their belief that such incidents occur in their units. Although these results do not measure the prevalence of hazing incidents, they yield insights into servicemember perceptions of hazing, and suggest that an evaluation of the extent of hazing is warranted. Without evaluating the prevalence of hazing within their organizations, DOD and the Coast Guard will be limited in their ability to effectively target their efforts to address hazing."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making 12 recommendations, among them that DOD and the Coast Guard regularly monitor policy implementation, issue guidance on the collection and tracking of hazing incident data, and evaluate the prevalence of hazing. DOD and DHS concurred with all of GAO's recommendations and have begun taking actions to address them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Initiations and rites of passage can be effective tools to instill esprit de  corps and loyalty among servicemembers and are included in many  traditions throughout the Department of Defense (DOD) and in the Coast  Guard. However, such traditional activities, as well as other, more ad hoc  activities, have at times included cruel or abusive behavior, and it has not  always been easy for servicemembers to draw a clear distinction between  legitimate traditions and patterns of misconduct. In recent years, the  military services, as well as the Coast Guard, have experienced high- profile hazing incidents. For example, seven members of the Coast Guard  were convicted at courts-martial for charges related to hazing behaviors  while on board the Coast Guard Cutter Venturous from 2007 through  2009. In 2011, while serving in Afghanistan, an Army private committed  suicide after reportedly being subjected to verbal and physical hazing and  a Lance Corporal in the Marine Corps committed suicide after fellow  Marines beat him during an alleged hazing incident for falling asleep on  watch.", "Until December 2015, DOD defined hazing as any conduct whereby a  military member or members, regardless of service or rank, without  proper authority causes another military member or members, regardless  of service or rank, to suffer or be exposed to any activity which is cruel,  abusive, humiliating, oppressive, demeaning, or harmful. Soliciting or  coercing another to perpetrate any such activity was also considered  hazing, and the actions could be verbal or psychological in nature.  Furthermore, actual or implied consent did not eliminate the culpability of  the perpetrator. The military services and the Coast Guard have adopted  similar definitions of hazing. At the conclusion of this review, DOD  updated its definition of hazing to, among other things, distinguish  between hazing and bullying, as we discuss later in this report. According  to the updated definition, hazing involves bringing people into a group or  new status, whereas bullying may involve the singling out of an individual  for being different or weak.", "The Carl Levin and Howard P. \u201cBuck\u201d McKeon National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 included a provision for us to report  on the policies to prevent hazing, and systems initiated to track incidents  of hazing, in each of the armed services. For this report, we reviewed the  extent to which DOD, the military services, and the Coast Guard have (1)  developed and implemented policies to address hazing incidents, and (2)  visibility over hazing incidents involving servicemembers.", "To address the first objective, we reviewed hazing policies and guidance  from DOD, the military services, and the Coast Guard. We interviewed  officials within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel  and Readiness, the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, and  the Coast Guard who are responsible for the development and  implementation of hazing policies, as well as criminal investigators,  inspector general officials, and legal officials. In addition, we reviewed  training materials from the military services and the Coast Guard on the  prevention of hazing. We visited two installations\u2014one for the Navy and  one for the Marine Corps\u2014to obtain the perspectives of servicemembers,  commanders, and other officials responsible for implementing hazing  policies and responding to reported incidents, and we conducted nine  focus groups with servicemembers in enlisted pay grades E3-E5 (5 Navy  and 4 Marine Corps) at those installations. We also administered a  related survey to the focus group participants. These focus groups  provided insight into the effects of hazing policies at the local levels, but  were not generalizable across the military services. We compared the  extent to which DOD, the military services, and the Coast Guard have  monitored the implementation of hazing policies to the Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government criteria on management  control activities, including the policies, procedures, techniques, and  mechanisms that enforce management\u2019s directives to achieve an entity\u2019s  objectives. We also compared the extent to which policies and guidance  are sufficiently clear for servicemembers to determine when hazing has  occurred to the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  criteria that state that management establishes standards of conduct,  which guide the directives, attitudes, and behaviors of the organization in  achieving the entity\u2019s objectives.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed DOD\u2019s, the military  services\u2019, and the Coast Guard\u2019s hazing policies to determine the extent  to which they required tracking of hazing incidents and to identify the  processes, if any, that are used to collect and maintain hazing incident  data. We analyzed hazing incident data from December 2012 through  December 2014\u2014to the extent they were available\u2014for each of the  military services and the Coast Guard. Further, we interviewed officials  from the military services and the Coast Guard who are responsible for  collecting data on hazing incidents and any related adjudications. We also  interviewed officials within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  for Personnel and Readiness to determine the extent to which DOD had  provided the military services with guidance on tracking hazing incident  data, and we interviewed officials in the Coast Guard Office of Military  Personnel, Policy and Standards Division, to determine the extent to  which the Coast Guard had issued guidance on tracking hazing incident  data. We compared the military services\u2019 and the Coast Guard\u2019s methods  of data collection with Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government criteria stating that information should be recorded and  communicated to management and others who need it in a form and  within a time frame that allows them to carry out their internal control and  other responsibilities. We found limitations in the reliability of the armed  services\u2019 data on hazing incidents, which we discuss in the report.  However, we found that the data were sufficiently reliable for reporting  some aggregate numbers of incidents, alleged offenders, and alleged  victims, and in some cases for reporting demographic information on  alleged offenders and victims. We interviewed officials in the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness and from each  of the military services to identify any DOD-wide or service-specific  initiatives that exist to evaluate the extent of hazing in the military. We  also interviewed Coast Guard officials to identify any steps that had been  taken to evaluate the extent of hazing in the Coast Guard. We obtained  and analyzed available data pertaining to perceptions of hazing and  demeaning behaviors from the results of command climate surveys  administered by each military service and by the Coast Guard in calendar  year 2014. We found some limitations in the reliability of these data,  which we discuss in the report. However, we found that the data were  sufficiently reliable to report some aggregate numbers on perceptions of  hazing across the armed services and in each armed service. Because of  the nature of the decentralized process used to administer and to collect  the results of the command climate surveys, the analysis cannot be  generalized to the entire population of active service members across the  armed forces or each service. Therefore, the analyses we present using  the command climate survey data are intended to demonstrate how the  survey data might be used to assess perceptions related to hazing. We  also reviewed a 2014 RAND Corporation study on sexual assault in the  military that also discussed hazing to identify the extent to which sexual  assault incidents may also result from or constitute hazing. We  compared the extent to which DOD and the Coast Guard have evaluated  the prevalence of hazing with Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government criteria stating that management analyzes identified  risks to estimate their significance, which provides a basis for responding  to the risks, and with leading practices for program evaluations, which  state that evaluations can play a key role in planning and program  management by providing feedback on both program design and  execution.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2015 to February 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  These standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Specifically,  Congress specified that each Armed Force report include, among other  things, an evaluation of the hazing definition contained in an August 1997  Secretary of Defense policy memorandum on hazing, a discussion of their  respective policies for preventing and responding to incidents of hazing,  and a description of the methods implemented to track and report,  including report anonymously, incidents of hazing in the Armed Forces.", "In response, each service provided reports to Congress in May and July  2013 addressing the requirements of the Act. For example, the Navy,  the Marine Corps, and the Coast Guard concurred with DOD\u2019s 1997  definition of hazing. To address all behaviors that involve mistreatment in  a single policy, the Army recommended revising the hazing definition to  include bullying. The Air Force recommended the hazing definition be  revised to better align with the hazing definitions used by the states  because DOD\u2019s broader definition risked creating a perception that  hazing is a larger problem in the military than it actually is according to  the civilian understanding of hazing. The Coast Guard also noted in its  report to Congress that it developed its policy to reflect the provisions  contained in DOD\u2019s hazing policy.", "With respect to the feasibility of establishing a database to track, respond  to, and resolve incidents of hazing, the Army report stated that existing  databases and legal tracking systems are sufficient for tracking hazing  incidents. The Navy reported that although it has a tracking database in  use, a comprehensive database for all services may be beneficial in  combatting hazing. The Marine Corps report stated that the Marine Corps  currently uses a service-wide database for tracking and managing all  allegations of hazing. The Air Force report stated that it will examine the  costs and benefits of establishing a database to track, respond to, and  resolve hazing incidents once a common definition and data elements are  developed. The Coast Guard stated that existing systems provide  adequate management of hazing incidents.", "Lastly, in response to the requirement to provide any recommended  changes to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) or the Manual for  Courts-Martial, the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force reports  stated that they supported inserting a provision in the Manual for Courts- Martial discussion section of Article 92 of the UCMJ that would enable  incidents of hazing to be charged as violations of Article 92 (violation of or  failure to obey a lawful general order or regulation). All of the armed  services agreed that a separate enumerated offense of the UCMJ for  hazing would be duplicative.", "In addition, in May 2012, the House Appropriations Committee Report  accompanying the DOD Appropriations Bill, 2013, expressing concern  about reports of hazing in the armed services, directed the Secretary of  Defense to provide a report to the Committee on the incidence of hazing,  harassment, and mistreatment of servicemembers, as well as a review of  the policies to prevent and respond to alleged hazing incidents. In  response to this requirement, and in addition to the service reports, in  September 2013, the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness provided a report to Congress that summarized the armed  service reports to Congress. In addition, the report noted that DOD  commissioned the RAND Corporation to conduct a study that would  include an assessment of the 1997 definition of hazing and subsequent  recommendation on a DOD definition of hazing, as well as an evaluation  of the feasibility of establishing a DOD-wide database to track hazing  incidents, common data elements, and requirements to include in the  revision of the 1997 policy memorandum for uniformity across the  services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Hazing and Military Law", "paragraphs": ["There is no specific article under the UCMJ that defines and prohibits  hazing.

To constitute an offense under Article 93, the  accused must be cruel toward, or oppress, or maltreat a victim that is  subject to his or her orders. Depending on the individual facts and  circumstances of the case, hazing could also be charged under other  punitive articles, such as Article 128, Assault.", "Commanders have multiple options to respond to allegations of hazing in  their units. After receiving a hazing complaint, commanders or other  authorities must promptly and thoroughly investigate the allegation,  according to the DOD policy. If the allegation is unsubstantiated, the case  is typically dropped. If the investigation substantiates the allegations, the  commander must take effective and appropriate action, which may  include adverse administrative action, non-judicial punishment, court- martial, or no action, among others.

In particular, our March  2015 report on male servicemember victims of sexual assault reported  that hazing incidents may cross the line into sexual assault. We noted  that service officials and male servicemembers at several military  installations gave us examples of recent incidents involving both hazing  and sexual assault. We found that a series of hazing incidents may  escalate into a sexual assault and that service officials stated that training  on hazing-type activities and their relationship to sexual assault would be  particularly beneficial to males in that it might lead to increased reporting  and fewer inappropriate incidents. Among other things, we recommended  that DOD revise its sexual assault prevention and response training to  more comprehensively and directly address how certain behavior and  activities, such as hazing, can constitute sexual assault. DOD concurred  with this recommendation, but did not state what actions it planned to  take in response. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2016 subsequently included a provision requiring the Secretary of  Defense, in collaboration with the Secretaries of the Military Departments,  to develop a plan for prevention and response to sexual assaults in which  the victim is a male servicemember.

Further, it  required the Secretaries of the Military Departments to ensure that DOD\u2019s  hazing policy was incorporated into entry-level enlisted and officer military  training, as well as professional military education. Coast Guard officials  told us that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not issued  any hazing-related policy applicable to the Coast Guard, and DHS  officials confirmed that no such policy had been issued, though as we  discuss further in this report, the Coast Guard issued policies that reflect  DOD\u2019s 1997 hazing policy.", "From 1997 through 2014, each of the military services issued or updated  applicable policies to reflect DOD\u2019s position on hazing and its  requirements for addressing such incidents. The military services  updated their policies for various reasons, such as implementing tracking  requirements or defining and prohibiting bullying along with hazing. The  Coast Guard also issued a policy during this timeframe that, as noted in  its 2013 report to Congress on hazing, mirrors the policy developed by  DOD. Each of the services made their policies punitive so that a  violation of the military service regulation could also be charged under the  UCMJ as a violation of Article 92, Failure to obey an order or regulation.", "More recently, in December 2015 DOD issued an updated hazing and  bullying memorandum and policy, which among other things included an  updated definition of hazing, defined bullying, and directed the secretaries  of the military departments to develop instructions to comply with the  memorandum.

Though not  required, the Army, the Navy, and the Marine Corps hazing policies  contain guidance and requirements that supplement several key  provisions in DOD\u2019s policy. For example, in addition to the examples of  hazing included in DOD\u2019s policy, the Army\u2019s 2014 regulation update  explicitly prohibits hazing via social media or other electronic  communications, and makes a distinction between hazing and bullying,  which it also prohibits.", "Further, the Army\u2019s, the Navy\u2019s, and the Marine Corps\u2019 hazing policies  and guidance include requirements for commanders and senior  noncommissioned officers beyond the general investigative and  disciplinary responsibilities specified by DOD. Specifically, the Army\u2019s  regulation requires its commanders to seek the counsel of their legal  advisor when taking actions pursuant to the hazing policy. Navy policy on  reporting hazing incidents directs all commands to submit reports of  substantiated hazing incidents for tracking by the Navy\u2019s Office of Hazing  Prevention. The Marine Corps\u2019 order requires commanding officers to  report both substantiated and unsubstantiated hazing incidents to Marine  Corps headquarters. In October 1997, the Air Force reissued the  Secretary of Defense\u2019s memorandum and DOD\u2019s hazing policy with a  cover letter from the Chief of Staff of the Air Force that underscored that  hazing is contrary to good order and discipline, that it would not be  tolerated, and that commanders and supervisors must stay engaged to  ensure that hazing does not occur within the Air Force.", "Regarding training, the Army\u2019s, the Navy\u2019s, and the Marine Corps\u2019 policies  supplement DOD\u2019s requirement that the topic of hazing be incorporated  into entry-level enlisted and officer training and Professional Military  Education. Specifically, the Army\u2019s hazing regulation requires that  commanders at a minimum conduct hazing awareness training on at least  an annual basis as part of the Army\u2019s Equal Opportunity training  requirements. The Department of the Navy\u2019s instruction requires that  hazing awareness training be incorporated into leadership training and  commander\u2019s courses, and the Marine Corps\u2019 order includes similar  requirements, adding that hazing awareness training also be included in  troop information programs and in unit orientation. By including the DOD  hazing policy, the Air Force memorandum includes the training  requirements specified by DOD, and an Air Education and Training  Command policy requires annual hazing awareness training within Air  Force training units.", "In September 2011, the Coast Guard updated its Discipline and Conduct  Instruction to include its policy prohibiting hazing. As previously noted, the  Coast Guard\u2019s instruction mirrors guidance set forth in a 1997 Secretary  of Defense Policy Memorandum, including DOD\u2019s definition of hazing and  examples of what does and does not constitute prohibited hazing  conduct. Like DOD\u2019s policy, the Coast Guard\u2019s instruction also specifies  that commanders who receive complaints or information about hazing  must investigate and take prompt, effective action and are to incorporate  hazing awareness training into the annual unit training. While similar in  some respects, the Coast Guard\u2019s hazing instruction contains guidance  and requirements that go beyond the policy issued by DOD. For example,  in addition to a requirement to investigate alleged incidents, the Coast  Guard\u2019s policy identifies penalties that may result from hazing that,  depending on the circumstances, range from counseling to administrative  discharge procedures. Further, the Coast Guard\u2019s instruction also  requires that a discussion about hazing be incorporated into existing  recruit, officer, and leadership training curricula.", "The Army, the Navy, and the Marine Corps hazing policies state that  servicemembers should report hazing complaints within the chain of  command, such as to their commander. The Army\u2019s regulation also states  that servicemembers may report hazing complaints to law enforcement or  the inspector general. The Coast Guard\u2019s hazing instruction states that  every military member\u2014to include victims of or witnesses to actual or  attempted hazing\u2014must report such incidents to the appropriate level  within the chain of command.", "Headquarters officials from each military service and the Coast Guard  told us that servicemembers may report hazing complaints through  existing channels, such as the commander, law enforcement, inspector  general, or the equal opportunity office, among others.

In other cases, such as an equal  opportunity advisor in their own command, the reporting channel would  not be independent of the command. These officials said that in most  cases, there are means to report hazing complaints anonymously to  many of these channels, such as anonymous inspector general hotlines.", "In addition, because hazing can be associated with rites of passage and  traditions, the Army, the Navy, and the Marine Corps\u2014either in their  policies or through supplemental guidance\u2014permit command-authorized  rituals, customs, and rites of passage that are not cruel or abusive, and  require commanders to ensure that these events do not include hazing.  The Army\u2019s policy states that the chain of command will ensure that  traditional events are carried out in accordance with Army values, and  that the dignity and respect of all participants is maintained. A quick  reference legal handbook issued by the Department of the Navy provides  guidance to Navy and Marine Corps commanders for conducting  ceremonies and traditional events as part of its section on hazing  prevention.

However, according to an official in the Army office that  developed the Army\u2019s hazing policy, there is no service-wide effort to  oversee the implementation of the hazing regulation. The Navy\u2019s  instruction designates commanders and supervisors as responsible for  ensuring that all ceremonies and initiations in their organizations comply  with the policy.

However, officials in the Navy\u2019s office that develops hazing  policy said there is no service-wide effort to specifically oversee  implementation of the hazing policy. The Marine Corps\u2019 order  designates the Deputy Commandant for Manpower and Reserve Affairs,  the Commanding General, and the Marine Corps Combat Development  Command, as well as commanding officers, and officers-in-charge as  being responsible for policy implementation. In addition, the Marine Corps  reported conducting regular inspections of command implementation of  the Marine Corps hazing policy as a means of overseeing service-wide  implementation of its hazing policy. The Air Force\u2019s hazing policy does  not contain specific designations of responsibility. However, the Air Force  policy memorandum states that commanders and supervisors must stay  engaged to make sure that hazing doesn\u2019t occur in the Air Force and the  Air Force instruction on standards states that each airman in the chain of  command is obligated to prevent hazing. As with the Army and Navy, the  Air Force hazing policy memorandum does not include requirements to  regularly monitor policy implementation across the service.", "The Coast Guard\u2019s hazing instruction generally identifies training centers,  commanders, and Coast Guard personnel as being responsible for its  implementation. Specifically, the instruction specifies that training centers  are responsible for incorporating hazing awareness training into curricula  administered to different levels of personnel. In addition to their  investigative responsibilities, the instruction also states that commanding  officers and supervisors are responsible for ensuring that they administer  their units in an environment of professionalism and mutual respect that  does not tolerate hazing of individuals or groups. Lastly, the instruction  charges all Coast Guard personnel with the responsibility to help ensure  that hazing does not occur in any form at any level and that the  appropriate authorities are informed of any suspected policy violation.  However, the Coast Guard reported that it has not regularly monitored  hazing policy implementation.", "An official in the Army\u2019s Equal Opportunity office stated that although its  office has responsibility for hazing policy, the office has not been tasked  with, and thus has not developed, a mechanism to monitor  implementation of its policy. However, the official acknowledged that it  could be helpful to have more information on the extent to which elements  of such policies are being incorporated by its commands and at its  installations. The official added that ways to do this could include  collecting and reviewing data from commands on policy implementation,  or conducting inspections, though the official noted that inspections would  require additional resources. Officials in the Navy\u2019s Office of Behavioral  Standards stated that the responsibility for compliance with the hazing  policy is delegated to the command level, with oversight by the immediate  superior in command, but our review found that the Navy did not have a  mechanism to facilitate headquarters-level monitoring of hazing policy  implementation.", "In contrast, the Marine Corps Inspector General, in coordination with the  Marine Corps Office of Manpower and Reserve Affairs, conducts service- wide inspections to determine, among other things, whether the  provisions of the Marine Corps\u2019 hazing policy are being implemented  consistently and to ensure that commands are in compliance with the  requirements of the hazing policy. Marine Corps Inspector General  officials told us that the Marine Corps Inspector General has inspected  command programs to address hazing since June 1997, with the initial  issuance of the Marine Corps\u2019 hazing order. Specifically, the Inspector  General checks command programs against a series of hazing-related  items, such as whether the command includes hazing policies and  procedures in its orientation and annual troop information program and  whether the command has complied with hazing incident reporting  requirements. These inspections do not necessarily cover all aspects of  hazing policy implementation. For example, Marine Corps Inspector  General officials told us they do not consistently review the content of  training materials, although they do review training rosters to verify that  servicemembers have received hazing training. However, the inspections  provide additional information to Marine Corps headquarters officials on  the implementation of hazing policy by commands. Marine Corps  Manpower and Reserve Affairs officials also told us that they will begin  consistently reviewing training content after they standardize the training.", "Marine Corps Inspector General officials stated that at the local level,  command inspectors general complete compliance inspections every two  years, and the Marine Corps headquarters inspector general assesses  local command inspectors general every three years to ensure they are  effectively inspecting subordinate units. The Marine Corps headquarters  inspector general also inspects those commands that do not have their  own inspectors general every two years. According to the Office of the  Marine Corps Inspector General, commanders are required to provide the  Inspector General\u2014within 30 days of its report\u2014a plan for addressing  any findings of non-compliance with the hazing policy. Further, a Marine  Corps Manpower and Reserve Affairs official said that when commands  are found to be out of compliance with the policy, officials conducting the  inspections will assist them in taking steps to improve their hazing  prevention program. Marine Corps officials told us that in the past 24  months, 3 of 33 commands inspected by the Marine Corps Inspector  General were found to have non-mission-capable hazing prevention  programs. They added that not having a mission-capable program does  not necessarily indicate the existence of a hazing problem in the  command. A Marine Corps Inspector General official said that local  inspectors general may re-inspect commands within 60 days, and no  longer than the next inspection cycle, to ensure they have made changes  to comply with the hazing policy.", "An official from the Air Force Personnel Directorate stated that oversight  is inherent in the requirement to comply with policy and that any violations  would be captured through the regular investigative, inspector general,  and equal opportunity processes, and potentially the military justice  process. The official also added that it is ultimately a commander\u2019s  responsibility to ensure policy compliance. However, the Air Force has  not established a mechanism that monitors implementation to help ensure  commanders are consistently applying the policy. Similarly, officials from  the Coast Guard\u2019s Office of Military Personnel, Policy and Standards  Division stated that they have not instituted a mechanism to monitor  implementation of the Coast Guard\u2019s hazing policy.", "During site visits to Naval Base Coronado and Marine Corps Base Camp  Pendleton, we conducted nine focus groups with enlisted  servicemembers and found that they were generally aware of some of the  requirements specified in DOD\u2019s and their respective service\u2019s policies on  hazing. For example, enlisted personnel in all nine focus groups  demonstrated an understanding that hazing is prohibited and generally  stated that they had received hazing awareness training. In addition,  during our site visit to Naval Base Coronado, servicemembers in one  focus group said that prior to a recent ceremony aboard the USS Carl  Vinson, the ship\u2019s commander provided all personnel aboard with  command-specific guidance and training to raise their awareness of  hazing. At Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, we identified multiple  postings of hazing policy statements throughout various commands.", "We are encouraged by the actions taken at these two installations and we  understand that there is a general expectation for commanders and other  leaders in the military services and in the Coast Guard to help ensure  compliance with policy. In addition, we note that the Marine Corps has  implemented a means of monitoring hazing policy implementation  throughout the service. However, without regular monitoring by DOD of  the implementation of its hazing policy by the services, and without  regular monitoring by all of the services of the implementation of their  hazing policies, DOD and the military services will be unable to effectively  identify issues and, when necessary, adjust their respective approaches  to addressing hazing. Likewise, without regular monitoring by the Coast  Guard of the implementation of its hazing policy, the Coast Guard will be  unable to effectively identify issues and make adjustments to its approach  to addressing hazing when necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Military Servicemembers May Not Have Sufficient Information to Distinguish Hazing From Permitted Behavior", "paragraphs": ["As previously noted, DOD and military service policies generally define  hazing and provide examples of prohibited conduct. However, based on  our review of these policies, meetings with officials, and focus groups with  servicemembers, we found that the military services may not have  provided servicemembers with sufficient information to determine whether  specific conduct or activities constitute hazing. According to the  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, management  establishes standards of conduct, which guide the directives, attitudes,  and behaviors of the organization in achieving the entity\u2019s objectives.  Each of the military services has defined hazing and provided training on  the definition to servicemembers, but may not have provided sufficient  clarification to servicemembers to help them make distinctions between  hazing and generally accepted activities in the military, such as training  and extra military instruction.", "To help servicemembers recognize an incident of hazing, DOD and  military service policies provide a definition of hazing and include  examples of rituals for servicemembers to illustrate various types of  prohibited conduct. As noted previously, from 1997 to December 2015  DOD defined hazing as any conduct whereby a servicemember, without  proper authority, causes another servicemember to suffer, or be exposed  to any activity which is, among other things, humiliating or demeaning.  According to this definition, hazing includes soliciting another to  perpetrate any such activity, and can be verbal or psychological in nature.  In addition, consent does not eliminate the culpability of the perpetrator.  DOD\u2019s 1997 hazing policy also listed examples such as playing abusive  tricks; threatening violence or bodily harm; striking; branding; shaving;  painting; or forcing or requiring the consumption of food, alcohol, drugs,  or any other substance. The policy also noted that this was not an  inclusive list of examples. Likewise, DOD\u2019s revised December 2015  hazing definition includes both physical and psychological acts, prohibits  soliciting others to perpetrate acts of hazing, states that consent does not  eliminate culpability, and gives a non-inclusive list of examples of hazing.", "Headquarters-level officials from each military service stated that under  the hazing definition a great variety of behaviors could be perceived as  hazing. For example, Army officials said the definition encompasses a  wide range of possible behaviors. Likewise, Marine Corps officials said  that based on the definition included in its order, any activity can be  construed as hazing. At our site visits, servicemembers in each focus  group, as well as groups of non-commissioned officers, noted that  perception plays a significant role in deciding whether something is  hazing or not\u2014that servicemembers may believe they have been hazed  because they feel demeaned, for example.", "To distinguish hazing from other types of activities, DOD (in its 1997  hazing memorandum) and military service policies also provide examples  of things that are not considered to be hazing, including command- authorized mission or operational activities, the requisite training to  prepare for such missions or operations, administrative corrective  measures, extra military instruction, command-authorized physical  training, and other similar activities that are authorized by the chain of  command. However, as DOD noted in its 2013 report to Congress on  hazing, corrective military instruction has the potential to be perceived as  hazing. DOD noted that military training can be arduous, and stated that  hazing prevention education should distinguish between extra military  instruction and unlawful behavior. DOD also stated that the services  should deliberately incorporate discussion of extra military instruction,  including proper administration and oversight, in contrast with hazing as  part of prevention education. Conversely, a superior may haze  a subordinate, and servicemembers therefore need to be able to  recognize when conduct by a superior crosses the line into hazing.", "To raise awareness of hazing, each service has developed training that  provides a general overview of prohibited conduct and the potential  consequences. However, the training materials we reviewed did not  provide servicemembers with information to enable them to identify less  obvious incidents of potential hazing, such as the inappropriate or  demeaning use of otherwise generally accepted corrective measures  such as extra military instruction. Conversely, the training materials that  we reviewed also did not include necessary information to help  servicemembers recognize an appropriate use of corrective measures.  Specifically, the training materials generally focused on clear examples of  hazing behaviors, and did not illustrate where accepted activities such as  training and discipline can cross the line into hazing. For example, the  Army administers hazing awareness training for use at all levels that  provides servicemembers with the definition of hazing and information  about the circumstances under which hazing may occur, as well as a list  of activities that are not considered hazing. However, our review found  that the Army\u2019s training materials do not provide information to  servicemembers about how to make consistent determinations about  whether an activity should be considered hazing, such as in cases that  may resemble permitted activities.", "Likewise, the Navy\u2019s training is designed to empower sailors to recognize,  intervene, and stop various behaviors such as hazing that are not aligned  with the Navy\u2019s ethos and core values. However, our review found that  the training focuses on intervening when an incident of hazing has  occurred and does not include information to help servicemembers  discern, for example, when a permissible activity is being used in an  impermissible manner. The Marine Corps\u2019 hazing awareness training is  locally developed and examples of training materials we reviewed provide  an overview of the definition of hazing, examples of acts that could be  considered hazing similar to those delineated in the Marine Corps order  governing hazing, and a list of potential disciplinary actions that could  arise from a violation of the hazing order, among other things. However,  our review found that the training materials do not provide  servicemembers with information on activities that are not considered  hazing, such as extra military instruction, or the necessary information to  differentiate between permissible and non-permissible activities. In its  2013 report to Congress on Hazing in the Armed Forces, DOD similarly  identified that it can be difficult to distinguish between corrective  measures and hazing and noted that the services should incorporate a  discussion of extra military instruction, to include proper administration  and oversight, in contrast with hazing as part of prevention education.", "During our site visits to Naval Base Coronado and Marine Corps Base  Camp Pendleton, three groups of non-commissioned officers reinforced  the suggestion that hazing definitions are not sufficiently clear to facilitate  a determination of which activities and conduct constitute hazing. The  non-commissioned officers we met with generally agreed that the broad  definition of hazing prevents them from effectively doing their jobs,  including disciplining servicemembers, taking corrective action, or  administering extra military instruction for fear of an allegation of hazing.  For example, non-commissioned officers during one site visit said that a  servicemember need only say \u201chazing\u201d to prompt an investigation. During  another site visit, a non-commissioned officer described one hazing  complaint in which the complainant alleged hazing because the  complainant\u2019s supervisor had required that the complainant work late to  catch up on administrative responsibilities. Although this complaint was  later found to be unsubstantiated, the allegation of hazing required that  resources be devoted to investigate the complaint. In addition, some  noncommissioned officers we met with stated that they were concerned  that the use of extra military instruction may result in an allegation of  hazing.", "In our focus groups, enlisted servicemembers\u2014over the course of both  site visits\u2014provided a range of possible definitions for hazing that further  demonstrated the different interpretations of what constitutes prohibited  conduct. For example, some defined hazing only in physical terms,  whereas others recognized that hazing can be purely verbal or  psychological as well. Some servicemembers believed that an incident  would not be hazing if the servicemembers consented to involvement in  the activity, although DOD and service policies state that actual or implied  consent to acts of hazing does not eliminate the culpability of the  perpetrator. In addition, consistent with the concerns expressed by some  of the non-commissioned officers that we interviewed, servicemembers in  two focus groups stated that they may perceive extra military instruction  as hazing. By contrast, unit commanders and legal officials at one site  visit stated that they believe that the existing definition of hazing provides  supervisors with sufficient latitude to address misconduct.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  management establishes expectations of competence for key roles, and  other roles at management\u2019s discretion. Competence is the qualification  to carry out assigned responsibilities, and requires relevant knowledge,  skills, and abilities. It also states that management should internally  communicate the necessary quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s  objectives.

The Air Force does not have a method of specifically tracking hazing  incidents, and the data it has generated on hazing incidents is also  therefore not necessarily complete, or consistent with the other military  services\u2019 data. Likewise, the Coast Guard does not have a method of  specifically tracking hazing incidents, and the data it has generated on  hazing incidents is therefore not necessarily complete.", "Although it is difficult to determine the total number of actual hazing  incidents, the military services\u2019 data may not effectively characterize  reported incidents of hazing because, for the time period of data we  reviewed, DOD had not articulated a consistent methodology for tracking  hazing incidents, such as specifying and defining common data collection  requirements. As a result, there is an inconsistent and incomplete  accounting of hazing incidents both within and across these services.  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  information should be recorded and communicated to management and  others who need it in a form and within a time frame that allows them to  carry out their internal control and other responsibilities. In the absence  of DOD-level guidance on how to track and report hazing incidents, the  Army, the Navy, and the Marine Corps developed differing policies on  hazing data collection and collected data on hazing incidents differently.  For example, until October 2015 the Army only collected data on cases  investigated by criminal investigators and military police, whereas the  Navy collected data on all substantiated hazing incidents reported to  commanders, and the Marine Corps collected data on both substantiated  and unsubstantiated incidents. The Air Force and the Coast Guard hazing  policies do not include a similar requirement to collect and track data on  hazing incidents. In the absence of DOD guidance, the Air Force has  taken an ad hoc approach to compiling relevant information to respond to  requests for data on hazing incidents, and in the absence of Coast Guard  guidance on tracking hazing incidents, the Coast Guard has also taken an  ad hoc approach to compiling hazing data. For example, the Air Force  queried its legal database for cases using variants of the word \u201chazing\u201d to  provide information on hazing incidents to Congress in 2013. Table 1  illustrates some of the differences in the services\u2019 collection of data on  hazing incidents and the total number of incidents for each service as  reflected in the data for the time period we reviewed. However, due to the  differences noted, data on reported incidents of hazing are not  comparable across the services.", "Until September 2015, the Army\u2019s primary tracking method for alleged  hazing incidents was a spreadsheet maintained by an official within the  Army\u2019s Criminal Investigation Command, which included data on alleged  hazing incidents that were recorded in a database of cases investigated  by either military police or Criminal Investigation Command investigators,  according to officials in the Army\u2019s Equal Opportunity office. However,  use of this database as the primary means of tracking hazing incidents  limited the Army\u2019s visibility over reported hazing incidents because it did  not capture allegations handled by other Army offices, such as cases that  are investigated by the chain of command or by the office of the inspector  general. Data on hazing incidents through September 2015 are therefore  not complete or consistent with the data from the other military services.  Beginning in October 2015, the Army began to track hazing and bullying  incidents in its Equal Opportunity Office\u2019s Equal Opportunity Reporting  System, but Army Equal Opportunity officials told us that they continue to  have difficulties obtaining all needed information on hazing cases due to  limitations in their ability to obtain information on hazing cases from  commanders.", "The Navy requires that commands report all substantiated hazing  incidents by sending a report to the headquarters-level Office of  Behavioral Standards, where the information is entered into a  spreadsheet that contains service-wide data received on reported hazing  incidents. Officials in the Navy\u2019s Office of Behavioral Standards told us  that they encourage commanders to also report unsubstantiated  incidents, but this is at the commanders\u2019 discretion. The data on  unsubstantiated incidents are therefore not necessarily comparable with  those of services that require the collection and tracking of data on  unsubstantiated incidents. Furthermore, as a result of the different types  of data that are collected, reported numbers of hazing incidents may not  be consistently represented across the services.", "Since May 2013, the Marine Corps has required that commanders  coordinate with their local Equal Opportunity Advisor to record  substantiated and unsubstantiated allegations of hazing in the Marine  Corps\u2019 Discrimination and Sexual Harassment database. While the  Marine Corps\u2019 tracking method is designed to capture all hazing  allegations of which a unit commander is aware, we found that the  methods used by the service to count cases, offenders, and victims have  not been consistent. For example, our analyses of these data identified  inconsistencies over time in the method of recording hazing cases.  Specifically, we found that in some instances, a reported hazing incident  involving multiple offenders or victims was counted as a separate case for  each offender-victim pair. In other instances, the incident was counted as  a single case even when it involved multiple offenders or victims. So, for  example, an incident involving 2 alleged offenders and 4 alleged victims  was counted as 8 incidents, and another with 3 alleged offenders and 3  alleged victims was counted as 9 incidents. On the other hand, we found  an example of a case with 4 alleged offenders and 1 alleged victim being  counted as a single case, and another with 2 alleged offenders and 2  alleged victims counted as a single case. The recording of incidents in the  Marine Corps is therefore not internally consistent or consistent with the  other military services.", "As previously noted, the Air Force does not require that data be collected  or tracked on reported incidents of hazing, which has complicated its  ability to efficiently provide data on hazing incidents when they are  requested. To produce the congressionally-mandated report on hazing  incidents reported in fiscal year 2013, the Air Force performed a keyword  search of its legal database for variants of the word \u201chazing.\u201d However,  given that the database is used and maintained by legal personnel, query  results only captured cases that came to the attention of a judge  advocate. Further, while the keyword search of its database identified  some incidents, the Air Force does not require that the term \u201chazing\u201d or  any of its variants be included in the case narrative, even if the case  involved hazing. An official of the Air Force Legal Operations Agency told  us that judge advocates focus on the articles of the UCMJ, and  depending on the circumstances, they may or may not consider the  context of hazing to be relevant information to record in the file. Given  that \u201chazing\u201d is not specifically delineated as an offense in the UCMJ,  documented incidents of hazing in the Air Force fall under various UCMJ  articles, such as Article 92 on Failure to Obey an Order or Regulation and  Article 128 on Assault, and may not identify the incident as hazing.  Consequently, Air Force officials stated that queries of the legal database  would not necessarily capture all reported hazing cases across the Air  Force. The Air Force\u2019s data on hazing incidents are also therefore not  necessarily complete or consistent with the other military services\u2019 data.", "The Coast Guard also has not established a requirement to collect and  track data on reported incidents of hazing, which has complicated its  ability to efficiently provide data on hazing incidents when they are  requested. As with the Air Force, the Coast Guard\u2019s current process of  compiling data on hazing cases has complicated its ability to efficiently  provide data on hazing incidents when they are requested, according to  Coast Guard officials. For example, to produce the congressionally- mandated report on hazing incidents reported in fiscal year 2013, the  Coast Guard queried its database of criminal investigations as well as its  database of courts-martials for variants of the term \u201chazing.\u201d According to  Coast Guard officials, the Coast Guard\u2019s queries only captured cases that  explicitly used a variant of the term \u201chazing\u201d in the case narrative and that  were investigated by the Coast Guard Investigative Service or had  resulted in a court-martial. As such, the Coast Guard\u2019s data did not  capture, for example, any cases that may have been investigated by the  chain of command and deemed unsubstantiated or resolved through  administrative action or non-judicial punishment.", "The military services\u2019 and the Coast Guard\u2019s available information on  hazing cases include some information on the dispositions of hazing  cases, which have been adjudicated in a variety of ways. Our review of  the data showed that this information was not always available or  updated, and the sources of the information were not always reliable. We  therefore found that data on hazing case dispositions were not sufficiently  reliable to report in aggregate. There were a wide range of dispositions,  from cases being found unsubstantiated to courts-martial. For example, in  one case, multiple servicemembers pled guilty at court-martial to hazing  and assault consummated by battery after being accused of attempted  penetrative sexual assault. In another hazing case involving taping to a  chair, the offender was punished through non-judicial punishment with  restriction, extra duty, and forfeiture of pay and the victim was given a  similar but lesser punishment for consenting to the hazing. In a third case,  a complainant alleged hazing after being told to work late, but an  investigation determined that the allegation was unsubstantiated.", "ODMEO officials acknowledged that it is difficult to gauge the scope and  impact of hazing given the limited information that is currently available  and the inconsistent nature of the services\u2019 data collection efforts. DOD\u2019s  updated hazing policy includes requirements that are intended to promote  greater consistency in the services\u2019 collection of data on reported hazing  incidents. Specifically, the revised policy includes a requirement for the  services to collect data on the number of substantiated and  unsubstantiated incidents of hazing and bullying, as well as the  demographics of the complainant and alleged offender in each case, a  description of the incident, and if applicable, disposition of the case.  ODMEO officials said they plan to provide a data collection template that  will provide a standard list of data elements and additional details on the  data to be collected and reported to ODMEO.", "DOD\u2019s updated hazing policy will help to improve the consistency of  hazing incident data collected by the services. However, it does not  appear that the policy will serve to make the services\u2019 disparate data  collection efforts fully consistent because the policy does not clearly  define the scope of information or define the data to be collected. For  example, the policy requires the military services to track hazing  incidents, but does not identify how to count an incident relative to the  number of alleged offenders and alleged victims, and the services have  counted incidents differently for tracking purposes. ODMEO officials said  they are continuing to revise the data collection template, which could  provide further specificity to the data collection.", "As a result of inconsistent and incomplete data, DOD and the Coast  Guard cannot provide an accurate picture of reported hazing incidents  either for the purposes of internal management or for external reporting.  Further, without a common basis to guide the collection of data, including  a standard list of data elements, decision makers in DOD, the Coast  Guard, and Congress will not be able to use these data to determine the  number of reported hazing incidents in DOD or the Coast Guard, or to  draw conclusions from the data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD and the Coast Guard Do Not Know the Extent of Hazing In Their Organizations", "paragraphs": ["To date, DOD and the Coast Guard do not know the extent of hazing in  their organizations because they have not conducted an evaluation of the  prevalence of hazing. In contrast to the limited data on reports of hazing  incidents, information on the prevalence of hazing would help DOD and  the Coast Guard to understand the extent of hazing beyond those  incidents that are reported.", "The prevalence of hazing could be estimated based on survey responses,  as DOD does in the case of sexual assault. We believe such an  evaluation could form the baseline against which to measure the  effectiveness of their efforts to address hazing and would enhance  visibility over the prevalence of such misconduct. Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government states that it is important to establish a  baseline that can be used as criteria against which to assess progress  and to help identify any issues or deficiencies that may exist. ODMEO  officials said that their efforts to address hazing are in the early stages  and that following the issuance of the updated hazing policy, DOD may  begin to establish a baseline against which to evaluate appropriate  responses to hazing. However, to date DOD and the military services  have not evaluated the prevalence of hazing across their organizations in  order to determine the appropriate responses. The Coast Guard also has  not evaluated the prevalence of hazing within its service.", "Officials in each of the military services and the Coast Guard told us that  reports of hazing incidents are currently the primary indicator used to  gauge the incidence of hazing. However, as previously noted, the data  that are currently collected on hazing incidents are neither complete or  consistent, and data obtained through other sources, such as surveys,  suggest that hazing may be more widespread in the military services and  the Coast Guard than the current numbers of reports indicate. In  particular, the RAND Corporation conducted a survey on sexual assault  and sexual harassment in the military for DOD in 2014, the results of  which indicate that the actual number of hazing incidents may exceed the  number of reported incidents tracked by the services. Based on our  analysis of RAND\u2019s survey results, we estimate that in 2014, about  11,000 male servicemembers in the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps,  and the Air Force were sexually assaulted. Of these, RAND estimated  that between 24 percent and 46 percent would describe their sexual  assaults as hazing (\u201cthings done to humiliate or \u2018toughen up\u2019 people prior  to accepting them in a group\u201d). Officials from DOD and the Coast Guard  told us that hazing and sexual assault can occur as part of the same  incident, but it will be documented and addressed based on the more  egregious offense\u2014in this case, sexual assault. We recognize that the  classification of an offense is key in that it directly corresponds to the  punitive actions that can be taken, but note that this further reinforces that  there may be a broader incidence of hazing than the data currently  collected by the military services and the Coast Guard indicate.", "In addition to the results of RAND\u2019s survey, we also obtained and  analyzed the results of organizational climate surveys for each of the  military services and the Coast Guard for calendar year 2014 and  determined that some servicemembers perceive that hazing occurs in  their units despite the policies in place prohibiting hazing. Commanders  throughout the military services and the Coast Guard are required\u2014at  designated intervals\u2014to administer organizational climate surveys to  members of their respective units. These surveys are designed to  evaluate various aspects of their unit\u2019s climate, including, among other  things, sexual assault and sexual harassment, and were recently revised  to include questions that solicit servicemember perspectives on the  incidence of hazing. Specifically, in 2014, the Defense Equal Opportunity  Management Institute\u2014the organization responsible for administering the  surveys\u2014began including questions related to hazing and demeaning  behaviors in the organizational climate surveys it administers for  commands throughout the military services and the Coast Guard. Each  question asked whether respondents strongly disagreed, disagreed,  agreed, or strongly agreed with a statement intended to measure either  hazing or demeaning behaviors. Table 2 shows the statements in the  organizational climate surveys about hazing and demeaning behaviors.", "These surveys do not measure the prevalence of hazing. Instead, they  measure the extent to which servicemembers perceive that hazing (and  demeaning behaviors) occurs in their units. In addition, the organizational  climate surveys were designed to be a tool for commanders to evaluate  their individual units as opposed to aggregate-level analyses; thus, the  data have limitations when used for aggregate-level analysis. The results  of these surveys are also not generalizable, in part because the Army  requires that command climate surveys be conducted more frequently  than is required by the other services. As such, Army responses are  overrepresented relative to the other military services when results are  aggregated. Finally, survey data may reflect other errors, such as  differences in how questions are interpreted.

These percentages dropped to  about 8 percent and 14 percent, respectively, at the E4-E6 levels, and  continued to drop, reaching about 1 percent for hazing and 2 percent for  demeaning behaviors for officers at the O4-O6 level. These responses  indicate that perceptions of the extent of hazing and demeaning  behaviors in the military services and in the Coast Guard may be different  between those at the lower and middle enlisted ranks and those with  responsibility for developing or enforcing policy.", "The data also show that perceptions of hazing may differ by service. For  hazing, about 9 percent of Army responses agreed with all three  statements; about 5 percent of Navy responses agreed with all three  statements; about 11 percent of Marine Corps responses agreed with all  three statements; and about 2 percent of responses in the Air Force and  Coast Guard agreed with all three statements. Likewise, for demeaning  behaviors, about 14 percent of Army responses agreed with all three  statements; about 9 percent of Navy responses agreed with all three  statements; about 15 percent of Marine Corps responses agreed with all  three statements; and responses from the Air Force and Coast Guard  came in at about 5 percent in agreement with all three statements for  each service.", "The results of such analyses indicate that sufficient numbers of  servicemembers perceive hazing to be occurring to warrant evaluation of  the prevalence of hazing. In addition, such survey data can provide  valuable insights that can be used by military leaders to help form a  baseline of information. For example, the services could use the results to  evaluate service-wide as well as command-specific perceptions of hazing,  compare how perceptions change over time, make comparisons with  incident rates, and perform other analyses to identify trends and areas  needing improvement.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  management analyzes identified risks to estimate their significance, which  provides a basis for responding to the risks.

However, DOD and the military services  have not evaluated the extent of hazing in their organizations or the  magnitude of its impact or likelihood of occurrence, in order to effectively  target their responses to hazing.

At  the service-wide level, high-profile hazing incidents can shape public  perceptions, potentially making recruitment and retention more  challenging. Both DOD and the Coast Guard have issued policies that  prohibit hazing. However, DOD issued its earlier hazing policy in 1997,  and despite several hazing incidents coming to public attention in recent  years, DOD and the Coast Guard do not regularly monitor implementation  of their hazing policies and do not know the extent of hazing in their  organizations. Without effective monitoring by DOD, the Coast Guard,  and each of the services, the offices with responsibility for addressing  hazing will not know whether hazing prevention policies and training are  being consistently implemented. In addition, servicemembers may not  sufficiently understand how to recognize and respond to hazing incidents.  As our discussions with groups of servicemembers and officials suggest,  there may be confusion that persists. Without providing additional  clarification to servicemembers, perhaps through revising and tailoring  training or providing more communication, servicemembers may be  limited in their ability to carry out their responsibilities, such as  recognizing hazing and enforcing discipline. At the same time, if they do  not fully understand the hazing policies, hazing victims may not be able to  recognize hazing when it occurs, including hazing by those in positions of  authority.", "DOD\u2019s and the Coast Guard\u2019s efforts to reduce hazing would also benefit  from a better understanding of the extent of hazing incidents.

Achieving such  visibility over hazing incidents depends on better data, which will not be  available without guidance specifying that the services should track all  reported hazing incidents, with standardized and defined data elements  that will facilitate the accurate tracking of reported hazing incidents.  Concurrent with better data, DOD and the Coast Guard need to evaluate  the prevalence of hazing in their organizations, since the data on reported  incidents alone will not provide a picture of the full extent of hazing in the  armed forces.

As noted in our report, the updated  policy memorandum will not fully address disparities in service-specific  data collection efforts until DOD and the services clearly define the scope  of information or define the data to be collected. For example, the hazing  policy requires the services to track hazing incidents, but does not identify  how to count an incident relative to the number of alleged offenders and  alleged victims, and the services have counted incidents differently for  tracking purposes.

We  compared the policies, definitions of hazing, and oversight and training  requirements to determine similarities and differences. To better  understand the hazing policies and guidance from each service, including  the Coast Guard, we interviewed knowledgeable officials from the Office  of Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity in the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, the Army Equal  Opportunity Office, the Navy Office of Behavioral Standards, the Marine  Corps Office of Manpower and Reserve Affairs, the Air Force Personnel  Directorate, and the Coast Guard Office of Military Personnel, Policy and  Standards Division, as well as officials in other offices listed in table 4,  below. In addition, we reviewed the services\u2019 hazing awareness training  requirements included in their respective policies and analyzed the  services\u2019 training materials to determine how servicemembers are trained  on hazing awareness, prevention, and response.

To better understand how policy and training  is implemented at installations, and to obtain servicemember perspectives  on hazing and hazing awareness training, we conducted site visits to  Naval Base Coronado, California, and Marine Corps Base Camp  Pendleton, California. We selected these sites based upon reported  hazing data, media reports of hazing, data on male victims of sexual  assault, and geographic proximity to each other. During these site visits  we conducted nine focus groups with enlisted servicemembers in grades  E-3 through E-5 that included a self-administered pen and paper survey  of all participants. We selected these grades because available data on  reported hazing incidents indicated that these grades were most likely to  be victims or perpetrators of a hazing incident. In addition, we met with  groups of noncommissioned officers (grades E-6 through E-9),  commanding officers, inspectors general, equal opportunity advisors, staff  judges advocates, and chaplains to obtain perspectives of  servicemembers and other officials that may be involved in addressing  hazing. For further information about the focus group and survey  methodology, see appendix III. We compared the extent to which DOD  and each armed service has oversight mechanisms in place to monitor  the implementation of hazing policies to the Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government criteria on control activities, which include the  policies, procedures, techniques, and mechanisms that enforce  management\u2019s directives to achieve an entity\u2019s objectives. We also  compared the extent to which guidance to servicemembers provides  enough clarity to determine when hazing has occurred to the Standards  for Internal Control in the Federal Government criteria that state that  management establishes standards of conduct that guide the directives,  attitudes, and behaviors of the organization in achieving the entity\u2019s  objectives, as well as Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government criteria that state that management establishes expectations  of competence for key roles, and other roles at management\u2019s discretion  and that management should internally communicate the necessary  quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives.", "To determine the extent to which DOD and the Coast Guard have  visibility over hazing incidents involving servicemembers, we reviewed the  DOD and Coast Guard hazing policies noted above to identify any  tracking requirements.
