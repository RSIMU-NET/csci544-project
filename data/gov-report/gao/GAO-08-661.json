The Department of Defense (Defense), through its Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan (CSTC-A), directs U.S. efforts to develop the Afghan National Army (ANA) and, in conjunction with the Department of State (State), the Afghan National Police (ANP). To follow up on recommendations from GAO's 2005 report on the ANSF, GAO analyzed the extent to which U.S. plans for the ANSF contain criteria we recommended. GAO also examined progress made and challenges faced in developing the ANA and ANP. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed Defense, State, and contractor documents and met with cognizant officials. GAO has prepared this report under the Comptroller General's authority to conduct evaluations on his own initiative."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In 2005, GAO recommended that Defense and State develop detailed plans for completing and sustaining the ANSF. In 2007, Defense provided a document in response to this recommendation. This 5-page document lacks sufficient detail for effective interagency planning and oversight. For example, while the document includes some broad objectives and performance measures, it identifies few long-term milestones and no intermediate milestones for assessing progress, and it lacks a sustainability strategy. Although Defense and State are partners in police training, the document does not include State's input or describe State's role. Further, State has not completed a plan of its own. In January 2008, CSTC-A completed a field-level plan to develop the ANSF that includes force goals, objectives, and performance measures. While this is an improvement over prior field-level planning, it is not a substitute for a coordinated, detailed Defense and State plan with near- and long-term resource requirements. In 2008, Congress mandated that the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of State, provide a long-term strategy and budget for strengthening the ANSF, and a long-term detailed plan for sustaining the ANSF. These have not been provided. Without a detailed plan, it is difficult to assess progress and conduct oversight of the cost of developing the ANSF. This is particularly important given the limited capacity of the Afghan government to fund the estimated $2 billion per year ANSF sustainment costs for years into the future. The United States has invested over $10 billion to develop the ANA since 2002. However, only 2 of 105 army units are assessed as being fully capable of conducting their primary mission and efforts to develop the army continue to face challenges. First, while the army has grown to approximately 58,000 of an authorized force structure of 80,000, it has experienced difficulties finding qualified candidates for leadership positions and retaining personnel. Second, while trainers or mentors are present in every ANA combat unit, shortfalls exist in the number deployed to the field. Finally, ANA combat units report significant shortages in about 40 percent of equipment items Defense defines as critical, including vehicles, weapons, and radios. Some of these challenges are due in part to competing U.S. global priorities. Without resolving these challenges, the ability of the ANA to reach full capability may be delayed. Although the ANP has reportedly grown in number since 2005, after an investment of over $6 billion, no police unit is fully capable and several challenges impede U.S. efforts to develop the police. First, less than one-quarter of the police have mentors present to provide training in the field and verify that police are on duty. Second, police units continue to face shortages in equipment items that Defense considers critical, such as vehicles, radios, and body armor. In addition, Afghanistan's weak judicial system hinders effective policing and rule of law, and the ANP consistently experiences problems with pay, corruption, and attacks from insurgents. Defense began a new effort in November 2007 to address these challenges, but the continuing shortfall in police mentors may put this effort at risk."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 2002, the United States, with assistance from the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization (NATO) and other coalition nations, has worked to  develop the Afghan National Army (ANA) and the Afghan National Police  (ANP)\u2014collectively referred to as the Afghan National Security Forces  (ANSF)\u2014to provide security for Afghanistan. The goal of these efforts is  to transfer responsibilities for the security of Afghanistan from the  international community to the Afghan government.

To address  these issues, the Afghan Ministry of Defense, assisted by CSTC-A, has  initiated programs to allow soldiers to transfer their pay to family  members and to facilitate the deposit of ANA salaries directly into  soldiers\u2019 bank accounts. CSTC-A officials stated these programs should  reduce AWOL rates.", "Second, although basic recruiting is strong, the ANA is experiencing  difficulties finding qualified candidates for leadership and specialist  positions. Defense reports that recruiting goals for ANA infantry positions  have been met, despite adjustments to increase ANA training output by  6,000 soldiers annually. However, CSTC-A noted shortfalls in the number  of candidates available for non-commissioned officer (NCO) and specialty  skill positions, such as logistics and medical support. Between November  2007 and February 2008, ANA manning levels for NCOs ranged between 50  to 70 percent of the authorized number. NCOs provide a vital link between  senior officers and soldiers and can provide leadership to ANA units in the  field, according to a senior Defense official. Officials attributed the  shortage to the low level of literacy among ANA recruits. CSTC-A is  attempting to address this shortfall by promoting NCOs from within ANA  ranks and implementing new programs to target literate recruits. CSTC-A  expects to have greater than 90 percent of the ANA\u2019s authorized NCOs  staffed by summer 2008. The ANA is also experiencing difficulties manning  specialist positions such as logistics, medical support, and engineering.  Although the ANA has developed courses to train military specialists, the  current Afghan army is comprised primarily of infantry forces. This is, in  part, because ANA recruits learn basic infantry skills first. However, this  focus is also due to difficulties identifying candidates who are suitable for  advanced training. According to Defense officials, without suitably trained  support personnel, the ANA will need to rely on coalition forces to provide  support services.", "Third, the ANA is facing challenges retaining personnel. A typical ANA  contract lasts for 3 years. At the end of a contract, ANA personnel are  given the opportunity to re-enlist with the Afghan army. Between March  2006 and February 2008, just over half of those combat personnel eligible  to re-enlist opted to do so, as shown in table 6.", "U.S. and Afghan officials attributed these re-enlistment rates to a variety of  factors, such as stationing soldiers away from their families, the rapid pace  of ANA military operations, and the higher salaries offered by private  companies and insurgent groups looking to recruit trained Afghan  soldiers. To address these factors, a senior Defense official stated that the  Ministry of Defense and CSTC-A are discussing the implementation of  several programs such as allowing re-enlisting soldiers greater choice in  determining where they will be stationed and increasing re-enlistment  bonuses. Without the ability to retain trained personnel, ANA units will  continue to lack experience and thus may be delayed in reaching their  ability to lead security operations. For instance, in November 2007, the  capability assessment of the ANA\u2019s 209th corps in northern Afghanistan  lowered the rating of one of its battalions from CM2 to CM3 when the  battalion failed to retain approximately half of its NCOs. Further, the  assessment noted that progress developing the capability of this battalion  could be delayed nearly a year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Shortage of U.S. Embedded Trainers and Coalition Mentors Delaying Advanced Skill Training for the ANA", "paragraphs": ["Although some U.S. embedded trainers or coalition mentors are present in  every ANA corps, the ANA is experiencing shortages in the number of  these required personnel to assist in its development. According to CSTC- A\u2019s Campaign Plan, after an ANA unit is fielded, either an embedded  training team (comprised of U.S. personnel) or a mentoring team  (comprised of coalition personnel) should be assigned to the unit. These  teams are responsible for developing the skills of ANA army units from  initial fielding until the unit has developed the capability to assume lead  responsibility for its security mission. As the ANA unit builds capability,  embedded trainers and mentors guide and assess the units and provide  them with access to air support and medical evacuation.", "Shortages exist in the number of embedded trainers and mentors fielded.  For instance, as of April 2008, the United States has fielded 46 percent  (1,019 of 2,215) of Defense\u2019s required number of embedded trainers.  Officials attributed these shortfalls to competing U.S. priorities for  Defense personnel, including the war in Iraq. CSTC-A has submitted  requests for additional forces to act as embedded trainers to assist the  ANA; however, the request has been deferred. As of April 2008, members  of the international community assisting in this effort have fielded 32 out  of 37 mentor teams promised, although the number of international  mentors in the field is smaller than the number of U.S embedded trainers.  Approximately one-third of personnel in the field assisting ANA unit  development are coalition mentors, while two-thirds are U.S. personnel.", "Without adequate training or mentoring, the ANA\u2019s ability to take the lead  in security operations may be delayed. First, Defense officials have cited  an insufficient number of embedded trainers and coalition mentors  deployed with units in the field as the major impediment to providing the  ANA with the training it needs to establish the capabilities necessary to  sustain the force in the long term, such as maneuver skills in battalion- level operations, intelligence collection, and logistics. Without these skills,  smaller ANA units cannot operate collectively at the battalion level, must  rely on the coalition for support tasks, and cannot assume the lead for  their own security. Secondly, as ANA units achieve greater levels of  capability, embedded trainers and mentors are responsible for assessing  and validating their progress. CSTC-A\u2019s Campaign Plan states that the  validation process is intended to improve collective training of ANA units;  however, without adequate numbers of U.S. embedded trainers and  coalition mentors, this validation will be slowed. CSTC-A officials stated  that this delay in validation would lengthen the amount of time it will take  the ANA to achieve full capability. Moreover, Defense officials noted that,  as the number of ANA units fielded increases, the number of U.S.  embedded training and coalition mentoring personnel needed also rises.  For instance, when we visited Afghanistan in August 2007, Defense  officials stated 73 U.S.-embedded training and coalition mentoring teams  were needed to assist the development of the ANA; however, Defense  officials projected that by December 2008 103 teams would be needed.  Without additional training and mentoring personnel to meet this  increased need, delays in ANA development will likely be exacerbated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Critical Equipment Shortfalls Remain Due to Changing Procurement Plans, Competing Global Priorities, and Production Limitations", "paragraphs": ["Since we reported in 2005, new equipment plans for the ANA have been  implemented and the ANA has received more equipment items.

As of February  2008, CSTC-A reports that the ANA combat forces are equipped with 60  percent of items defined as critical by Defense, a 7 percentage point  increase since August 2007.", "Despite these advances, shortages exist in a number of equipment items  defined as critical by Defense. For instance, of 55 critical equipment items  for ANA combat forces, CSTC-A reports having less than half of the  required amount on hand for 21 of these items. Types of critical equipment  items with significant shortfalls include vehicles, weapons, and  communication equipment (see table 7).", "Although shortfalls exist for certain items defined as critical by Defense,  such as NATO-standard machine guns, this does not necessarily mean that  the ANA is unequipped. Defense officials stated that while ANA forces  wait to receive NATO-standard weapons, Eastern bloc substitutes will be  used. However, several ANA combat corps reported shortages in these  items as well. For instance, each month between November 2007 and  February 2008 at least 2 of 5 ANA corps reported shortages in Eastern bloc  anti-tank weapons and 1 of 5 ANA corps reported shortages in Eastern  bloc light machine guns. Moreover, shortfalls in items for which no  Eastern bloc substitute is being used, such as communication equipment  and cargo trucks, were reported in every ANA combat corps in February  2008.", "Defense officials attribute these shortfalls to a variety of factors, such as  competing global priorities for equipment, production delays, and delayed  receipt and execution of fiscal year 2007 funding, among other reasons. As  equipment orders are filled, ANA units may not be the top priority to  receive certain equipment items. CSTC-A officials said that U.S. soldiers  currently in combat have first priority to receive some of the equipment  that is also requested for the ANA, while security forces in other nations,  such as Iraq, may also be higher priority than the Afghan army. When U.S.  forces or other nations have higher priority to receive equipment, CSTC-A  officials noted that ANA orders are delayed. Officials at the U.S. Army  Security Assistance Command also stated that Iraq may be a higher  priority than Afghanistan, while a senior official from the Defense Security  Cooperation Agency (DSCA) stated that other nations, such as Georgia  and Lebanon, may also receive higher priority. Furthermore, production  delays for certain equipment items may contribute to equipment shortfalls.  For instance, CSTC-A officials stated that due to production delays,  certain equipment items, such as NATO-standard heavy machine guns and  mortars, were not currently available and would not likely be delivered  until 2009 or 2010. Similarly, Defense officials in Washington, D.C., stated  that production limitations were responsible for some equipment  shortages, particularly in the case of NATO-standard mortars. Additional  factors cited as contributing to equipment shortages included delayed  receipt and execution of fiscal year 2007 funding, accelerated fielding of  ANA units, and difficulties distributing equipment to the field.", "One method to help address shortages while western equipment is delayed  is through increased equipment donations from the international  community. CSTC-A is currently seeking additional contributions,  particularly of Eastern bloc equipment, such as the basic soldier assault  rifle. Between 2002 and March 2008, over 40 non-U.S. donors provided  approximately $426 million to assist in the training and equipping of the  ANA. Eighty-eight percent of this support has been in the area of  equipment; however, the value of equipment donations is determined by  the donor, according to CSTC-A officials. The quality of this donated  equipment has been mixed (see fig. 5), and delivery of some donations has  been delayed due to limited funds to pay for shipments into Afghanistan.", "To address quality issues, NATO and CSTC-A have established procedures  to verify that international donations comply with current needs for the  ANA and, if necessary, verify the condition and completeness of  equipment. Furthermore, to defray the cost of shipments into Afghanistan,  a NATO-administered trust fund has been established to support the  transportation of equipment into Afghanistan. However, Defense officials  stated that the amount of money in the trust fund, which they estimated to  be approximately $1 million, is limited and may not support the  transportation of a large number of donations. Additionally, CSTC-A has  also set aside funding to transport donated goods when required.", "The development of capable ANA forces may be delayed by shortages in  equipment, as units cannot be certified as fully capable in equipment  unless they have 85 percent or more of their critical equipment items.

However, this document included few long-term  milestones, no intermediate milestones for judging progress, and no  sustainability strategy. In 2008, Congress mandated that Defense, in  coordination with State, submit reports on a comprehensive and long-term  strategy and budget for strengthening the ANSF and a long-term detailed  plan for sustaining the ANSF. Defense has yet to provide these reports. As  such it remains difficult to determine if U.S. efforts are on track and how  much more they will cost to complete. Until a coordinated, detailed plan is  completed, Congress will continue to lack visibility into the progress made  to date and the cost of completing this mission\u2014information that is  essential to holding the performing agencies accountable.

State expressed concerns about conditioning future  appropriations on the completion of a detailed plan. In addition, State  highlighted ongoing coordination efforts with Defense as well as certain  other operational changes, many of which occurred after the completion  of our fieldwork in August 2007. For example, while we note that civilian  mentors are not accompanying military mentors into districts that are  considered unsafe, State notes in its comments that civilian police mentors  are now deployed with their military counterparts to all ongoing Focused  District Development districts and that all efforts are made to enable the  deployment of civilian police in support of the program.", "We acknowledge State\u2019s concerns and appreciate its efforts to coordinate  with Defense. However, we believe that a coordinated, detailed plan that  clearly identifies the various agencies\u2019 roles would be beneficial, given the  continuous turnover of U.S. government staff in Afghanistan. We believe a  coordinated, detailed plan with intermediate milestones is also important  particularly in light of the new Focused District Development initiative for  ANP training, which will entail considerable resources and time to  complete. Further, intermediate milestones would provide policymakers  with more information regarding the transition to a normalized security  assistance relationship, as discussed by State in its comments.", "Defense disagreed that Congress should consider conditioning a portion of  future appropriations on completion of a coordinated, detailed plan to  develop the ANSF, and stated that current guidance provided by State and  Defense to the field is sufficient to implement a successful program to  train and equip the ANSF. Defense noted that the 5-page document it  provided to GAO in January 2007 articulated goals for the size,  capabilities, and requirements for the ANSF, and reflected an approach  approved by multiple agencies\u2014including State. Defense also cited a  number of other documents it considers to be part of the effort to develop  the ANSF. Furthermore, Defense disagreed with our conclusion that,  absent a detailed plan, progress in developing the ANSF is difficult to  assess, and stated that monthly progress reports and communication with  Congress provide legislators with the information needed to assess the  program and allocate resources.", "We do not believe that the 5-page document provides a strategic-level plan  for the development of the ANSF. The document does not represent a  coordinated Defense and State plan for completing and sustaining the  ANSF with sufficient detail and transparency for Congress and others to  make informed decisions concerning future resources. This 5-page  document, which Defense now refers to as a \u201cStrategic Vision\u201d and which  CSTC-A officials were unaware of at the time of our review, does not  identify or discuss the roles and responsibilities of the Department of  State, Defense\u2019s key partner in training the ANP. This is an element that  one would expect in a strategic planning document for ANSF  development. Furthermore, the document contains just one date-- December 2008, by which time the 152,000 person ANSF would be  completed. Defense\u2019s document lacks any other intermediate or long-term  milestones by which progress could be measured. While the U.S. role in  training and equipping the ANSF could exceed a decade, according to  CSTC-A representatives, neither the 5-page document nor the documents  identified by Defense in its comments to GAO constitute a sustainability  strategy. For example, while Defense states that the international  community will need to sustain the ANSF for the \u201cnear-term\u201d until  government revenues increase in Afghanistan, the document lacks further  detail regarding the expected time frames for increasing government  revenues, as well as a definition of \u201cnear-term.\u201d As such, it remains unclear  how long Defense and State expect to support the ANSF.", "Furthermore, we maintain that, without a coordinated, detailed plan,  assessing progress in developing the ANSF is difficult.

Specifically, we  independently proposed categories, agreed on the relevant categories,  reviewed reports, and categorized the observations contained therein.  Instances discussed in more than one report were only categorized and  counted the first time they appeared. To ensure the validity and reliability  of this analysis, we reconciled any differences. Once all differences were  reconciled, we analyzed the data to identify the challenges most often  discussed.

Additionally, we compared the funding data with our May 2007  Afghanistan report. Differences between table 1 in this report and the  funding chart presented in our May 2007 report are due to the following  factors:   Certain funds were removed, such as those provided to support a  protective detail for Afghanistan\u2019s President, because agency officials  later clarified that these dollars did not support efforts to train and  equip the ANSF, while certain funds were added, such as those used to  provide support for counter narcotics police, because agency officials  later clarified that these dollars supported efforts to train and equip the  ANSF.", "For fiscal years 2007 and 2008, totals printed in May 2007 included  budget requests.

Overall, based on our  discussions with cognizant officials, we concluded that ANSF capability  and ANA personnel data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  engagement. However, based on concerns expressed by the Joint Chiefs of  Staff and highlighted in our prior work, as well as the results of the census  conducted by Defense, we note in this report that the number of ANP  reported as assigned may not be reliable. Because Defense relies on the  number of ANP reported as assigned as a measure of progress in building  the ANP, we include this figure in our report as evidence that the ANP  appear to have grown in number over the last 3 years.

Defense states that its document establishes quantitative and  qualitative measures to assess ANSF development. While the 5-page  document contains some qualitative measures to assess ANSF  development, it contains only one milestone date, December 2008,  when, according to the document, the ANSF will have achieved initial  independent operating capability. However, this one milestone is not  consistent with dates contained in monthly reports that track manning,  training, equipment, and capability, which have fluctuated. While the  monthly updates are useful in providing the status of ANSF capability,  each monthly report is a snapshot in time without consistent baselines  that would facilitate an assessment of progress over time. For  example, even though the United States began funding and training the  ANA in 2002, the February 2007 report that was provided to GAO as an  attachment to the 5-page document uses three different baselines for  assessing the ANSF\u2014July 2005 for the number of trained and equipped  Afghan army and police, June 2006 for the status of the ANA battalion  Training and Readiness Assessments, and the first quarter of 2007 for  the status of ANA and ANP embedded training teams and mentors.  However, the report does not refer back to 2002 in measuring progress.  Similarly, the Training and Readiness Assessments that are provided  on a quarterly basis to congressional oversight committees are also  snapshots in time.   2.  Defense maintains that the CSTC-A milestones are consistent with  those in the 5-page Defense document. We disagree. The three phases  and associated time frames of ANSF development are articulated  differently in the 5-page document and the CSTC-A Campaign Plan.   For example, Phase III in CSTC-A\u2019s Campaign Plan\u2014Transition to  Strategic Partnership\u2014is not identified as a phase in the 5-page  document.", "Defense also contends that differences between the two documents are  due to developments in the security environment.  While this may be  true, absent a detailed plan with specific time frames, it is difficult to  assess the extent to which deteriorating security delayed ANSF  development.  3.  Defense notes that until government revenues increase in Afghanistan,  the international community will need to sustain the ANSF and that  such international support is required for the \u201cnear-term.\u201d Moreover,  Defense states that, where appropriate, it supports efforts to increase  government revenues in Afghanistan. However, in the absence of  further detail regarding the expected timeline for increasing  government revenues\u2014or the definition of \u201cnear-term\u201d\u2014it remains  unclear how long the United States will need to support the ANSF. As  we note in our report, the United States has been a major contributor  to this mission\u2014investing about $16.5 billion to develop the ANSF.  Furthermore, current costs to sustain the force are estimated to be at  over $2 billion annually. Given that the Afghan government is currently  unable to support the recurring costs of its security forces and that  U.S. officials estimate this mission could exceed a decade, additional  clarity on the estimated length of time and amount of money needed to  complete this mission, and the potential for Afghan financial  contributions, could assist in conducting oversight of the program.  4.  Defense states that the 5-page document received by GAO was a longer  articulation of a plan approved by State. However, although Defense  and State are partners in training the ANP, the fact remains State did  not participate in the development of the 5-page document Defense  provided to GAO, nor has State developed a plan of its own. Defense\u2019s  5-page document does share basic end-strength and capability  information with two slides on ANSF development approved by the  Principals Committee for ANSF Development. However, these slides  do not themselves constitute a coordinated plan and do not contain  elements, such as intermediate milestones, identified by GAO in our  2005 recommendation and agreed to by Defense and State as needed.  5.  Defense contends that the role of State in ANSF development is  articulated in documents other than the 5-page document provided to  GAO. However, while State\u2019s role may be discussed elsewhere, the 5- page document provided to us by Defense does not describe the role of  State or other key stakeholders. If, as stated, Defense intends this  document to provide strategic-level guidance for the development of  the ANSF, including in it an articulation of the roles and  responsibilities of partners and key stakeholders could assist in  implementing and coordinating the program\u2019s efforts. For instance, we  note in our report that the dual chain of command between State and  Defense has complicated the efforts of civilian mentors assisting with  the program.  6.  We maintain that, without a detailed plan, assessing progress in  developing the ANSF is difficult. While Defense produces various  documents that report in detail on the current status of the ANSF,  these documents do not contain consistent baseline data, intermediate  milestones, or consistent end dates necessary to determine if the  program is on track to achieve its desired results within a set time  frame. For example, after 6 years and a U.S. investment of about $16.5  billion in the program, Defense status reports show that, as of April  2008, less than 2 percent (2 of 105) ANA units and no ANP units (0 of  433) are rated as fully capable and the estimated completion date of  these forces is March 2011 and December 2012, respectively. Defense  asserts this is impressive, particularly for the ANA. However, without  interim milestones against which to assess the ANSF, it is difficult to  know if this status constitutes progress or will allow Defense to meet  its currently projected completion dates. Moreover, the completion  dates cited by Defense do not constitute firm goals and have shifted  numerous times during the course of our review. For instance, in  monthly Defense reports dated June 2007, November 2007, and May  2008, completion dates for the ANA fluctuated from December 2008 to  September 2010 to March 2011. Likewise, over the same period,  completion dates for the ANP fluctuated from December 2008 to  March 2009 to December 2012, with a 3-month period when the  completion date was reported as \u201cto be determined.\u201d Moreover, as we  note in our report, Defense officials stated that completion dates  contained in its monthly status reports did not account for shortfalls in  the required number of mentors and trainers and, therefore, could be  subject to further change.", "Defense also states that it only began to support independent  operations capability for the ANA in 2006. While it is true that planned  capability for the ANA was upgraded in 2006, absent a detailed plan, it  is unclear the extent to which this planned capability upgrade should  be expected to affect the timeline for the development of individual  ANA units. Had Defense implemented GAO\u2019s 2005 recommendation to  produce such a plan, it might be able to provide more clarity on the  relationship between planned capability upgrades and program  timelines. Moreover, even though planned ANA capability was  upgraded in 2006, prior to that time, the U.S. invested nearly $3 billion  to develop the ANA and reported approximately 20,000 troops trained  as of May 2005. Absent a plan with performance measures, such as  planned capability, linked to intermediate milestones and end dates, it  is difficult to assess the results achieved by this financial investment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Key contributors to this report include Hynek Kalkus, Assistant Director;   Lynn Cothern; Aniruddha Dasgupta; Mark Dowling; Cindy Gilbert;  Elizabeth Guran; Al Huntington; and Elizabeth Repko."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Combating Terrorism: U.S. Lacks Comprehensive Plan to Destroy  Terrorist Threat and Close Safe Haven in Pakistan\u2019s Federally  Administered Tribal Areas.
