The Department of Justice (DOJ) may not prosecute such cases due to competing priorities, the complexity of these operations, and challenges related to bringing charges under some federal laws.", "Despite these challenges, federal and state agencies as well as stakeholders have taken actions to combat rogue Internet pharmacies. Federal agencies have conducted investigations that have led to convictions, fines, and asset seizures from rogue Internet pharmacies as well as from companies that provide services to them. FDA and other federal agencies have also collaborated with law enforcement agencies around the world to disrupt rogue Internet pharmacy operations. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which are responsible for enforcing laws related to the importation of goods such as prescription drugs, have also worked with other agencies, including FDA, to interdict rogue Internet pharmacy shipments at the border. Given that most rogue Internet pharmacies operate from abroad, states have faced challenges combating them, and generally focus their oversight on licensed in-state entities that fulfill orders for rogue Internet pharmacies. Companies that provide services to Internet-based businesses, such as search engines and payment processors, have also taken action--primarily by blocking services to them.", "FDA and others have taken steps to educate consumers about the dangers of buying prescription drugs from rogue Internet pharmacies.

Specifically, according to agency  officials, from fiscal years 2010 through 2012,", "FDA opened 227 rogue Internet pharmacy investigations and its  investigations led to the conviction of 219 individuals and more than  $76 million in fines and restitution;  ICE initiated 138 investigations and its investigations led to 56  convictions and the seizure of nearly $7 million;", "USPIS worked on 392 investigations and arrested 560 individuals;  IRS conducted 22 investigations and its investigations led to the  conviction of 5 individuals; and", "DEA conducted 49 investigations into rogue Internet pharmacies and  seized more than $1 million.", "In addition to investigating rogue Internet pharmacy operators, federal  agencies have investigated companies for providing services to rogue  Internet pharmacies. In 2011, a DOJ and FDA investigation led to a  settlement under which Google agreed to forfeit $500 million for allowing  certain rogue Internet pharmacies to place sponsored advertisements in  its search engine results from calendar years 2003 through 2009. In  March 2013, a DOJ investigation led to a settlement under which UPS  agreed to forfeit $40 million for transporting and distributing prescription  drugs, including controlled substances, from certain rogue Internet  pharmacies to U.S. consumers from calendar years 2003 through 2010.", "As part of their settlements with DOJ, both companies noted that they will  stop serving rogue Internet pharmacies and create compliance programs  to identify rogue actors, in exchange for not being prosecuted by the U.S.  government for crimes related to this activity. In addition, according to  FedEx documents, DOJ is investigating the company for potentially  violating federal law by shipping prescription drugs from Internet  pharmacies.", "Federal agencies have also taken steps to shut down rogue Internet  pharmacy websites. For example, FDA and other federal agencies have  participated in Operation Pangea, an annual worldwide, week-long  initiative in which regulatory and law enforcement agencies from around  the world work together to combat rogue Internet pharmacies. In 2013,  FDA took action against 1,677 rogue Internet pharmacy websites during  Operation Pangea. In 2012, as part of the Operation, FDA informed  domain name registrars that over 4,100 rogue Internet pharmacy  websites were illegally selling prescription drugs online, in violation of the  registrars\u2019 terms of service with their customers. The agency informed the registrars of these violations in order to encourage them to shut down  these violative websites. FDA officials told us that the effect of such  shutdowns is primarily disruptive since rogue Internet pharmacies often  reopen after their websites get shut down; officials from federal agencies  and stakeholders we spoke with likened shutting down websites to taking  a \u201cwhack-a-mole\u201d approach. One stakeholder noted that rogue Internet  pharmacies own and keep domain names in reserve so that they can  redirect traffic to new websites and maintain operations if any of their  websites get shut down. Rogue Internet pharmacies may also find new  registrars to host their websites\u2014figure 3 provides an example of a rogue  Internet pharmacy website that was shut down during Pangea but that  continued operations by switching to another domain name registrar. FDA  has also issued warning letters to rogue Internet pharmacies to notify  them that they are engaged in potentially illegal activity and direct them to  cease their illegal activity. From calendar years 2009 through 2012,  FDA reported issuing about 30 warning letters to rogue Internet  pharmacies. According to FDA officials, rogue Internet pharmacies often  ignore the letters and continue with their illicit activity. However, in some  cases, FDA\u2019s warning letters have led to the removal of potentially  dangerous products from certain websites. FDA officials told us that  they remain committed to combating rogue Internet pharmacies and in  April 2013 they formed a new Cyber Crimes Investigation Unit that is  devoted to this cause.", "Federal agencies responsible for preventing illegal prescription drug  imports have also interdicted rogue Internet pharmacy shipments. CBP  coordinates with FDA to inspect and seize illicit mail, express courier, and  cargo shipments of prescription drugs presented for import at the border  on a daily basis. CBP also leads Operation Safeguard, a multiagency  initiative to target illicit imports of prescription drugs. Once a month, CBP,  along with FDA and ICE, targets a specific international mail or express  courier facility and, according to agency officials, conducts extensive  examinations and seizures of illicit prescription drug shipments for 3 days.  In total, from fiscal years 2010 through 2012, FDA reported examining  nearly 45,000 shipments and CBP reported seizing more than 14,000  illicit shipments of prescription drugs, with mail shipments constituting the  majority of the shipments that were seized. In addition to seizures of  shipments presented for import, according to USPIS, the agency seized  more than 800 illicit shipments of controlled substances in the domestic  mail system during fiscal year 2012. Despite these efforts, FDA officials  told us that the sheer volume of inbound international mail shipments\u2014 which total nearly 1.2 million pieces every day, according to USPIS\u2014 makes it difficult to interdict all illicit prescription drug imports.", "Other federal agencies have also taken steps to combat rogue Internet  pharmacies by sponsoring research and engaging stakeholders. The  National Science Foundation has provided grants to researchers who  have examined rogue Internet pharmacy operations and developed  strategies for combating them. For example, researchers found that rogue  Internet pharmacies may be vulnerable to efforts to limit their ability to  process online payments.companies to encourage them to limit services to rogue Internet  pharmacies.", "According to DEA officials, illicit pain clinics\u2014brick-and-mortar operations where  customers can obtain prescriptions for controlled substances without a legitimate medical  need\u2014have since emerged as the primary source of controlled substance diversion. agency\u2019s conclusion that domestic and foreign rogue Internet pharmacies  are generally not selling controlled substances. Furthermore, agency  officials told us that they do not track data that could demonstrate a  reduction in the sale of controlled substances online because they told us  there is no reason to do so. DEA officials explained their rationale by  saying that the agency does not collect data on threats that do not exist.  However, DEA\u2019s 2011 assessment of Internet pharmacies that advertised  the sale of controlled substances revealed that 40 percent were selling  such substances. DEA has not gathered additional data to demonstrate  the extent to which controlled substances are being diverted over the  Internet."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Face Challenges Combating Rogue Internet Pharmacies, and Have Focused on Regulating the Activities of Licensed Pharmacies", "paragraphs": ["States face challenges investigating rogue Internet pharmacies and have  played a limited role in combating them. Given that most rogue Internet  pharmacies operate from abroad, stakeholders including NABP, National  Alliance for Model State Drug Laws, and National Association of  Attorneys General, as well as officials from several state attorneys  general offices told us that states do not have the authority, ability, or  resources to investigate and prosecute them. These stakeholders told us  that, as a result, states generally have not investigated rogue Internet  pharmacies for violating their laws. In addition, officials from the five state  boards of pharmacy we interviewed also told us that they do not  proactively investigate unlicensed pharmacy activity, and most of the  boards view the enforcement of unlicensed pharmacy activity as the  responsibility of state law enforcement agencies, rather than themselves.  Accordingly, they have not actively sought to identify or investigate rogue  Internet pharmacies\u2014either in-state or out-of-state\u2014that sell prescription  drugs to customers within their state, though they may look into rogue  Internet pharmacies if they received complaints. Further, board officials  told us that they face challenges enforcing laws outside of their own  states. When rogue Internet pharmacies located in other states violate  their state laws, board officials contact officials of state boards where the  pharmacies are located, and it is then the responsibility of the contacted  boards to take any appropriate investigative or enforcement actions. The  boards may also send cease-and-desist letters or attempt to fine out-of- state pharmacies that violate their states\u2019 laws. However, the boards have  no ability to ensure compliance with enforcement actions against  pharmacies outside of their state that are not licensed in their state.", "State boards of pharmacy focus on regulating licensed brick-and-mortar  pharmacies located within their state. In regulating licensed pharmacies,  officials from each of the five states told us that they have taken  enforcement actions against licensed pharmacies in their states for  fulfilling orders on behalf of rogue Internet pharmacies or illicitly selling  prescription drugs over the Internet. For example, in 2010, the Nevada  Board of Pharmacy revoked the license of a pharmacist for illegally  shipping controlled substances to an out-of-state customer who placed an  order through a rogue Internet pharmacy.

In doing so, they monitor web activity to identify rogue Internet  pharmacies, and employ investigators to gather evidence against rogue  operators. On the basis of their investigations, these manufacturers  provide federal agencies, such as ICE and FDA, with investigative leads  and information that may support existing investigations. In addition,  manufacturers have also provided CBP with information to better target  illicit drug imports and with brochures to help CBP officials differentiate  between legitimate and counterfeit prescription drugs.", "Several stakeholders also help facilitate information sharing between drug  manufacturers and federal agencies on rogue Internet pharmacies. The  Pharmaceutical Security Institute, an association of 26 drug  manufacturers focused on sharing information related to counterfeit  prescription drugs, collects and analyzes surveillance information from its  members and, according to an official from the institute, helps them share  information with federal agencies about the illicit marketing of counterfeit  prescription drugs by rogue Internet pharmacies.

Other Internet pharmacies may  fraudulently display a VIPPS-accreditation logo on their website, despite  not having earned the accreditation, or may fraudulently display Visa,  MasterCard, PayPal, or other logos on their website despite not holding  active accounts with these companies or being able to process such  payments.

Over the last 10 years, several local governments  and consumer organizations have organized bus trips to Canada so that  U.S. residents can purchase prescription drugs at Canadian brick-and- mortar pharmacies at prices lower than those in the United States. More  recently, some state and local governments implemented programs that  provided residents or employees and retirees with access to prescription  drugs from Canadian Internet pharmacies. Despite FDA warnings to  consumers that the agency could not ensure the safety of drugs not  approved for sale in the United States that are purchased from other  countries, the prevalence of such programs may have contributed to a  perception among U.S. consumers that they can readily save money and  obtain safe prescription drugs by purchasing them from Canada.

While some stakeholders broadly supported these  proposals, others noted that because most rogue Internet pharmacies are  operated from overseas, additional federal laws and authorities, such as  those noted below, would have a limited effect on their ability to combat  rogue Internet pharmacies.", "Creating a Federal Definition of a Valid Prescription. Some Members of  Congress and other stakeholders have proposed creating a federal  definition of a valid prescription that applies to all prescription drugs.  Currently, the only federal definition of a valid prescription applies solely  to prescriptions for controlled substances. Although the Federal Food,  Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) requires certain drugs to be dispensed  upon a prescription of a licensed practitioner, it does not define how this  requirement is to be met. Instead, each state\u2019s pharmacy and medical  practice acts define what constitutes a valid prescription. As such, when  federal prosecutors pursue charges against operators of rogue Internet  pharmacies that sell drugs without prescriptions that meet the FDCA\u2019s  prescription requirement, they must research the laws of each relevant  state to determine which ones apply to their case.", "Proponents of a federal definition contend that such a definition would  make it easier and less resource-intensive for federal and state  investigators and prosecutors to gather evidence and build a case against  rogue Internet pharmacy operators who sell drugs without valid  prescriptions. Some contend, however, that such a definition would be of  limited value. They note that, because rogue Internet pharmacy  operations have increasingly moved components of their business  abroad, they are beyond the boundaries of where such a law could be  readily enforced. Additionally, those interested in promoting telemedicine  have raised concerns that these proposals have too narrowly defined the  circumstances for which prescriptions could be issued on the basis of  legitimate medical examinations conducted via telemedicine.", "Developing a Comprehensive List of Legitimate Internet Pharmacies.  Members of Congress have introduced legislation that would have  required the establishment of a comprehensive list of legitimate Internet  pharmacies. Other stakeholders, such as the Alliance for Safe Online  Pharmacies, have also supported this proposal. Members of Congress  and stakeholders have proposed that the Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) would be responsible for establishing and maintaining the list.", "Proponents of a comprehensive list contend that it would help consumers,  stakeholders, and federal and state agencies distinguish between  legitimate and rogue Internet pharmacies. Although the National  Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) and LegitScript have tools on  their websites that enable consumers to identify legitimate Internet  pharmacies, some maintain that FDA management of the list is critical,  and could help to inspire public confidence in the list. Others stated that a  list created by a third party would be helpful, as long as it is endorsed by  the FDA. However, FDA officials and other stakeholders have raised  concerns about the agency\u2019s ability to maintain such a list, given the large  volume of new Internet pharmacies launched and modified every day.  Additionally, FDA does not regulate the practice of pharmacy, which has  long been regulated by the states. Finally, according to officials we  interviewed from two stakeholders that provide services to Internet  businesses, such a list is not necessary as their companies\u2019 policies and  procedures allow them to immediately suspend customer accounts once  they become aware that such customers are violating their policies and  procedures.", "Establishing a Safe Harbor for Companies That Provide Services to  Internet-Based Businesses. Members of Congress have introduced  legislation to provide legal immunity to companies\u2014such as Internet  registrars, search engines, and credit card processors\u2014that ceased or  refused to provide services to rogue Internet pharmacies when acting in  good faith. Proponents state that protection from liability would  encourage companies to block services to rogue Internet pharmacies. In  addition, some told us that such immunity would allow them to more  readily take action against suspected rogue Internet pharmacies.  However, others doubted the necessity of such legislation.

In 2007, Congress  required FDA to develop standards that would apply to such a system, as  well as to develop a standardized numerical identifier that could be  applied to prescription drugs during manufacturing and repackaging. In  response, FDA issued guidance for industry, and hosted a public  workshop on the topic. However, a nationwide track-and-trace system  has not yet been implemented. Supporters of a nationwide track-and- trace system contend that it would enable federal agencies to more  readily identify counterfeit or adulterated prescription drugs, as well as  reduce the potential for counterfeit drugs to enter the supply chain,  including through Internet pharmacies. FDA officials told us that while a  track-and-trace system would benefit multiple stakeholders, it would likely  not directly affect the operations of rogue Internet pharmacies because  such enterprises sell counterfeit and adulterated drugs directly to  consumers, which is not a distribution method that would be covered by a  track-and-trace system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["Marcia Crosse, (202) 512-7114, crossem@gao.gov."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Geri Redican-Bigott, Assistant  Director; Michael Erhardt; Cathleen Hamann; Jason Kelly; Lisa Motley;  Patricia Roy; and Lillian Shields made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Prescription Drug Control: DEA Has Enhanced Efforts to Combat  Diversion, but Could Better Assess and Report Program Results.
