The mark-to-market program was developed for multifamily properties that are both insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and aided through the project-based Section 8 program. Under the mark-to-market program, at the time of the assisted properties' section 8 contract renewal, HUD resets rents to prevailing market levels and restructures a property's mortgage debt, if necessary, to permit a positive cash flow. This process is designed to ensure that properties whose rents are reduced to market level still have sufficient income to meet the mortgage payments and operating expenses on the property. The Office of Multifamily Housing Assistance Restructuring (OMHAR) was established within HUD to administer the mark-to-market program. OMHAR places federally assisted, FHA-insured properties on the watch list when their rents have been reduced to market level under the mark-to-market program but their mortgages have not been restructured. Two-hundred and eleven properties have been placed on the watch list, for one of three reasons: (1) the property owners elected not to enter into or complete the mortgage restructuring process; (2) OMHAR determined that the property was not financially viable for restructuring; or (3) the property owners were disqualified from the mortgage restructuring process because of certain actions by the owner, such as financial or managerial improprieties. Eighty-seven percent of OMHAR's watch list properties received HUD inspections that indicated they were in satisfactory physical condition, but some of these inspections occurred before the properties were placed in the watch list. The timing of HUD's inspection cycle depends on the results of each property's most recent inspection. As a result, a watch list property that received a high score on its previous physical inspection may not be reinspected for up to 3 years from the last inspection. While OMHAR believes that all properties on the watch list are potentially at financial risk, HUD's Financial Assessment Subsystem--which contains information on property owners' audited annual financial statements--indicates that 62 percent of the watch list properties show signs of potential financial risk. HUD established guidance for monitoring the watch list properties 10 months ago, but it is too early to assess how effective the monitoring will be."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 1997, Congress established the mark-to-market program to help preserve the availability and affordability of low-income rental housing while also reducing the cost to the federal government of rental assistance provided to low-income households. There is a shortage of affordable housing in the United States, particularly in tight housing markets. The mark-to-market program was developed for multifamily properties that are both insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and aided through the project-based Section 8 program. HUD\u2019s project-based Section 8 program provides rental subsidies to participating property owners to supplement rent paid by eligible low-income families for units in those properties. The impetus for the mark-to-market program was the determination that unit rents in many of these properties exceeded those prevailing in the market, resulting in higher federal subsidies to property owners.", "Under the mark-to-market program, at the time of the assisted properties\u2019 section 8 contract renewal, HUD \u201cmarks\u201d (i.e., resets) rents to prevailing market levels and restructures a property\u2019s mortgage debt, if necessary, to permit a positive cash flow. This process is designed to ensure that properties whose rents are reduced to market level still have sufficient income to meet the mortgage payments and operating expenses on the property. The Office of Multifamily Housing Assistance Restructuring (OMHAR) was established within HUD to administer the mark-to-market program.", "Property owners receiving above market rents are eligible to enter the mark-to-market process when their current Section 8 contracts are about to expire. Once a property owner decides to enter the mark-to-market process, OMHAR determines how much the property\u2019s rents will be reduced and whether the property needs mortgage restructuring. OMHAR assigns each property that needs a mortgage restructuring to a contractor who works with the owner to develop a restructuring plan that would permit a positive cash flow in light of the reduced rents. Since the inception of the mark-to-market program, over 2,000 properties have entered the restructuring process. Of these, over 200 properties that needed a mortgage restructuring have not completed the process. These properties represent 15,301 units and approximately $207 million in outstanding mortgage principle. OMHAR believes these properties are at risk of physical and financial problems because, according to the contractors\u2019 financial analyses, the properties will not have sufficient cash flow to meet their mortgage payments and operating expenses without restructuring. Moreover, because these properties are insured by FHA, if any of the properties should go into default, FHA will likely be responsible for paying the lender\u2019s claim. In order to closely monitor these properties, OMHAR placed them on a watch list and, in concert with HUD\u2019s Office of Multifamily Housing, developed and implemented new monitoring procedures for them.", "Because of your concerns about the possible problems associated with the watch-list properties, you asked us to examine HUD\u2019s oversight of these properties. As agreed with your offices, this report examines (1) the reasons OMHAR places Section 8 properties on the watch list, (2) the physical condition of the properties, (3) the financial condition of the properties, and (4) HUD\u2019s monitoring procedures for the properties.", "To assess the reasons that Section 8 properties were placed on the watch list, we analyzed available data from OMHAR. We also conducted telephone interviews with contractors responsible for developing the restructuring plans for a random sample of these properties. To determine the physical and financial condition of the watch-list properties, we analyzed data on the results of HUD\u2019s physical inspections and assessments of annual financial statements submitted by property owners. To examine the procedures that HUD uses to monitor the watch-list properties, we (1) reviewed HUD guidelines for monitoring properties and (2) discussed the implementation of the guidelines at selected HUD field offices. We also conducted case studies for six watch-list properties to obtain detailed information on the reasons they were placed on the watch list, the implications of their rents being reduced to market levels, the physical and financial condition of the properties, and HUD\u2019s role in monitoring them. For detailed descriptions of the properties included in our case studies, see appendixes I through VI. Data are current as of April 2002, unless otherwise noted. We conducted our review from October 2001 to July 2002, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. (See app. VII for additional discussion of our scope and methodology.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["To date, over 800,000 units in approximately 8,500 multifamily housing projects have been financed with mortgages insured by FHA and supported by project-based Section 8 housing assistance payments contracts. Many of these contracts set rents at amounts higher than those of the local market. As these housing subsidy contracts expire, Congress has mandated that the rents on these privately owned multifamily properties be lowered to market levels.", "For those properties identified by HUD as having above-market rents, Congress created the mark-to-market program in 1997 to reduce rents to market levels and restructure existing mortgage debt to levels supportable by these rents. The goals of the mark-to-market program include preserving the affordability and the availability of low-income rental housing, while reducing the long-term costs of Section 8 project-based assistance. The restructuring generally involves resetting rents to market levels and reducing mortgage debt, if necessary, to permit a positive cash flow. To facilitate the restructurings, Congress provided OMHAR with certain tools, such as the ability to reduce an owner\u2019s mortgage payments by creating a new first mortgage and, where necessary, deferring some of the debt to a second mortgage, which is only required to be repaid if sufficient cash flow is available.", "The mark-to-market process begins when a property\u2019s existing Section 8 project contract is nearing expiration and the owner decides to remain in the program. Before a new Section 8 contract is awarded, these property owners are required to submit to HUD a market study that contains information on market rents for comparable properties located within the subject property\u2019s geographic area. Local HUD field offices review these market studies and, where studies show a property owner\u2019s rents are not above market, have the option and authority to award the owner with a new Section 8 contract. HUD field offices forward cases to OMHAR when a market study submitted by an owner shows their rents are above market. OMHAR, in turn, provides these cases to contractors, known as participating administrative entities (PAE), who also conduct market studies, carry out the analysis necessary for restructurings, and prepare restructuring plans and documentation.", "Under the mark-to-market program, properties whose rents are above market levels undergo one of two types of restructuring. Mortgage restructurings generally involve resetting rents to market levels and reducing mortgage debt to permit an acceptable, positive cash flow. For this type of restructuring, the PAE develops restructuring plans based on a reduction in rents and mortgage debt and submits the plans to OMHAR for review and approval. Before the restructuring plans can be implemented, owners are required to enter into a new 20-year Section 8 contract and to sign an affordability and use agreement promising to maintain restrictions aimed at preserving the designated units as affordable housing for at least 30 years\u201410 years beyond the Section 8 contract period. Property owners must agree to contribute 20 percent of the total cost of rehabilitation needs of the property. The remaining rehabilitation costs are included in the second mortgage that is created during the restructuring process. Rent restructuring also involves the PAEs developing restructuring plans that must be approved by OMHAR. However, these plans are based only on a reduction in the rents, not the mortgage debt. Rent restructurings are only permitted for properties that can demonstrate the ability to have acceptable, positive cash flow with a rent reduction but without a mortgage restructuring. There are no affordability and use restrictions on properties that receive rent restructuring, and the Section 8 contracts are usually renewed for 5 years.", "Approximately 211 properties have not completed the mortgage restructuring process, even though, as a result of having their rents reduced to market level, OMHAR determined that such a restructuring is necessary for the properties to have acceptable, positive cash flows.OMHAR places properties that it believes should have had a mortgage restructuring on the watch list because it believes such properties are at risk of developing physical and financial problems stemming from insufficient cash flow. These property owners receive a 1-year renewal watch-list contract.", "After OMHAR places these properties on its watch list, it becomes the responsibility of HUD field offices to monitor them as part of their asset management duties. Guidance issued by HUD in September 2001 requires HUD field offices to monitor watch properties for signs of physical, financial, and management deterioration. Based on the guidance, field office staff should review available data on the properties\u2019 physical and financial condition, and conduct periodic management reviews and site visits for properties showing signs of impending default. If a field office observes a decline in the properties\u2019 physical or financial condition, it can refer the property to HUD\u2019s Departmental Enforcement Center (DEC) for analysis and a potential corrective action plan. In cases where owners fail to comply, DEC can resort to enforcement actions, such as the issuance of civil money penalties, taking debarment and suspension actions, and recommending foreclosure.", "HUD\u2019s REAC conducts physical inspections of all HUD multifamily properties, including watch-list properties. One of the key monitoring responsibilities of HUD project managers is to monitor the results of these physical inspections, which are captured in HUD\u2019s Guidance for Oversight of Multifamily Physical Inspections. HUD\u2019s monitoring guidelines direct project managers to pay special attention to properties receiving a substandard or severe physical inspection score of 59 or below, including follow-up with the property owners to ensure that all exigent deficiencies (health and safety issues) are corrected in 3 business days.", "Each year HUD requires property owners to submit audited financial statements for all multifamily housing properties it insures and/or subsidizes. Using its Financial Assessment Subsystem (FASS), HUD develops a score that indicates the level of financial health associated with such properties. This financial score represents a single aggregate financial measure that synthesizes data from five different financial ratios. For example, the debt service coverage ratio compares a property\u2019s net operating income to its mortgage amount and demonstrates whether the property has sufficient cash flow to meet its debt service obligations. If a property\u2019s income is equal to its debt service, the debt service coverage ratio is 1.0. Generally, HUD expects a property\u2019s income to be at least 120 percent of its debt, or have a debt service coverage ratio of 1.2 or higher."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Properties Are on the Watch List for One of Three Reasons", "paragraphs": ["OMHAR places properties on the watch list when a property\u2019s rents are reduced to market level but its mortgage is not restructured. As of April 15, 2002, OMHAR had placed 211 properties on the watch list for one of three reasons. OMHAR assigned the majority of these properties to the watch list because the property owners elected not to enter into or complete the mortgage restructuring process, even though OMHAR had determined that the mortgage needed to be restructured. In addition, OMHAR placed some properties on the watch list because it decided that restructuring the mortgage was not financially feasible under OMHAR\u2019s guidelines. Finally, OMHAR placed a few properties on the watch list because the owner\u2019s actions, such as financial or managerial improprieties, resulted in the owner\u2019s ineligibility for a mortgage restructuring. Figure 1 below shows the percentage and number of properties placed on the watch list by reason."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Owners\u2019 Refusal to Restructure Mortgage Is Most Common Reason OMHAR Placed Properties on the Watch List", "paragraphs": ["According to HUD data, most owners on the watch list refused to enter into or complete the restructuring process. OMHAR considers these owners \u201cuncooperative.\u201d According to OMHAR, uncooperative owners include those who (1) fail at any point during the process to supply information needed to complete the restructuring process, (2) fail to respond in a timely manner to the PAE\u2019s proposed restructuring plan, (3) fail to address critical repair needs in a timely manner, and (4) fail to close on a viable transaction.", "OMHAR officials told us that property owners did not restructure their mortgages for several different reasons. OMHAR and PAEs, who work closely with owners while developing restructuring plans, agreed that the most common reasons owners refuse to enter into or complete the restructuring process are (1) the required out-of-pocket funds for rehabilitation and repairs and (2) the owners\u2019 perception that properties could operate sufficiently at the reduced rents. Under mark-to-market program regulations, each owner who is participating in a mortgage restructuring is required to contribute 20 percent of the total cost of rehabilitation of the property. For example, the owner of one of the properties we visited for a case study did not complete the restructuring because he refused to pay approximately $26,000 for contributions toward rehabilitation and escrow costs. OMHAR determined that with restructuring, the property would have an acceptable cash flow. However, because of the owner\u2019s refusal to complete the restructuring process, OMHAR believes the property does not have sufficient income to cover its debt and operating expenses. See appendix V for more information on this case study property.", "Some owners chose not to have their mortgages restructured because, despite OMHAR\u2019s determination that a restructuring was necessary to provide for an acceptable cash flow, the owners felt that they could successfully operate the property at reduced cash flow. According to one housing industry representative, some owners disagree with OMHAR\u2019s conclusion that their property\u2019s mortgage needed to be restructured. The housing industry official stated that she believes that some owners have valid arguments against OMHAR\u2019s conclusion and that their properties could operate successfully at reduced cash flow. According to OMHAR, there are some properties on the watch list that may operate successfully at reduced rents until they have a major capital repair need that will affect their cash flow because they do not have sufficient reserves to cover the repair.", "Another reason some property owners have not restructured their mortgages is their reluctance to enter into a 30-year affordability and use agreement, as required in the act. This agreement requires that a certain percentage of units must be leased to families whose incomes do not exceed a certain percentage of the area median income. According to a PAE, some owners are concerned about entering into a 30-year affordability and use agreement when the contract HUD has established for a mortgage restructuring is only for a 20-year period, which leaves 10 years when the owner will have to provide affordable housing without the guarantee of a Section 8 contract. Also, an industry official representing owners noted that some owners are also concerned about agreeing to a 30- year affordability and use agreement when their property is already 20 to 30 years old and they are uncertain about the viability of their property in 30 years. According to HUD\u2019s database, most properties on the watch list are at least 20 years old.", "According to OMHAR, some property owners have not restructured their mortgages because they are planning to opt out of the project-based Section 8 program. When an owner chooses to opt out of the project-based Section 8 program, eligible tenants are offered assistance in the form of tenant-based vouchers, which they may use at the same property. According to OMHAR, some owners may be able to obtain higher subsidies through tenant-based assistance because the market rents established for tenant-based assistance may be higher than the market rents established for the property through the mark-to-market process.", "Secondly, OMHAR also places properties on the watch list if it determines that because of economic conditions in the market and/or a property\u2019s financial and/or physical condition, restructuring the property is not financially viable. According to OMHAR, the majority of the 31 watch-list properties that were determined to be financially nonviable were nonviable due to a combination of the economic conditions in the market and the property\u2019s financial and/or physical condition. Two of the properties we visited for case studies were declared by OMHAR to be financially not viable for restructuring. For example, one property we visited in Washington, D.C., required over $4 million in rehabilitation and had an outstanding mortgage balance of about $1.3 million. OMHAR determined that, given the market rents in the area, the property could not generate enough income to finance the mortgage and rehabilitation costs. The other property that we visited that OMHAR declared financially nonviable was located in Rhode Island. OMHAR determined that restructuring was not viable for this property because it had an unpaid mortgage balance of $421,280 but appraised at only $217,000 and required $200,000 in rehabilitation costs. See appendixes II and III for more information on these properties.", "Third, OMHAR places properties on the watch list because of an owner\u2019s actions.

Thus far, 70 properties that were at one time on the watch list have been removed. Under watch-list monitoring guidelines, properties can remain on the watch list for 3 or more years. According to OMHAR, a property can be removed if, after 3 years on the watch list, it has maintained its physical and financial condition. No properties have been removed from the watch list for this reason. In addition, properties can be removed from the watch list if the owners prepay their FHA-insured mortgage. Property owners who prepay their FHA-insured mortgages may continue to have Section 8 contracts but no longer represent a financial risk to the FHA insurance fund. Thirty-two properties have been removed from the watch list for this reason. Properties are also removed from the watch list if the owner decides to reenter the mortgage restructuring process, as has occurred with 32 properties. In addition, properties are removed from the watch list if the owner opts out of the Section 8 program, as has occurred with six properties."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Most Watch-List Properties Received Satisfactory Physical Inspection Scores", "paragraphs": ["According to HUD\u2019s latest physical inspection results, the majority of watch-list properties are in satisfactory physical condition.

However, 75 of these properties have not been inspected since being placed on the watch list.", "HUD uses the same criteria for determining the timing of inspections for watch-list properties as it does for other multifamily properties. Under HUD\u2019s guidelines, properties that receive a physical inspection score between 90 and 100 are to be reinspected in 3 years, properties that receive a score between 80 and 89 are to be reinspected in 2 years, and properties that receive a score of less than 80 are to be reinspected in 1 year. HUD data indicate that 131 of the watch-list properties received scores between 80 and 100 on their most recent inspection and therefore are not required to be reinspected for 2 or 3 years. According to HUD and industry officials, watch-list properties are at risk of developing physical problems because, in response to reduced cash flow, some owners are likely to cut back on routine maintenance, major improvements, and contributions to replacement reserves.", "Twenty-six of the watch-list properties, or 12 percent, received a substandard physical inspection score between 31 and 59 on their most recent inspection. Properties with scores in this range may exhibit a variety of significant problems. For example, a property we reviewed in Florida for our case studies that received a score of 33 had a wide range of deficiencies, including health and safety issues, such as inoperable smoke detectors and missing or broken electrical outlets. See appendix I for more information on this case study.", "Three watch-list properties, or about 1 percent of the total, received a physical inspection score of 30 or less\u2014which HUD considers severely distressed. Severely distressed properties are likely to have major problems. One of our case study properties received a score of 21.

According to HUD officials, the overall FASS score is meant to provide HUD with information on the financial condition of its aggregate portfolio and highlight properties that warrant further investigation by spotting potential financial problems before they occur. These officials also told us that these data should be used in conjunction with other available information to assess a property\u2019s overall financial condition.", "One of the indicators that are included in the FASS score is the debt service coverage ratio, which shows how much revenue is available to pay mortgage payments. We found that 97 of the 211 watch-list properties, or about 46 percent, had debt service coverage ratios below 1.0. Specifically, 73 of the 95 high-risk properties, 18 of the 36 cautionary properties, and 6 of the 66 acceptable properties had debt service coverage ratios below 1.0.
