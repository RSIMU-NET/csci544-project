To accomplish its mission, FAA provides services 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, through its air traffic control (ATC) system\u2014the principal component of the NAS. Predicted growth in air traffic and aging equipment led FAA to initiate a multibillion-dollar modernization effort in 1981 to increase the safety, capacity, and efficiency of the system. However, over the past 17 years, FAA\u2019s modernization program has experienced substantial cost overruns, lengthy schedule delays, and significant performance shortfalls. Consequently, many of the benefits anticipated from the modernization program\u2014new facilities, equipment, and procedures\u2014have not been realized, and the efficiency of air traffic control operations has been limited. In addition, the expected growth in air traffic will place added strains on the system\u2019s capacity.", "To get the modernization effort back on track and thereby address the limitations of the present system and meet the growing demand for increasing its capacity, FAA\u2014in consultation with the aviation community\u2014is developing plans to implement a phased approach to modernization, including a new concept of air traffic management known as \u201cfree flight.\u201d To enable free flight, FAA intends to introduce a host of new technologies and procedures that will allow the agency to gradually move from its present system of air traffic control, which relies heavily on rules, procedures, and tight control over aircraft operations, to a more collaborative system of air traffic management. Under such a system, users would have more flexibility to select optimal flight paths, whose use would lower costs, improve safety, and help accommodate future growth in air traffic through the more efficient use of airspace and airport resources. Implementing this new air traffic management system will require FAA to introduce new technologies and procedures. FAA plans to test other new technologies and procedures through an initiative called Flight 2000 (now the Free Flight Operational Enhancement Program)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "National Airspace System/Air Traffic Control System", "paragraphs": ["FAA\u2019s air traffic controllers direct aircraft through the NAS. Automated information-processing and display, communication, navigation, surveillance, and weather equipment allow air traffic controllers to see the location of aircraft, aircraft flight plans, and prevailing weather conditions, as well as to communicate with pilots. FAA controllers are primarily located in three types of facilities: air traffic control towers, terminal area facilities, and en route centers. The functions of each type of facility are described below. \u2022 Airport towers control the flow of aircraft\u2014before landing, on the ground, and after take-off\u2014within 5 nautical miles of the airport and up to 3,000 feet above the airport. A combination of technological and visual surveillance is used by air traffic controllers to direct departures and approaches, as well as to communicate instructions and weather-related information to pilots. \u2022 Terminal area facilities\u2014known as Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facilities\u2014sequence and separate aircraft as they approach and leave busy airports, beginning about 5 nautical miles and extending to about 50 nautical miles from the airport and up to 10,000 feet above the ground. \u2022 Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC)\u2014or en route centers\u2014control planes in transit over the continental United States and during approaches to some airports. Planes are controlled through regions of airspace by en route centers responsible for the regions. Control is passed from one en route center to another as a plane moves across a region until it reaches TRACON airspace. Most of the en route centers\u2019 controlled airspace extends above 18,000 feet for commercial aircraft. En route centers also handle lower altitudes when dealing directly with a tower or after agreeing with a terminal facility. Aircraft over the ocean are handled by en route centers in Oakland and New York. Beyond the radars\u2019 sight, controllers must rely on periodic radio communications through a third party\u2014Aeronautical Radio Incorporated (ARINC), a private organization funded by the airlines and FAA to operate radio stations\u2014to determine aircraft locations. \u2022 Flight Service Stations provide weather and flight plan services, primarily for general aviation pilots.", "See figure 1.1 for a visual summary of air traffic control over the continental United States and oceans.", "FAA will continue to operate en route, terminal, and tower facilities under the new air traffic management system; controllers in these facilities will be able to manage flight operations more collaboratively through the use of new decision support tools.

Under this new management system, air traffic control is expected to move gradually from a highly structured system based on elaborate rules and procedures to a more flexible system that allows pilots, within limits, to change their route, speed, and altitude, notifying the air traffic controller of the new route. In contrast, under the present system, while flight plans are developed in conjunction with air traffic control personnel, aircraft are required to fly along specific routes with minimal deviation. When deviations from designated routes are allowed\u2014to, for example, avoid severe weather\u2014they must be pre-approved by an air traffic controller. Under free flight, despite the availability of flexibilities to pilots, the ultimate decision-making authority for air traffic operations will continue to reside with controllers.", "While FAA and the aviation community have recently increased their efforts to implement free flight, the concept of free flight\u2014allowing pilots to fly more optimal routes\u2014is not new. In fact, the idea has been around for decades. With the development of navigation technology in the 1970s that allowed aircraft to fly directly from origin to destination without following fixed air routes (highways in the sky), the possibility of providing pilots with flexibility in choosing routes became viable. However, until recently, movement to develop the procedures and decision support systems needed to fully use this type of point-to-point navigation has been slow. In the last several years, because of the need to meet demands for increasing the system\u2019s capacity and efficiency, FAA and aviation system users and their major trade organizations, representatives of air traffic control personnel, equipment manufacturers, the Department of Defense (DOD), and others (collectively referred to as stakeholders) have been working on plans to accelerate the implementation of free flight.", "To enable this new system of air traffic management, FAA plans to introduce a range of new technologies and procedures that will give pilots and controllers more precise information about the location of aircraft. This information will eventually allow for the distances between aircraft to be safely reduced\u2014in turn, allowing more aircraft to operate in the system. For example, a new tool planned for use primarily in the en route environment will give controllers better information about the location of aircraft so that they can detect and resolve potential conflicts sooner than they can using current technology. Similarly, pilots will have more precise information about the location of their aircraft in relation to other aircraft. The use of these technologies will help to improve the system\u2019s safety and capacity. While free flight will provide pilots with more flexibility, different situations will dictate its use. For instance, in clear, uncrowded skies, pilots may be able to use free flight fully, but some restrictions may be necessary during bad weather or in highly congested areas."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FAA Developed a Definition of Free Flight With Stakeholders", "paragraphs": ["\u201ca safe and efficient flight operating capability under instrument flight rules in which the operators have the freedom to select their path and speed in real time.

In addition, under certain conditions, these users may be allowed to safely reduce the distance between themselves and other aircraft. Similarly, in airspace between 5 and 50 miles from the airport, the improved sequencing of traffic for approaches and landings will provide the potential for users to operate more efficiently than under the present system. Improved sequencing is expected to increase the number of aircraft that can safely operate in this environment at a given time. In addition, improved information sharing between pilots and controllers on the location of aircraft on an airport\u2019s surface, for example, is expected to allow for better use of the airport\u2019s surface capacity (such as runways and gates).

To define free flight and develop recommendations, associated initiatives, and time frames for its implementation, FAA has worked with stakeholders under the leadership of RTCA\u2014a nonprofit organization that serves as an advisor to FAA. As of July 1998, 1 of 44 recommendations had been completed, and substantial progress has been made in implementing many of the initiatives that fall under the remaining recommendations.", "While working to implement the 44 recommendations, FAA and stakeholders agreed on the need to focus their efforts on deploying technologies designed to provide early benefits to users.

The vast majority of these recommendations (35 of 44) were to be completed in the near term (1995 through 1997), 6 are focused on the midterm (1998 through 2000), and 3 are to be completed in the far term (2001 and beyond). See appendix I for a list of these recommendations.", "Since late 1995, FAA and stakeholders have been working on various free flight recommendations and many associated initiatives and, in August 1996, agreed on an action plan to guide their implementation. According to FAA, through July 1998, they have fully implemented only 1 of the 35 near-term recommendations\u2014to incorporate airline schedule updates, such as delays and cancellations, into FAA\u2019s Traffic Flow Management system to help it reduce unnecessary restrictions and delays imposed on airline operations. However, FAA and stakeholders have made substantial progress in implementing many of the initiatives under the near-term recommendations. For example, as outlined under a recommendation to extend the benefits of data exchange, FAA has deployed digital pre-departure clearances at 57 sites, which provide pilots with departure information via digital cockpit displays and reduce the need for voice messages. In addition, 49 of these sites have Digital Automatic Terminal Information Service, which provides information about current weather, airport, and facility conditions around the world. Digital communications provide an advantage over voice communications by helping to relieve congested voice frequencies and reduce the number of operational errors that are caused directly or indirectly by miscommunication. Under another recommendation, FAA is working with stakeholders through an RTCA task force to find ways to reduce the time and cost associated with the agency\u2019s process for approving new technologies for flight operations. To address another recommendation, FAA has deployed a technology, on a limited basis, for controllers\u2019 use that is expected to improve the sequencing of air traffic as aircraft enter, leave, and operate within terminal airspace.", "Work is under way on six midterm and three far-term recommendations and their associated initiatives. For the most part, these recommendations focus on incremental improvements to the core technologies that are being deployed under Free Flight Phase 1 and those planned for deployment under Flight 2000 (now the Free Flight Operational Enhancement Program). For example, in the midterm, FAA has begun to modify controllers\u2019 workstations and supporting computer equipment to accept, process, and display data received from satellites. In addition, under a far-term recommendation, FAA is studying the feasibility of using satellite-based information to provide more precise information for landing during periods of limited visibility.", "FAA also noted that while it was in the early stages of planning for the implementation of free flight, it took steps to maximize the air traffic control system\u2019s capacity and efficiency by extending flexibilities to users\u2014to select and fly more efficient flight paths when operating in designated altitudes/areas\u2014through programs such as the National Route Program (NRP)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Existing Programs Extend Some Flexibility to Users", "paragraphs": ["FAA has two early efforts under way to allow users (under certain conditions) to select routes and procedures that will save them time and money\u2014NRP and the Future Air Navigation System (FANS). Established in 1990, NRP is intended to conserve fuel by allowing users to select preferred or direct routes. FAA estimates that NRP saves the aviation industry over $40 million annually. These savings are realized, in part, because pilots are allowed to take advantage of favorable winds or minimize the effects of unfavorable winds, thereby reducing fuel consumption. Initially allowed only at higher altitudes, the program has been expanded to include operations down to 29,000 feet. FAA is also working to decrease, where appropriate, the present restriction that flights must be 200 miles from their point of departure before they can participate and must end their participation 200 miles prior to landing.", "FANS uses new technologies and procedures that enhance communication between pilots and air traffic controllers and provide more precise information on the position of aircraft\u2014allowing for improvements in air navigation safety and in the ability of air traffic controllers to monitor flights. Used primarily over the oceans and in remote areas normally out of the range of ground-based navigation aids, FANS uses digital communication more than voice communication to exchange information such as an aircraft\u2019s location, speed, and altitude. Although FANS is gradually being implemented in many regions and countries, the aviation community believes that for its full operational benefits (such as time and fuel savings) to be realized, air traffic control procedures need to be modified to shorten the distance currently required between aircraft.

Much as we found in reviewing the system\u2019s logical architecture in February 1997, the task force found that the architecture under development appropriately built on the concept of operations for the NAS and identified the programs necessary to meet users\u2019 needs. However, the task force found that the architecture was insufficient because of issues associated with cost, risk, and lack of commitment from users.", "In response, the task force recommended a phased approach that would cost less, focus more on providing near-term benefits to users, and modernize the NAS incrementally. Many of the initiatives identified under the near- and midterm recommendations will be included under this phased approach because these initiatives are expected to provide early benefits for users. A central tenet of this approach is the \u201cbuild a little, test a little\u201d concept of technology development and deployment\u2014intended to limit efforts to a manageable scope, identify and mitigate risks, and deploy technologies before the system is fully mature when they can immediately improve the system\u2019s safety, efficiency, and/or capacity. Such a phased approach to implementing free flight was designed to help the agency avoid repeating past modernization problems associated with overly ambitious cost, schedule, and performance goals and to restore users\u2019 faith in its ability to deliver on its promises.", "As a first step toward the phased implementation of free flight, FAA\u2014in coordination with stakeholders\u2014outlined a plan for Free Flight Phase 1 in early 1998. This plan is expected to be implemented by 2002. As currently envisioned, Free Flight Phase 1 calls for the expedited deployment of certain NAS technologies. The technologies\u2014which are at various stages of development and will be further refined and tested are the (1) Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) Build 1, (2) User Request Evaluation Tool (URET), (3) Single Center Traffic Management Advisor (TMA), (4) Collaborative Decision Making (CDM), (5) Surface Movement Advisor (SMA), and (6) Passive Final Approach Spacing Tool (pFAST). In general, these technologies are expected to provide tools for controllers that will help to increase the safety and capacity of the air traffic control system and benefit users through savings on fuel and crew costs. For example, FAA and many stakeholders believe that TMA and pFAST should improve controllers\u2019 ability to more efficiently sequence traffic to improve its flow in crowded terminal airspace.", "Similarly, they believe the URET conflict probe will improve controllers\u2019 ability to detect and resolve potential conflicts sooner than present technology allows. However, in June 1998, the air traffic controllers\u2019 union at one of the two en route centers where URET is being tested asked that its use be terminated until several concerns about its use in the current environment can be resolved. Termination did not occur at this facility, and the issue has been elevated to the regional level within FAA for resolution.

One stakeholder stressed that the effectiveness of these teams has also been limited by (1) inadequate training of members on how to operate a team and (2) the fact that these teams are given responsibility for projects without the commensurate authority they need to carry out their responsibilities. Some stakeholders also noted that the agency has not made a number of decisions about modernization because of ongoing disagreements among various program offices over how best to proceed with its various components, such as the selection of new free flight technologies for communicating information digitally rather than by voice.", "The concerns cited above are consistent with our prior work on FAA\u2019s culture as it affects acquisition management. In particular, we found that the agency has previously had difficulty communicating and coordinating effectively across traditional program lines. In addition, we learned from some FAA staff and functional managers that FAA has encountered resistance to the integrated product team concept and these teams\u2019 operations. As we reported, one major factor impeding coordination has been FAA\u2019s organization into different divisions whose \u201cstovepipes,\u201d or upward lines of authority and communication, are separate and distinct. Because FAA\u2019s operational divisions are based on a functional specialty, such as engineering, air traffic control, or equipment maintenance, getting the employees in these units to work together has been difficult. Internal and external studies have found that the operations and development sides of FAA have not forged effective partnerships.", "To its credit, FAA is currently attempting to improve cross-agency communication and coordination by developing incentives for staff to work toward the agency\u2019s goals and priorities. Plans are also under way to develop contracts with each integrated product team to hold its members accountable for developing and deploying a given operational capability. According to FAA officials, these contracts are intended to improve accountability for delivering technologies; in the past, such accountability has not been clearly assigned.

In addition, airlines do not want to install new equipment too early because they want to be able to take advantage of opportunities to purchase the best technologies at the lowest cost; however, they do not want to equip too late and miss out on the benefits. Similarly, because DOD must request funding well before installing new equipment, it needs ample lead time to develop budget requests and installation schedules for many of its aircraft, which number more than 16,000.

For example, a recent report by the National Research Council on human factors and automation raised concerns that, among other things, the increased use of automation may lead to confusion among pilots, controllers, and airline operations personnel over where control lies, especially in a free flight environment.As a result, the report recommended that until these and other human factors issues are better understood, the introduction of automated tools should proceed gradually and decision-making authority should continue to reside on the ground with controllers.", "A related issue is the need to incorporate the consideration of human factors into the product development cycle to avoid costly and cumbersome changes at the end of the development process. An FAA human factors official told us that FAA has learned a lot from its experience with the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) about the need to involve users in considering human factors throughout the product development cycle\u2014from the mission needs statement, forward. This official stressed that the agency can pay to consider human factors throughout the acquisition cycle or pay more later, as it is doing with STARS, to fix the problems that arise when these factors are not considered. Furthermore, when human factors are not considered along the way, problems cannot always be fixed. Fewer options are available at the end of a development cycle for modifying a given technology. Stakeholders agreed with this assessment.", "While FAA has developed guidelines for considering human factors during the technology development process, it has not established a formal requirement for using these guidelines. In June 1996, we reported that FAA\u2019s work on human factors was not centralized, and we recommended that the Secretary of Transportation direct FAA to ensure that all units coordinate their research through the agency\u2019s Human Factors Division.According to some FAA officials and one stakeholder, such coordination is still lacking and the agency\u2019s programs would benefit from assigning responsibility for human factors to a higher level within FAA so that these issues can receive sufficient attention from the agency\u2019s senior management. In addition, several stakeholders stressed the importance of retaining the same members on teams that address concerns about human factors through the entire development process.
