Historically, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has considered telephone assistance to be the most efficient method to help taxpayers. IRS has three toll-free telephone programs that taxpayers can use to seek assistance, deal with delinquent taxes, and obtain forms and publications. Of these programs, Taxpayer Services has operated the largest one\u2014the telephone assistance program\u2014for almost three decades. According to IRS, the program is a principal means for promoting the public\u2019s confidence in IRS and voluntary compliance with tax laws.

Procedural inquiries involve routine issues like where to file a tax return or how to get a particular form or publication. Account inquiries concern tax bills, notices, and other correspondence relating to a specific taxpayer.", "Assistors at 27 IRS call sites answer taxpayers\u2019 calls year round. According to IRS officials, assistors at the call sites have access to IRS\u2019 10 service center databases, which contain taxpayer account information. In fiscal year 1994, these call sites received almost 156 million calls. IRS also operates Tele-Tax, an automated system in which taxpayers can listen to selected topic tapes 24 hours a day and inquire about the status of their refunds Monday to Friday from 7:00 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. In fiscal year 1994, Tele-Tax answered about 34 million calls. Organizationally, each call site is located within an IRS district office. Call sites manage their day-to-day operations, although they receive program direction from one of seven regional offices. The regional offices report directly to the National Office.", "The goal of the telephone assistance program is to provide consistently prompt and accurate service to taxpayers. According to IRS, consistently prompt service means that all taxpayers have the same opportunity to receive assistance and be connected to an assistor within a reasonable period of time, regardless of geographic location, day of week, or time of day. IRS is working to develop a specific standard for \u201creasonable period of time\u201d as it acquires more modern equipment. According to IRS, accurate service means that taxpayers should receive complete, concise, and correct answers to their telephone inquiries. IRS officials said that these are continuing goals that do not change from year to year.", "In fiscal year 1994, IRS call sites had 5,786 technical employees assigned to its telephone assistance program during its peak staffing period. IRS reported that 3,450 were permanent assistors and 2,336 were part-time or seasonal assistors. Assistors are either taxpayer service representatives, who are entry-level employees and answer basic types of questions, or taxpayer service specialists, who are more experienced and answer more complex inquiries. In addition to responding to taxpayer inquiries while on the telephone, assistors have other responsibilities that take them off the telephone, such as researching answers to taxpayers\u2019 questions, attending training, team building meetings, award ceremonies, blood drives, and union meetings.", "At the time of our review, each of the call sites uses one of eight different telephone systems to answer its incoming calls. IRS is replacing older systems at some of its call sites with new equipment. As of November 1994, IRS had installed new equipment at 19 sites. Among other things, the new equipment allows taxpayers to use menus to route calls to assistors, access Tele-Tax, and to remain in queue or on-hold if all assistors are busy, and to leave messages if they do not care to wait for an answer. According to IRS officials, these features will help to increase the number of calls that IRS can answer. Installing this equipment is part of IRS\u2019 Customer Service Vision to improve service to taxpayers.", "IRS\u2019 Customer Service Vision calls for consolidating its 3 telephone services and related service and compliance activities that now operate at 70 locations into 23 customer service sites. The customer service sites are to provide one-stop service to taxpayers seeking answers to any tax-related question. IRS plans for the customer service sites to provide extended service hours and to eventually employ about 22,000 staff drawn from the 3 existing telephone assistance programs and from other activities that do not now involve intensive telephone work. This would be about 7,000 fewer staff than are currently handling all the work planned for consolidation. In an effort to smooth this transition, IRS and the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), which represents IRS\u2019 nonmanagement employees, formed a partnership to share pertinent information and ensure direct involvement of union representatives in decisions affecting IRS employees.", "Since 1987, we have issued several reports and testified several times on taxpayers\u2019 problems with the accuracy of answers received from IRS\u2019 assistors and the accessibility to IRS\u2019 telephone assistance program. Our reports showed that IRS has made significant progress in improving the accuracy of the answers assistors provide to tax-law questions. For example, in 1989, we reported that IRS was providing taxpayers with accurate responses to their questions only 63 percent of the time. By 1993, following an aggressive IRS effort to improve, the accuracy of responses had increased to 89 percent due, in part, to the increased management emphasis.", "In contrast to the improvement in accuracy, taxpayers\u2019 ability to reach IRS\u2019 assistors has not improved over the years. For example, in our report on the 1990 tax filing season, we said that taxpayers called IRS about 51 million times and IRS answered about 17.4 million of those calls, a 34 percent answer rate. We noted that IRS had answered about 58 percent of taxpayers\u2019 calls during the 1989 tax filing season. IRS attributed the reduced accessibility for the 1990 tax filing season to funding cutbacks and a higher-than-expected demand for telephone service. As we continued to report on taxpayers\u2019 ability to reach IRS\u2019 assistors during ensuing filing seasons, the percentage of calls answered declined each year, reaching a low of 21 percent during the 1994 filing season."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Because of the continuing decline in taxpayers\u2019 ability to contact an IRS assistor, we reviewed IRS\u2019 telephone assistance program to determine the nature and extent of the accessibility problem, compare IRS\u2019 practices with other organizations that provide telephone assistance to identify practices IRS might use to answer more calls with existing staff resources, and identify reasons why IRS has been unable to answer more taxpayers\u2019 calls.", "To accomplish each of the objectives, we visited IRS\u2019 National Office; the Central and Southeast Regions; and the Atlanta, Baltimore, Dallas, Indianapolis, Nashville, and Seattle District Office call sites. We judgmentally selected these locations to reflect the diverse operations at IRS\u2019 call sites. Factors we considered when making our selection included accessibility rates, call volumes, staff hours, productivity rates, types of equipment, and geographic locations. Each of the sites we visited had been named a Customer Service Site under IRS\u2019 Customer Service Vision plan. IRS\u2019 National Office officials agreed that the sites we selected and fiscal year 1993 data from the sites would generally reflect the operations of the Taxpayer Services telephone assistance program.", "To determine how Taxpayer Services uses its assistors and technology to answer calls, we interviewed officials from the Taxpayer Services, Research, and Technical Management Divisions; the Telephone Routing Interactive System Project Office; the Business Transition Office; and NTEU. We also met with IRS officials responsible for overseeing daily call site operations, including call site managers, system analysts, and quality review analysts. We also obtained and reviewed pertinent IRS documents relating to accessibility trends, management procedures, and telephone equipment for the telephone assistance program.", "We sent questionnaires to Taxpayer Services Division Chiefs, who manage the call sites, at 31 of the 32 IRS toll-free call sites in operation at the time. (We excluded the Puerto Rico call site because it was considered international and had very few calls). Among other things, the questionnaires were used to ascertain current call site hours of operation and types of assistor performance standards used. Appendix II contains the results of the questionnaires.", "At each of the six call sites we visited, we analyzed 2 weeks of data on operations during the period September 1992 through October 1993 to evaluate call site operations. During this time period, we identified and selected 2 separate weeks for each call site in which the call site used relatively the same number of staff hours but had variances in the number of calls it answered during those weeks. We collected numerous management information reports from each site\u2019s call system, analyzing items such as the average time assistors were on the telephones and access rates by hour.", "In addition, we compared IRS with other organizations that rely heavily on the telephone as a means of providing service to their customers. Specifically, we interviewed officials at a credit card company, an airline company, a power company, an insurance company, and the Social Security Administration (SSA). We also visited all of the organizations except the credit card company. We selected organizations well-known for providing customer service via telephone. Overall, our discussions with officials from these organizations focused on how they operated their telephone assistance programs, both in managing their employees and in using their technology, to maximize accessibility. Specifically, we obtained information from each of these organizations about their overall management approach and objectives for their telephone assistance programs; the business environment in which they operated; and the goals, management practices, operating standards, and performance measurement techniques they used in managing their programs.", "To identify reasons IRS has been unable to answer more calls, we analyzed all the information we had collected for our first two objectives, giving particular attention to differences in the management approach taken by the organizations we visited and the environment in which they operated, as compared with IRS. We also reviewed earlier GAO and IRS studies and related material dealing with IRS\u2019 efforts to improve the accuracy of its assistors\u2019 answers to tax law questions and compared the management actions IRS took in dealing with that issue to actions it has taken to improve accessibility to the telephone assistance program. Finally, we discussed the issues identified in our analysis of all of this information with IRS and NTEU officials.", "The organizations we contacted have objectives similar to IRS for their telephone assistance programs, although the private sector companies operate in a different environment. The private sector companies use the telephone not only to provide service, but to make sales and earn revenue, which in turn provides them with an added incentive to maximize their programs. IRS also uses its telephone assistance program to provide service and collect revenue. Each year, IRS provides service to thousands of taxpayers by answering their tax law questions, but it also collects a great deal of revenue in connection with taxpayer calls about their accounts. For example, IRS completed about 2.6 million new installment agreements in fiscal year 1994 to collect delinquent taxes from individual taxpayers. These agreements totalled $9.4 billion, many of which were arranged by Taxpayer Services assistors over the telephone.", "Another similarity between IRS and the five organizations we contacted is that all received large numbers of calls. In fiscal year 1993, IRS received over 130 million calls. The largest number of calls made to 1 of the 5 organizations we contacted was to SSA, which received about 80 million calls in 1993. The smallest number of calls was made to the power company, which received about 4 million calls in 1993. There are similarities also between the nature of the calls made to the organizations we contacted and the calls made to IRS. The calls to the five organizations dealt with a variety of issues, but most of them were about customer account information, which makes up over half of IRS\u2019 call workload.", "The greatest similarity between IRS and the five organizations we contacted, however, is the basic requirement to answer the telephone. No service is provided, no sale can be made, and no tax revenue can be collected unless the telephone is answered. Because of the similarities between IRS\u2019 telephone assistance program and the assistance programs in the five organizations we contacted, we believe that the telephone management practices we found common among the organizations would also be useful to IRS.", "We did our work from August 1993 to September 1994 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

In fiscal year 1989, taxpayers had a 1 out of 2 chance of reaching an assistor; however, in fiscal year 1994, taxpayers had only a 1 out of 4 chance of getting through.", "IRS is aware of the decline in the percentage of calls answered. For example, in fiscal year 1989, IRS estimated that 46 million taxpayers called for assistance and about 37 million of those calls were answered. Thus, IRS assisted about 80 percent of the estimated number of taxpayers who called for assistance.", "For fiscal year 1994, IRS estimated that 67 million taxpayers called for assistance; about 36 million of those calls were answered, an assistance rate of only 54 percent. Figure 2.1 shows the general decline in taxpayer accessibility since fiscal year 1989.", "Taxpayers\u2019 ability to reach IRS assistors is not just a filing season problem, it exists year-round. This access pattern has been a problem for taxpayers for several years. As shown in figure 2.2, for fiscal year 1994, access for the filing season (January through April) was 21 percent, while access for the October through December and May through September periods was 39 and 21 percent, respectively. Other years have shown similar problems.", "It is generally easier to reach an assistor at the end of the week, since call sites receive most of their calls on Monday and Tuesday. National Office officials told us that for many years, the sites have typically received most of their calls on Mondays and Tuesdays, causing access rates to be lower these days. Our work at the call site level generally showed this to be true. For example, figure 2.3 shows that during a week we analyzed for the Baltimore call site, access rates on Monday and Tuesday were 22 percent and 19 percent, respectively. That same week the access rate was much higher at the end of the week, reaching 70 percent on Friday. Access rates were lower at the beginning of the week during 8 of the 12 weeks we analyzed.", "The best time of day to call and reach an assistor appeared to vary from call site to call site. Some taxpayers had an easier time reaching assistors early in the day, while others had an easier time at the end of the day. For example, Atlanta\u2019s lowest access rate was during the first hour of operation, Nashville\u2019s lowest rate was during lunch time, and Seattle\u2019s lowest rate was at the end of the day. We found no clear trends in Indianapolis and Dallas, and Baltimore could not provide time-of-day data for our analysis.", "Taxpayers\u2019 ability to reach an assistor also varied depending on the taxpayer\u2019s location. IRS has been trying to equalize taxpayers\u2019 ability to reach its assistors, but taxpayers\u2019 chances of getting through varied by call site. For example, in fiscal year 1994, a caller served by IRS\u2019 call site in Jacksonville, Florida, had a 17-percent chance of having a call get through; a caller served by the Des Moines, Iowa, call site had a 34-percent chance of getting through.

If their calls are answered, they may be placed on hold to wait for an assistor to become available. At this stage, many callers hang up before receiving an answer to their questions. The consequences of low accessibility rates are reflected in the number of busy signals taxpayers receive, the amount of time they are on hold, and the number of taxpayers who abandon their calls. Also, IRS reports show that some taxpayers may never call back.", "The number of busy signals has greatly increased over the past few years. In 1989, 47 percent, or about 34 million, of the more than 73 million calls to IRS received busy signals when taxpayers tried to call. By fiscal year 1994 busy signals increased to 73 percent of all calls, as shown in figure 2.4. IRS believes that when calls to sites are heavy, taxpayers redial to make numerous call attempts before reaching an assistor, which accounts for many of the busy signals. However, some taxpayers who attempt to reach IRS but only receive busy signals may give up and may not try to call back. For example, for the week ending April 16, 1994, an IRS report shows that at least 1 million taxpayers called at least once, did not reach an assistor, and never called back that week.", "Some callers who got through faced long periods on hold waiting for an assistor. Taxpayers are put on hold for a variety of reasons. For example, some \u201cgates\u201d may be receiving more calls than others, and these wait times can become lengthy. During 1 day at the Seattle call site, average taxpayer on-hold time for one gate reached 34 minutes. The average on-hold time for the same gate for the week was about 14 minutes. In Nashville, average on-hold time reached 20 minutes for one gate. For the week it was about 14 minutes. At the Baltimore call site, on-hold time for one gate reached 21 minutes for 1 of the days we reviewed. For the week it was about 11 minutes. The other sites we visited did not have this information available.", "In November 1993, IRS issued guidelines for on-hold time standards for call sites with new equipment, but in September 1994 it began trying to redefine the standards. In January 1995, these guidelines were still being redefined.", "Many taxpayers who do get into the system never have their questions answered. Due to the lengthy on-hold times, many taxpayers abandon their calls before reaching an assistor. The number of abandoned calls has increased from fiscal year 1989 to 1994, rising from 2.8 million to 6 million calls.

The private sector company officials told us they have been able to answer many calls in 20 to 50 seconds. To provide this level of service during peak periods, both SSA and the companies we contacted used extra employees to answer calls. To keep employees informed about demand, some companies posted statistics during the work shift, such as how long customers are waiting on hold. Officials told us that setting goals was also important in helping to ensure callers would not receive busy signals. They said that keeping employees informed of call site performance also helped to increase productivity.", "All of the four private sector companies we contacted had established a performance standard for the number of hours employees were expected to be on the telephone. Three companies also had established a standard for an approximate number of calls to be answered during a work shift. For example, the power company we visited expected its employees to be on the phones 7-1/2 hours of an 8-hour work day and to answer 85 to 105 calls each day. Managers at the airline company we visited said that their representatives were expected to be on the phones 7 hours and 40 minutes of an 8-1/2 hour day and to handle about 80 to 100 calls a day.

Clearly, this is useful work, but IRS concedes that the time spent doing it serves fewer taxpayers than the same amount of time spent on the telephones. Also, because assistors answer tax questions from taxpayers, it is reasonable that assistors receive periodic training to enable them to accurately answer questions.

For example, in 1991 the Taxpayer Services Division considered routing calls during lunch time to sites in other time zones to increase service to taxpayers. Sites where calls were to be routed would no longer take staggered lunches; all assistors at a site would go to lunch at the same time. Taxpayer Services Division asked the call sites to comment about the feasibility of diverting calls from their sites during lunch.", "Of the 14 call sites that responded, 8 indicated the change would require discussion with the union. IRS did not discuss this issue with the union because the Taxpayer Services Division never completed its analysis of how traffic would need to be routed.", "The example discussed in the first section of this chapter about IRS\u2019 unsuccessful efforts to establish standard hours for call site operations also illustrates IRS\u2019 lack of a strategy for identifying issues that need to be dealt with on the national, rather than the local, level. The Taxpayer Services Division asked the call sites to provide input on the Division\u2019s plan to expand standard hours of service nationwide during the 1994 filing season. The Division would have expanded service by routing calls to different sites in other time zones and extending the hours of some call sites.", "IRS\u2019 seven regions commented that expanding the hours could raise union concerns, especially if two shifts were expected at some call sites. One region wrote that changing hours was a costly issue due to NTEU negotiations. Another region wrote that changing hours \u201chas significant labor relations implications,\u201d and that if a uniform agreement could not be reached at the national level, local negotiations could take a long time. The plan was not implemented for the 1994 filing season. Rather than pursue changing local call site hours, the Taxpayer Services Division looked at the number of call sites with later hours, but it found that too few sites were open late enough to handle rerouted traffic.", "For the 1995 filing season, IRS has begun to offer expanded hours of service. The expanded service is being provided by routing calls among the call sites, together with short increases in the time several call sites are open. For example, the three call sites in the Southeast Region now provide 10 hours of service. Taxpayer Services officials at the National Office told us that they had discussed the need for expanded hours with NTEU\u2019s national office officials. NTEU decided that the specifics of how the changes were to be implemented should be worked out with IRS officials at the local level rather than at the national level. National Office officials told us there were no serious problems in getting this done.", "Taxpayer Services officials at the National Office told us they expected regional offices to extend hours at the call sites for the 1995 filing season because the National Office was more forceful in its efforts to change hours than it had been in previous attempts. Providing an increase in the hours telephone assistance is available is a worthwhile accomplishment, and we commend IRS for achieving this. However, the time it took illustrates the need for IRS\u2019 top management to assert itself and to develop a way to work toward agreement on more than one change at a time with NTEU."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS and NTEU Can Build on Their Existing Partnership to Reach Agreement on Nationwide Issues", "paragraphs": ["In May 1994, as a result of a long-term effort, IRS and NTEU agreed to a partnership arrangement designed to give the union a stronger role in IRS\u2019 organizational and policy issues.

In the past, the telephone assistance program has been hampered by the need to negotiate issues on a site-by-site basis that affect the entire system and, in our opinion, should be dealt with on a nationwide basis. The need to negotiate some matters locally will continue, and local input can and usually should be obtained in connection with negotiating national issues. However, we believe that IRS and NTEU could use the framework established by the August 1994 Memorandum of Understanding to work toward a situation in which IRS and NTEU can agree on operating practices and standards for performance measurement that would enable IRS to operate a telephone assistance program that provides consistent, high-quality service to as many taxpayers as possible throughout the country."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Funding Limitation for Staff Has Been a Problem", "paragraphs": ["For the past several years, Taxpayer Services has asked IRS and Treasury to request additional funds to hire more assistors to answer more taxpayer calls.

The additional funds would have allowed IRS to answer more calls than it now does but not nearly all of the calls it receives. While funding for additional staff was not received, IRS received funds to continue to plan for and buy upgraded telephone equipment for call sites.

IRS reduced the request to 356 FTEs, but Treasury denied it. For fiscal year 1995, Taxpayer Services asked for 236 additional FTEs to answer about 1 million more calls over the 1994 level. IRS agreed with the request, but Treasury denied it. IRS officials told us that in both years the requests for additional funds were denied because other needs, such as efforts to improve compliance, were judged to have higher priority in preparing Treasury\u2019s portion of the President\u2019s budget. Meanwhile, there were about 156 million calls for telephone assistance in fiscal year 1994. IRS expects even more calls during fiscal year 1995.", "For fiscal year 1996, Treasury included in its budget submission to Congress a request to fund a 226 FTE increase in taxpayer service assistors. Although the increase in assistors, if funded, will aid in answering more calls, it represents an overall decrease of 193 FTEs when compared to the number of assistors available for fiscal year 1994.

Taxpayer Services officials told us that they intend to continue setting annual goals for increasing the number of calls answered, based primarily on the installation of new telephone equipment. IRS has purchased and installed automated telephone switching equipment at 19 call sites during the past 2 years. IRS has reported productivity improvement of about 10 percent at the sites with the new equipment, in part because the equipment frees some assistors from answering and routing calls manually. IRS plans similar purchases for the remaining call sites over the next few years and is working to develop more ways for taxpayers to get answers to their questions on the telephone automatically, without speaking to an assistor.

Operating practices vary among the 27 call sites. Each site has a great deal of autonomy to set its own standards and measures. This is illustrated by the 19 different combinations of operating hours among the call sites we surveyed, although this problem has been corrected. More importantly, IRS top management has not exercised its authority to establish and enforce policies necessary to create an integrated, nationwide telephone assistance program that can efficiently use the resources available to answer as many taxpayers\u2019 calls as possible. The lack of uniform systemwide policies and the tendency for IRS and NTEU to negotiate call site practices at the local level have resulted in call site autonomy to a degree that we believe is incompatible with the kind of sophisticated telephone assistance system IRS envisions for the future.", "These problems must be overcome if IRS is to improve the service it provides taxpayers during the transition to its Customer Service Vision and if IRS is to achieve its vision of improved customer service. The Customer Service Vision calls for a telephone assistance system that is integrated nationwide, in which an assistor located anywhere in the country will answer calls from anywhere else in the country. Such a system would match those that other telephone assistance organizations\u2019 customers enjoy today and should provide the American taxpayer with better service.", "To improve taxpayers\u2019 access to the telephone assistance system, we believe that IRS could draw upon its experience in improving the accuracy of assistors\u2019 answers to tax law questions. That effort, characterized by strong top management support, challenging nationwide goals, clear-cut performance measures, and accountability from top to bottom, has resulted in major improvement in accuracy test scores. We see no reason why IRS cannot apply the same management principles to increasing the number of taxpayer calls that IRS answers.", "IRS\u2019 National Office will have to exercise its authority to establish and enforce the policies necessary to build an effective nationwide telephone assistance program. A critical part of this effort will be to take advantage of its partnership with NTEU to develop a way to agree on nationwide operating practices and performance measurement standards that would enable IRS to answer as many calls as possible. Answering more calls now and in the future also requires that IRS make better use of the information technology it has today.", "IRS officials directly responsible for the telephone assistance program have requested additional funding for staff in recent years, but those requests have not been approved by senior IRS or Treasury Department officials because those officials placed higher priority on other needs.

Those practices should include, although not be limited to, the following: challenging program goals for increasing the number of calls answered that are based, at least in part, on taxpayers\u2019 needs; standards for the amount of time assistors should be available to answer hours of operation that offer taxpayers greater opportunity to reach IRS uniform reporting definitions for the number of calls answered and other performance measures.", "We also recommend that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue direct the Chief, Taxpayer Services, to quickly take the steps necessary to effectively route taxpayers\u2019 calls nationwide using real-time information.

The added hours of service give taxpayers a better chance of getting their questions answered, but SSA provides 12 hours per day of access to an assistor and the four private companies we contacted routinely provide access to a customer service representative 24 hours a day.", "A similar comparison of IRS\u2019 use of technology to route calls today compared with a few years ago shows that IRS has made considerable progress in this area also but remains behind the other organizations we contacted, even though IRS said it had implemented best practices identified in other organizations. From essentially no capability to route calls a few years ago, IRS now can route calls anywhere in the country, but it does so using a cumbersome and slow process, thus limiting the efficiency\u2014and benefit to taxpayers\u2014of a centrally controlled, real-time routing system.

For fiscal year 1994, IRS estimated that 67 million taxpayers called for assistance and about 36 million of those calls were answered, an assistance rate of 54 percent. To the extent IRS estimates are accurate, what that means is that approximately 31 million taxpayers who called for assistance did not get it because they could not get through to an assistor.
