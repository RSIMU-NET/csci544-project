Providing reasonable estimates based on reliable data is critical to effective program stewardship and accountability. Program managers and the Congress rely on this information to make funding and programmatic decisions involving hundreds of billions of dollars annually. For some types of credit programs, unreliable information can affect the availability and the delivery of basic program services to taxpayers because changes in cost estimates may alter the number and amount of loans available.", "To gain an understanding of the key issues impeding reasonable estimates of subsidy costs of credit programs for the five key credit agencies, the Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Departments of Education, Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Veterans Affairs (VA), and Agriculture (USDA), we reviewed these agencies\u2019 abilities to reasonably estimate the cost of their loan programs, including whether they used practices identified by the Credit Reform Task Force as being effective in making these estimates.

At the end of fiscal year 1997, the Department of the Treasury reported that the federal government\u2019s gross direct loans outstanding totaled $216.6 billion, and loan guarantees outstanding totaled $712.4 billion.", "Before enactment of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, credit programs\u2014like most other federal programs\u2014were recorded in budgetary accounts on a cash basis. While this basis reflected cash flows, it distorted the timing of when costs would actually be recognized and, thus, distorted the comparability of credit program costs with other programs intended to achieve similar purposes, such as grants. For example, for direct loans, the budget generally showed budget authority and outlays for loans disbursed that exceeded repayments received from all past loans in that year.", "Therefore, in the budget a direct loan in the first year of a program was equivalent to the cost of a grant. Cash-basis budgetary recording also suggested a bias in favor of loan guarantees over direct loans. Loan guarantees appeared to be free in the short-term because cash-basis recording did not recognize that some loan guarantees result in costs due to default of the underlying loans.", "FCRA changed the budgetary treatment of credit programs beginning with fiscal year 1992 so that their costs could be compared more appropriately with each other and with the costs of other federal spending. FCRA requires that agencies have budget authority to cover the program\u2019s cost to the government in advance, before new direct loan obligations are incurred and new loan guarantee commitments are made. The act therefore requires agencies to estimate the cost of extending or guaranteeing credit, called the subsidy cost. This cost is the present value of disbursements\u2014over the life of the loan\u2014by the government (loan disbursements and other payments) minus estimated payments to the government (repayments of principal, payments of interest, other recoveries, and other payments). For loan guarantees, the subsidy cost is the present value of cash flows from estimated payments by the government (for defaults and delinquencies, interest rate subsidies, and other payments) minus estimated payments to the government (for loan origination and other fees, penalties, and recoveries).", "FCRA assigned to OMB the responsibility to coordinate the cost estimates required by the act. OMB is authorized to delegate to lending agencies the authority to estimate costs, based on written guidelines issued by OMB. These guidelines are contained in sections 33.1 through 33.12 of OMB Circular No. A-11, and supporting exhibits.", "The Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) developed the accounting standard for credit programs, Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards No. 2, Accounting for Direct Loans and Loan Guarantees (SFFAS No. 2), which became effective with fiscal year 1994. This standard, which generally mirrors FCRA, established guidance for estimating the cost of direct and guaranteed loan programs, as well as for recording direct loans and the liability for loan guarantees for financial reporting purposes. SFFAS No. 2 states that the actual and expected costs of federal credit programs should be fully recognized in both budgetary and financial reporting. To accomplish this, agencies first predict or estimate the future performance of direct and guaranteed loans when preparing their annual budgets. The data used for these budgetary estimates are generally reestimated after the fiscal year end to reflect any changes in actual loan performance since the budget was prepared, as well as any expected changes in assumptions and future loan performance. This reestimated data is then used to report the cost of the loans disbursed under the direct or guaranteed loan program as a \u201cProgram Cost\u201d on the agencies\u2019 Statement of Net Costs after loans are disbursed.", "Agency management is responsible for accumulating sufficient, relevant, and reliable data on which to base the estimates. Further, SFFAS No. 2 states that agencies should use the historical experience of the loan programs when estimating future loan performance. To accomplish this, agencies use cash flow models based on various assumptions, often referred to as cash flow assumptions, such as the number and amount of loans that will default in a given year\u2014known as the default assumption. Those assumptions that have the greatest impact on the credit subsidy vary by program and are often referred to as key cash flow assumptions.", "Statement on Auditing Standards No. 57 states that auditors should evaluate the reasonableness of estimates in the context of the financial statements taken as a whole. As part of the annual financial statement audits, agency cash flow models and assumptions are assessed to determine if management has a reliable basis for its credit subsidy estimates.", "In 1997, the Credit Reform Task Force of the Accounting and Auditing Policy Committee was formed in order to address key issues surrounding the implementation of FCRA and the related federal accounting standard. This task force developed a Technical Release, Preparing and Auditing Direct Loan and Loan Guarantee Subsidies Under the Credit Reform Act, which has been approved by FASAB and is expected to be issued by OMB during fiscal year 1999. This Technical Release identifies specific practices that, if fully implemented by credit agencies, will enhance their ability to reasonably estimate loan program costs. These practices include the following:", "Accumulating sufficient, relevant, and reliable supporting data that provides a reliable basis for agencies\u2019 estimates of future loan performance. For example, to make reasonable projections of future loan defaults, recoveries, prepayments, or other key cash flows, agencies should use reliable records of historical experience and take into consideration current and forecasted economic conditions.", "Conducting periodic comparisons of estimated loan performance to actual cash flows in the accounting system.

Knowledge of these key assumptions provides management with the ability to monitor the economic trends that most affect the loan program\u2019s performance. These analyses also allow agencies to more efficiently focus their efforts on providing support for the key assumptions, which need to be documented to pass the test of an independent audit.", "Ensuring that agency cash flow models are well organized, documented, and, to reduce the chance of errors, require minimal data entry.

As a result, three of the five agencies in our review, HUD, VA, and USDA, prepared action plans to address, among other things, problems with preparing reasonable estimates of their loan program costs.

The resulting report noted that the lack of timely reestimates, as well as the frequent absence of documentation and reliable information, limited the ability of agency management, OMB, and the Congress to exercise intended oversight.

We selected a sample of 10 programs\u20145 direct loan programs totaling $52.1 billion and 5 guaranteed loan programs totaling $558.1 billion\u2014from the five agencies with the largest domestic federal credit programs: the Small Business Administration and the Departments of Education, Housing and Urban Development, Veterans Affairs, and Agriculture. We generally selected programs that had the most credit outstanding or highest loan levels at each agency. Specifically, these programs were the following:", "7(a) General Business Loans Program and Disaster Loan Program, which totaled 72 percent of SBA\u2019s loan guarantees and 73 percent of its direct loans, respectively;", "Federal Family Education Loan Program and William D.

In addition, we determined whether agencies had a reliable basis for the underlying assumptions for their estimates of loan program performance by assessing the support for key cash flow assumptions.

However, for the two programs we reviewed, SBA initially made errors in the reestimates of its loan program\u2019s costs, which its independent public accountant uncovered, including using incorrect discount rates, which required large adjustments to the draft financial statements. As a result of making these adjustments, SBA received an unqualified opinion on its fiscal year 1997 financial statements. However, because the fiscal year 1997 budgetary reestimate was included with the fiscal year 1999 President\u2019s budget prior to the audit adjustments, the budgetary reestimate contained erroneous data.", "Since the inception of credit reform in 1992, SBA has placed significant emphasis on gathering reliable key cash flow data and, with OMB\u2019s assistance, developed sophisticated cash flow models to estimate future loan performance and cost. Beginning in 1992, SBA devoted considerable resources to evaluating its existing financial management systems and determining what modifications would be necessary to allow it to reasonably estimate loan program costs under credit reform. Since these initial efforts, SBA has continued to further refine its estimates of loan program costs and the related underlying assumptions. For example, during 1997, SBA hired consultants to study and develop refined loss and recovery estimates for the Disaster Loan Program.", "SBA followed a number of practices that enhanced its ability to make reasonable financial statement and budgetary estimates of loan program costs for the two programs we reviewed. For example, SBA developed an extensive database of historical cash flow information, which provided a reliable basis for its estimates of credit program costs. Further, SBA, with assistance from OMB, established sophisticated, well organized cash flow models that, when compared with actual historical data, reasonably estimated future loan performance. Because of this database and SBA\u2019s sophisticated cash flow model, SBA was able to calculate reasonable estimates of loan program costs without significant manual intervention or requests for data from outside entities. SBA also routinely compared estimated loan performance to actual costs recorded in the accounting system to assess the reasonableness of its estimates of future loan performance and costs. Finally, in preparing their estimates for the two programs we reviewed, individuals from SBA\u2019s program, budget, and accounting offices coordinated their work.", "However, during the audit of SBA\u2019s fiscal year 1997 financial statements, the independent public accountants identified material internal control weaknesses related to estimating the cost of credit programs. Specifically, the independent public accountant reported that incorrect data, including discount rates, were used in the 1997 reestimate, and errors existed in some of the reestimated cash flow models. In aggregate, these errors resulted in SBA recording over $221 million in adjustments to its financial statements, which enabled the independent public accountant to render an unqualified opinion. However, these adjustments were not identified until after SBA submitted its fiscal year 1999 budget to OMB and, as a result, this budget submission and the President\u2019s budget misstated the cost of these loan programs. Further, the independent public accountant reported that SBA lacked adequate internal controls over the estimation process. For example, SBA did not retain the cash flow models for one of the programs we reviewed for fiscal years 1992 through 1997. Although these models are normally a part of performing the reestimates, and should be retained as a matter of routine record-keeping, SBA was able to calculate a reasonable financial statement reestimate by using a more recent cash flow model.", "Because SBA received an unqualified audit opinion on its fiscal year 1997 financial statements, OMB did not require SBA to prepare a formal action plan to address the weaknesses identified in the estimation process. However, in the audit report on the fiscal year 1997 financial statements, the independent public accountant made recommendations, with which we concur, which addressed the material internal control weaknesses described above including developing formal policies and procedures for estimating the cost of credit programs and implementing a formal supervisory review process to identify and correct potential errors. In response to these recommendations, SBA developed and implemented formal policies and procedures including a formal supervisory review process. In addition, SBA adopted other practices, such as performing sensitivity analyses and calculating its fiscal year 1998 reestimate earlier than the fiscal year 1997 reestimates, to allow sufficient time to include any necessary adjustments resulting from the audit in the data presented in the President\u2019s budget. These actions should help SBA ensure that future errors are detected and corrected promptly and that budgetary and financial estimates of loan program costs are reasonable."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["SBA agreed with the findings in this report.

However, the audited estimates differed materially from the credit subsidy estimates based on Education\u2019s own database, which raises questions about the validity of Education\u2019s database. Further, Education\u2019s credit program estimates for its budget submission for these two programs were based on the questionable data from its own database. Until the information in the existing database is determined to be reliable, Education will continue to expend considerable time and resources in order to make reasonable loan program cost estimates.", "While the IG concluded that Education\u2019s fiscal year 1997 financial statement estimates were reasonable, several internal control weaknesses were reported. For example, the IG reported that Education needed to establish the validity of its principal database, the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS), to provide a basis for preparing reliable loan estimates and to establish sufficient controls to detect material errors in its loan estimates. Data from NSLDS were used to prepare the fiscal year 1997 budgetary estimates because Education\u2019s staff believed that the data were reliable. However, the weaknesses found in Education\u2019s internal controls raise questions about the quality of this database.", "Based on Education\u2019s continuing validation efforts, it believed that estimates based on data from NSLDS would be similar to estimates based on data received from the guaranty agencies. Education therefore planned to use the guaranty agencies\u2019 data to validate the estimates that were based on NSLDS data. As part of this plan, Education prepared two estimates for financial statement purposes\u2014one based on data from NSLDS and the other based on data from the guaranty agencies. The IG audited the estimates based on the data provided by the guaranty agencies and concluded that these estimates differed materially from the estimates based on Education\u2019s own database. Further, the IG reported that \u201cEducation\u2019s own procedures for preparing its loan estimates were not sufficiently rigorous to detect this material misstatement\u201d and that \u201cEducation\u2019s ability to continue to prepare auditable loan estimates for its financial statements depends on establishing a reliable store of up-to-date historical loan data.\u201d", "The IG audited the guaranty agency-based estimates and found them to be reasonable. However, obtaining data from the guaranty agencies was a time-consuming way for Education to develop its estimates of loan program costs and should be viewed as a short-term solution only. It is not feasible for Education to carry out this process year after year instead of relying on the principal system that was designed to provide this information.", "In addition to these data problems, the auditors identified some instances where Education\u2019s estimation practices could be improved. For example, Education did not have documented policies and procedures for calculating the cost of credit programs, including a formal review process, to routinely identify and correct potential errors. These important internal controls could help ensure the reasonableness of Education\u2019s complex estimates in the future. While Education did some limited sensitivity analyses, it did not document the analyses. Such documented analyses would have allowed its auditors to focus their audit procedures on the key cash flow assumptions. For fiscal year 1997, the IG audited more than 20 cash flow assumptions to validate the assumptions used by the model to estimate the cost of the loan programs. In the future, conducting a complete sensitivity analyses and documenting the results could save significant time and effort by helping focus management and the auditors\u2019 attention on the reasonableness of the assumptions that have the greatest impact on the program\u2019s cost.", "Using guaranty agency data, Education was able to calculate reasonable financial statement estimates of credit program costs, partly due to the sophistication of its credit subsidy model. Education developed its own method for estimating and reestimating credit program costs, called the Budget Loan Model (BLM) System. This model uses a series of assumptions to estimate cash flows over the life of the loans. BLM is used in concert with the OMB credit subsidy model because Education believes it captures the unique requirements of its program. During the fiscal year 1997 audit, BLM was reviewed and the auditors determined that BLM included and modeled all key elements of Education\u2019s various loan program requirements, such as loan term and repayment grace periods, and used historically valid data obtained from the guaranty agencies.", "In addition to developing its sophisticated cash flow model, Education followed other effective practices for cost estimation, such as documenting its cash flow model, by developing a Technical Manual and User\u2019s Guide. Also, for financial statement purposes, agency staff compared estimates of future loan performance, based on the data obtained from the guaranty agencies, to actual costs recorded in the accounting system and determined that the financial statement estimates reasonably predicted future loan performance. Further, calculating the estimates of loan program costs at Education was a coordinated effort between the accounting, budget, and program staff. For example, representatives from these three offices met on a regular basis and jointly developed the cash flow assumptions used in the financial statement estimates. In addition, Education compared the cash flow models to program requirements and determined that its models accurately captured all material aspects of the credit programs. Finally, Education also calculated timely reestimates for both budgetary and financial statement purposes. However, as discussed previously, the NSLDS data used for the budget reestimates were questionable.", "Since Education received an unqualified audit opinion on its fiscal year 1997 financial statements, the agency was not required by OMB to prepare a formal action plan to address any financial management issues. However, according to Education officials, Education has efforts underway to address the challenges it faces in preparing reasonable estimates of its loan program costs. For example, Education is continuing its efforts to review and correct inaccurate or incomplete data in NSLDS, including providing detailed technical instructions to data originators and providers (schools, lenders, and guaranty agencies). These efforts should help Education address its major loan cost estimation challenges. However, until these efforts are successfully completed and Education can rely on the data in NSLDS, it will be forced to repeatedly undergo an onerous process in order to make reasonable estimates of loan program costs.", "In its June 1998 audit report on Education\u2019s fiscal year 1997 financial statements, the IG made several recommendations, which we concur with, related to improving the agency\u2019s loan cost estimation process.

However, in order to consolidate FHA\u2019s financial results into HUD, credit program cost information must be converted to federal accounting standards. HUD has had difficulty making this conversion due to the differences in the two accounting approaches for credit programs. Under SFFAS No. 2, when estimating the liability and related expense for future defaults on guaranteed loans, FHA must estimate, for the life of the loans, all cash disbursements related to the loan guarantee and the associated collateral (for example, payment of default claims and costs to dispose of foreclosed property) as well as all cash receipts (for example, loan guarantee premiums and proceeds from the sale of foreclosed properties). GAAP considers most of the same receipts and disbursements but does not include loan guarantee premiums (a significant cash receipt for FHA) when calculating the same liability and related expense. Under GAAP, the loan guarantee premiums are generally reported as revenues. Further, calculating the present value of receipts and disbursements is not required under GAAP.

As a result, the auditors issued a qualified opinion on HUD\u2019s fiscal year 1997 financial statements. However, an independent public accounting firm is currently auditing FHA\u2019s fiscal year 1997 balance sheet prepared in accordance with SFFAS No. 2 as part of its audit of the opening balances for the fiscal year 1998 financial statement audit.", "While HUD was not recording the cost of its loan guarantee programs on its financial statements in accordance with the requirements of SFFAS No. 2, it was estimating the future cash flows of its loan guarantee programs for budget purposes. In the spring of 1998, we evaluated the cash flow models used to develop the fiscal year 1997 budget for the two programs we reviewed and identified numerous problems, such as formula errors and inconsistent calculations of cash flow assumptions. We also determined that these cash flow models were not documented and the Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) Fund model required extensive manual data entry, which increased the likelihood of errors. Additionally, HUD was unable to provide supporting data for many of the cash flow assumptions in the models. These problems with the cash flow models and the supporting data raise concerns over the reliability of HUD\u2019s fiscal year 1997 budget submission for its credit subsidy estimates.", "In the summer of 1998, HUD, with the assistance of independent contractors, focused significant effort on correcting the errors in these models. These contractors assisted in gathering and developing sufficient, relevant, and readily available supporting data as a basis for the estimates of loan program cost estimates; performed extensive detailed analyses of these cash flow models; identified additional errors; and revised the models. The contractors also helped HUD implement other effective cost estimation practices. For example, the contractors compared cash flow models to program requirements and determined that these revised models accurately captured all significant aspects of the program, such as loan origination fees and rebates of premiums when loans are repaid early. In addition, the contractors assisted HUD in documenting these cash flow models, including sources of data and the mechanics of the model.", "HUD, with the assistance of its contractors, also followed other effective cost estimation practices. For example, HUD recently performed sensitivity analyses for its credit programs, including the two we reviewed, to identify key cash flow assumptions. And, by working together, accounting, budget, and program staff focused their efforts on gathering and documenting the basis for the assumptions that had the greatest impact on HUD\u2019s credit subsidy estimates. HUD determined that an independent actuarial review provided the basis for three of the six key cash flow assumptions for the MMI model\u2014the primary single family guaranteed loan program. For the remaining key cash flow assumptions for this program, HUD determined and documented that the basis for estimating future loan performance was historical experience from the accounting system.", "While HUD has generally improved its estimation process for the two programs we reviewed, other improvements could be made. For example, comparing its estimates of future loan performance to actual cash flows recorded in the accounting system would enable HUD to determine whether these estimates reasonably predicted future loan performance. In making this comparison, we found that the average claim amount used in the 1997 budget submission was consistent with historical experience for the MMI Fund. However, when the contractors were updating HUD\u2019s fiscal year 1997 cash flow models for financial reporting purposes, they misinterpreted a report and used it to calculate an estimated average claim amount for the MMI Fund that was significantly less than the actual amount recorded in the accounting system.", "When we informed HUD of the error in the revised cash flow model, HUD changed the average claim amount to be consistent with actual costs recorded in the accounting system. As a result, the estimated program cost recorded in the draft financial statements increased $1.3 billion. If HUD had compared the estimated future loan performance used in the models to actual costs recorded in the accounting system, it would have detected this error in the average claim amount.", "Also, for the two programs we reviewed, HUD did not prepare timely credit subsidy reestimates for budgetary and financial statement purposes. HUD obtained permission from OMB to routinely prepare budget reestimates in the summer following the reporting year. However, SFFAS No. 2 requires annual reestimates each year as of the date of the financial statements if the reestimate would significantly affect the amounts presented. According to the Director of HUD\u2019s Housing Budget Office, actual data from the accounting system were not available in time to prepare reestimates in the fall\u2014the same time that the staff were formulating the annual budget. HUD management has refined its reestimate approach which should have allowed for timely reestimates to be included in the current year\u2019s budget and financial statements.", "Because HUD received a qualified opinion on its fiscal year 1997 financial statements, it was required by OMB to prepare an action plan to address identified financial management issues related to the loan program cost estimation process. This plan included accumulating supporting data for estimating the cost of its loan programs and reviewing its cash flow models to identify additional improvements that could reduce the chance of error. Further, the plan included routinely reestimating the cost of its loan programs timely and including the reestimates in both the current budget cycle and the current year\u2019s financial statements. Additionally, the plan included establishing formal policies and procedures that include a formal supervisory review process.

These problems contributed to the qualified audit opinion on VA\u2019s fiscal year 1997 financial statements. They also raise doubts about the reliability of loan program cost information submitted to OMB for budgetary purposes. Further, we found that VA did not record its guarantee obligations on the loans it sold. These weaknesses not only affect VA\u2019s ability to make reasonable cost estimates, but also call into question its ability to effectively manage and monitor its vendee loan program.", "During fiscal year 1997, VA transferred the management of its direct loan portfolio to an outside servicer. VA hoped that the transfer would reduce the number of staff resources needed and resolve existing internal control weaknesses and obsolescence issues related to its computer system. However, the data transferred to the servicer, which up to that point had been maintained by more than 40 VA regional offices, were incomplete and inconsistent and immediately created loan servicing problems. Further, VA closed down its own loan servicing system without putting in place procedures designed to ensure that it maintained accountability over the loan portfolio. These procedures should have included maintaining an inventory of the loans in the portfolio and a loan origination database to be used in conjunction with the servicer\u2019s system. It also included other procedures for monitoring the amount and timing of cash due from borrowers.", "As a result, VA management did not know the number or amount of direct loans outstanding at year-end, which VA estimated to be at least $2.1 billion, or whether the amount of cash received from the servicer during the year was correct. Further, because the servicer did not have an accurate inventory, the servicer was, according to VA, unable to allocate over $3 million in payments received after the transfer and, therefore, did not have correct payment histories for the affected loans. Without this basic information, VA was unable to reliably track the performance of its existing loans or reasonably estimate the future performance of its loans or the cost of its credit programs.", "VA\u2019s loan accounting problems were further exacerbated by its improper treatment of loans sold to investors with a guarantee of prompt payment of future principal and interest. During fiscal year 1997, VA sold about $1 billion in loans and, since 1992, has sold approximately $9 billion in loans. Because VA guaranteed future principal and interest payments on the sold loans, it is responsible for future losses resulting from such occurrences as delinquencies and defaults of the underlying loans. According to SFFAS No. 2, future losses should have been estimated and a subsidy expense and related liability should have been established for future defaults or delinquent payments when the loans were sold.", "Prior to fiscal year 1997, VA did not record the subsidy expense or the liability for potential future defaults on the loans it sold. Once we identified this error, VA, in consultation with OMB, estimated an additional expense as part of an aggregate adjustment for future losses and related liability for the loan sales not recorded between 1992 and 1997. Because the adjustment was aggregated in the financial statements with other adjustments related to direct loans, we were unable to determine what portion of this $376 million estimate was related directly to the loan sales activity, therefore, we did not attempt to determine the reasonableness of the adjustment. However, because of the lack of critical financial data, VA\u2019s ability to reasonably estimate the cost of its guarantee obligations related to loans sold is severely hampered. In order to further refine this estimate, VA recently hired an outside contractor to reconstruct the historical data on prior loan sales and develop a model to estimate the cost of loans sold with a guarantee. In addition, the contractor plans to assess VA\u2019s current cash flow models for direct and guaranteed loan programs to determine whether the assumptions are appropriate.", "The problems VA had in accounting for its loans also hindered the agency\u2019s ability to implement effective cost estimation practices. For example, because VA lacked complete data about the inventory of loans in its portfolio, it did not have a reasonable basis for estimates of future loan performance and could not compare estimated loan performance to actual costs recorded in the accounting system.", "VA did not use certain other estimation practices that would have improved its cost estimation process. For example, VA did not perform sensitivity analyses, but instead it relied on program managers\u2019 opinions in order to identify those assumptions that had the greatest impact on the programs\u2019 cost. As part of our assignment, we performed sensitivity analyses and verified that program managers\u2019 opinions correctly identified the key cash flow assumptions. However, for new programs and changes in current program design or delivery, sensitivity analyses would help ensure that key cash flow assumptions are appropriately identified. Also, VA did not have either written policies and procedures for estimating loan program costs or a formal review process that included representatives from the program, budget, and accounting offices. While VA did implement a number of effective cost estimation practices\u2014including calculating timely reestimates, comparing cash flow models to program requirements, and having organized, documented cash flow models\u2014the combined impact of VA\u2019s serious basic accounting weaknesses hindered its ability to make reasonable cost estimates.", "As required by OMB, VA has prepared an action plan to address its financial management problems. The action plan focuses on resolving the fundamental problems in accounting for the loan sales program and the basic data integrity issues related to the incomplete inventory of loans currently maintained by the servicer. Until these basic accounting deficiencies are resolved, VA will continue to have difficulty making reasonable estimates of its loan program costs.

These long-standing problems contributed to the auditor\u2019s inability to give an opinion on USDA\u2019s fiscal year 1997 consolidated financial statements and raised questions about the quality of the budget data related to USDA\u2019s loan programs.", "For the two programs we reviewed, USDA performed sensitivity analyses and identified which assumptions had the greatest impact on the credit subsidy. However, because it lacked adequate historical data, USDA based its prediction of key assumptions, such as the amount and timing of defaults and prepayments, primarily on the opinion of program managers. These managers estimated future loan performance based on their programmatic knowledge and experience without the assistance of extensive historical loan performance data and sophisticated computer modeling. Program management opinion may be an acceptable source of support for estimates when a new, unique program is established or when significant changes have been made to existing programs. However, program management opinion should be used only as an interim method and does not provide a reliable basis for established programs.Additionally, when program manager opinion is used, it should subsequently be compared to actual cash flow data from the accounting system to corroborate the reasonableness of management\u2019s judgment.", "The lack of historical data for the two programs we reviewed was largely the result of system inadequacies. For example, prior to the implementation of FCRA, USDA\u2019s systems did not track certain key cash flow data. In addition, although USDA\u2019s current systems were capable of capturing some key cash flow data at the detail level, these systems could not summarize the data so that they were readily usable for calculating credit subsidy estimates. For example, USDA\u2019s current systems were incapable of accumulating summary level prepayment information because the systems could not distinguish between borrowers that were completely paying off loans and borrowers that were paying an extra amount each month. USDA\u2019s accounting system also did not contain the loan origination date for loans that were modified when borrowers experienced financial hardship and were unable to meet scheduled payments. As a result, the number and amount of delinquent loans in the accounting system could not be broken out by loan origination year, and USDA was unable to track individual loans through their entire history without extensive manual intervention.", "USDA also lacked adequate historical data to estimate the amount of interest subsidy borrowers would receive in the future. The Single Family Housing Loan Program makes low interest rate loans to low income families who lack adequate housing and cannot obtain credit from other sources. For this program, the amount of interest that USDA subsidizes is based on borrowers\u2019 income. As the borrowers\u2019 income increases or decreases, USDA pays more or less interest subsidy on the loans. Ultimately, when the borrowers are capable of paying market interest rates for a housing loan, they \u201cgraduate\u201d from the program because they no longer qualify for the program. However, USDA did not maintain adequate records of the number of borrowers who moved to higher income levels and when borrowers were eligible to graduate from the program.", "Another factor affecting the reasonableness of USDA\u2019s estimates of loan program costs is the timing of reestimates that should be made to incorporate actual loan performance and other new information. In order to reasonably estimate and report the cost of loan programs, USDA must reestimate its credit subsidies on time and include these reestimates in the current year\u2019s financial statements and budget submission. However, USDA management told us that the agency lacked sufficient staff to make prompt reestimates for the programs we reviewed because these estimates needed to be calculated in the fall at the same time the budget was prepared. USDA received OMB\u2019s permission to calculate budgetary reestimates in the summer following the financial statement reporting year. However, this authorization to delay budgetary reestimates did not allow USDA to delay the financial statement reestimates. Further, USDA did not calculate the fiscal year 1997 reestimate for the Single Family Direct Loan Program until the fall of 1998\u2014after the date agreed upon with OMB. As a result, the agency did not update its fiscal year 1997 estimate of loan program costs until nearly 3 years after the original estimate was prepared in 1995.", "Until USDA calculates timely reestimates and includes them in its financial statements or clearly demonstrates that the reestimates would not be material to the financial statements, the amount of loans, liability for loan guarantees, and cost of the credit programs may be materially misstated on the financial statements. Delaying the reestimates also affects the quality of loan performance and cost data that are provided to the Congress for budgetary considerations.", "Also, for the two programs we reviewed, USDA did not use other practices that would enhance its ability to reasonably estimate the cost of loan programs. For example, USDA did not routinely compare estimated loan performance to actual costs recorded in the accounting system to assess how closely the estimate compared with subsequent actual costs. It also did not routinely compare cash flow models to program requirements. These comparisons would have enabled USDA to identify and research significant differences and determine whether assumptions related to expected future loan performance needed to be revised. In addition, during fiscal year 1997, USDA did not have formal policies and procedures for calculating estimates of loan program costs or for a formal review process that included representatives from the program, budget, and accounting offices to help ensure continuity and accuracy during this complicated estimation process.", "USDA has developed an action plan to address deficiencies in estimating the cost of its loan programs.

With this two-digit format, however, the Year 2000 is indistinguishable from 1900, 2001 from 1901, and so on. As a result of this ambiguity, system or application programs that use dates to perform calculations may generate incorrect results when working with years after 1999.

Systems used to track loans could (1) produce erroneous information on loan status, such as indicating that an unpaid loan had been satisfied or (2) incorrectly calculate interest and amortization schedules. Loan origination, default, repayment schedule, prepayment, and premium receipts are all linked to dates.

For loan guarantees, the subsidy cost is the present value of cash flows from estimated payments by the government (for defaults and delinquencies, interest rate subsidies, and other payments) minus estimated payments to the government (for loan origination and other fees, penalties, and recoveries).", "To estimate the cost of loan programs, agencies first estimate the future performance of direct and guaranteed loans when preparing their annual budgets. The data used for these budgetary estimates should be reestimated to reflect any changes in loan performance since the budget was prepared. This reestimated data is then used in financial reporting when calculating the allowance for subsidy (the cost of direct loans), the liability for loan guarantees, and the cost of the program.

Further, SFFAS No. 2 states that each credit program should use a systematic methodology to project expected cash flows into the future. To accomplish this task, agencies should develop cash flow models. A cash flow model is a computer-based spreadsheet that generally uses historical information and various assumptions including defaults, prepayments, recoveries, and the timing of these events to estimate future loan performance. These cash flow models, which should be based on sound economic, financial, and statistical theory, identify key factors that affect loan repayment performance. Agencies use this information to make more informed predictions of future credit performance. The August 1994 User\u2019s Guide To Version r.8 of the OMB Credit Subsidy Model provides general guidance on creating cash flow models to estimate future delinquencies, defaults, recoveries, etc. This user\u2019s guide states that \u201cIn every case, the agency or budget examiner must maintain current and complete documentation and justification for the estimation methods and assumptions used in determining the cash flow figures used for the OMB Subsidy Model\u201d to calculate the credit subsidy.", "According to SFFAS No. 2, to estimate the cost of loan programs and predict the future performance of credit programs, agencies should establish and use reliable records of historical credit performance. Since actual historical experience is a primary factor upon which estimates of credit performance are based, agencies should maintain a database, also known as an information store, at the individual loan level, of historical information on all key cash flow assumptions, such as defaults or recoveries, used in calculating the credit subsidy cost. Additional nonauthoritative guidance on cash flow models may be found in the Model Credit Program Methods and Documentation for Estimating Subsidy Rates and the Model Information Store issue paper prepared by the Credit Reform Task Force of the Accounting and Auditing Policy Committee. The draft \u201cInformation Store\u201d Task Force paper provides guidance on the type of historical information agencies need to reasonably estimate the cost of credit programs. The information store should provide three types of information. First, the information store should maintain key loan characteristics at the individual loan level, such as the loan terms and conditions. Second, it should track economic data that influence loan performance, such as property values for housing loans. Third, an information store should track historical cash flows on a loan-by-loan basis. The data elements in an information store should be selected to allow for more in-depth analyses of the most significant subsidy estimate assumptions.", "In addition to using historical databases and the cash flow models, other relevant factors must be considered by agencies to estimate future loan performance.

The reestimate should include all aspects of the original cost estimate including prepayments, defaults, delinquencies, recoveries, and interest. Reestimates of the credit subsidy allow agency management to compare the original budget estimates with actual program results to identify variances from the original estimate, assess the quality of the original estimate, and adjust future program estimates as appropriate.

The technical reestimate, for budgetary purposes, generally must be done annually, at the beginning of every year as long as the loans are outstanding, unless a different plan is approved by OMB, regardless of financial statement significance. For financial statement reporting purposes, both technical and interest rate reestimates are required annually, at the end of the fiscal year, whenever the reestimated amount is significant to the financial statements.

We followed the guidance in the Credit Reform Task Force\u2019s Technical Release Preparing and Auditing Direct Loan and Loan Guarantee Subsidies Under the Federal Credit Reform Act and adjusted each root cash flow assumption by 10 percent. To determine which root assumption had the greatest impact on the credit subsidy, we used the adjusted cash flows as input into OMB\u2019s credit subsidy model to recalculate the subsidy. For the recovery assumptions\u2014generally the estimated amount agencies receive from selling collateral net of cash outflows for managing, maintaining, and selling foreclosed properties\u2014we adjusted the recovery assumption along with the default timing assumption to ensure that recoveries occurred after the defaults.", "Once we identified the key cash flow assumptions, we used the guidance in Statement on Auditing Standard No. 57, Auditing Accounting Estimates, as well as the Technical Release to determine whether agencies had a reliable basis\u2014whether the agencies had gathered sufficient, relevant, and reliable supporting data\u2014for the estimates of loan program cost and for their estimates of loan program performance. Because of VA\u2019s serious problems performing basic accounting for its loan programs, we determined that it would not be meaningful to further assess whether VA had sufficient, relevant, and reliable supporting data for its estimates of loan program costs. When possible, we used the work of the agencies\u2019 fiscal year 1997 financial statement auditors to determine whether agencies had a reliable basis for their estimates of loan program costs. We also compared program descriptions with agencies\u2019 cash flow models to determine whether all characteristics of the program were appropriately modeled. Further, we compared estimated loan program performance to actual loan program performance when appropriate, to determine whether material variances between the estimates and actual performance existed.", "For two agencies, USDA and VA, this comparison was not meaningful, and therefore not performed, because of serious data quality concerns.", "To determine whether agencies had implemented the practices identified in the Technical Release, we interviewed agencies\u2019 accounting, program, and budget staff and assessed the process agencies used to estimate the cost of their loan programs.

See the \u201cAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\u201d section for VA. 2. We do not agree that VA has already corrected the accounting issues discussed in this report. In September 1998, we visited VA\u2019s servicer and concluded that the problems described in this report\u2014including the servicer\u2019s inability to monitor the amount and timing of cash due from borrowers, its inaccurate and incomplete loan histories, and its inability to allocate payments received from borrowers to the appropriate borrower\u2019s account\u2014continued to exist. 3.

Thus, we did not focus on other actions described by VA because they were beyond the scope of this review. 4. While the specific scope of this review was the Guaranty and Indemnity Fund and the Loan Guaranty Direct Loan Program, VA provided us with one model for its guaranteed loan program and one model for its direct loan program that included both the \u201cvendee\u201d and acquired loans. However, only one subsidy cost is produced per model. Since the direct loan model included both types of loans, we could not determine the amount of subsidy attributable to each loan type. As a result, we reviewed 100 percent of VA\u2019s post credit reform loan guarantees and 69 percent of its total loans receivable. To further clarify this, the report was revised to better describe our scope determination. 5. This report does not focus on VA\u2019s \u201cnon-established loans.\u201d However, this is being covered in a review that is now ongoing. 6. The $3 million referred to in our report relates to monthly loan payments or loan payoff amounts that VA received which it could not match to a borrower.

We agree that USDA needs to determine the appropriate amount of detailed history needed to make reasonable predictions of future loan performance. The amount of history needed for each loan program would likely vary by program type and complexity and be closely linked to the quality and type of history agencies had available. However, we do not agree that loan history is of limited value where program or economic changes have occurred. Historical experience should be used as the baseline for an agency\u2019s credit subsidy estimate. Once this baseline is established, the incremental changes in cash flows due to expected changes in the current and forecasted economic conditions as well as changes in program design or delivery should be adjusted for. In addition, USDA should compare the estimates of loan performance for the changed credit program to the most recent historical experience to ensure that current estimates are reasonably predicting actual loan program performance. However, as discussed in our report, USDA was not routinely comparing its estimates of loan program costs with actual historical experience.", "Further, we agree that extensive pre-credit reform detailed loan history may not be required in all cases and, in some cases, reliable summary level information may be acceptable. However, because nearly 73 percent of USDA\u2019s reported loan portfolio is comprised of pre-credit reform loans, we believe that this experience is relevant to USDA\u2019s current estimates of loan performance and, therefore, should be considered at some level. 2. While we agree that USDA has made system changes to help control funds, track cohorts, and respond to financial and budgetary reporting needs, further work is needed. USDA officials told us that the current systems configuration does not allow the systems to summarize the data so that it is readily usable for calculating credit subsidy estimates. Until these systems are able to readily provide reliable key cash flow data in a format that can be easily used in the subsidy estimation process, USDA\u2019s ability to calculate reasonable credit subsidy estimates will continue to be impaired. 3. We agree that some progress has been made by USDA in the past 2 years in addressing the challenges it faces preparing reasonable estimates of its loan program costs; however, the benefits of these and planned future actions have not yet been fully realized. Further, as explained in comment 2, until USDA\u2019s systems readily provide reliable supporting data for the credit subsidy estimates, the ultimate success of these actions may be jeopardized. 4. Although we acknowledge that USDA has a large number of loan programs, the amount of work needed to prepare reasonable credit subsidy estimates can be reduced by optimizing its computer systems\u2019 abilities and appropriately configuring these systems to readily provide reliable data for the loan cost estimation process. 5. We did not intend to imply, and did not state in our draft report, that the note interest rate varied based on the borrower\u2019s income. To avoid further confusion on this point, the report was revised to clarify that the amount of interest subsidy paid by USDA changes when a borrower\u2019s income changes. Further, the lack of support for USDA\u2019s interest subsidy assumption for this loan program could affect the estimates of the amount of interest subsidy that would be recaptured (the amount of interest subsidy a borrower may be required to repay upon sale of the property). 6. The Year 2000 section of this report focused on the status of systems managed at the USDA agency level and did not address systems managed by components such as Rural Development. We did not verify the status of Rural Development\u2019s Year 2000 compliance efforts. 7. The report was revised to reflect the agency\u2019s comment. 8. See \u201cAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\u201d section for USDA. 9. We do not agree that because of ever-evolving credit reform standards that agencies appear to be in a no-win situation and oversight agencies continue to raise the bar on their expectations. The requirements and standards have changed little since the Federal Credit Reform Act became effective in 1992 and the related accounting standards became effective in 1994. Since this time, OMB, Treasury, and the Accounting and Auditing Policy Committee\u2019s credit reform task force (which included representatives from USDA) have been working to help provide agencies with detailed guidance on how to implement credit reform requirements. Further, as demonstrated by the Small Business Administration and the Department of Education, some agencies are able to prepare reasonable credit subsidy estimates. Finally, when forecasting loan repayments for a credit program whose performance is directly linked to economic conditions, econometric models are an appropriate tool because they would consider the impact of economic conditions on estimated future loan repayments.
