The average time to complete a claim was 188 days in fiscal year 2011, and VA expects an increase in claims received as 1 million servicemembers leave military service over the next 5 years. As GAO and other organizations have previously reported, VA has faced challenges in reducing the time it takes to decide veterans\u2019 claims. GAO was asked to review these issues. Specifically, this report examines (1) the factors that contribute to lengthy processing times for disability claims and appeals, and (2) the status of VBA\u2019s recent efforts to improve disability claims and appeals processing timeliness. To do this, GAO analyzed VBA performance data and program documents, reviewed relevant studies and evaluations, met with staff from five VA regional offices, and interviewed VBA officials and Veterans Service Organizations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["A number of factors\u2014both external and internal to the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA)\u2014have contributed to the increase in processing timeframes and subsequent growth in the backlog of veterans\u2019 disability compensation claims. As the population of new veterans has swelled in recent years, the annual number of claims received by VBA has gone up. Compared to the past, these claims have a higher number of disabling conditions, and some of these conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries, make their assessment complex. Moreover, due to new regulations that have established eligibility for benefits for new diseases associated with Agent Orange exposure, VBA adjudicated 260,000 previously denied and new claims. Beyond these external factors, issues with the design and implementation of the compensation program have contributed to timeliness challenges. For example, the law requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to assist veterans in obtaining records that support their claim. However, VBA officials said that lengthy timeframes in obtaining military records\u2014particularly for members of the National Guard and Reserve\u2014and Social Security Administration (SSA) medical records impact VA\u2019s duty to assist, possibly delaying a decision on a veteran\u2019s disability claim. As a result, the evidence gathering phase of the claims process took an average of 157 days in 2011. Further, VBA\u2019s paper-based claims processing system involves multiple hand-offs, which can lead to misplaced and lost documents and can cause unnecessary time delays. Concerning timeliness of appeals, VBA regional offices have shifted resources away from appeals and toward claims in recent years, which has led to lengthy appeals timeframes.", "VBA is currently taking steps to improve the timeliness of claims and appeals processing; however, prospects for improvement remain uncertain because timely processing remains a daunting challenge. VBA is using contractors to handle some aspects of the claims process, and is also shifting some workload between regional offices. Also, VBA is modifying and streamlining certain claims and appeals processing procedures for veterans who opt to participate in these initiatives in exchange for an expedited decision. For example, veterans receive expedited processing when they submit a claim that is certified as having all required evidence. Not many veterans have elected this option, but VA is making adjustments to increase its attractiveness. In addition, VBA is trying to decrease the amount of time it takes to gather medical evidence. For example, VBA recently encouraged medical providers to use a standardized form when responding to VBA\u2019s request for information. However, results of this initiative have been mixed. VBA is also taking steps to streamline the claims process, including implementing initiatives to create (1) standardized language for decision letters sent to veterans, (2) specialized teams that process claims based on level of complexity, and (3) a paperless claims system. According to VBA officials, these efforts will help VA process veterans\u2019 claims within 125 days by 2015. However, the extent to which VA is positioned to meet this ambitious goal remains uncertain. Specifically, VBA\u2019s backlog reduction plan\u2014its key planning document\u2014does not articulate performance measures for each initiative, including their intended impact on the claims backlog. Furthermore, VA has not yet reported on how these efforts have affected processing times, a condition which raises concern given the mixed results that have emerged to date."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VBA (1) partner with military officials to reduce timeframes to gather records from National Guard and Reserve sources, (2) partner with SSA to reduce timeframes to gather SSA medical records, and (3) ensure the development of a robust plan for its initiatives that identifies performance goals that include the impact of individual initiatives on processing timeliness. In response to a draft of this report, VA officials generally agreed with GAO\u2019s conclusions and concurred with the recommendations, and summarized efforts that are planned or underway to address the recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability compensation program  provides monetary support to veterans with disabling conditions that were  incurred or aggravated during military service. In fiscal year 2011, the  program provided $39.4 billion in benefits to 3.35 million veterans. For  years, the disability compensation claims process has been the subject of  concern and attention by VA, Congress, and Veterans Service  Organizations (VSO), due in large part to long waits for decisions and the  large number of claims pending a decision. Moreover, VA\u2019s backlog of  claims\u2014defined as claims awaiting a decision for over 125 days\u2014has  more than tripled since September 2009. Against this backdrop, 1 million  servicemembers are expected to become veterans in the next 5 years  according to VA officials, with a significant number expected to apply for  disability benefits. As we and other organizations have reported over the  last decade, VA has faced challenges in reducing the time it takes to  decide veterans\u2019 claims.

The Veterans Benefits  Administration (VBA) has a number of ongoing initiatives in place to help  meet its stated timeliness goals. In this context, we were asked to  examine issues VA regional offices face in processing disability claims  and appeals in a timely fashion. Specifically, we addressed the following  questions:  1.  What factors contribute to lengthy processing times for disability  claims and appeals?  2.  What is the status of VBA\u2019s recent efforts to improve disability  claims and appeals processing timeliness?", "To address our objectives, we collected and analyzed information through  multiple methods. We reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations,  court decisions, VBA policy manuals and documents, and training  materials. We also reviewed past GAO and VA Office of Inspector  General (OIG) reports, VBA studies and evaluations, and other  documents relevant to claims and appeals processing at VBA regional  offices. We collected data on claims and appeals processing workload  and timeliness from VBA\u2019s internal dashboard. To assess the reliability of  the data, we conducted interviews with VBA officials in charge of  maintaining VBA\u2019s internal dashboard about their quality control  procedures and practices used to extract timeliness and workload data  from underlying data sources. We relied on past GAO data reliability  assessments of the underlying data sources where enterprise-wide data  on workload and timeliness of claims and appeals processing is stored  and extracted into the internal dashboard tool. In addition, we collected  data on claims processing resources from VBA\u2019s Personnel and  Accounting Integrated Database. To assess the reliability of these data,  we interviewed officials in VBA\u2019s Office of Human Resources about  practices to record personnel actions, quality control procedures  conducted within the Office of Human Resources to ensure the quality of  the data, as well as potential limitations to the data. We reviewed the data  and found it to be sufficiently reliable for the purpose of analyzing  timeliness, workload, and resources assigned to claims processing. We  interviewed VBA central office officials, including officials in VBA\u2019s  Implementation Center (which was established as a project management  office to manage improvement initiatives), and VSO representatives who  assist veterans with their claims and appeals. We also met with staff from  five VA regional offices\u2014Atlanta, Georgia; Houston, Texas; Los Angeles,  California; New York, New York; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We  selected offices based on size of metropolitan area, claims workload, and  timeliness of claims and appeals processing.

VA also pays additional compensation for certain dependent spouses,  children, and parents of veterans. VA\u2019s disability compensation claims  process starts when a veteran submits a claim to VBA (see fig. 2). A  claim folder is created at 1 of VA\u2019s 57 regional offices, and a Veterans  Service Representative (VSR) then reviews the claim and helps the  veteran gather the relevant evidence needed to evaluate the claim. Such  evidence includes the veteran\u2019s military service records, medical  examinations, and treatment records from Veterans Health Administration  (VHA) medical facilities and private medical service providers. Also, if  necessary to provide support to substantiate the claim, VA will provide a  medical examination for the veteran. Once VBA has gathered the  supporting evidence, a Rating Veterans Service Representative  (RVSR)\u2014who typically has more experience at VBA than a VSR\u2014 evaluates the claim and determines whether the veteran is eligible for  benefits. If so, the RVSR assigns a percentage rating.

If the veteran further  disagrees with the decision, he or she may appeal to the Board of  Veterans\u2019 Appeals (the Board). Before transferring the appeal to the  Board, VBA reviews the case again and then certifies that the appeal is  ready for review by the Board. After the appeal has been certified, the  Board conducts a hearing if the veteran requests one, then grants  benefits, denies the appeal, or returns the case to VBA to obtain  additional evidence necessary to decide the claim.

In addition, the time it took to mail a Statement of the  Case increased 57 percent over that time period\u2014from 293 days to 460  days on average.", "A number of factors have contributed to the substantial increase in claims  received. One factor was the commencement in October 2010 of VBA\u2019s  adjudication of 260,000 previously denied and new claims when a  presumptive service connection was established for three additional  Agent Orange-related diseases.and assigned experienced claims staff to process and track them. VBA  officials said that 37 percent of its claims processing resources nationally  were devoted to adjudicating Agent Orange claims from October 2010 to  March 2012. VBA officials in one regional office we spoke to said that all  claims processing staff were assigned solely to developing and rating  Agent Orange claims for 4 months in 2011, and that no other new and  pending claims in the regional office\u2019s inventory were processed during  that time. Also during this time period, special VBA teams\u2014known as  brokering centers\u2014which previously accepted claims and appeals from  regional offices experiencing processing delays, were devoted to  processing Agent Orange claims exclusively. According to VBA, other  factors that contributed to the growing number of claims include an  increase in the number of veterans from the military downsizing after 10  years of conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan, improved outreach activities and  transition services to servicemembers and veterans, and difficult financial  conditions for veterans during the economic downturn. In conjunction with  an increase in claims received, VBA officials said that claims today are  more complex than in the past. As we reported in 2010, VBA said it is  receiving more claims for complex disabilities related to combat and  deployments overseas, including those based on environmental and   VBA gave these claims a high priority  infectious disease risks and traumatic brain injuries. Claims with many  conditions can take longer to complete because each condition must be  evaluated separately and then combined into a single percentage rating.  According to VA, in 2011, the number of medical conditions claimed by  veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan averaged 8.5, an increase  from 3-4 conditions per claim for Vietnam veterans.", "As we reported in 2010, VBA\u2019s goal is for newly hired VSRs to be proficient within 18  months and new RVSRs to be proficient within 2 years. See GAO-10-213. However,  becoming proficient often takes longer\u2014about 3 to 5 years for RVSRs. While VBA hired  additional temporary staff using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 funds,  they were given limited training and less complex claims processing tasks. According to  VBA officials, in 2011, VA received authority to convert temporary employees into  permanent staff, which required additional training and mentoring. officials at one regional office said the number of claims processing staff  assigned to outreach activities has increased. Specifically, at the time of  our review, 37 out of 302 claims processing staff were conducting  outreach activities to servicemembers and veterans, such as giving  briefings and distributing materials at military bases about pre-discharge  and transition assistance programs.", "According to VBA officials, a primary reason that appeals timeliness at VA  regional offices has worsened is a lack of staff focused on processing  these appeals. VBA officials at each of the five regional offices we met  with stated that over the last several years appeals staff have also had to  train and mentor new staff, conduct quality reviews, as well as develop  and rate disability claims to varying degrees. For example, at one regional  office, all staff on the appeals team focused exclusively on rating disability  claims for a 9-month period in 2010 instead of processing appeals.  Officials at another regional office stated that until 2012, their appeals  staff spent up to 2 weeks per month on non-appeals tasks. In addition, we  reported in 2011 that regional office managers estimated that Decision  Review Officers (DRO) spent on average 36 percent of their time on non- appeals processing tasks.office managers did not assign enough staff to process appeals, diverted  staff from processing appeals, and did not ensure that appeals staff acted   A 2012 VA OIG report noted that VA regional  on appeals promptly because, in part, they were assigned responsibilities  to process initial claims, which were given higher priority. The VA OIG  recommended that VBA identify staffing resources needed to meet their  appeals processing goals, conduct DRO reviews on all appeals, and  revise productivity standards and procedures to emphasize processing  appeals in a timely manner, such as implementing criteria requiring  appeals staff to initiate a review or develop for Notices of Disagreement  and certified appeals within 60 days of receipt. VBA agreed with the VA  OIG\u2019s findings and is conducting a pilot to assess the feasibility of  addressing these recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Requirements Contribute to Long Processing Times", "paragraphs": ["According to VA officials, federal laws and court decisions over the  past decade have expanded veterans\u2019 entitlement to benefits but have  also added requirements that can negatively affect claims processing  times. For example, the VCAA requires VA to assist a veteran who files a  claim in obtaining evidence to substantiate the claim before making a  decision. This requirement includes helping veterans obtain all relevant  federal records and non-federal records. VA is required to continue  trying to obtain federal records, such as VA medical records, military  service records, and Social Security records, until they are either obtained  or the associated federal entity indicates the records do not exist. VA may  continue to process the claim and provide partial benefits to the veteran,  but the claim cannot be completed until all relevant federal evidence is  obtained.", "While VA must consider all evidence submitted throughout the claims and  appeals processes, if a veteran submits additional evidence or adds a  condition to a claim late in the claims process it can require rework and  may subsequently delay a decision, according to VBA central office  officials. VBA officials at regional offices we spoke to said that submitting  additional evidence may add months to the claims process. New  evidence must first be reviewed to determine what additional action, if  any, is required. Next, another notification letter must be sent to the  veteran detailing the new evidence necessary to redevelop the claim and  additional steps VA will take in light of the new evidence. Then, VA may  have to obtain additional records or order another medical examination  before the claim can be rated and a decision can be made. Furthermore,  while VA may continue to process the claim and provide partial benefits to  the veteran, a claim is not considered \u201ccomplete\u201d until a decision is made  on all conditions submitted by the veteran. Moreover, a veteran has up to  1 year, from the notification of VA\u2019s decision, to submit additional  evidence in support of the claim before the decision is considered final. In  addition, a veteran may submit additional evidence in support of their  appeal at any time during the process. If the veteran submits additional  evidence after VA completes a Statement of the Case, VA must review  the new evidence, reconsider the appeal, and provide another written  explanation of its decision\u2014known as a Supplemental Statement of the  Case. Congress recently passed a law allowing VA to waive review of  additional evidence submitted after the veteran has filed a substantive  appeal and instead have the new evidence reviewed by the Board to  expedite VA\u2019s process of certifying appeals to the Board.", "While federal law requires veterans to use an application form prescribed  by VA when submitting a claim for original disability compensation  benefits, VBA central office officials said they accept reopened claims or  claims requesting an increase in disability compensation benefits in any  format, which can contribute to lengthy processing times. VBA will  accept an original disability claim informally if it is submitted in a non- standard format, but within 1 year the veteran must submit a VA Form 21- 526, Veteran\u2019s Application for Compensation and/or Pension. VBA does  not track the number of claims submitted in non-standard formats;  however, officials at three regional offices we met with said they receive  claims submitted in various formats, including hand-written letters.  Officials at these three regional offices said that when such claims are  submitted, there is a risk that claims staff may not be able to identify all  the conditions the veteran would like to claim during initial development.  For example, officials at one regional office stated that if these conditions  are discovered later in the process, then VA must redevelop the claim\u2014 which could include sending another letter to the veteran, obtaining  additional records, and conducting another medical exam\u2014before the  claim can be rated and a benefit amount determined and disbursed. VBA  officials said they expect the number of non-standard applications for  disability claims to decrease as more veterans file claims electronically  through the Veterans On Line Application (VONAPP), which is available  at VA\u2019s eBenefits website.", "Similar to processing for reopened claims, VA\u2019s procedures allowing  veterans to submit appeals in any format can negatively affect appeals  processing times, according to VBA officials. For example, a veteran\u2019s  intention to appeal a prior decision may be overlooked initially by staff  because there is no standard appeals submission form and a veteran\u2019s  statement to appeal a prior decision may be included along with other  written correspondence for other purposes, such as submitting a new  claim, according to VBA officials.

However, VBA  area directors and officials at all five regional offices we met with  acknowledged that delays in obtaining these records are a system-wide  challenge. Military records of National Guard or Reserve members can  often be difficult to obtain, in particular, because these servicemembers  typically have multiple, non-consecutive deployments with different units  and their records may not always be held with their reserve units and may  exist in multiple places. Moreover, according to VBA officials, National  Guard and Reserve members may be treated by private providers  between tours of active duty and VA may have to contact multiple military  personnel and private medical providers to obtain all relevant records,  potentially causing delays in the evidence gathering process.", "Difficulties in obtaining timely and complete medical information,  especially from private medical providers, can also contribute to a lengthy  evidence gathering phase. For example, officials at one regional office  said the process may be delayed if veterans are slow to return their  consent forms that allow VA to pursue private medical records. Also,  according to VBA officials, private medical providers may not respond to  VA records requests in a timely fashion. In addition, officials at one  regional office we met with mentioned that time frames can also be  affected if veterans fail to show up for scheduled examinations. Officials  at two regional offices we met with said that even when medical records  are obtained, medical exams and opinions may include erroneous  information or be missing necessary evidence, which then requires VA  officials to follow-up with medical providers to clarify information. In some  cases, another examination must be ordered before a decision can be  made on the claim, which can add months to the process. VBA area  directors acknowledged that obtaining complete and sufficient medical  information is a system-wide challenge.", "Difficulties obtaining Social Security Administration (SSA) medical  records, as one specific example, can also lengthen the evidence  gathering phase. Currently, an interagency agreement exists that  establishes the terms and conditions under which SSA discloses  information to VA for use in determining eligibility for disability benefits,  according to VBA officials. Although VBA regional office staff have direct  access to SSA benefits payment histories, they do not have direct access  to medical records held by SSA. If a veteran submits a disability claim  and reports receiving SSA disability benefits, VA is required to help the  veteran obtain relevant federal records, including certain SSA medical  records, to process the claim. VBA\u2019s policy manual instructs claims staff  to fax a request for medical information to SSA and if no reply is received,  to wait 60 working days before sending a follow-up fax request. If a  response to the follow-up request is not received after 30 days, the  manual instructs claims staff to send an email request to an SSA liaison.  VBA officials at four of the five regional offices we reviewed told us that  when following this protocol, they have had difficulty obtaining SSA  medical records in a timely fashion. Moreover, they reported having no  contact information for SSA, beyond the fax number, to help process their  requests. In complying with VA\u2019s duty to assist requirement, VBA staff  told us they continue trying to retrieve SSA records by sending follow-up  fax requests until they receive the records or receive a response that the  records do not exist. VBA area directors said some regional offices have  established relationships with local SSA offices and have better results,  but obtaining necessary SSA information has been an ongoing issue  nationally.

For example, VBA officials at  one regional office said that a claim may be stalled in the evidence  gathering phase if a piece of mail that contains outstanding evidence is  misplaced or lost. In addition, claims staff may rate a claim without  knowledge of the additional evidence submitted and then, once the mail is  routed to the claim folder, have to rerate the claim in light of the new  evidence received. Furthermore, VBA officials at one regional office we  met with said that processing can also be delayed if mail staff are slow to  record new claims or appeals into IT systems. As of August 2012, VBA  took 43 days on average to record Notices of Disagreement in the  appeals system\u201436 days longer than VBA\u2019s national target. In May 2011,  the VA OIG reported that VA regional office mailroom operations needed  strengthening to ensure that staff process mail in an accurate and timely  manner.

VBA area  directors said that mail processing timeliness varies by regional office and  that the more efficient offices in general do a better job of associating mail  with the correct claims folder. In addition, VBA area directors said that  standardizing the mail handling and sorting process in an integrated mail  processing center\u2014a component of the Claims Organizational Model  implemented in 18 regional offices in fiscal year 2012\u2014is intended to  improve mail processing by involving more senior staff in the process.  VBA officials also said that moving claims folders among regional offices  and medical providers contributes to lengthy processing times. According  to a 2011 VA OIG report, processing delays occurred following medical  examinations because staff could not match claims-related mail with the  appropriate claim folders until the folders were returned from the VA  Medical Center. In addition, processing halts while a claim folder is sent  to another regional office or brokering center.", "Lastly, according to VBA officials, the lack of an integrated IT system that  provides all necessary information and functionality to track and process  claims and appeals can decrease the productivity of claims processing  staff. For example, according to staff at one VA regional office we spoke  with, currently, they must use different systems to track claims folders,  order medical exams, record claim processing actions taken by VBA staff  and evidence received on a claim, rate claims, process awards, and  record the status of appeals to the Board. The lack of an integrated  system requires staff to enter claim information multiple times, search  through multiple systems for claim information, and maintain processing  notes on the status of the claim or appeal in multiple systems.

One effort is the Fully Developed Claims (FDC)  program, which began as a pilot in December 2008 and was implemented  nationwide in June 2010. The FDC program was implemented in  response to a congressional mandate that required VBA to conduct a pilot  program to expedite processing of fully developed claims in 90 days or  less. Normally, once a veteran submits a claim, VBA will review the  claim and then send the veteran a letter detailing additional evidence  required to support the claim. The FDC program eliminates this step and  saves time because the required notification is provided to the veteran  directly on the FDC form. The program also attempts to reduce the time  VBA would normally spend gathering evidence for the veteran. In  exchange for expedited processing, veterans participating in the FDC  program send VBA any relevant private medical evidence with the claim  and certify that they have no additional evidence to provide. While VBA  officials and VSOs expect the program to reduce processing delays for  veterans, claims submitted without the required evidence are considered  incomplete. Furthermore, claims submitted under the FDC program with  incomplete evidence sometimes lose their priority status and are  processed with VBA\u2019s non-expedited workload, which can result in  additional processing time. According to VBA officials, in the first 2 years  of the program, VBA has processed 33,001 FDC claims, taking an  average of about 98 days to complete\u20148 days longer than the goal of 90  days for these claims. VBA officials attribute not meeting FDC processing  time goals to the increased workload resulting from processing Agent  Orange claims. As of July 2012, veteran participation in the FDC program  has been low\u2014only 4 percent of all compensation rating claims submitted  in 2012. A VBA official told us that in response to VSO input, they have  made the FDC form easier to use. Moreover, the VBA official we spoke  with expects more FDC claims once veterans are able to electronically file  claims. While FDC claims are currently submitted by paper, the proposed  electronic system will guide veterans through the steps to gather the  necessary evidence in support of their claim and draw information needed  on the form from VBA electronic databases.", "VBA also began the Appeals Design Pilot\u2014implemented at a single  regional office\u2014in spring 2012 to expedite appeals processing. The pilot  modifies several program procedures with the goal of decreasing appeals  processing times, according to management at the regional office  conducting the pilot. For example, veterans participating in the pilot do not  file appeals in non-traditional formats. Instead, they use a standardized  Notice of Disagreement form. The pilot also forgoes the election of a  traditional versus a DRO review of an appeal\u2014providing DRO reviews for  all appeals from veterans participating in the pilot. This change  eliminates the need for VBA to wait up to 60 days for a veteran to make  an election on the type of regional office review in an appeal. In addition,  veterans submitting new evidence during the appeal can opt to have their  case expedited directly to the Board without having the regional office  review the additional evidence submitted. In addition to those mentioned  above, the Appeals Design Pilot also has several other elements. For  example, expedited processing is provided to appeals that are filed with  only one or two disabling conditions.

For instance, the number  and complexity of VA claims received has increased. And that number is  projected to continue to increase as 1 million servicemembers become  veterans over the next 5 years due to the drawdown of troops from a  decade of conflict in Afghanistan and Iraq. Moreover, the evidence  gathering phase in fiscal year 2011, which took over 5 months (157 days)  on average, continues to worsen in 2012, partly due to difficulties in  obtaining records for National Guard and Reserve and SSA medical  records, according to VBA officials. While recent process and technology  improvements hold some promise, without improved evidence gathering,  VBA may struggle to meet its goal of processing all compensation claims  within its 125 day goal by 2015. Although VBA is attempting to address  processing challenges through various improvement initiatives, without a  comprehensive plan to strategically manage resources and evaluate the  effectiveness of these efforts, the agency risks spending limited resources  on initiatives that may not speed up disability claims and appeals  processes.
