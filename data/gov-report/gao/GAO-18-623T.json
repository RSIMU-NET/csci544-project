Certain physician types are consistently among the most difficult to recruit and retain, and are thus considered mission-critical by VHA.", "Over the past two decades, GAO and others have expressed concern about VHA's ability to ensure that it has the appropriate clinical workforce, including physicians, to meet the current and future needs of veterans.", "This statement is based on GAO's October 2017 report and examines (1) VHA information on how many mission critical physicians provided care at VAMCs, (2) VHA guidance for determining its physician staffing needs, and (3) the strategies VHA used to support the recruitment and retention of physicians at VAMCs, and the extent to which it has evaluated these strategies to determine their effectiveness.", "For this statement, GAO updated the information from its October 2017 report and obtained information from VHA officials in June 2018 about steps they have taken to implement the 2017 recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) continues to face challenges related to physician staffing, recruitment, and retention, though it has begun work to implement recommendations made in GAO's October 2017 report. Specifically, GAO's report found the following:", "VHA's data on the number of physicians that provided care at VA medical centers (VAMC) were incomplete. GAO found that data were incomplete because they did not include data on the number of contract physicians and contained only limited data on the number of physician trainees\u2014two types of physicians that augment the care provided by physicians employed by VHA. Thus, VHA data underestimated the total number of physicians providing care in its medical centers leaving it unable to ensure that its workforce planning processes sufficiently addressed gaps in staffing. GAO recommended that VHA implement a process to accurately count all its physicians. VHA did not concur with this recommendation, stating that it used other tools for workforce planning. VHA has since implemented a new human resources (HR) database\u2014HR Smart\u2014that has the capability to track each position at its VAMCs. However, VHA officials told us they do not plan to include information on physician contractors in this database.", "VHA provided VAMCs with guidance on how to determine the number of physicians and support staff needed for some physician occupations, although it lacked sufficient guidance for its medical and surgical specialties. GAO recommended that VHA issue guidance to VAMCs on determining appropriate staffing levels for all physicians. VHA concurred and reported it would develop staffing guidance for its medical and surgical specialties. VHA officials told GAO VHA signed a specialty care workgroup charter November 27, 2017; the primary goal of the workgroup was to develop a specialty care staffing model that would include staffing information for all specialty care. VHA anticipates completing its work and issuing staffing guidance by December 2018.", "VHA used various strategies to recruit and retain its physician workforce, but had not comprehensively evaluated them to assess effectiveness . Without such an evaluation, VHA did not have complete information on the underlying causes of the difficulties VAMCs face, or whether its recruitment and retention strategies were meeting physician workforce needs. GAO recommended VHA (1) establish a system-wide method to share information about physician trainees to help fill vacancies across VAMCs and (2) conduct a comprehensive, system-wide evaluation of VAMCs' physician recruitment and retention efforts and establish an ongoing monitoring program. VHA concurred and reported it has since taken steps to address the recommendations. For example, VHA's Office of Workforce Management and Consulting has partnered with its Partnered Evidence-based Policy Resource Center to evaluate and recommend a systematic approach for allocating workforce management resources. In addition, VHA has added the capability to track physician trainees to its HR Smart database. VHA expects to complete its efforts by September 2018 and September 2019, respectively."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing on the  ability of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health  Administration (VHA) to recruit and retain high-quality physicians. A  strong clinical workforce capable of providing quality and timely care to  our nation\u2019s veterans is critical to the success of VHA, which operates  one of the largest health care systems in the United States, providing  care at 1,252 facilities, including 170 VA medical centers (VAMC). As the  demand for VHA\u2019s services grows\u2014due in part to increasing demand  from servicemembers returning from the United States\u2019 military operations  in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the growing needs of an aging veteran  population\u2014attracting, hiring, and retaining top talent is critical to VHA\u2019s  mission to provide high-quality and timely health care for our nation\u2019s  veterans.", "Physicians\u2014who provide and supervise a broad range of care, including  primary and specialty care\u2014serve an integral role in VHA\u2019s mission. VHA  indicated that physicians occupy a top spot on its annual list of mission- critical occupations, as a result of factors including the time frames  needed for VHA\u2019s hiring process, a limited supply of candidates, and  competition for candidates. Within the physician category, VHA has also  identified the top five physician occupations that are the hardest to recruit  and retain. We use the term \u201cmission-critical physician occupations\u201d to  refer to the top five physician occupations VHA identified in fiscal year  2016 as most in need of staffing: primary care, mental health,  gastroenterology, orthopedic surgery, and emergency medicine. VHA  hires more than 2,800 mission-critical physicians annually. Yet,  physicians have consistently been identified by VHA as a critical staffing  priority due to recruitment and retention concerns.", "Over the past two decades, we and others have expressed concerns  about VHA\u2019s ability to ensure that it has the appropriate clinical workforce  to meet the current and future needs of veterans. A 2015 independent  assessment found that if VHA does not increase its total number of  clinical employees, including physicians, it will be difficult for it to meet the  projected demand for services. Further, in July 2016, we found that the  number of physicians who leave VHA had steadily increased from fiscal  years 2011 through 2015. During this time, physicians were among the 10  occupations with the highest rates of attrition each year. The attrition was  primarily due to voluntary resignations and retirements.", "My statement today is based on our October 2017 report examining VHA  physician staffing, recruitment, and retention strategies. In particular, my  statement focuses on (1) VHA information on how many mission-critical  physicians provided care at VAMCs; (2) VHA guidance for determining its  physician staffing needs; and (3) the strategies VHA used to support the  recruitment and retention of physicians at VAMCs, and the extent to  which it has evaluated these strategies to determine their effectiveness.  As part of that work, we made several recommendations for VHA to  improve staffing, recruitment, and retention strategies for physicians.", "To do the work for our October 2017 report, we reviewed key documents  and interviewed knowledgeable officials from VHA in headquarters  offices, as well as in six VAMCs across the country. More detailed  information on the objectives, scope, and methodology for our 2017  report can be found in that report. For this statement, we obtained  information from VHA officials in June 2018 about any steps they have  taken to implement our 2017 recommendations.", "This statement is based on work conducted in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that  we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to  provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The attrition among VHA physicians has been of particular concern given  that the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)  anticipates that by 2025 the national demand for physician services will  exceed supply. HRSA\u2019s Office of Rural Health Policy reported, in 2017,  that physician shortages were exacerbated in rural areas, where  communities struggle to attract and keep well-trained providers. This  difficulty has posed a particular challenge for VHA, as approximately one  in four VAMCs is located in a rural area.", "Most physicians providing care at VAMCs are employed by VHA. VHA  also supplements the capacity of its employed physician staff by acquiring  additional physician services through fee-basis arrangements or  contracts. Under fee-basis arrangements, providers are paid a pre- agreed-upon amount for each service provided. Under contracts,  physician services may be obtained on a short-term basis; for example,  through sole-source contracts with academic affiliates. VAMCs may also  use physicians who volunteer their time, who are referred to as work- without-compensation providers.", "In addition to VHA-employed, contract, and fee-basis physicians, VAMCs  often supplement their capacity by using physician trainees, who include  medical residents and advanced fellows. In 2016, 135 of the 170 VAMCs  had active physician training programs. According to VHA officials, there  were 43,768 medical residents who trained at a VAMC in 2016. VHA has  been expanding its physician training program, as directed by the  Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014, as amended.  In 2017, VHA added 175 physician trainee positions across VAMCs  nationwide, including 3 VAMCs that did not have physician trainees prior  to this expansion. VHA\u2019s objective is to add 953 additional physician  trainee positions to its VAMCs by 2025 in order to improve access and  hire additional physicians. Further, VHA officials told us they want to  continue to add new positions that would eventually allow all VAMCs  access to physician trainees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VHA Lacked Information on the Total Number of Mission-Critical Physicians Who Provided Care at VAMCs and Does Not Plan to Collect this Information", "paragraphs": ["In our October 2017 report, we found that VHA\u2019s data on physicians who  provided care at VAMCs were incomplete. Specifically, we found that  VHA had data on the number of mission-critical physicians it employed  (more than 11,000) and who provided services on a fee-basis (about  2,800), but lacked data on the number of contract physicians and  physician trainees. As a result, VHA did not have data on the extent to  which VAMCs used these arrangements and thus, underestimated its  physician use overall. Therefore, VHA was unable to ensure that its  workforce planning processes sufficiently addressed any gaps in staffing.", "All six VAMCs included in our review used at least one type of  arrangement other than employment for physicians, and five of the six  used contract physicians or physician trainees. (See fig. 1.) On average,  contract and fee-basis physicians made up 5 to 40 percent of the  physicians in a given mission-critical physician occupation at each VAMC  in our review. For example, officials from a large, highly complex VAMC  told us that, in March 2017, they augmented the 86 employed primary  care physicians with eight contract and three fee-basis physicians, which  represented about 16 percent of their primary care physician workforce.  Further, this VAMC also had about 64 primary care physician trainees  providing certain medical services under the supervision of a senior  physician.", "During the course of our work for the October 2017 report, VHA officials  told us that its personnel databases were designed to manage VHA\u2019s  payroll systems, but that these databases did not contain information on  contract physicians or physician trainees. VHA officials told us they were  working to include information on physician trainees in a new human  resources (HR) database\u2014HR Smart\u2014which at the time of our review,  was scheduled to be implemented in 2017. However, these officials were  not aware of plans to add information to the database on contract  physicians. Instead, VAMC leaders used locally devised methods to  identify and track contract physicians, fee-basis physicians, and physician  trainees. For example, one VAMC in our October 2017 review used a  locally maintained spreadsheet to track its physicians under  arrangements other than employment, while another VAMC asked  department leaders to identify how many of these provided care within  their respective departments. At each of the six VAMCs in our review, we  found that department leaders were generally knowledgeable about the  total number of physicians that provided care within the departments they  managed. However, this locally maintained information was not readily  accessible by VHA officials.", "To address the limitations in VHA\u2019s data, we recommended in our  October 2017 report that VHA develop and implement a process to  accurately count all physicians providing care at each of its VAMCs,  including physicians not employed by VHA. VHA did not concur with this  recommendation, stating that it uses other tools for workforce planning.  However, a VHA official acknowledged that data sources used for  workforce planning may not include all types of contract physicians or  work-without-compensation physicians.", "As we discussed in our prior report, implementing such a systematic  process would eliminate the need for individual VAMCs to use their own  mechanisms, such as a locally developed and maintained spreadsheet to  track its physician workforce, as was done by one VAMC in our prior  review. Further, local mechanisms may not be readily accessible to VHA  officials engaged in workforce planning, resulting in incomplete  information for decision-making purposes.", "Since our report, VHA officials told us that they have completed  implementation of HR Smart, which provides the capability to track every  position with a unique position number, and each employee\u2019s full  employment history. However, VHA officials told us they do not plan to  enhance the capability of HR Smart to track contractors.", "We continue to believe that having a systematic and consistent process  to account for all physicians who provide care across VAMCs, including  physicians not employed by VHA, would help address concerns that VHA  is unable to identify all physicians providing care at its VAMCs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VHA Has Begun to Develop Guidance for Determining Its Staffing Needs for All Physicians", "paragraphs": ["In our October 2017 report, we found that VHA gave responsibility for  determining staffing needs to its VAMCs and provided its facilities with  guidance, through policies and directives, on how to determine the  number of physicians and support staff needed for some physician  occupations. Specifically, VHA provided this guidance for primary care,  mental health, and emergency medicine, but lacked sufficient guidance  for its medical and surgical specialties, including occupations such as  gastroenterology and orthopedic surgery. For these occupations, VHA  provided guidance on the minimum number of physicians, but did not  provide information on how to determine appropriate staffing levels for  physicians or support staff based on the need for care.", "Specifically, the VHA guidance available at the time set a minimum  requirement that VAMCs of a certain complexity level have at least one  gastroenterologist and one orthopedic surgeon that is available within 15  minutes by phone or 60 minutes in person 24 hours a day, 7 days a  week. VHA guidance did not include information on how to use data,  such as workload data, to manage the demand for care or help inform  staffing levels for these physician occupations beyond this minimum  requirement. Officials from four of the six VAMCs we reviewed for our  October 2017 report told us that because they lacked (1) guidance on  how to determine the number of physicians and support staff needed, and  (2) data on how their staffing levels compared with those of similar  VAMCs, they were sometimes unsure whether their staffing levels were  adequate.", "In our October 2017 report, we discussed that VHA had previously  established, in 2016, a specialty physician staffing workgroup that  examined the relationships between staffing levels, provider workload and  productivity, veterans\u2019 access, and cost across VAMCs for its medical and  surgical specialties, including gastroenterology and orthopedic surgery.  This group\u2019s work culminated in a January 2017 report that found VHA  was unable to assess and report on the staffing at each VAMC, as  required by the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014,  because a staffing model for specialty care had not been established and  applied across VAMCs. This report made a number of recommendations,  including that VHA provide guidance to its VAMCs on what level of  staffing is appropriate for its mission-critical physician occupations.  However, as we noted in our October 2017 report, VHA leadership had  not yet taken steps to develop such staffing guidance. We reported that,  according to a VHA official, other priorities were taking precedence and  continued work in this area had not yet been approved by VHA  leadership. Although VHA officials agreed that further steps should be  taken, they did not indicate when these would occur. In our report, we  concluded that until VHA issues guidance on staffing levels for certain  physician occupations that provide specialty care to veterans, there would  continue to be ambiguity for VAMCs on how to determine appropriate  staffing levels.", "To address this, we recommended that VHA develop and issue guidance  to VAMCs on determining appropriate staffing levels for all mission-critical  physician occupations. VHA concurred with our recommendation and  reported it would evaluate and develop staffing guidance for its medical  and surgical specialties.", "Since our report, VHA officials told us that on November 27, 2017, the  Executive-in-Charge for VHA signed the specialty care workgroup  charter. The primary goal of the workgroup is to develop a specialty care  staffing model that will include staffing information for all specialty care.

(See table 1.)", "In our October 2017 report, we found that VHA faced challenges using its  strategies for recruiting and retaining physicians. For example, according  to VHA officials, budget shortfalls in the Education Debt Reduction  Program\u2014which reimburses qualifying education loan debt for  employees, including physicians, in hard-to-recruit positions\u2014reduced  VAMCs\u2019 ability to offer this recruitment incentive to physician candidates.  In addition, the relatively small number of physician recruiters in VHA\u2019s  National Recruitment Program\u201419 recruiters for the 170 VAMCs at the  time of our report\u2014limited their ability to understand the particular  nuances of some markets, particularly in rural areas.", "Further, despite VHA\u2019s large and expanding graduate medical training  program, VAMCs experienced difficulties hiring physicians who received  training through its residency and fellowship programs. VHA did not track  the number of physician trainees who were hired following graduation, but  officials told us that the number was small in comparison to the almost  44,000 physician trainees educated at VAMCs each year.", "We found that VAMCs faced challenges hiring physician trainees, in part,  because VHA did not share information on graduating physician trainees  for recruitment purposes with VAMCs across the system. VHA officials  told us that recruitment efforts could be improved by developing and  maintaining a database of physician trainees, but said that VHA had no  such database. According to VHA officials, information sharing could help  both VAMCs in geographically remote locations that do not have a  residency program and help identify trainees who want to work at VHA  after graduating, but who received no offers from the VAMC they trained  at due to the lack of vacancies in their specialty.", "We also reported in October 2017 that VHA did not have complete  information on whether its recruitment and retention strategies were  meeting its needs. VHA had gathered feedback on barriers VAMCs face  when offering financial incentives to physician candidates through its  Education Debt Reduction Program and created a workgroup to look at its  overall use of physician retention strategies, although it had not  completed a comprehensive review of its recruitment and retention  strategies to identify any areas for improvement. As a result, VHA did not  have complete information on the underlying causes of the difficulties  VAMCs faced or whether its recruitment and retention strategies met its  objective of having a robust physician workforce to meet the health care  needs of veterans.", "To address these issues, we recommended that VHA (1) establish a  system-wide method to share information about physician trainees to help  fill vacancies across VAMCs, and (2) conduct a comprehensive, system- wide evaluation of its physician recruitment and retention efforts, and  establish an ongoing monitoring program. VHA concurred with our  recommendations, and reported it planned to enhance its personnel  database, HR Smart, to include physician trainees. Additionally, VHA said  it planned to complete a comprehensive, system-wide evaluation of the  physician recruitment and retention strategies.", "Since our report, VHA reported taking some steps to address these  recommendations. Specifically, officials told us they are working to  include information in the newly implemented HR Smart database on  work-without-compensation employees, such as physician trainees, and  anticipate conducting pilot projects at various sites before fully  implementing this capability by September 30, 2019. Additionally, officials  said that they are in the process of completing a review of physician  recruitment and retention incentives. Furthermore, according to VHA  officials, beginning in October 2017, VHA\u2019s Office of Workforce  Management and Consulting partnered with the Partnered Evidence- based Policy Resource Center\u2014an internal VHA resource center\u2014to  evaluate and recommend a systematic approach for allocating workforce  management resources, such as the Education Debt Reduction Program.
