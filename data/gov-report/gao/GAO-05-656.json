To deter such fraud, CMS contracts with the National Supplier Clearinghouse (NSC) to verify that suppliers meet 21 standards before they can bill Medicare. NSC verifies adherence to the standards through on-site inspections and document reviews. Recent prosecutions of fraudulent suppliers suggest that there may be weaknesses in NSC's efforts to screen suppliers or in the standards. In this report, GAO evaluated: 1) NSC's efforts to verify suppliers' compliance with the 21 standards, 2) the adequacy of the standards to screen suppliers, and 3) CMS's oversight of NSC's efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["NSC's efforts to verify compliance with the 21 standards are insufficient because of weaknesses in two key screening procedures--checking state licensure and conducting on-site inspections. NSC's licensure check is ineffective because it relies on self-reported information about the items suppliers intend to provide to beneficiaries and does not match this against actual billing later. We found a total of 22 suppliers in Florida, Louisiana, and Texas that had each been paid at least $1,000 by Medicare in 2004 for providing oxygen services, but did not have the required state license. Further, more than half of the almost $107 million paid by Medicare for custom-fabricated orthotics and prosthetics in Florida in 2004 went to suppliers that had not had their licenses checked. At least 46 of these suppliers were under investigation for fraud as of April 2005. NSC's on-site inspections also have weaknesses that limit their effectiveness. We estimate that NSC did not conduct required on-site inspections of 605 suppliers. Further, when conducting on-site inspections, NSC does not require its inspectors to examine beneficiary files to assess whether suppliers are meeting the standard to maintain proof of delivery or check whether suppliers have a real source of inventory, as required by Medicare. Medicare's 21 standards are currently too weak to be used effectively to screen medical equipment suppliers. Although Medicare paid suppliers about $8.8 billion in fiscal year 2004, the program's 21 standards do not include measures related to supplier integrity and capability analogous to those that federal agencies generally apply to prospective contractors or those used by at least two state Medicaid programs for their suppliers. For example, in sworn testimony before the Committee on Finance in April 2004, an individual who pleaded guilty to Medicare fraud described how she was able to open a sham business with $3,000--despite lacking the experience and the financial, technical, and managerial resources to operate a legitimate supply company. If an agency finds a company does not meet federal contracting standards for integrity and capability, the agency may decline to award it a contract. If a contractor performs inadequately, the agency can terminate the contract. Further, agencies may disqualify a contractor from competing for other federal contracts. In addition, a California supplier that is disenrolled from Medicaid for failing to meet state requirements cannot reenroll for 3 years. In contrast, if a Medicare supplier can later demonstrate compliance with the 21 standards, CMS readmits it into the program. CMS's oversight has not been sufficient to determine whether NSC is meeting its responsibilities in screening and enrolling DMEPOS suppliers. For example, CMS was unaware--until we informed the agency--that NSC had not conducted all required on-site inspections for suppliers. Moreover, while CMS has established performance goals for NSC related primarily to processing applications, it has not established a method to evaluate NSC's success in identifying noncompliant and fraudulent suppliers and recommending that they be removed from the program."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Medicare is the federal program that helps pay for a variety of health care  services and items on behalf of almost 42 million elderly and certain  disabled beneficiaries. One of the responsibilities of the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that administers  Medicare, is to minimize improper payments made on behalf of its  beneficiaries. Improper payments result from mistakes on the part of  those who bill Medicare; abusive activities; or fraud, which is intentional  misrepresentation. According to CMS estimates, in fiscal year 2004,  Medicare paid about $8.8 billion in claims for durable medical equipment,  prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS), of which $900 million  were improper payments. As we previously reported in November 2004,  some improper payments were made to DMEPOS suppliers that were  committing fraud. For example, in one 2003 criminal case, 20 individuals  in Arizona pleaded guilty to charges of defrauding Medicare of more than  $25 million by creating about 30 sham companies that billed for DMEPOS  items that they did not deliver or that had not been ordered by the  beneficiaries\u2019 physicians. Similarly, in 2004, the government won a civil  suit against 24 DMEPOS suppliers for $366 million as treble damages to  settle charges of falsely billing Medicare for items not needed or delivered  as claimed.", "Because identifying and prosecuting suppliers engaged in fraudulent  activity is time consuming, resource intensive, and costly, CMS tries to  prevent potentially fraudulent entities from entering the Medicare  program. To do so, using its statutory authority, CMS developed  regulations that define the 21 standards that DMEPOS suppliers must meet  to be authorized to bill Medicare for items and services that they provide  to beneficiaries. The 21 standards are intended to help ensure that  suppliers are legitimate businesses as well as properly licensed by the  states in which they operate\u2014and therefore qualified\u2014to provide  DMEPOS items and services. CMS contracts with the National Supplier  Clearinghouse (NSC) to screen potential suppliers and enroll those that  comply with the 21 standards into the Medicare program. NSC verifies  DMEPOS suppliers\u2019 compliance with most of the standards through on-site  inspections and conducts other verification procedures using information  from the applications or gathered during the on-site inspections. Enrolled  suppliers are authorized to bill Medicare, and to retain their billing  privileges must apply for reenrollment and be rescreened every 3 years.  NSC may also verify compliance with the standards at other times\u2014 usually when it receives information about possible noncompliance or  fraud.", "Despite these safeguards, recent prosecutions of fraudulent suppliers that  successfully billed Medicare suggest that there may be weaknesses in  NSC\u2019s efforts to verify compliance with the standards or in the standards  themselves. Due to concerns that such weaknesses may leave the  Medicare program vulnerable to improper billing practices or allow  unqualified suppliers to serve beneficiaries, you asked us to examine the  procedures used by NSC to ensure that DMEPOS suppliers are legitimate  businesses and are qualified to bill Medicare. In this report, we evaluated:  1) NSC\u2019s efforts to verify suppliers\u2019 compliance with the 21 standards,   2) the adequacy of the standards used to screen suppliers, and 3) CMS\u2019s  oversight of NSC\u2019s efforts.", "To evaluate NSC\u2019s efforts to verify suppliers\u2019 compliance with the  standards, we examined NSC\u2019s contract statement of work and its written  procedures. Through this analysis, we determined that checking DMEPOS  suppliers\u2019 state licenses and conducting on-site inspections were two of  the most important verification procedures and we focused our review on  them. We analyzed Medicare DMEPOS claims data for 2003 and 2004 in  four states\u2014Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, and Texas\u2014and information from  NSC\u2019s supplier database. This helped us determine whether suppliers had  the state licenses necessary for the items they billed and whether NSC had  conducted all required on-site inspections. We chose these states because  they have licensure requirements for certain DMEPOS items and have  suppliers with fraudulent Medicare DMEPOS billings. We assessed the  reliability of the 2003 and 2004 claims data from CMS and the NSC supplier  data files by performing electronic testing of required data elements,  reviewing existing information about the data and the systems that  produced them, and interviewing CMS and NSC officials knowledgeable  about the data. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable to  address the issues in this report. We also accompanied NSC staff on  supplier on-site inspections and had our Forensic Audits and Special  Investigations staff investigate selected suppliers and companies  associated with them in Florida and Texas.", "To determine the adequacy of the 21 standards to screen suppliers, we  compared them to certain standards applicable to government contracting  and for participating as Medicaid DMEPOS suppliers in California and  Florida. Further, we analyzed appeals from suppliers that had their  supplier numbers denied or revoked to better understand their infractions  and obtained documentation on criminal cases of suppliers that had  defrauded Medicare or were under active investigation. We interviewed  fraud inspectors at NSC and in the Department of Health and Human  Services Office of Inspector General (OIG), as well as DMEPOS suppliers  and their representatives. To assess CMS\u2019s oversight of NSC, we reviewed  the agency\u2019s written evaluation procedures, evaluation reports, and other  documents related to the agency\u2019s oversight. In addition, we interviewed  NSC and CMS officials about NSC\u2019s efforts to verify compliance, the  adequacy of the standards, and CMS\u2019s oversight of NSC.

Under the schedules, Medicare pays 80 percent,  and the beneficiary pays the balance, of either the actual charge submitted  by the supplier or the fee schedule amount, whichever is less.

For  example, the standards require suppliers to have a physical facility on an  appropriate site that is accessible to beneficiaries and to CMS, with stated  business hours clearly posted. CMS established the requirement for having  an appropriate physical facility in December 2000 after investigators  discovered fraudulent suppliers without fixed locations claiming vans or  station wagons as their place of business or using mail drop boxes to  receive Medicare payments for items they billed but never delivered.  Among other things, the standards also require suppliers to:    comply with applicable federal and state regulatory requirements,  including state licensure, when providing DMEPOS items or services;    maintain inventory on site or off site, or available through valid contracts  with other companies not excluded from doing business with the federal  government or its health care programs; and    obtain comprehensive liability insurance.", "The 21 supplier standards also prohibit certain practices.

For example, when on site the inspectors  are expected to check that the supplier has all the valid occupation and  business licenses required by its state and has a comprehensive liability  insurance policy. The NSC analyst is expected to check that the supplier  has all the state licenses that it would need to provide the items it  disclosed in its application. The NSC analyst also is expected to contact  the insurance underwriter to ensure that the supplier\u2019s policy is valid, and  the post office to make sure the supplier\u2019s address is listed.

For example, the  standard that requires suppliers to furnish NSC with complete and  accurate information on the application and notify NSC of any changes  within 30 days is verified through checking the accuracy of the suppliers\u2019  disclosures of information for other standards\u2014such as ownership and  the appropriateness of the physical facility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "On-site Inspection Procedures", "paragraphs": ["The majority of on-site inspections are conducted by more than 380 field  representatives of Overland Solutions, Inc.

Further, although on-site inspections play a key role in  verifying suppliers\u2019 compliance with the 21 standards, we estimate that  NSC did not conduct more than 600 required on-site inspections and its  inspection procedures have limitations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NSC\u2019s Procedures to Verify State Licenses Have Gaps", "paragraphs": ["NSC does not have an effective means of identifying suppliers that violate  the standard to have appropriate state licensure for the items they provide  to beneficiaries. This is partly because CMS\u2019s requirements are inadequate  to assure an effective process and partly because NSC does not have  effective procedures that are consistently followed. To determine whether  it needs to verify a supplier\u2019s license, NSC relies on the information the  supplier provides\u2014in enrollment or reenrollment applications\u2014regarding  the items or services the supplier intends to provide to Medicare  beneficiaries. Suppliers are required to certify on their applications that  they will notify CMS of any changes to the information they provided on  the form. However, if the supplier fills out the application incorrectly or  dishonestly and does not provide a license during an on-site inspection,  NSC would not verify whether the supplier has all the licenses needed in  its state. We also found that NSC did not consistently resolve  discrepancies or omissions in the information provided by suppliers\u2014 such as not forwarding a copy of a needed state license\u2013-before issuing  suppliers billing numbers. Further, even though suppliers may change the  items they supply, CMS\u2019s contract requires NSC to verify licensure only  during enrollment and does not require verification at any later time, such  as during reenrollment. Thus, even if a supplier begins to bill for items that  require a state license and discloses this information during reenrollment,  CMS does not require NSC to check the supplier\u2019s state licenses. Further,  CMS does not require NSC to recheck suppliers prior to reenrollment to  ensure that the supplier\u2019s license has not lapsed. Finally, CMS has not  required NSC to verify licensure after enrollment by routinely comparing a  supplier\u2019s actual billing history against the DMEPOS items and services  originally disclosed on the supplier\u2019s application. Without such a check,  CMS lacks assurance that suppliers are billing only for items they  disclosed to NSC and for which NSC has verified a license.", "As a result of these gaps, Medicare paid suppliers when NSC had not  verified their licenses, including some suppliers that lacked the  appropriate license. As table 1 shows, by analyzing 2004 DMEPOS claims  data, we found 121 suppliers in Florida, Louisiana, and Texas that were  each paid at least $1,000 by Medicare for oxygen services, even though  they should not have billed for them. These suppliers either had not  informed NSC that they would be billing for oxygen, did not provide NSC  with the appropriate state license to verify, or both. Therefore, these  suppliers were not in compliance with the 21 standards. In total, these  suppliers were paid almost $6 million by Medicare. When we checked with  the three states, we found that 22 of these suppliers did not have a license  to provide oxygen in their states in 2004. These unlicensed suppliers were  paid $231,730 in 2004 by Medicare for oxygen on behalf of beneficiaries. In  addition, we verified licensure with the respective states for a sample of  the suppliers that had disclosed to NSC their intention to bill for oxygen  and had been paid at least $1,000 by Medicare for this service. Through  this process, we identified 7 more suppliers that did not have the required  state license to provide oxygen services in 2004.", "Similarly, in 2003 and 2004, Medicare paid prosthetics and custom- fabricated orthotics claims submitted by suppliers that did not both  disclose to NSC that they would supply these items and provide a copy of  their licenses. Thus, they should not have been allowed to bill Medicare  for these items. We found 28 suppliers in Illinois and Texas that were paid  a total of about $197,000 in 2004 for prosthetics and custom-fabricated  orthotics even though they should not have been billing for these items.", "Routinely comparing suppliers\u2019 billing to the information they report on  the enrollment or reenrollment application regarding the items and  services they intend to provide might have avoided some of the improper  prosthetics and orthotics payments that occurred in Florida. In this state,  Medicare payments for prosthetics and custom-fabricated orthotics  inexplicably tripled in 1 year\u2014from about $32.5 million in 2003 to almost  $107.0 million in 2004. As figure 1 shows, most of the increase was in  payments to suppliers that did not disclose to NSC that they intended to  provide these items. In 2004, the 73 suppliers that did not disclose the  intention to provide prosthetics or orthotics were paid more than   $56.3 million. These 73 suppliers were paid more than the amount paid to  the 262 suppliers that had informed NSC that they would provide these  items. The DME regional carrier has established about $16.3 million as  overpaid to 70 of the 73 suppliers, but has collected less than $2.3 million  plus interest payments of $60,820, as of April 21, 2005. Investigative staff  at the Region C DME regional carrier informed us that at least 46 of the 73  suppliers are currently under active investigation for health care fraud.", "When NSC reviewed each case we identified of suppliers that billed for  oxygen or prosthetics and custom-fabricated orthotics without disclosing  the intention to do so, its analysis revealed several types of problems with  its processing of suppliers\u2019 applications. For example, in Florida, for one  case that we identified, the supplier had not correctly filled out the  application to disclose the intention of providing prosthetics and custom- fabricated orthotics but had given NSC a copy of its state license. In two  cases, the supplier disclosed the intention of providing prosthetics and  custom-fabricated orthotics, but did not give NSC a copy of its state  license to review. Despite the discrepancies in the information provided by  suppliers, NSC enrolled or reenrolled these suppliers. In three cases, the  supplier disclosed the intention to provide prosthetics and custom- fabricated orthotics and gave NSC a copy of its license, but NSC staff did  not update their information appropriately in the supplier database.", "During this engagement, we discussed with CMS NSC\u2019s weaknesses in  verifying suppliers\u2019 licenses. CMS officials acknowledged that the law  requires CMS to restrict Medicare payment of prosthetics and certain  custom-fabricated orthotics to those supplied by a qualified practitioner  and fabricated by a qualified practitioner or supplier. The law defines  qualified practitioners as a physician; an orthotist or a prosthetist who is  licensed, certified, or has credentials and qualifications approved by the  Secretary of Health and Human Services; or a qualified physical therapist  or occupational therapist. The law defines qualified suppliers as entities  accredited by the American Board of Certification in Orthotics and  Prosthetics, Inc., the Board for Orthotist/Prosthetist Certification, or a  program approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. CMS is  in the process of developing proposed regulations that would further  define qualified practitioners and suppliers of prosthetics and certain  custom-fabricated orthotics on a national level. As an interim step, as of  October 3, 2005, CMS will be requiring its DME regional carriers to put  edits in their payment systems to deny claims for prosthetics and certain  custom-fabricated orthotics submitted by any suppliers that are not  qualified, or do not have qualified practitioners on staff, in the states that  currently require licensure or certification. CMS indicated that these two  actions should help address the problem of unlicensed suppliers billing for  prosthetics and custom-fabricated orthotics. However, if NSC does not  resolve discrepancies in the information provided by suppliers to have an  accurate supplier database, the DME regional carriers will not have  accurate information for approving or denying prosthetics and certain  custom-fabricated orthotics claims. Further, the agency has not restricted  payments for any other items that require state licensure\u2014such as oxygen.  Nor has it taken action to prevent payments to suppliers that have violated  the standard for accurate disclosure of application information by billing  for items they have not disclosed to NSC\u2014whether or not a license is  required in their states to provide these items.", "CMS has recently added another requirement for verifying licensure and  other certifications. During this evaluation, we pointed out to CMS staff  that the agency\u2019s contract with NSC was not specific about whether a  license close to its expiration date when submitted to NSC should be  rechecked to ensure the supplier had renewed it. CMS was developing a  new statement of work for NSC and as a result of our discussion, the new  statement of work requires NSC to follow up to ensure renewal of  licenses, insurance policies, and certifications submitted within 60 days of  expiration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NSC Has Not Conducted All of the Routine On-site Inspections Required to Verify Standards", "paragraphs": ["NSC has not conducted the routine on-site inspections to verify supplier  standards for all the DMEPOS suppliers that CMS requires it to inspect.

We also estimate that NSC  conducted on-site inspections for another 3,079 suppliers, but did not  properly record the date of these inspections in its supplier database. As  a result, the database\u2013-with inaccurate or missing information\u2014is not a  reliable management tool for CMS to use in overseeing NSC\u2019s activities.", "NSC may not have conducted all of the required on-site inspections  because of its procedures for determining which suppliers to inspect.  According to NSC\u2019s written procedures, NSC staff use discretion to decide  if an on-site inspection should be conducted prior to the enrollment or  reenrollment of a supplier. In contrast, while CMS\u2019s contract with NSC  exempts certain types of suppliers from routine on-site inspection, it does  not state that NSC should use its discretion to choose whether to inspect  the nonexempt suppliers. CMS staff informed us that NSC is required to  inspect suppliers on initial enrollment and reenrollment, with some  exceptions, and they were unaware that NSC was not conducting all of the  required on-site inspections.", "Furthermore, because CMS\u2019s statements of work in its fiscal year 2004 and  2005 contracts with NSC were not clear about what constitutes a supplier  chain, NSC was not inspecting other suppliers that could be eligible for on- site inspections. NSC did not have to inspect supplier chains with 25 or  more locations. However, the contract did not clearly state whether all 25  locations in the chain have to have active billing numbers. As a result, NSC  was exempting some suppliers in chains that currently have fewer than 25  locations with active billing numbers. We found 484 active suppliers  included in chains with 24 or fewer locations with active billing numbers  as of May 31, 2004. Of these 484 active suppliers, 257 did not have any on- site inspections recorded. For example, NSC indicated to us that no on-site  inspection was needed for Responsive Home Health Care, because it was  included in a chain with 50 locations. However, it was part of a chain with  24 active locations, one location whose billing number had been revoked,  and 25 inactive locations. We recently informed CMS that its contract  language on chain suppliers was not clear, because CMS was developing a  new statement of work for the next NSC contract.

Thus,  the procedures cannot assure suppliers\u2019 legitimacy and qualifications to  serve beneficiaries. First, NSC does not explicitly require its site  inspectors to review a specific number of suppliers\u2019 beneficiary files  during their inspections. NSC told us that inspectors reviewed beneficiary  files, but OSI told us that its inspectors were not required to review the  contents of any beneficiary files.", "Without reviewing beneficiary files, it is unclear how inspectors can verify  suppliers\u2019 compliance with the standard that requires suppliers to maintain  several forms of documentation\u2014including proof of delivery and evidence  of their efforts to educate beneficiaries on how to use the equipment.  Further, reviewing beneficiary files is also helpful to provide support  beyond a written supplier policy that other standards are being met. For  example, a record of equipment maintenance is better proof that the  supplier repairs equipment than a written policy alone. Reviewing  beneficiary files can also enable an inspector to identify potentially  fraudulent patterns of behavior and fabrications designed to cover up lack  of compliance with the 21 standards. For example, NSC investigators told  us that when many beneficiaries using one supplier have the same  physician\u2019s signature on certificates that are required by Medicare to  affirm the medical necessity of certain DMEPOS items, this can be a sign  of fraudulent certifications designed to falsify compliance with Medicare\u2019s  rules. The Region C DME regional carrier is currently investigating a  group of suppliers using the same set of physicians on their certificates.", "Second, NSC does not routinely provide its site inspectors with the dollar  amounts and specific DMEPOS items a supplier billed to Medicare.  Knowing a supplier\u2019s billing history would enable inspectors to determine  whether the supplier\u2019s submitted claims coincide with its inventory,  invoices, delivery tickets, and other documentation in beneficiary files.  When we accompanied NSC inspectors to the physical facilities of several  suppliers about which NSC had suspicions\u2014based on the suppliers\u2019 billing  patterns or their association with other companies under investigation\u2014 the site inspectors did not have data on the billing histories for the  suppliers being inspected. As a result, the inspectors did not know what  types and amounts of inventory, delivery tickets, or invoices they should  expect to find.", "Third, neither CMS nor NSC explicitly requires the site inspectors to verify  a supplier\u2019s inventory when it is stored at, or purchased from, another  location. The inventory standard does not preclude a supplier from storing  inventory off site or relying on another supplier\u2014even a competitor\u2014to  provide its inventory. However, when this occurs, without taking  additional verification steps, NSC would not know whether the off-site  inventory exists or whether the source of inventory is legitimate.  According to the inventory standard, suppliers cannot contract with  companies that are currently excluded from the Medicare program, any  state health programs, or from any other federal procurement or  nonprocurement programs. However, without investigating the companies  that are cited as sources of inventory, NSC would not know if this  standard was being met. NSC\u2019s procedures suggest, but do not require, its  site inspectors to verify off-site inventory locations. Because CMS does not  require NSC to conduct verification of off-site inventory or an assessment  of the company cited as the source of inventory, the current procedures do  not fully verify the inventory standard.", "Inspecting off-site inventory or assessing the validity of inventory  contracts can help pinpoint violations of the standard for inventory and  can also identify potentially fraudulent activities. For instance, when NSC  inspected an address of a company that a supplier gave as its source for  inventory, it discovered an auto body shop at that address. In another  instance, NSC found a vacant building at the address given as a supplier\u2019s  inventory source. These suppliers violated the standards for disclosing  accurate information to NSC and for having inventory or a contract to  procure it. Further, citing a nonexistent source of inventory suggests the  possibility that these suppliers were engaging in fraud. Similarly, groups of  suppliers under investigation for fraud in Houston in 2003 and 2004 were  using the same company as their fictitious source of inventory. SACU  investigators were able to identify other suppliers participating in the same  fraud scheme because the suppliers claimed they were obtaining inventory  from a source that was under investigation.", "Through examining sources of inventory, our investigators identified  companies with questionable financial transactions or owners involved  with suppliers engaged in potentially fraudulent billing. For example, we  identified and investigated one distribution company in Florida that six  suppliers had cited as one of their main sources of inventory. CMS had  denied or revoked the billing numbers for the six suppliers, in part  because they did not appear to have inventory, but five of them were able  to obtain or regain their billing numbers after providing contracts for  inventory from this distribution company. Our investigators found that the  distribution company\u2019s bank had filed 27 separate reports identifying cash  withdrawals from company accounts in amounts ranging from $10,000 to  more than $98,000 over a period of 20 months\u2014almost $1 million in total.  Such cash withdrawals are suspicious because they can indicate attempts  to disguise illicit funds and make them more difficult to track. Even more  suspicious, our investigators found that this distribution company did not  appear to be an active business. Through on-site inspections conducted in  March 2005, we found that two of the addresses given for it were vacant  office/storage units and one was a custom woodworking shop. In June  2005, we investigated a fourth possible address for the company. This  address had been leased by an individual who identified himself in leasing  paperwork as being associated with a \u201cMedical Equipment\u201d business and  was found to be a storage unit littered with debris and a pile of boxes,  many of which were crushed and broken. The investigators saw no posted  signs or activities that would indicate an active business. In addition, of  the five suppliers currently reenrolled in Medicare that cited this source of  inventory, three were under investigation in March 2005 by the Region C  DME regional carrier\u2019s fraud control unit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NSC Is Not Required by Contract to Conduct a Minimum Number of Out- of-cycle On-site Inspections", "paragraphs": ["Out-of-cycle on-site inspections have been effective in identifying  suppliers that are not complying with Medicare\u2019s standards. For example,  during the April 2004 hearing before the Senate Committee on Finance on  the Medicare power wheelchair benefit, the attendees watched a video of  law enforcement surveillance that showed individuals bringing office  equipment and DMEPOS items into an office suite in order to appear to  meet the standards for having an appropriate physical facility and  inventory to pass an on-site inspection. Because the timing of enrollment  and reenrollment inspections are predictable, a supplier intent on  committing fraud can anticipate an enrollment on-site inspection and  create the illusion of legitimacy, fully understanding that an inspector is  not likely to return for 3 years. Out-of-cycle on-site inspections can be so  valuable that we previously recommended that CMS direct NSC to  routinely conduct them for suppliers suspected of billing improperly.  CMS agreed with the recommendation and pointed out the number of out- of-cycle inspections that were being completed. In 2003, NSC conducted  over 600 out-of-cycle inspections and found 306 DMEPOS suppliers not  complying with Medicare\u2019s standards. NSC continued this practice in fiscal  year 2004, conducting over 400 out-of-cycle on-site inspections targeted  specifically at high-volume suppliers that were not part of chains. CMS  has also requested NSC to conduct out-of-cycle on-site inspections in  fiscal year 2005. Nevertheless, NSC\u2019s contract does not explicitly require it  to conduct out-of-cycle on-site inspections.", "Although NSC has conducted out-of-cycle on-site inspections in the last  several years, without becoming an explicit part of its contract, this  activity could be curtailed at any time. We discussed our concerns about  this with CMS staff writing the revised statement of work for a new  contract that is scheduled to be awarded in December 2005. As a result,  CMS included language in the revised statement of work that will  explicitly require the contractor for NSC to conduct random, out-of-cycle  on-site inspections as resources permit.

For  example, federal agencies do not have to contract with companies that  have demonstrated poor performance in the past. In contrast, CMS has  reenrolled suppliers whose billing numbers have been revoked, after they  have demonstrated compliance with the standards\u2014no matter how many  standards they had previously violated. We found cases of suppliers that  had billed improperly and violated standards, reentered the program, and  then began to bill improperly for other items.

Federal agencies can  consider a contractor\u2019s past performance as an indicator of future  performance and require a disclosure of financial and management  information to make their assessment. In addition, after a contract is  awarded, federal agencies can terminate the contract for default or  convenience. Further, for committing certain crimes or not meeting  certain federal requirements, a company may be debarred from receiving  federal contracts, generally for up to 3 years.", "Some state governments have requirements to ensure that Medicaid  suppliers are responsible. For example, California\u2019s Medicaid program  requires DME suppliers to have the administrative and fiscal foundation to  survive as a business, demonstrated by financial records, such as a  business plan, bank statements, and contractual agreements. California  state officials told us that a DME supplier in their state could not meet the  definition of being an established business for the Medicaid program if it  sold power wheelchairs out of a residence, as some Medicare DME  suppliers have done. Similarly, Florida\u2019s Medicaid program requires  suppliers to provide evidence of being a viable, ongoing business. Florida  also requires anyone with 5 percent or greater ownership, and the  manager of the supplier, to be fingerprinted and undergo a criminal  background investigation, because the state will not enroll suppliers with  owners convicted of several types of crimes, such as health care fraud or  patient abuse.", "In contrast, suppliers are not CMS contractors, and CMS\u2019s standards do  not require suppliers to demonstrate that they are responsible based on  their financial, technical, and managerial ability, their integrity, and their  past performance. As a result, suppliers that are not legitimate DMEPOS  businesses have enrolled in Medicare and have been paid millions of  dollars in improper payments without having to demonstrate that they  have the ability and integrity to serve beneficiaries, as the following  examples show.", "For example, in sworn testimony before the Senate Committee on Finance  in April 2004, a witness who pleaded guilty to fraud explained her part in a  $25 million fraud scheme that she and a group of 19 others committed  against the Medicare program. She explained how she was able to set up a  sham company\u2014Mercury Medical Supplies\u2014with $3,000 and obtain a  Medicare billing number, even though she had no prior experience,  expertise, or discernable resources for providing DMEPOS items or  services. From September 2000 to December 2001, when its billing number  was revoked, Medicare paid Mercury Medical Supplies $1,158,482 for  providing DMEPOS items that were falsely billed based on forged  physicians\u2019 prescriptions and were generally not supplied to beneficiaries.  While the Medicare program paid Mercury Medical Supplies over   $1 million but did not inquire into its financial ability to supply DMEPOS  items, one federal agency refused to award a $230,000 contract to a  company with $32,500 in working capital, in part because the agency\u2019s  contracting officer did not think that the company was financially strong  enough to fulfill the contractual obligations.", "Like Mercury Medical Supplies, All-Divine Health Services in Lufkin, Texas  was not a legitimate DMEPOS business, but managed to enroll in Medicare  in December 2002. NSC\u2019s inspector noted on an initial site inspection  report that the owner explained that she was awaiting inventory, which  was why she had none in her storage area prior to enrollment in the  Medicare program. Once enrolled, All-Divine Health Services began to bill  for power wheelchairs, an item for which Medicare pays over $5,000.  However, because of concerns about inappropriate power wheelchair  billing, NSC conducted out-of-cycle on-site inspections of All-Divine and  other power wheelchair suppliers in the area. The site inspector found  evidence of potential fraud, such as altered certificates from physicians  attesting to the beneficiaries\u2019 medical need for the items to be supplied, as  well as violations of Medicare\u2019s standards. Following the out-of-cycle  inspection, CMS found that All-Divine was in violation of four standards,  because it lacked comprehensive liability insurance, lacked a state license  to provide bedding, did not have adequate contracts for inventory, and did  not have adequate provision to repair and service DME. All-Divine\u2019s billing  number was revoked effective August 6, 2003. After the owner pleaded  guilty to conspiracy to commit health care fraud on June 25, 2004, her  lawyer testified that All-Divine\u2019s owner had not understood the intricacies  of proper Medicare billing and had no experience managing a DMEPOS  company. The owner told her lawyer that she did not think she was  committing a crime, although she admitted purchasing paperwork  certifying beneficiaries as needing power wheelchairs and then submitting  claims on their behalf. Her lawyer also testified that the owner stated that  her firm lacked the operational controls to ensure that beneficiaries  actually received the power wheelchairs for which the company billed and  was paid by Medicare. Before its billing number was revoked, All-Divine  was paid over $1.8 million by the program, predominantly for power  wheelchairs not provided as billed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicare Suppliers Do Not Face the Same Penalties for Not Meeting Federal Requirements as Contractors and Medicaid Suppliers", "paragraphs": ["While federal agencies, including CMS, may choose not to conduct  business with companies that lack integrity or perform poorly, and may  disqualify companies from competing for federal contracts, suppliers that  have failed to comply with Medicare\u2019s standards have not lost their billing  privileges for any substantial length of time. Federal agencies can  terminate contracts at their convenience or for default\u2014which is when a  contractor fails to perform the contract. For certain serious violations,  contractors can be debarred from receiving any federal contract, generally  for up to 3 years. Willful failure to perform the terms of a government  contract is a basis for debarment. In addition, apart from debarment,  agencies can refuse to offer new contracts to companies exhibiting  previous performance problems or a lack of integrity in the past. This  may occur after conviction for criminal charges, but sometimes the  refusals follow allegations of wrongdoing. For example, one agency  refused to offer a new contract to a company that had allegedly provided  false certifications in the past. Another agency used the results of  criminal investigative reports as a basis for refusing to offer contracts to  companies.", "Compared with Medicare, the Medicaid programs of California and Florida  put more barriers to reenrollment of problematic suppliers into Medicaid.  For example, California provisionally enrolls new Medicaid providers for  12 to 18 months. During this period, if the provider fails to meet state  requirements, the state agency disenrolls the provider from Medicaid. In  addition, if a provider fails to accurately disclose information, such as the  ownership of the company, California can disenroll the provider from  Medicaid and keep it from reenrolling for 3 years. The California  Medicaid program denies applications from providers under investigation  for criminal offenses. Florida will not reenroll suppliers that have been  excluded from the program. When NSC identifies suppliers that violate  Medicare\u2019s standards, CMS may revoke their billing privileges. However, in  contrast to California and Florida Medicaid, if a supplier can demonstrate  compliance with the 21 standards, CMS readmits it into Medicare unless it  has been otherwise excluded from participating in the program.", "DMEPOS suppliers that have their billing privileges revoked and then later  reenter Medicare are not uncommon. We identified 1,038 DMEPOS  suppliers that lost their billing privileges in 2003, generally for violating  multiple standards. Of these suppliers, 192 were reenrolled in Medicare as  of May 31, 2004, with the average period of suspension lasting about 3  months. None of these suppliers encountered any barrier to enrollment for  violating the standards. Further, when some suppliers that had billed  improperly because they were unlicensed reentered the program, they  resumed improper billing for different types of items.

NSC and CMS  officials agreed that the inventory and physical facility standards are not  specific enough. These standards do not specify the characteristics of an  inventory, or the amount, type, or source of inventory that should be  required for the items or services the supplier intends to provide to  Medicare beneficiaries. According to these officials, the lack of specificity  in the standards has allowed suppliers that were not legitimate companies  to acquire Medicare billing numbers and then defraud the program. NSC  and OIG officials investigating enrolled suppliers with potentially  fraudulent billing reported that many had physical facilities not conducive  to conducting a legitimate DMEPOS business. For example, these  investigators have found multiple suppliers located in close proximity in  small suites in the same building. In addition, they found suppliers in  buildings that were not located where beneficiaries were likely to come  and purchase DMEPOS items. The investigators also reported finding  DMEPOS suppliers operating out of their houses and garages. These  suppliers had few DMEPOS items in stock, but claimed that they had  contracts for acquiring inventory. These documents sometimes lacked the  usual elements of a contract, such as the clear signature of authorized  individuals from both companies and the time period for the contract.  Nevertheless, these suppliers met the current standards.", "In early 2004, based on NSC proposals, CMS drafted new guidance on the  current supplier standards to make them more specific. For example, CMS  added more details to describe what constituted a reasonable amount of  inventory, the elements of an acceptable contract for inventory, and an  appropriate physical facility from which to provide items and services to  Medicare beneficiaries. As of June 2005, CMS had not issued the new  guidance. According to an agency official, some of the revisions have been  incorporated into a proposed regulation under review within the agency.  The official told us that CMS plans to issue other changes through  revisions of Medicare guidance manuals, once the proposed regulation had  been issued.", "In addition to the new guidance, provisions of the MMA that require CMS  to develop quality standards for DMEPOS suppliers and competitive  bidding, when implemented, could enhance the agency\u2019s ability to screen  suppliers. The MMA requires CMS to develop quality standards for all  DMEPOS suppliers and to select one or more independent accreditation  organizations that will apply these standards to determine if suppliers are  meeting them. CMS has not finished its development of the quality  standards, so it is not clear whether the standards will incorporate  requirements for suppliers to demonstrate that they have the integrity and  capability to perform their functions analogous to the standards for  federal contractors. In addition, the MMA requires CMS to establish  competitive bidding among suppliers for DME, supplies, off-the-shelf  orthotics, and enteral nutrients and related equipment and supplies in at  least 10 of the largest metropolitan areas by 2007 and in 80 of these areas  by 2009. The MMA will require suppliers chosen by competitive bidding to  comply with the quality standards that are being developed for all  DMEPOS suppliers as well as new financial standards to be specified by  the Secretary. However, competitive bidding will be limited to certain  DMEPOS items and localities, so not all Medicare DMEPOS suppliers will  be held to the new financial standards.

Furthermore, CMS did not know that, in contrast to its requirements,  NSC\u2019s procedures allow its staff to use discretion in selecting which  suppliers received on-site inspections. In addition, CMS did not recognize  gaps in NSC\u2019s verification of suppliers\u2019 state licenses and as a result,  Medicare paid suppliers whose licenses the contractor did not verify.", "During our review, we found weaknesses in the methods CMS uses to  oversee its contractor that could lead to the agency not recognizing  problems in the verification process. CMS evaluates NSC\u2019s performance  primarily through an annual inspection. During this inspection, CMS  analyzes a small random sample of supplier files to determine, for  instance, whether NSC is conducting on-site inspections, processing  enrollment applications, and handling appeals of denied or revoked billing  privileges in accordance with its requirements. The analysis of NSC\u2019s  supplier files is CMS\u2019s most direct means of assessing NSC\u2019s efforts to  screen and enroll suppliers; however, we determined that CMS\u2019s past  practice of basing NSC\u2019s performance on a sample selected from a single  quarter of the year may not be adequate. NSC\u2019s performance might differ  during the quarters in which it was not reviewed. CMS also recognized  problems with basing its review on a single quarter, and in October 2004  began to institute quarterly reviews of a sample of supplier files. However,  if any problems are uncovered, the sample sizes examined by CMS are too  small to be used as a means of oversight, relative to the number of  application files processed and other type of files reviewed. During fiscal  year 2004, NSC processed more than 58,000 supplier applications for  enrollment or reenrollment. To evaluate NSC\u2019s efforts to enroll suppliers  during its fiscal year 2004 inspection, CMS examined a sample of 10  approved supplier applications, as well as 10 denied and 10 returned  applications. To evaluate NSC\u2019s efforts to reenroll suppliers, CMS  examined a sample of 20 approved reenrollments. If CMS uncovered any  problems, it would need to select a much larger sample to determine if the  problems were systemic, a step that is not indicated in the evaluation  protocol.", "CMS\u2019s evaluation of NSC\u2019s performance is focused primarily on whether  the suppliers\u2019 applications are filled out and processed correctly\u2014not  whether NSC has conducted the required verification tasks thoroughly.  For example, while NSC may have a supplier site inspection form with the  boxes checked to indicate that a supplier is complying with various  standards\u2014such as the one to maintain documentation of delivery of  items to beneficiaries\u2014CMS cannot know from reviewing the form if the  inspector checking that supplier actually examined any beneficiary files.", "CMS also oversees NSC through reviewing monthly reports from NSC, but  this does not provide information on the thoroughness of NSC\u2019s screening  and enrollment efforts. Instead, CMS reviews the monthly reports to  monitor NSC\u2019s workload\u2014including the number of enrollment and  reenrollment applications received, pending, approved, and returned; the  timeliness in processing applications; the number of denials and  revocations; and the timeliness with which NSC handles inquiries from  suppliers. This monitoring is important to ensure that NSC is managing its  workload, but does not inform CMS as to how well NSC performs these  activities.", "Finally, while CMS has established performance goals in NSC\u2019s contract  related primarily to processing supplier applications and managing other  aspects of NSC\u2019s workload\u2014such as handling inquiries\u2014it has not  established performance goals connected to effectiveness of the screening  or fraud prevention efforts. CMS uses both the annual inspection and the  monthly reports to measure NSC\u2019s performance against goals established  in its contract. These goals are linked to timeliness in processing suppliers\u2019  applications, appeals, and inquiries. For example, according to its  contract, NSC must    process 90 percent of all applications and reenrollments accurately within  60 calendar days of receipt and 99 percent of applications within 120  calendar days of receipt,    process 90 percent of appeals accurately within 60 calendar days of    answer 85 percent of supplier telephone calls within the first 60 seconds.", "These performance measures do not indicate the success of NSC or its  SACU in identifying noncompliant and fraudulent suppliers. Further,  CMS\u2019s contract requires NSC to maintain a SACU, but the contract does  not establish outcomes expected from this unit. Similarly, in its annual  inspection, CMS does not evaluate the SACU\u2019s efforts\u2014whether, for  instance, the SACU has adequately educated suppliers, adequately  supervised the quality of on-site inspections, or analyzed supplier  enrollment and billing data so that NSC can identify suppliers for  additional inspections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["CMS is responsible for assuring that Medicare beneficiaries have access to  the equipment, supplies, and services they need, and at the same time, for  protecting the program from abusive billing and fraud.

Through that  assessment, we determined that its procedures to check licensure and  conduct on-site inspections of suppliers were critical to verifying  compliance with the standards and we focused our evaluation on these  procedures. To better understand the on-site inspection process, we  accompanied NSC officials as they conducted on-site inspections of 12  suppliers in Maryland during August 9 and 10, 2004. In addition, to test the  effectiveness of the licensure verification, we analyzed Medicare durable  medical equipment, orthotics, prosthetics, and supplies (DMEPOS) claims  data for 2003 and 2004 from Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, and Texas  and  NSC\u2019s active supplier data file to determine whether suppliers had the  licenses necessary for items billed.

To assess the reliability of  the 2003 and 2004 claims from CMS and NSC\u2019s supplier data files, we  performed electronic testing of required data elements, reviewed existing  information about the data and the systems that produced them, and  interviewed CMS and NSC officials knowledgeable about the data. We  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  this report. We also contacted Florida, Texas, and Louisiana to determine  which of the suppliers that had not disclosed to NSC that they would be  providing oxygen and were paid at least $1,000 for oxygen claims in 2004  actually had the needed state licenses. In addition, we also checked with  these states to determine whether a small sample of suppliers that had  disclosed the intention to bill for oxygen, and were paid at least $1,000 for  oxygen claims in 2004, had the needed state licenses. For custom- fabricated orthotics and prosthetics, we were not able to confirm whether  the suppliers that had not disclosed to NSC that they would be providing  these items and were paid at least $1,000 for such claims in 2004 in  Florida, Illinois, and Texas had the proper state licenses, because those  states license individuals to be allowed to supply these items, not  companies. To evaluate procedures for on-site inspections, we analyzed  on-site inspection instructions and the standards and interviewed on-site  inspectors and officials in NSC and Overland Solutions, Inc. We  investigated two companies cited as sources of inventory by two groups of  Florida and Texas suppliers that had their billing privileges denied or  revoked, in part because of inventory issues, and also investigated those  suppliers.", "To evaluate the adequacy of the 21 supplier standards, we compared them  to the requirements for government contractors and those imposed by the  California and Florida Medicaid program on suppliers. In addition, we  analyzed cases of revocations that had been appealed to CMS in 2004 to  determine if weaknesses in the standards were leading to suppliers with  questionable billing practices being reinstated in the program. We also  obtained documentation on cases of suppliers that had defrauded  Medicare and interviewed fraud inspectors at NSC and in the Department  of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General to develop  insight into the problems that they saw with the 21 standards. We also  interviewed NSC and CMS officials and individuals from the following  organizations: the American Association for Homecare, the American  Orthotic and Prosthetic Association, Hoveround, National Association for  Home Care and Hospice, Power Mobility Coalition, and a representative  from the National Supplier Clearinghouse\u2019s Advisory Council.", "To evaluate CMS\u2019s oversight of NSC, we considered the information we  had gathered to answer the previous questions. We reviewed CMS\u2019s  written procedures used to evaluate NSC and other documents related to  CMS\u2019s oversight. We also discussed CMS\u2019s oversight with CMS and NSC  officials.", "Our work was conducted from June 2004 to September 2005 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Medicare\u2019s 21 Standards for Suppliers and NSC\u2019s Procedures to Verify Their Compliance", "paragraphs": ["Suppliers of durable medical equipment (DME), prosthetics, orthotics, and  supplies must meet 21 standards in order to obtain and retain their  Medicare billing privileges.
