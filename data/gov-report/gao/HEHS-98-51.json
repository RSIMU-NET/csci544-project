Most care is provided in 115 hospitals and 471 clinics\u2014called military treatment facilities\u2014operated by the Army, Navy, and Air Force worldwide. This direct delivery health system is supplemented by DOD-funded care provided in civilian facilities. In fiscal year 1997, DOD spent about $12 billion for direct care and about $3.5 billion for civilian facility care.", "In the late 1980s, in response to increasing health care costs and uneven access to care, DOD initiated, with congressional authority, a series of demonstrations to evaluate alternative health care delivery approaches. On the basis of this experience, DOD designed TRICARE as its managed health care program. TRICARE is intended to ensure a high-quality, consistent health care benefit; preserve choice of health care providers for beneficiaries; improve access to care; and contain health care costs. TRICARE is designed to give beneficiaries a choice among three approaches to health care: TRICARE Prime, an HMO-like option; TRICARE Extra, which is similar to a preferred provider option; and TRICARE Standard, a fee-for-service-type option.", "The TRICARE program uses regional managed care support contracts to augment its MTFs. The contractors\u2019 responsibilities include developing civilian provider networks, performing utilization management functions,processing claims, and providing such support functions as beneficiary education and enrollment. The 11 TRICARE regions in the United States are covered by seven managed care support contracts, and health care delivery has commenced under five of the contracts (see fig. 1).", "The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) (hereafter referred to as Health Affairs) sets TRICARE policy and has overall responsibility for the program. The managed care support contractors are overseen by the TRICARE Support Office (TSO), a part of Health Affairs. The Army, Navy, and Air Force Surgeons General have authority over the MTFs in their respective services. To coordinate MTF and contractor services, each region is headed by a \u201clead agent,\u201d which is led by a designated MTF commander and supported by a joint-service staff. The lead agent responds to direction from Health Affairs, but the services retain authority and control over their medical facilities and personnel.

But retirees\u2019 satisfaction generally remained higher than that of active duty family members in both surveys. Moreover, active duty family members\u2019 satisfaction was slightly higher in regions in which TRICARE had been implemented than in the other regions. In the 1994-95 survey, retirees and their family members in TRICARE regions reported higher satisfaction than their counterparts in the other regions, but in 1996 the two results were about the same, as shown in figure 2.", "While overall satisfaction levels were fairly high, satisfaction with certain aspects of military health care was somewhat lower, according to the 1996 annual survey (see fig. 3).", "DOD survey officials told us it was too soon to use these annual survey results to assess TRICARE because the program is new and not yet implemented nationwide. Also, they said two surveys constitute an insufficient basis from which to identify trends, and several more annual surveys are needed of the fully implemented program before the results can be used as an overall system performance measure. Nonetheless, the lead official for DOD\u2019s survey efforts told us of uses already being made of the annual survey\u2019s results. For example, the 1994-95 results showed that beneficiaries were more satisfied with civilian care than with military care, which led Health Affairs and the service Surgeon General offices to design a survey targeting MTF outpatients\u2019 perceptions of the care they received. (This survey will be discussed further below.) Also, in implementing its new Enrollment Based Capitation financing approach, DOD is using the annual survey\u2019s health status measures and results to adjust the various MTF enrollee populations for their projected health care needs.

The MTF outpatient survey was also based on survey questions developed, tested, and used by the private sector, which has facilitated comparisons of MTF and civilian care satisfaction levels. Health Affairs provides detailed survey results reports to MTFs and summary reports to lead agents and service commands.", "DOD provided us with April, May, and June 1997 MTF outpatient survey results for each service and region. The results measure satisfaction on a 5-point scale in three areas: (1) access to care for a single visit, (2) quality of care during that visit, and (3) staff interaction with the survey respondent during the visit.

Like the private sector, DOD officials told us they use this information to identify problems and gauge performance of various MTF services. We obtained many examples of beneficiary-initiated complaints and other comments covering a host of issues. However, because beneficiary comments were not consistently documented, the examples we obtained cannot be viewed as representative of all TRICARE beneficiary-initiated feedback. Nevertheless, the examples do illustrate the types of issues military health care beneficiaries choose to raise. Detailed descriptions of feedback-related processes are provided in appendix III.", "Because neither DOD nor the services require MTFs to follow a standard procedure for tracking and reporting beneficiary comments, MTFs are free to establish their own feedback systems. As a result, the MTFs we visited have differing ways of obtaining, documenting, and analyzing beneficiary-initiated feedback. The MTFs also have different ways of reporting their feedback to MTF management and others within the facility. We also found, with few exceptions, that most reporting of feedback to entities outside MTFs is not done systematically.", "Lead agents also capture information on beneficiary-initiated concerns in varying ways. Each of the three lead agents we visited has systems according to which its MTFs and the regional managed care support contractor report certain TRICARE-related issues to the lead agent, including issues emanating from beneficiary comments. All three lead agents also track in some way the beneficiary feedback-related issues that they learn of. Lead agent officials told us that they consider the complaints they receive to be a valuable source of information about possible problems in their regions. None of the offices provide formal feedback-related issues reports to Health Affairs or the Surgeons General, although all have a variety of informal ways of reporting issues to them.", "Health Affairs, the Surgeons General, and TSO also receive beneficiary feedback and have their own procedures for handling it. These offices maintain tracking systems for the beneficiary feedback they receive, but these systems primarily track who is responsible for handling the case and response timeliness, not the specific categories the beneficiary comments fall into. Staff in these offices told us that they use the complaints they receive as indicators of possible TRICARE problems.", "Representatives of both of the managed care support contractors we contacted told us that they extensively track complaints and use them to identify system problems, and that their TRICARE tracking systems mirror the systems they use for their commercial health plans. While the managed care support contracts require periodic reports that include beneficiary feedback volume and response timeliness, DOD does not require the contractors to report their complaint tracking results to the government. Yet, managed care support contractor officials told us that they consider systematically tracked beneficiary feedback and rigorous analysis of the root causes of members\u2019 complaints to be hallmarks of a customer service-oriented managed care plan.", "Officials at the various MHS organizations we visited told us how their complaint tracking procedures have led to problem identification and elimination. For example, one MTF\u2019s deputy commander told us that he saw an increase in \u201cstaff attitude\u201d complaints from patients at his facility. In response, he required all facility staff to take customer service training. In another case, lead agent officials told us how their tracking of complaints indicated that TRICARE Prime enrollees were being required to drive more than an hour for an MTF\u2019s specialty care, though this exceeded the TRICARE requirement. The lead agent staff found that driving time to the MTF routinely exceeded 1 hour because of heavy traffic in parts of the MTF\u2019s catchment area. As a result, the staff arranged for beneficiaries in those areas to go instead to closer network providers.", "Further, one contractor learned through complaints that civilian providers were referring beneficiaries to collection agencies because of unpaid bills. The contractor identified a number of problems caused by beneficiary and provider mistakes, which led to improved beneficiary and provider education efforts. This investigation also identified a DOD policy that was causing claims to be inappropriately denied. When a beneficiary needs medical care that cannot be provided at an MTF, the facility can complete a \u201cnonavailability statement\u201d certifying that the facility does not have the required resources to provide the care needed and authorizing the beneficiary to receive the care from a civilian provider. The contractor\u2019s investigation found that when the computer record erroneously showed that a nonavailability statement had not been issued, DOD\u2019s policy was to not accept a paper copy of such a statement.

NCQA officials told us that no one system is prescribed for managing member complaints.

Moreover, with a consistent approach to tracking and reporting feedback, MHS and contractor personnel could put the complaints they receive into a systemwide perspective, even if they were tracking complaints locally. Further, with standardized tracking and reporting, personnel throughout the MHS could identify trends beyond those at their own location.

Because of DOD\u2019s merged responsibilities, which are usually held by separate entities in the private sector, the checks and balances that exist in civilian business relationships do not exist. For example, a civilian employer that receives numerous complaints about a hospital in the health plan\u2019s network can insist that the plan either drop the hospital or lose the employer\u2019s business.

Both DOD\u2019s hospitals and DOD\u2019s contractors send patients to each other for some care, but neither has real financial or other authority to control what the other does.

DOD requires managed care support contractors to have a toll-free phone line for beneficiaries, and much of the feedback that the contractors receive comes in over these lines.", "Officials throughout DOD told us that they consider it important that complaints be resolved at as low a level as possible. They said that people who register dissatisfaction should not be \u201cgiven the runaround\u201d in the process of trying to find someone to listen to and deal with their complaint. This emphasis is consistent with the National Performance Review report on the importance of empowering front-line employees to provide \u201con-the-spot, just-in-time resolution of  problems.\u201d"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Military Treatment Facilities", "paragraphs": ["Each MTF we visited had procedures in place enabling beneficiaries to comment directly to MTF staff while at the facility. Much of this feedback is in the form of oral comments made directly to MTF staff members or through comment cards or forms beneficiaries fill out. MTF officials told us that they also receive comments through phone calls, letters, and electronic mail.", "The MTFs differed in their approaches to handling beneficiary comments. Some MTFs had designated personnel throughout the facility who served as patient representatives or patient advocates. These staff were tasked with receiving beneficiary comments about their own clinic or department. MTFs with patient representatives at this level also had a senior patient representative whose job was to be available to any beneficiaries with comments, whether concerning a particular facility area, the whole facility, or military health care in general. Other facilities did not have formally designated patient representatives at clinics or departments but, instead, had a single patient representative office where beneficiaries could go to make comments.", "Procedures for documenting beneficiary feedback also varied among the MTFs visited. For example, some MTFs entered everything the patient representatives received into a central patient feedback database, and some also kept hard copy documentation of the comments that came in. Another MTF had a system that required oral comments to be documented in writing. Staff kept hard copies of both those comments and the ones that came in through comment cards but did not enter the comments into a database. Another MTF did little or no documentation of oral or written beneficiary feedback. The head patient representative at that facility said that he did not have enough time to both handle patient concerns and prepare documentation, so he opted to spend time with patients instead of doing paperwork.", "Also, wide differences existed in how much the MTFs analyzed beneficiary feedback for trends. For example, some used the categorized patient feedback in their central database to prepare regular feedback trend reports. They analyzed how the number of complaints per type changed over time and which hospital areas were generating more complaints. Other MTFs did little or no formal trend analysis of beneficiary comments, although staff members at these facilities told us that they relied on their experience with feedback at the facility over time to notice trends.", "We also found variation in how the feedback tracking results were reported to MTF management or to others in the facility. For example, some MTFs distributed formal feedback reports on trends to senior MTF management, as well as reports about department-level feedback to supervisory staff in various areas of the facility. At another facility, however, internal reporting of patient feedback consisted of oral input from the head patient representative to a senior management committee, with no supporting documentation.", "MTF patient representatives told us that these systems constitute the formal structure that is in place to receive feedback, but that other avenues exist. For example, they said that beneficiaries can speak to staff members throughout the MTF if they have concerns and that many do. People can speak with their doctor or other staff members in the various clinics, or they can go to different parts of the MTF\u2019s administrative structure, such as the managed care office or the MTF commander\u2019s office. Even at MTFs with extensive feedback documentation and trend analysis systems, staff members noted that some of the feedback that comes in to staff other than patient representatives does not make it into the MTFs\u2019 systems. For example, one officer in an MTF command section told us that he hears beneficiary complaints and handles them but does not typically report what he hears to the central MTF patient representative office that maintains a database of patient complaints.", "MTF officials told us that they do not systematically report most beneficiary feedback to Health Affairs or the service Surgeons General. Officials at MTFs and other MHS offices told us that MTF staff are expected to resolve problems that arise, whether identified through beneficiary complaints or not. Health Affairs and the service Surgeons General expect to be brought in only to handle issues that the MTF cannot. While such issues do get referred to the higher levels, the officials told us that information about problems solved locally normally do not. The exception was regular reporting of contractor-related issues to lead agents by MTFs.", "One exception to the lack of systematic reporting of beneficiary feedback is found in the Southern California Region. MTFs in that region are part of a program led by the lead agent to systematically report to the lead agent certain types of beneficiary comments. Lead agent officials told us that MTFs in the region have been asked to send to the lead agent the beneficiary complaints made to the MTF concerning the managed care support contractor. For example, if a beneficiary tells the patient representative about an enrollment card problem or a problem getting contractor network care, the MTF will send a copy of the complaint to the lead agent, where it will be centrally tracked, as well as notify the managed care support contractor of the problem. The regional managed care support contractor has also been asked to do the same for MTF-related complaints made to it. Lead agent officials told us that they hope to expand this project to include all regional complaints in the future.", "Further, MTFs have systems in place for documenting and reporting clinical health care quality issues, some of which come to light through patient complaints. To maintain JCAHO accreditation, MTFs must have systems in place to track clinical care quality issues. MTF officials told us that such complaints, along with other clinical quality issues identified at the facility, are documented and analyzed for trends and become the subject of detailed review by special committees as well as by MTF risk management and legal office staff."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lead Agents", "paragraphs": ["Some beneficiary concerns come directly to the lead agents through letters or phone calls, others come through oral or written reports from regional MTF staffs and the contractors, and still others are referred to the lead agent by other offices.", "The three lead agents we visited had issues tracking systems that tracked, among other things, concerns that came to light through complaints from beneficiaries. The Southeast Region lead agent maintained a central log of complaints that came directly to the lead agent as well as complaints forwarded to the lead agent by other DOD offices (including priority correspondence complaints); complaints about MTFs forwarded by the region\u2019s managed care support contractor; and certain complaints received by MTFs in the region. Southeast Region officials told us that beneficiary complaints about managed care support contractor functions were frequently the subject of discussion during regular telephone meetings between contracting officer\u2019s technical representatives (COTR) at the region\u2019s MTFs and lead agent staff. Lead agent officials in the Southeast Region also told us that they used the system to track issues to ensure they were being properly addressed and resolved, but that they did not organize the issues by category or analyze for trends over time.", "In the Southern California Region, the lead agent had implemented a system specifically to track complaints. The system tracked complaints (1) received by MTFs in the region if they concerned the managed care support contractor, (2) received by the managed care support contractor if they concerned an MTF, and (3) received by the lead agent directly. The lead agent staff tracked and analyzed for trends the complaints in this system by category of complaint. Lead agent staff told us that they want to expand the system to include more types of complaints in the future.", "The Southwest Region lead agent asked the COTRs at the MTFs to perform a number of contractor oversight functions and to report the results monthly to the lead agent. Some of the issues that the COTR reports raised were related to beneficiary complaints. The lead agent staff then compiled the issues raised by the various monthly reports of COTRs into a single letter to the region\u2019s managed care support contractor asking for issue-by-issue responses.", "Lead agent officials in the three regions we visited told us that they use the complaints that they receive to identify and proactively deal with issues before they become worse, as well as to monitor overall TRICARE performance in their region. Lead agent staff said that when their beneficiary complaint tracking indicates a possible problem, they discuss the issue with the managed care support contractor, MTF staff members, or both to help identify the cause and discuss possible solutions. Lead agent staff also said that by tracking complaints they are better able to identify the root causes of problems in ways that surveys are not, although surveys can, on the other hand, indicate how well DOD is fixing the problems identified through complaints.", "Lead agent officials told us they did not systematically report beneficiary feedback-related issues to Health Affairs or the Surgeons General. They said, however, that a number of regularly scheduled video, telephone, and face-to-face meetings take place with Health Affairs, service Surgeons General, and contractor staff and that at these meetings some issues discussed may have emanated from beneficiary comments.

Others are from beneficiaries who simultaneously send their complaint letters to as many places as possible.", "Health Affairs, service Surgeons General, and TSO officials told us their organizations have their own tracking systems for beneficiary concerns that come to the attention of their respective offices. Health Affairs officials told us they enter all beneficiary feedback they receive\u2014both directly sent and referred\u2014into a tracking system that notes the receipt date, which staffer was assigned to handle the concern, the response due date, and a short issue description. Officials told us that the system\u2019s purpose is to track response timeliness and not to track or establish trends in issues by category. Reports from the Health Affairs tracking system show that the system\u2019s issue descriptions are not specific enough for tracking or identifying trends in issues by category.", "Service Surgeon General office officials described similar systems for tracking the timeliness of the offices\u2019 responses to beneficiary feedback.", "Also, staff from the Navy told us that they had begun to track selected beneficiary concerns by type.", "TSO also tracks beneficiary issues. According to officials there, a large number of phone calls and letters come into that office and are centrally tracked in a computer database. However, officials also said that the categorization system they use puts issues only into broad categories\u2014such as \u201cclaims\u201d or \u201cpolicy questions\u201d\u2014which limits the usefulness of the system for tracking issues by type.", "Beneficiaries can also register their complaints with the Army or Navy Inspector General. These Inspectors General deal mostly with misconduct allegations but, on occasion, they receive health care service-related complaints. Officials at Inspector General offices told us they track beneficiary concerns by nature of issue but report health care issues only on an ad hoc basis.

The representatives told us that their beneficiary feedback tracking systems are similar to the systems used by their parent companies\u2019 civilian health care operations.
