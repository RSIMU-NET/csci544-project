Reforestation and subsequent timber stand improvement treatments, such as thinning trees and removing competing vegetation, are critical to restoring and improving the health of our national forests after timber harvests or natural disturbances such as wildland fires. GAO was asked to (1) examine the reported trends in federal lands needing reforestation and timber stand improvement, (2) identify the factors that have contributed to these trends, and (3) describe any potential effects of these trends that federal land managers have identified."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The acreage of Forest Service lands needing reforestation and timber stand improvement generally has been increasing since 2000, according to Forest Service officials and data reported to the Congress, as well as other studies. While the Forest Service data are sufficiently reliable to identify this relative trend they are not sufficiently reliable to accurately quantify the agency's specific needs, establish priorities among treatments, or estimate a budget. The data's reliability is limited in part because some Forest Service regions and forests define their needs differently, and some do not systematically update the data to reflect current forest conditions or review the accuracy of the data. Forest Service officials acknowledge these problems, and the agency is implementing a new data system to better track its needs. While helpful, this action alone will not be sufficient to address the data problems GAO has identified. According to Forest Service officials, reforestation needs have been increasing in spite of declining timber harvests because of the growing acreage of lands affected by natural disturbances such as wildland fires, insect infestation, and diseases. In the past, reforestation needs resulted primarily from timber harvests, whose sales produced sufficient revenue to fund most reforestation needs. Now needs are resulting mainly from natural causes, and funding sources for such needs have remained relatively constant rather than rising in step with increasing needs. For timber stand improvement, the acreage needing attention is growing in part because high-density planting practices, used in the past to replace harvested trees, are creating needs for thinning treatments today and because treatments have not kept pace with the growing needs. Forest Service officials believe the agency's ability to achieve its forest management objectives may be impaired if future reforestation and timber stand improvement needs continue to outpace the agency's ability to meet these needs. For example, maintaining wildlife habitat--one forest management objective--could be hindered if brush grows to dominate an area formerly forested with tree species that provided forage, nesting, or other benefits to wildlife. Also, if treatments are delayed, costs could increase because competing vegetation--which must be removed to allow newly reforested stands to survive--grows larger over time and becomes more costly to remove. Further, without needed thinning treatments, agency officials said forests become dense, fueling wildland fires and creating competition among trees, leaving them stressed and vulnerable to insect attack. While agency officials expressed concern about these potential effects, the agency has not adjusted its policies and priorities for the reforestation and timber stand improvement program so that adverse effects can be minimized. Forest Service officials did, however, acknowledge the need to make such changes."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In March 2004, the Forest Service reported to the Congress that it had a  backlog of about 900,000 acres of land needing reforestation.  Reforestation\u2014the planting and natural regeneration of trees\u2014is critical to  restoring and improving the health of our national forests after timber  harvests, as well as after natural disturbances such as wildland fires,  outbreaks of disease, or insect infestations. The success of reforestation, as  well as the overall health of the forests, often depends upon subsequent  timber stand improvement treatments, such as thinning trees and removing  competing vegetation to allow seedlings to survive. In some parts of the  country, without active intervention, it may take decades for disturbed land  to return to a forested condition. In other parts, trees may naturally return  soon after a disturbance, but the type of regrowth may not be consistent  with Forest Service program objectives. Historically, the Forest Service\u2019s  reforestation and timber stand improvement program focused on  maximizing timber production. Now, however, the program is intended to  achieve a variety of objectives, such as improving wildlife habitat,  enhancing recreational opportunities, maintaining water quality, and  ensuring sustainable timber production. For example, reforestation can  improve wildlife habitat by providing forest cover for species like the  black-tailed deer and timber stand improvement can make forests less  susceptible to wildland fires by removing brush that fuels the fires. The  Forest Service in the Department of Agriculture has primary responsibility  for both reforestation and timber stand improvement treatments in 155  national forests. The agency manages 192 million acres of federal land and  has a stewardship responsibility to maintain the health, productivity, and  diversity of the national forests on this land.", "In 1974, the Forest Service reported a reforestation and timber stand  improvement backlog that affected 3.3 million acres of forested lands. To  address this backlog, the Congress included a provision in the National  Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA) requiring the Forest Service to  annually report the estimated funding needed to prevent the recurrence of  a backlog on lands available for timber production. The Forest Service  primarily uses moneys generated from the sale of timber to reforest areas  where timber has been harvested, whereas it relies primarily on annual  appropriations to reforest areas affected by natural disturbances. In 1980,  the Congress created the Reforestation Trust Fund, which is funded  through tariffs on imported wood products, to provide dedicated funding  for reforestation and timber stand improvement treatments and to help  eliminate the backlog. In 1985, the Forest Service declared that it had  virtually eliminated the backlog reported in 1974.", "With the 2004 announcement of a new backlog, you asked us to (1)  examine the reported trends in federal lands needing reforestation and  timber stand improvement, (2) identify the factors that have contributed to  these trends, and (3) describe any potential effects of these trends that  federal land managers have identified. This report focuses primarily on the  Forest Service\u2019s reforestation and timber stand improvement program  because it is the largest one managed by a federal land management agency  and covers the broadest cross section of the country. The Bureau of Land  Management (BLM) in the Department of the Interior also has  responsibility for reforestation and timber stand improvement on federal  lands, but its program is much smaller than the Forest Service\u2019s. In 2003,  for example, the Forest Service reported reforesting more than 160,000  acres of federal land nationwide, while BLM reported reforesting less than  11,000 acres, with the majority of this activity occurring in western Oregon.  The results of our limited review of BLM\u2019s program are summarized in  appendix I.", "To examine the trends in federal lands needing reforestation and timber  stand improvement, we reviewed and analyzed Forest Service data for the  10 years between 1995 and 2004, analyzed applicable statutes and agency  regulations, and interviewed agency officials and other experts about these  trends. In addition, we reviewed and analyzed Forest Service documents,  including database manuals and agency-wide and regional procedures for  gathering and reporting data related to reforestation and timber stand  improvement. To identify factors that have contributed to reforestation and  timber stand improvement trends and describe potential effects identified  by federal land managers, we reviewed internal Forest Service reports, as  well as other studies, and interviewed agency officials in both headquarters  and selected regions. We also visited four regions with the largest reported  reforestation and timber stand improvement needs and national forests  within these regions. We conducted our work from June 2004 to March  2005 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Appendix II provides further details about the scope and  methodology of our review."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Forest Service\u2019s reforestation and timber stand improvement program  shapes our national forests as well as their associated plant and animal  communities through treatments that establish, develop, and care for trees  over their lifetime. Under NFMA, each national forest is required to have a  forest management plan describing the agency\u2019s objectives for the forest,  including those related to reforestation and timber stand improvement.", "To achieve these management objectives after a timber harvest or natural  event that damages forests, Forest Service staff identify areas needing  reforestation and visit forest locations to plan a specific sequence of  treatments needed, known as a prescription. The prescription directs how  many young trees must be reestablished and the proper mix of vegetation  necessary to achieve specific objectives in the forest plan, such as  maintaining wildlife habitat. Reforestation prescriptions may call for  planting or natural regeneration, as outlined in table 1. To plant a site,  Forest Service staff order seedlings from a nursery up to 3 years in advance  of planting to allow enough time for them to grow, then plant the seedlings  when conditions are favorable. For natural regeneration, agency staff allow  seeds from trees left on the site or nearby trees to germinate and grow,  which sometimes requires removing unwanted vegetation and surface  debris to improve the likelihood that the trees will survive or accelerate  their growth.", "As with reforestation, Forest Service staff identify areas of a forest needing  timber stand improvement and prepare prescriptions. Timber stand  improvement prescriptions are intended to improve growing conditions for  trees in a stand and typically call for treatments such as release or thinning,  as outlined in table 1. To conduct a release treatment, Forest Service staff  remove competing vegetation to allow seedlings to grow; and to thin a  stand, agency staff remove some trees to accelerate the growth of the  remaining trees or to improve forest health.", "Reforestation and timber stand improvement treatments are funded by  various sources, principally congressional appropriations and trust funds.  Congressional appropriations that fund this work include moneys allocated  from the National Forest System appropriation to the reforestation and  timber stand improvement program as well as to other Forest Service  programs whose primary purposes include improving forest health,  decreasing hazardous fuels, and rehabilitating burned areas. In addition to  these moneys, the Knutson-Vandenberg Trust fund that collects receipts  generated from timber sales helps pay for reforestation and timber stand  improvement in areas harvested for timber. While Knutson-Vandenberg  funds are a dedicated source of funding for reforesting harvested lands,  work in areas destroyed by natural causes, such as wildland fire, is  generally funded through the National Forest System appropriation and a  portion of the Reforestation Trust Fund. Reforestation Trust Fund receipts  are generated by tariffs on imported wood products, and by law, moneys  transferred into this fund for the Forest Service\u2019s use are limited to $30  million each fiscal year. Other sources of funds, such as gifts, bequests, and  partnerships, also fund reforestation and timber stand improvement  treatments.", "The Forest Service\u2019s implementation, management, and oversight of the  reforestation and timber stand improvement program are decentralized.  Forest Service headquarters and 9 regional offices establish policy and  provide technical direction to 155 national forest offices on various aspects  of the program. These national forest offices, in turn, provide general  oversight to more than 600 district offices, several of which are located in  each national forest. The district offices plan, fund, and manage  reforestation and timber stand improvement projects, and the managers of  these offices have considerable discretion in interpreting and applying the  agency\u2019s policies and selecting projects to fund. District office staff are  responsible for assessing reforestation and timber stand improvement  needs, developing prescriptions to address these needs, and accomplishing  the work.

Although the Director of Forest Management in its headquarters is  responsible for the agency-wide reporting of reforestation and timber stand  improvement needs, much of the responsibility for establishing standards  and procedures for collecting and reporting these data has been delegated  to the regional, national forest, and district offices. Forest and district  offices use automated systems to record their reforestation and timber  stand improvement needs and accomplishments and each region collects  the data in one of nine regional databases and transmits its total  reforestation and timber stand improvement needs to a centralized data  repository. Nationally, the Forest Service consolidates the regional data to  produce agency-wide reports of reforestation and timber stand  improvement needs and accomplishments by national forest.

These Forest Service data, when combined with  other information, are sufficiently reliable to identify a general trend of  increasing needs. Nonetheless, we have concerns about the usefulness of  these data in quantifying the acreage of agency land needing reforestation  and timber stand improvement.

During this 10-year  period, the primary source of the Forest Service\u2019s reforestation needs  changed. Specifically, the agency reports that its reforestation needs  attributable to timber harvests decreased steadily, while needs associated  with wildland fires and other natural disturbances were relatively stable  until 2000, when such needs rose dramatically with the increase in wildland  fires, particularly in western states. Reforestation needs reported by the  Forest Service\u2019s Northern Region\u2014covering all of Montana and North  Dakota and portions of some adjacent states\u2014followed the national  pattern most closely. In addition to the Northern Region, other regions we  visited (Pacific Northwest, Pacific Southwest) spanning western states,  such as Washington, Oregon, and California, reported large reforestation  needs. These regions expressed concern about the increasing level of their  reforestation needs relative to their future ability to meet these needs.", "With respect to timber stand improvement needs, the Forest Service  reports that the acreage of its lands needing such treatments increased in  most years following 1995, except for 1999, 2003, and 2004, when the  reported needs declined slightly (as shown in fig. 3). The agency partially  attributes the decline in needs during these years to an emphasis on  thinning treatments and additional work associated with the National Fire  Plan during 2003 and 2004. Officials at two of the four regions we visited,  the Northern and Pacific Northwest Regions, told us they were concerned  about the overall increasing level of their timber stand improvement needs.  Timber stand improvement needs reported by the Forest Service\u2019s Pacific  Northwest region\u2014covering all of Washington and Oregon\u2014were the  highest of any region during 4 of the last 5 years. According to officials in  the Pacific Northwest region, timber stand improvement needs have  accumulated, in part, due to placing a lower priority on such treatments  than on reforestation and because many stands in which high-density tree  planting practices were used to replace harvested trees during the early  1990s are now in need of thinning. While nationwide timber stand  improvement needs generally have been increasing over time, some  regions have reported stable or decreasing trends. For example, in the  Southern Region, reported timber stand improvement needs have been  relatively stable over the last 10 years, while the Pacific Southwest Region  has reported slightly decreasing needs since 1995. According to officials in  the Pacific Southwest Region, they have less need for timber stand  improvement projects because they plant fewer trees as the result of  reduced timber harvests.

Although agency guidance generally requires that needs be  diagnosed for a specific site and linked to a prescription for treatment, it  also directs staff to estimate reforestation needs following a wildland fire  or other natural disturbance and revise these estimates within the year. We  found in our visits to four regions that they vary in the extent to which they  report needs based on a site-specific diagnosis or an estimate, and  consequently may understate or overstate needs.", "Forest Service guidance sets different standards for reporting reforestation  needs that arise from timber harvest rather than those created by fires or  other natural disturbances, in part, to promote timely reporting. For  example, after a clear-cut harvest, the guidance directs regions to  determine reforestation needs using a site-specific diagnosis and  prescription for regenerating the acreage. In contrast, after fires or other  natural disturbances, this guidance encourages staff to immediately  estimate the acres in need of reforestation before they have visited forest  locations to develop a site-specific prescription and refine their estimate  while performing restoration activities. Forest Service officials commented  that at times it is difficult to balance the timely reporting of needs created  by natural disturbances with data accuracy.", "Regions we visited varied in the extent to which they used site-specific  prescriptions or estimates as a basis for reporting needs. For example,  although a Forest Service official in the Southern Region told us that over  100,000 acres of land there may need reforestation, in part due to insect  damage, he said none of this acreage will be reported as needing  reforestation until staff diagnose the needs through site visits and prescribe  treatments. In contrast, forests in wildland fire-prone regions, such as the  Pacific Southwest Region, report needs based on gross estimates after  natural disturbances. In cases where reforestation or timber stand  improvement needs are based on gross estimates, the reported needs may  not always be adjusted after the actual needs are known, according to  Forest Service officials. For example, an official from the Pacific  Southwest Region indicated that the moist climate in some areas of the  region causes vegetation to grow quickly, so that when an area initially  needs to be reforested, staff generously estimate all possible treatments  needed to remove unwanted vegetation and are unlikely to update these  reforestation needs, even if subsequent treatments are deemed  unnecessary. On the other hand, this official indicated that staff are likely  to understate the need to thin trees in some areas because they do not  expect sufficient funding to address all of the timber stand improvement  needs. They therefore concentrate their efforts on meeting the needs rather  than diagnosing and precisely reporting them. Officials in other regions  also noted that they emphasize addressing needs rather than accurately  identifying and reporting them, in part because incentives are focused on  accomplishments and meeting treatment goals established by  headquarters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data Are Not Reviewed for Accuracy", "paragraphs": ["The Forest Service cannot attest that the reported data on needs reflect  actual forest conditions nationwide because the data are not reviewed for  accuracy and when errors are found they are not always corrected.

Some regions do not consistently update or review their data for  substantive errors before reporting them. Although Forest Service  headquarters staff conduct high-level checks to ensure that some data are  reported consistently, they have not conducted reviews in the last decade  to ensure that the data reflect on-the-ground conditions. Consequently, an  official in the Pacific Southwest Region speculated that there is an error  rate of approximately 20 percent in the reforestation and timber stand  improvement needs reported within the region.

This study attributed these shortcomings to a lack  of centralized program management to standardize definitions of need and  establish consistent reporting criteria. Subsequent reviews of the program,  including a GAO review in 1991, found similar problems and recommended additional standardization. The Forest Service recognizes these problems  and has acknowledged it has not provided the Congress estimates on  funding needed to prevent a backlog, in part, because needs data are a  mixture of actual needs, estimates, and obsolete needs.

Other  factors, such as reforestation failures, also have contributed to increasing  reforestation needs, according to agency officials.

At the same time, agency officials have been  identifying more timber stand improvement needs as they have expanded  the scope of work included in the program. In addition, timber stand  improvement needs have been increasing because, in the 1980s and 1990s,  the Forest Service used reforestation techniques that favored planting trees  densely, creating stands that now need thinning."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agency Officials Link Rising Reforestation Needs to Natural Causes Rather Than Timber Harvests", "paragraphs": ["Forest Service officials told us that reforestation needs have been rising  largely because such needs have increasingly been generated by causes  other than timber harvests, and funding to address these needs has not  kept pace. During the early 1990s, the agency shifted its management  emphasis from timber production to enhancing forest ecosystem health  and, as a result, began harvesting less timber. With the reduction in  harvests, revenue from timber sales decreased. As shown in figure 4, nearly  4 billion board feet of timber were harvested from Forest Service lands in  1995, whereas about 2 billion board feet were harvested in 2004. Similarly,  according to the Forest Service, the timber harvested on its lands in 1995  was worth about $616 million, whereas timber harvested in 2004 was worth  about $217 million. As timber harvests and revenue have decreased, related  reforestation needs also have decreased, and so the Forest Service has  generally been able to meet these needs by using timber sale revenue to  help pay for reforestation. Forest Service officials also noted that the value  of the wood they are now selling is typically much lower than it was a  decade ago.", "According to Forest Service reports, as timber harvests and related  reforestation needs were decreasing, the acreage burned in wildland fires  and damaged by insects and diseases annually began to increase  significantly around 2000, leaving thousands of acres needing reforestation.  Nationally, wildland fires burned over 8 million acres in 2000, compared  with less than 6 million acres in 1999 and about 2.3 million acres in 1998.   In 2002, Colorado, Arizona, and Oregon recorded their largest fires in the  last century. Similarly, figure 5 shows that the amount of land damaged by  insects and diseases has increased significantly, with over 12 million acres  of forest affected in 2003, compared with less than 2 million acres in 1999.  As the acreage affected by these natural disturbances increased, so did  reforestation needs. However, funding allocated to pay for reforestation did  not increase at the same rate, so needs began to accumulate.", "While reported reforestation needs have been rising, funding allocated for  reforestation and timber stand improvement has been relatively constant  (as shown in fig. 6). In addition, pressure on limited funding was magnified  in fiscal year 2001, as the Forest Service combined under one budget  multiple programs including reforestation and timber stand improvement  as well as range, watershed improvement, and noxious weed management  programs, among others. Once these programs were combined, agency  officials had to balance reforestation and timber stand improvement needs  against priorities in the other programs. On a broader scale, a Forest  Service official said they must balance reforestation needs against other  competing priorities when requesting a budget from the Congress, so they  did not request more funding to help pay for reforestation needs during the  last decade. Officials did, however, request additional funding for fiscal  year 2006, according to an agency official.", "In addition to natural causes, several other factors have contributed to the  reported increase in reforestation needs, according to Forest Service  officials. In some areas, reforestation attempts have failed, creating needs  where agency officials will try again to reforest the same lands.  Reforestation efforts can fail for a variety of reasons, such as insufficient  moisture, improper planting techniques, or animal damage to young  seedlings. Ongoing drought conditions in the West, as well as the  retirement of experienced foresters, may have played a role in recent  reforestation failures, according to Forest Service officials. Another factor  that has contributed to the reported increase in reforestation needs is that  some national forests have recently acquired lands through purchase or  exchange that need reforestation. For example, the Ozark-St. Francis  National Forest in Arkansas acquired about 11,000 acres of land in 1993 and  1994 that had been harvested, and much of it needed reforestation.

In addition,  agency officials said that, generally, lands needing reforestation change  more quickly than lands needing timber stand improvement, so the  opportunity cost of deferring reforestation treatments is higher than that of  deferring timber stand improvement projects. For example, an official in  the Pacific Southwest Region estimated that if they did not reforest an area  immediately after a fire, brush would likely become established within a  few years, and removing the brush could add as much as $400 per acre to  the costs of reforestation.

For example, during  the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, the Idaho-Panhandle National Forest had  an active timber production program, clear-cutting and harvesting  thousands of acres each year, and replanting densely. During that period,  officials deliberately planted seedlings densely so that as the trees grew,  they could keep the largest and healthiest of them for cultivating, and thin  out the others.

In some parts of  the country, such as Idaho, timber stand improvement projects may not be  needed until 20 or 30 years after planting.

In addition, like the  Southwestern region, the Pacific Southwest region has begun to give  priority to timber stand improvement projects that contribute to fuels  reduction goals. According to agency officials in the region, this emphasis  has helped finance timber stand improvement work and reduce needs.

For example, at the  Bitterroot National Forest in Montana and Idaho, agency officials have  identified a management objective of establishing or maintaining  ponderosa pine forests, which populated the area historically and are well- adapted to high-frequency, low-intensity wildland fires. Currently, the  Bitterroot National Forest has thousands of acres that need reforestation  because of wildland fires in 2000. If these needs are left unattended,  douglas fir forests will likely become established instead of ponderosa  pine; and, according to agency officials, douglas fir tends to grow into  crowded stands that officials believe will perpetuate the cycle of dense  forests, fueling severe fires. In addition, agency officials prefer ponderosa  pine forests because they provide habitat for certain wildlife species, such  as pileated woodpeckers. In other cases, an area previously dominated by  forests could become dominated by shrubfields, compromising wildlife  habitat, recreation, and timber value. In the Shasta-Trinity National Forest,  an area that was cleared by logging and wildland fires at the turn of the  century left a brushfield that persisted for over 60 years and only became  forested when the Forest Service actively planted the area. Similarly, about  750 acres in the Tahoe National Forest were cleared by a 1924 wildland fire  and replaced by shrubs (shown in fig. 7) that remained until agency  officials replanted the area in 1964\u201440 years later. One Forest Service  official expressed particular concern about leaving reforestation needs  unattended because, as these needs are increasingly created by natural  causes such as wildland fires that burn vast areas, adverse effects have the  potential to occur on a large scale.

If thinning needs are left unattended,  forest management objectives can be thwarted as well. For example, some  forests have identified areas where timber production is an objective, and  thinning treatments are used to increase timber productivity by removing  trees with the least potential for growth and leaving those with the greatest  potential.

For example, at the Ozark-St. Francis National Forest in Arkansas, insects  have destroyed thousands of acres of red oak forests since 1999, leaving  large areas that need to be reforested. As the Forest Service has left these  areas unattended, brush that must be removed before new seedlings are  planted is becoming established, and removing it will be more costly as  time passes. When the brush was young and small, it could have been  removed with inexpensive methods such as hand spraying herbicides; but  now it will require a more expensive method such as cutting the brush with  a chainsaw, according to agency officials. If these areas are left indefinitely,  trees may become established, but a different mix of species will probably  replace the red oak forests, which are desirable both for their commercial  value and the habitat they provide for wildlife, such as large game.", "In addition, some Forest Service officials said that because there has been  recent controversy over salvage timber sales\u2014the selling of dead or dying  trees\u2014the sales have been delayed, adding costs to reforestation projects  done following salvage sales. The Forest Service could not, however,  quantify such costs. Although salvage sales do not always precede  reforestation, any salvage harvesting that is done is generally completed  before reforesting begins because logging activities and equipment can  damage young seedlings. Consequently, when salvage sales are delayed,  reforestation projects are delayed as well, causing reforestation costs to  increase as vegetation grows that must be removed before reforesting.", "Also, when salvage sales are delayed, revenue declines because over time  the value of the salvage timber decreases as the wood decays.

Once such invasive species become established, it  is difficult to eradicate them. In addition, wildland fires may weaken some  trees without killing them, leaving them susceptible to insect attack and  diseases; and if reforestation needs are left unattended, an insect  infestation can grow to epidemic proportions.

Similarly, when insects or diseases infect such forests\u2014especially when  the trees are of a uniform species and age rather than a variety of species  and ages\u2014they can spread rapidly because of the stressed condition of the  trees and because the trees are close together and of the same species."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Forest Service Is Not Well Positioned to Manage Potential Effects of Increasing Needs", "paragraphs": ["Although Forest Service officials expressed concern about the potential  effects of leaving reforestation and timber stand improvement needs  unattended, the agency has not made sufficient adjustments to address  these concerns and adapt to changes in the context in which the program  operates.

However, the agency has not  adjusted the program\u2019s direction, policies, practices, and priorities in  keeping with these changes, although agency officials acknowledged the  need to do so. Until they do, it will be difficult to ensure that reforestation  and timber stand improvement funds are targeted toward activities that  will have the greatest impact in mitigating potential adverse effects.", "While the Forest Service formally shifted its management emphasis from  timber production to ecosystem management in the early 1990s, there  remains a general lack of clarity about agency mission and goals, and more  specifically, a lack of clarity about the direction and goals for the  reforestation and timber stand improvement program, according to agency  officials. When timber production was the emphasis, the direction for the  reforestation and timber stand improvement program was clearly focused  around maximizing timber production, whereas in the current  environment, it is less clear. Reforestation and timber stand improvement  projects now are done for multiple purposes\u2014such as improving wildlife  habitat, protecting streams and water quality, and reducing susceptibility to  wildland fires\u2014but it is unclear which of these purposes are more  important, if any, and how to allocate limited funds to support such diverse  purposes. The lack of clarity is apparent in forest management plans,  where management objectives are expressed in language that may be vague  or contradictory, according to agency officials. For example, one objective  in a Montana forest\u2019s management plan calls for providing \u201ca pleasing and  healthy environment, including clean air, clean water, and diverse  ecosystems.\u201d The forest management plans are intended to help guide  management decisions, such as deciding which reforestation and timber  stand improvement techniques to use, but agency officials said it can be  difficult to interpret the plans when making such decisions because of the  vague language, conflicting management objectives, or a combination of  these factors. A 2004 study in the Pacific Southwest Region found that  many agency officials believe forest management plans are too generic and  lack clear priorities.", "In the absence of program direction that is consistent with the current  management emphasis, reforestation and timber stand improvement  policies remain in place that reflect outdated direction and management  emphasis. For example, some reforestation policies written in the 1980s  call for tight spacing between trees consistent with the agency\u2019s timber  focus at the time. Dense planting can increase timber production and  decrease competing vegetation, but it is more expensive than sparser  planting and can add costs later because dense stands need to be thinned.  Agency officials acknowledged that in many cases, these standards are  outdated and reflect neither the current emphasis on ecosystem  management, nor the current environment of constrained budgets.  Nevertheless, officials explained that they have not changed the standards  because they are not required to comply with them. Rather, they have the  discretion to determine the appropriate spacing for trees on a site-specific  basis and to write a prescription that deviates from the standards by relying  on their professional judgment. While reliance on professional judgment  may result in actions that are more closely aligned with the current  management emphasis, there is no assurance that it will have such results  without clear direction and policies consistent with the direction.", "In some places, regional culture that reflects a former management  emphasis and budgetary situation influences current practices. For  example, when reforesting an area, officials in the Pacific Southwest region  almost always rely on planting\u2014a more expensive method than natural  regeneration\u2014because they have always done so and, according to agency  officials, this practice has been reinforced by the regional culture. When  the agency-wide management emphasis was timber production,  reforestation standards called for prompt reforestation and tightly spaced  trees to maximize timber volume; so officials rarely relied on natural  regeneration, which does not necessarily ensure rapid reforestation or  result in tightly spaced trees. In addition, when timber revenues were  higher and reforestation efforts centered on harvested areas, the region  could always afford to plant. Now, as the agency\u2019s management emphasis  has shifted to ecosystem and forest health, and as budgets have become  increasingly strained, officials in the Pacific Southwest region said they are  beginning to encourage greater reliance on natural regeneration, but it  remains to be seen whether forests and districts will adjust their practices,  accordingly.", "Priorities for the reforestation and timber stand improvement program also  reflect a lack of clarity about program direction in the context of the  current management emphasis, and a continued reliance on former  program direction. For example, among agency officials we talked with,  there was disagreement on how funding should be allocated between  reforestation and timber stand improvement work and on whether one  ought to be higher priority than the other. In the Pacific Northwest region,  agency officials wrote a 2001 report recommending that the region divert  some of its reforestation funds to pay for additional timber stand  improvement. The report stated that doing so is justified,  because (1) many  of the current timber stand improvement needs resulted from reforestation  projects several decades ago that favored high density planting and (2)  without thinning to help reduce the impacts of wildland fire, reforestation  will continue to be needed after wildland fires. Nevertheless, regional  officials we talked with did not all agree with the recommendation, and the  region has not implemented it. Instead, the region has continued to  prioritize reforestation over timber stand improvement, as it has done since  the inception of the timber program. According to one regional official, the  Forest Service\u2019s history of timber production permeates current thinking,  and many procedures do not reflect the current management emphasis on  ecosystem health.", "Without clear program direction, not only is it difficult to determine  priorities between reforestation and timber stand improvement, but it is  also difficult to do so for work within each. For the most part, the regions  and forests we visited have not established clear criteria for prioritizing  funding decisions, and officials do not always agree with one another about  such decisions. For example, at a forest in the Pacific Southwest region,  after district officials replanted most of an area burned by a 1996 wildland  fire, regional officials thought replanting the remaining burned area was a  low priority because of the high per-acre cost. District and forest-level staff,  however, believed it was a high priority because the area was harvested in a  salvage sale after the fire, and the Forest Service is required to reforest all  harvested lands within 5 years. The forest has continued to fund projects to  replant the remaining area.

If the  agency does not have accurate data, it cannot clearly define the extent or  severity of its reforestation and timber stand improvement needs or  effectively channel efforts and resources to meet the most important  needs. Currently, the Forest Service has difficulty estimating how much it  would cost to meet all of its reforestation and timber stand improvement  needs because Forest Service data are inconsistent across regions and are  not sufficiently reliable to accurately quantify needs. With the advent of a  new agency-wide data collection system, the Forest Service has the  opportunity to improve the accuracy of its data.

According to BLM officials, the declining timber  harvests were largely a result of growing controversy surrounding timber  harvests and the protection of endangered species on public land. Related  litigation and judicial decisions hindered BLM from harvesting timber on its  lands. The controversy was addressed in the Northwest Forest Plan,  adopted in 1994, which reduced the portion of BLM\u2019s western Oregon lands  to be managed primarily for timber. After adoption of the plan, BLM  reduced the upper limit on annual timber sales from these lands to 211  million board feet. At the same time, BLM modified its harvesting methods  to rely less on clear-cutting  and more on thinning. Unlike clear-cut forests,  the thinned forests did not need to be reforested and required fewer growth  enhancement treatments, resulting in a further reduction of needs.

According to agency officials, increased funding in 1996 and subsequent  years enabled BLM to treat more acres annually than it had done  previously, thereby reducing the backlogs.", "In addition to declining timber harvests and increased funding, BLM took  several actions to help reduce its reforestation and growth enhancement  backlogs in response to the 1994 Inspector General\u2019s report. First, officials  in the reforestation and growth enhancement program instituted measures  to improve their data collection and tracking so that they could accurately  quantify the size of the backlogs, locate the source of the backlogs, and  track progress in eliminating them. Second, BLM shifted its priorities,  funding, and resources to target the areas where the need was greatest.  BLM officials from all of the districts in western Oregon, as well as the state  office, came together to agree on a list of priorities for the program, then  targeted available funding and resources to the highest priority needs. For  example, they decided to place a higher priority on maintaining existing  timber stands than on planting new stands, because maintenance needs  made up the greatest portion of the backlog. Adhering to the prioritization  scheme helped address the backlog, according to an agency official, but  required staff to have fluid roles. Finally, BLM officials analyzed treatment  costs per acre in each district and identified best practices to optimize their  investments of scarce resources. For example, one district identified cost- saving forestry techniques for thinning, while another identified lower-cost  contracting procedures. BLM then standardized these practices across all  western Oregon districts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BLM Reports Preventing Adverse Effects by Keeping Pace with Reforestation and Growth Enhancement Needs", "paragraphs": ["Because BLM has been keeping pace with its reforestation and growth  enhancement needs on its western Oregon lands since 2002, it is preventing  any adverse effects that could result from a backlog of needs, according to  agency officials."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To examine the trends in federal lands needing reforestation and timber  stand improvement, we reviewed the Forest Service and BLM programs  because most of the nation\u2019s reforestation and timber stand improvement  activities are managed by these two agencies. We focused our work  primarily on the Forest Service\u2019s program because it is larger than BLM\u2019s  and its forests cover a broader cross-section of the country. During 2004,  we visited the following four Forest Service regions and one national forest  in each region: Northern, Pacific Northwest, Pacific Southwest, and  Southern. These regions were selected because they had the highest  reported reforestation or timber stand improvement needs for fiscal years  2000 to 2003. We obtained and analyzed 10 years of national data, from  fiscal years 1995 through 2004, on the Forest Service\u2019s reforestation and  timber stand improvement needs and treatments from the agency\u2019s Timber  Activity Control System for Silvicultural Activities (TRACS-SILVA). We  assessed the reliability of the data by examining the TRACS-SILVA system  as well as the regional data systems of the four regions we visited, which  provide the source data for the national TRACS-SILVA system. To  understand what standards, procedures, and internal controls are in place  for collecting, reporting, and verifying needs\u2014and to assess the accuracy  and completeness of the TRACS-SILVA data\u2014we conducted structured  interviews with headquarters, regional, and forest-level officials who enter  data into the data systems, maintain the systems, and prepare reports using  data from the systems. We performed basic electronic testing on some of  the data and reviewed manuals and other documents describing the  systems, such as flowcharts and data dictionaries. To obtain information  about the new agency-wide data system, known as the Forest Service  Activity Tracking System (FACTS), we interviewed agency officials  involved in its implementation and reviewed information on the system\u2019s  data management functions, procedures, and applications.", "To corroborate the TRACS-SILVA data, we obtained information about  trends in the Forest Service\u2019s reforestation and timber stand improvement  needs from additional sources. Specifically, we interviewed agency  program officials and data experts in headquarters as well as in each  regional and forest office that we visited to discuss the trends in  reforestation and timber stand improvement needs, and we visited sites  where reforestation and timber stand improvement treatments were  needed. In addition, we reviewed agency reports and testimony written by  foresters, budget officials, and researchers. We also reviewed  nongovernmental studies and contacted outside experts to discuss these  trends. Based on our review, we determined that the Forest Service data\u2014 when combined with other information we examined\u2014are sufficiently  reliable to identify general trend information, but we have concerns about  whether these data accurately quantify the acreage of land needing  reforestation and timber stand improvement.", "To identify the factors that have contributed to reforestation and timber  stand improvement trends, we interviewed Forest Service officials in  headquarters and the regional and national forest offices we visited. We  also contacted an agency official in the Southwestern Region. We reviewed  headquarters and regional reports on factors contributing to reforestation  and timber stand improvement trends as well as reports from the Forest  Service\u2019s research station in the Rocky Mountain region and supplemented  this information by interviewing researchers there. We obtained Forest  Service data on timber harvests, wildland fires, and insect infestations  during the last decade and conducted limited reliability assessments on  these data. We also interviewed experts from nongovernmental  organizations and reviewed publications from the organizations.", "To determine the potential effects of the Forest Service\u2019s reforestation and  timber stand improvement trends identified by the agency\u2019s land managers,  we interviewed agency officials (including ecologists and silviculturists) in  headquarters, regional, and national forest offices. We visited the sites of  ongoing and completed reforestation and timber stand improvement  projects in four national forests and discussed the potential effects of  delaying treatments with local Forest Service officials. We interviewed  Forest Service research program officials as well as scientific and technical  experts at Forest Service research stations in Arizona and Montana and at  nongovernmental organizations. We also reviewed select governmental and  nongovernmental publications, including scientific studies that discuss  potential effects of delaying reforestation and timber stand improvement  treatments and interviewed some of the authors.", "We limited our review of BLM to its western Oregon lands because they are  central to the agency\u2019s forest development program and because BLM does  not systematically track reforestation data for its other lands. We obtained  and analyzed 10 years of data, from 1995 through 2004, on the BLM\u2019s  reforestation and growth enhancement needs in western Oregon. We  performed a limited reliability assessment of these data and BLM\u2019s  reporting system through discussions with BLM headquarters officials and  a structured interview with officials at BLM\u2019s state office in Portland,  Oregon, which oversees BLM\u2019s western Oregon lands. We supplemented  these efforts by gathering other relevant documents and reports issued by  the department of the Interior\u2019s Inspector General. We determined that the  BLM data were sufficiently reliable to use them descriptively in appendix 1  of this report. To determine the factors contributing to BLM\u2019s reforestation  and forest development trends and to identify potential effects of the  trends identified by the agency\u2019s land managers, we interviewed BLM  officials in Oregon and reviewed relevant BLM and Inspector General  reports.", "We conducted our work from June 2004 through March 2005 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of Agriculture", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of the Interior", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Other individuals making key contributions to this report were Bill Bates,  Christy Colburn, Sandy Davis, Sandra Edwards, Omari Norman, Cynthia  Norris, and Jay Smale."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
