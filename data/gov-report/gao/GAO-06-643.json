Prior to Hurricane Katrina, disaster plans and exercises did not incorporate lessons learned from past catastrophes to fully delineate the military capabilities needed to respond to a catastrophe. For example, the government's National Response Plan made little distinction between the military response to a smaller regional disaster and its response to a catastrophic natural disaster. In addition, DOD's emergency response plan for providing military assistance to civil authorities during disasters lacked adequate detail. The plan did not: account for the full range of assistance that might be provided by DOD, divide tasks between the National Guard and the federal responders, or establish response time frames. National Guard state plans were also inadequate and did not account for the level of outside assistance that would be needed during a catastrophe, and they were not synchronized with federal plans. Moreover, plans had not been tested with a robust exercise program. None of the exercises that were conducted prior to Katrina called for a major deployment of DOD capabilities in response to a catastrophic hurricane. As a result, a lack of understanding exists within the military and among federal, state, and local responders as to the types of assistance and capabilities that DOD might provide in the event of a catastrophe, the timing of this assistance, and the respective contributions of the active-duty and National Guard forces. Despite the lack of planning, the military took proactive steps and responded with about 50,000 National Guard and 20,000 active federal personnel. Based on its June 2005 civil support strategy, DOD relied heavily on the Guard during the initial response. Active duty forces were alerted prior to landfall and key capabilities such as aviation, medical, and engineering forces were initially deployed. Growing concerns about the magnitude of the disaster prompted DOD to deploy large, active ground units to supplement the Guard beginning about 5 days after landfall. Several factors affected the military's ability to gain situational awareness and organize and execute its response, including a lack of timely damage assessments, communications difficulties, force integration problems, uncoordinated search and rescue efforts, and unexpected logistics responsibilities. Without detailed plans to address these factors, DOD and the federal government risk being unprepared for the next catastrophe. DOD is examining the lessons learned from its own reviews and those of the White House and the Congress, and it is beginning to take actions to address the lessons and prepare for the next catastrophe. It is too early to evaluate DOD's actions, but many appear to hold promise. However, some issues identified after Katrina such as damage assessments are long-standing problems that were identified by GAO after Hurricane Andrew in 1992. They will be difficult to address because they are complex and cut across agency boundaries. Thus, substantial improvement will require sustained attention from the highest management levels in DOD, and across the government."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["When Hurricane Katrina made its final landfall along the  Louisiana/Mississippi border on August 29, 2005, it quickly became one of  the largest natural disasters in the history of the United States.

The plan generally calls for a reactive federal response  following specific state requests for assistance. However, the NRP also  contains a catastrophic incident annex that calls for a proactive federal  response when catastrophes overwhelm local and state responders. The  NRP generally assigns the Department of Defense (DOD) a supporting role  in disaster response, but even in this role, DOD has specific planning  responsibilities. For example, the NRP requires federal agencies to  incorporate the accelerated response requirements of the NRP\u2019s  catastrophic incident annex into their own emergency response plans.", "Within DOD, the Strategy for Homeland Defense and Civil Support, which  was issued in June 2005, envisions a greater reliance on National Guard  and Reserve forces for homeland missions.

During smaller disasters, an affected state\u2019s National Guard may provide a  sufficient response but larger disasters and catastrophes that overwhelm  the state may require assistance from out-of-state National Guard or  federal troops. For Katrina, the response was heavily reliant on the  National Guard, which is consistent with DOD\u2019s Strategy for Homeland  Defense and Civil Support. This represents a departure from past  catastrophes when active-duty forces played a larger role in the response.", "During disaster response missions, National Guard troops typically  operate under the control of the state governors.

The NRP states that DOD has significant  resources that may be available to support the federal response to an  incident of national significance, but it lists very few specific DOD  resources that should be called upon even in the event of a catastrophic  natural disaster.

In addition to designating primary  agencies for each of its 15 emergency support functions, the NRP  designates an emergency function coordinator. The coordinator, which is  also a primary agency, is responsible for coordinating all activities related  to catastrophic incident planning. Since the NRP generally places DOD in  a supporting role rather than in a coordinator role, DOD relied on other  agencies to take the lead in coordinating the overall response within each  functional area. However, according to DOD officials, coordinated  emergency support function plans were generally not completed when  Katrina struck. Lacking coordinated plans to clearly identify the  capabilities that other agencies would provide during a catastrophe, DOD  was forced to anticipate which capabilities the primary agencies and other  supporting agencies would provide as it developed the details in its  supporting plan.

DOD planners typically use one of three different  types of plans for its missions. From most to least detailed, they are  operations plans, contingency plans, and functional plans. Combatant  commanders, like Northern Command, have some discretion to determine  what type of planning is necessary for their assigned missions. For its  emergency response plan to provide defense assistance to civil authorities  during disasters or catastrophes, DOD opted to use its least detailed type  of plan, the functional plan. Functional plans are generally used to address  peacetime operations in permissive environments. DOD\u2019s plan is called  Functional Plan 2501. Even though functional plans are less detailed than  the two other types of plans, according to DOD\u2019s joint planning guidance,  a functional plan must be adequate and feasible.

The  2005 DOD Strategy for Homeland Defense and Civil Support called for  focused reliance on reserve component capabilities for civil support  missions, but Functional Plan 2501 did not envision the large-scale  employment of National Guard and Reserve assets and did not outline a  concept of operations using National Guard/Reserve capabilities. It did not  address key questions of integration, command and control, and the  division of tasks between National Guard resources under state control  and federal resources under U.S. Northern Command\u2019s control.

Furthermore, the strategy  envisions effective surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities in support  of homeland defense operations and again, the functional plan does not  sufficiently address this capability. In contrast, the Northern Command  has more detailed and operationally specific plans for other homeland  defense missions, like its response missions following a terrorist attack.  Understandably, development of these plans was given priority after the  terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.

However, the Louisiana plan did not address the need to bring in  thousands of military troops from outside the state during a catastrophe.  Similarly, Mississippi National Guard officials told us that even their 1969  experience with Hurricane Camille, a category 5 storm that hit the same  general area, had not adequately prepared them for a catastrophic natural  disaster of Katrina\u2019s magnitude.

For example, commands had published warning and  planning orders and DOD had already deployed Defense Coordinating  Officers to all the potentially affected states. After landfall, the governors  and National Guard officials in Louisiana and Mississippi requested  additional support from other states. The governor of Louisiana also  requested federal military assistance to help with response and recovery  efforts.", "Figure 1 shows the buildup of forces as the military supported response  and recovery operations with engineering, communication, and military  police units as well as helicopter search-and-rescue and ship crews, and  personnel with many other critically needed capabilities. Active-duty  forces were alerted prior to landfall and the initial buildup of active-duty  forces shown in figure 1 reflects the deployment of key active-duty  capabilities such as aviation, medical, and engineering forces. Growing  concerns about the magnitude of the disaster prompted DOD to deploy  large active-duty ground units beginning on September 3, 2005, 5 days after  Katrina\u2019s landfall.", "Figure 1 also indicates that the military response, which began prior to  Katrina\u2019s landfall on August 29, 2005, peaked at more than 70,000 troops\u2014 over 50,000 National Guard and over 20,000 active federal personnel. This  reliance on the National Guard was based on DOD\u2019s Strategy for  Homeland Defense and Civil Support, which was issued in June 2005. The  strategy called for a focused reliance on the National Guard and Reserves  for civil support missions because, among other things, they have key civil  support capabilities and are located in 3,200 communities throughout the  nation. The reliance on the National Guard and Reserves represents a  departure from past catastrophes when active-duty forces played a larger  role in the response. For example, during the military response to  Hurricane Andrew, the National Guard provided less than 20 percent of  the more than 30,000 military responders.", "Most of the National Guard response to Hurricane Katrina came from  outside Louisiana and Mississippi, with the National Guard Bureau acting  as a conduit to communicate requirements for assistance in Louisiana and  Mississippi to the adjutants general in the rest of the country. The  adjutants general of other states, with the authorization of their state  governors, then sent their National Guard troops to Louisiana and  Mississippi under emergency assistance agreements between the states.  Requirements for out-of-state National Guard or federal assistance were  increased because thousands of National Guard personnel from  Mississippi and Louisiana were already mobilized for other missions and  thus unavailable when Hurricane Katrina struck their states. The National  Guard troops that had been mobilized from within the affected states were  able to quickly deploy to where they were needed because they had  trained and planned for disaster mobilizations within their states. The  deployment of out-of-state forces, though quick when compared to past  catastrophes, took longer because mobilization plans were developed and  units were identified for deployment in the midst of the crisis. By Monday,  September 5, 2005 (a week after Katrina made landfall), over 13,800 out-of- state National Guard troops were in Louisiana assisting with response and  recovery efforts. However, when the Superdome bus evacuations began on  Thursday, September 1, 2005, only about 1,600 out-of-state National Guard  troops were in Louisiana, fewer than the number of Louisiana National  Guard members who were mobilized for other missions and unavailable  when Katrina made landfall. At the peak of the military\u2019s response, nearly  40,000 National Guard members from other states were supporting  operations in Louisiana and Mississippi\u2014an unprecedented domestic  mobilization.", "In the days after the hurricane passed, considerable confusion surrounded  the employment of military support and many questioned why more  federal ground troops were not sent sooner. According to senior DOD  officials involved in executing DOD\u2019s response to Katrina, DOD was aware  that the situation warranted significant military support and they noted  that the department took steps to proactively deploy federal military  capabilities from all the services to the region. For example, DOD  deployed a joint task force, medical personnel, helicopters, ships from  Texas, Virginia, and Maryland, and construction battalion engineers. Many  of these capabilities were providing assistance or deploying to the area  within hours of Katrina\u2019s landfall. Given the current DOD homeland  defense strategy, which calls for \u201cfocused reliance\u201d on the reserve  components for civil support missions, DOD officials told us that they also  began working with the National Guard Bureau to ensure the mobilization  of National Guard forces from across the country. As the situation  unfolded during the week, concerns about the magnitude of the disaster  led to discussions about the need to deploy additional active-duty forces to  supplement the National Guard forces. After visiting the region and  meeting with the Louisiana Governor on Friday, September 2, 2005, the  President, on the next day, ordered the deployment of over 7,000 active- duty ground troops to the region.", "Data concerning the military response were not always fully documented  in the midst of the Hurricane Katrina crisis, but it is clear that the military  had a huge impact on response and recovery operations. Data from the  active-duty military task force that headed the federal response indicate  that the military  flew thousands of helicopter sorties, rescuing tens of thousands of  people and carrying thousands of tons of cargo, including sandbags to  repair breeches in the levees around New Orleans;    delivered millions of meals ready to eat, gallons of water, and pounds    searched hundreds of thousands of houses in the affected regions;    provided medical treatment to tens of thousands of civilians; and    conducted mosquito spraying missions over more than 1 million acres."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Factors Affected the Military Response", "paragraphs": ["Despite the significant contribution of its massive response, a number of  interrelated factors affected the military\u2019s ability to leverage its resources  to gain situational awareness and effectively organize and execute its  response efforts.

The NRP notes that  following a disaster, state and local governments are responsible for  conducting initial damage assessments, but it also notes that state and  local officials could be overwhelmed in a catastrophe. The NRP addresses  this incongruous situation, where state and local officials who may be  overwhelmed have critical functions to perform during the initial stages of  disaster recovery efforts, by stating that the federal government should  provide a proactive response when state and local officials are  overwhelmed during a catastrophe. However, the NRP does not specify  the proactive means or capabilities the federal government should use to  conduct damage assessments and gain situational awareness when the  responsible state and local officials are overwhelmed.", "The military has significant capabilities to conduct damage assessments  using reconnaissance aircraft and satellite imagery, but our analysis shows  that neither the NRP nor DOD\u2019s Functional Plan 2501 specifically called  for the proactive use of these assets to meet the NRP catastrophic incident  annex\u2019s requirement for a proactive response to catastrophic incidents. In  addition, DOD did not initially receive significant requests for these  capabilities. At FEMA\u2019s request, DOD initially provided three helicopters  to assist in damage assessments. About 4 days after Katrina\u2019s landfall, the  military began providing imagery data from some of its reconnaissance  assets to its forces and civilian agencies. However, the process for sharing  information proved difficult for several reasons. Some information was  classified due to its source and could not be shared directly with civilian  agencies. In addition, some agencies were not able to access some of the  available information because the data files were too large to download to  the agency computers. A National Guard Hurricane Katrina after-action  review reported that the adjutants general (in Mississippi and Louisiana)  required real time imagery that the military community should have been  able to provide, but did not.", "Because state and local officials were overwhelmed and the military\u2019s  extensive reconnaissance capabilities were not effectively leveraged as  part of a proactive federal effort to conduct timely, comprehensive  damage assessments, the military began organizing and deploying its  response without fully understanding the extent of the damage or the  required assistance. According to military officials, available  reconnaissance assets could have provided additional situational  awareness. In contrast, DOD officials told us that almost immediately after  Hurricane Rita struck Louisiana and Texas in September 2005,  considerable surveillance assets were made available to assess damage,  primarily because of lessons learned from Katrina."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Communications Difficulties Affected the Military Response", "paragraphs": ["Hurricane Katrina caused significant damage to the communication  infrastructure in Louisiana and Mississippi, which further contributed to a  lack of situational awareness for military and civilian officials. Katrina  destroyed or severely degraded many commercial landline and cellular  telephone systems, and emergency radio systems were oversubscribed,  making it difficult to establish necessary connections between officials  and responders at the local, state, and federal levels. As a result, it was  difficult for officials to gain situational awareness. Even when local  officials were able to conduct damage assessments, the lack of  communications assets caused delays in the transmitting of the results of  the assessments. Communications problems, like damage assessment  problems, have been long-standing problems that were also highlighted  following Hurricane Andrew in 1992.", "The military, other agencies, and public companies all have extensive  communications assets and capabilities, but the Department of Homeland  Security has responsibility for coordinating the communications portion  of disaster response operations under the NRP. However, neither the NRP,  the Department of Homeland Security, nor DOD fully identified the  extensive military communication capabilities that could be leveraged as  part of a proactive federal response to a catastrophe. In addition, DOD\u2019s  emergency response plan, Functional Plan 2501, addressed internal  military communications requirements, but it did not address the  communication requirements of communities affected by a catastrophic  natural disaster. It also did not address coordination with civilian  responders. Typically, military equipment cannot communicate with  civilian police, fire, and emergency medical systems unless it is augmented  with specialized equipment. While the military and civilian agencies  deployed mobile communication vans that were able to connect different  communications systems that are normally incompatible, the placement of  these vans was not coordinated and some areas had multiple systems  while other areas had no systems at all. Because state and local officials  were overwhelmed and the Department of Homeland Security and DOD  waited for requests for assistance rather than deploying a proactive  response, some of the military\u2019s available communication assets were  never requested or deployed.", "In addition to the coordination challenges, communications challenges  arose within the military response. Some deployed National Guard assets  were underutilized because the states that sent the assets placed  restrictions on their use. The equipment was sent solely to support the  sending states\u2019 units and thus was unavailable for priority use. As a result,  a number of mobile communications vans were collocated at a single site  while other areas remained without communications. In addition, some  National Guard responders were short of equipment. For example, one  National Guard unit deployed to the area of operations with only 5 percent  of its communications personnel and 50 percent of its communication  equipment. As a result of these problems, military forces lacked good  communication between headquarters units and troops on the ground.  While subordinate military commanders are trained to complete their  missions even when they do not have communications with their  headquarters, this lack of communication made it difficult for senior  military leaders to determine which missions had been completed, which  were still ongoing, and what new missions may have surfaced."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Military Encountered Problems Integrating Its Response", "paragraphs": ["The integration of the military response to Hurricane Katrina was affected  by inadequate planning and by a key mobilization statute that limited  DOD\u2019s reserve component members from being involuntarily ordered to  active duty for disaster response. The military did not adequately plan for  the integration of large numbers of deployed troops from different  commands during disaster response operations. For example, a Louisiana  plan to integrate military responders from outside the state called for the  reception of not more than 300 troops per day. However, in the days  following Hurricane Katrina, more than 20,000 National Guard members  from other states arrived in Louisiana to join the response effort, and on  one single day\u2014September 5, 2005\u2014more than 8,500 National Guard  members from other states arrived in Louisiana to join the Katrina  response effort.", "One critical issue that needs to be resolved in any large, integrated  operation is the decision concerning command and control of the forces.  This issue had not been resolved prior to Hurricane Katrina and was a  subject of discussion during the critical first days after Katrina made  landfall. Ultimately, the military took a pragmatic approach to deconflict  the operation with separate active-duty and National Guard chains of  command. The federal forces\u2014the active component and mobilized  Reserve volunteers\u2014were under the command and control of Northern  Command\u2019s Joint Task Force-Katrina, while the National Guard forces,  including those from other states, were under the command and control of  the governors in Mississippi and Louisiana. While response operations  were coordinated across the several chains of command, they were not  integrated, which led to some inefficiencies and duplication of effort. For  example, many responding military units from outside the states were  assigned missions within established geographic boundaries, but the  Louisiana and Mississippi National Guard units had functional missions  that cut across these geographic boundaries. Furthermore, in New  Orleans, the geographic boundaries were not the same as the city district  boundaries. This made coordination with local responders more difficult.  Despite the lack of prior planning to address integration issues, many  efforts were made to integrate the response. For example, active military  representatives were assigned to state emergency operations centers and  the commander of the active forces traveled daily throughout the affected  region coordinating and collaborating with National Guard, and federal,  state, and local civilian officials.", "Because the military had not specifically planned nor decided which parts  of the military response would be handled by the National Guard and  which parts would be handled by the active component and mobilized  reservists, many of the force flow decisions and integration efforts were ad  hoc in the midst of the crisis. Because military plans and exercises had not  provided a means for integrating the response, no one had the total picture  of the forces on the ground, the forces that were on the way, the missions  for which forces had been allocated, and the missions that still needed to  be done. For example, National Guard commanders in Mississippi and  Louisiana were not prepared to receive the division headquarter elements  that were sent from Indiana and Kansas to command the out-of-state  National Guard forces that were arriving in the two states from around the  country.", "A key mobilization statute also affected the integration of the military  response. Title 10 of the United States Code currently limits a unit or  member of a reserve component from being involuntarily ordered to  federal active duty for disaster response. While this restriction applies to  both National Guard and Reserve forces, National Guard forces were  mobilized under both state active duty and Title 32 for Hurricane Katrina.  No similar provisions exist to specifically mobilize Reserve forces for  disaster response, although it is conceivable that if the President declares  a national emergency, reserve component forces could become available  for involuntary activation. As a result, all the Reservists who responded to  Hurricane Katrina were volunteers, and Reservists constituted a relatively  small portion of the response when compared to the National Guard and  active component portions of the response.", "If the military continues to rely on Reserve volunteers it will have difficulty  fully executing DOD\u2019s 2005 civil support strategy that calls for a focused  reliance on both the National Guard and the Reserves.  The strategy notes  that the National Guard is particularly well suited for civil support  missions because it is routinely exercised with local law enforcement and  first responders, experienced in supporting neighboring communities in  times of crisis, and accessible in state active duty and Title 32 status.  However, the strategy also emphasizes the use of the Reserves for  domestic missions. The strategy specifically states that \u201cthe nation needs  to focus particular attention on better using the competencies of National  Guard and Reserve\u201d organizations, and notes that Reserve forces currently  provide many key capabilities. The process of lining up volunteers can be  time-consuming and is more appropriate for mobilizing individuals than it  is for mobilizing entire units or capabilities that may be needed during a  catastrophe.", "In 1993, after Hurricane Andrew, the military was facing a drawdown in  force size and increasing mission requirements, and we issued two reports  related to disaster assistance that addressed the Title 10 limitation. One of  the reports said that, to improve DOD\u2019s response to catastrophic events,  the Congress may want to consider amending Title 10 of the United States  Code to allow reserve component units to be involuntarily activated to  provide disaster assistance. Such a change would have provided DOD with  more flexibility in the use of its total force. However, the limitation has  remained in place. While the mobilization restriction did not limit the  military\u2019s ability to respond to Hurricane Katrina, it could limit DOD\u2019s  ability to respond to future catastrophes if large portions of the active-duty  and National Guard forces are unavailable due to other mission  requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Search and Rescue Plans and Efforts Were Not Coordinated", "paragraphs": ["While tens of thousands of people were rescued after Katrina through the  efforts of military, civil government, and private rescuers, the lack of  clarity in search and rescue plans led to operations that, according to  aviation officials, were not as efficient as they could have been. The NRP  addressed only part of the search and rescue mission, and the National  Search and Rescue Plan had not been updated to reflect the NRP. Under  the United States National Search and Rescue Plan, which was issued in  1999, the Coast Guard ordinarily has responsibility for providing or  arranging maritime search and rescue services, and the Air Force  ordinarily has responsibility for providing or arranging nonmaritime  search and rescue services in the continental United States. The plan also  calls on DOD to support civil search and rescue efforts when the efforts do  not interfere with DOD\u2019s primary military duties, and it states that DOD  and Coast Guard commands should provide their facilities for civil search  and rescue to the fullest extent practicable. While the NRP acknowledges  the existence of the National Search and Rescue Plan, the NRP does not  specifically address how the Coast Guard and the Air Force organizational  responsibilities in the National Search and Rescue Plan coincide with the  NRP\u2019s urban search and rescue annex. That annex lays out organizational  responsibilities for search and rescue during a disaster, but it focuses on  ground rescues.

At least two different locations were assigning search and  rescue tasks to military helicopter pilots operating over New Orleans and  no one had the total picture of the missions that had been resourced and  the missions that still needed to be performed. In accordance with the  National Search and Rescue Plan, the Air Force established a Joint Search  and Rescue Center at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, to manage  Hurricane Katrina search and rescue missions; however, this center was  not set up until September 4, 2005, 6 days after Katrina\u2019s landfall.  Furthermore, the center did not have radar coverage over New Orleans.  After Katrina made landfall, search and rescue helicopters operating in the  New Orleans area were receiving their tasks from either the Coast Guard,  which was based at Belle Chase, Louisiana, or from a task force led by the  Louisiana National Guard, which was operating at the Superdome.  According to Louisiana National Guard officials, they worked with the  Coast Guard to deconflict the aviation operations, but the search and  rescue efforts that were being directed from the two sites were not  integrated. For example, some military aircraft received their direction  from the task for at the Superdome, while others received their direction  from the Coast Guard or the Joint Task Force that was in command of the  active troops on the ground.

Damage assessments are normally to be  conducted by local or state officials during a disaster. However, local and  state officials who are overwhelmed in a catastrophe are unlikely to be  able to conduct timely and comprehensive damage assessments.

The plans and exercises should  specifically address the    use of reconnaissance capabilities to assess damage,    use of communications capabilities to facilitate support to civil  authorities,  integration of active component and National Guard and Reserve  forces,    use of search and rescue capabilities and the military\u2019s role in search  and rescue, and  role the military might be expected to play in logistics.", "Third, since National Guard troops can join response efforts as part of the  federal response or as part of the state response under mutual assistance  agreements, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Chief  of the National Guard Bureau to work with the state governors and  adjutants general to develop and maintain a list of the types of capabilities  the National Guard will likely provide in response to domestic natural  disasters under state-to-state mutual assistance agreements along with the  associated units that could provide these capabilities. In addition, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Chief of the National  Guard Bureau to make this information available to the Northern  Command, U.S. Joint Forces Command, and other organizations with  federal military support to civil authority planning responsibilities.", "Finally, based on the above action by the National Guard Bureau to  identify the National Guard units that are likely to respond to domestic  disasters under state-to-state mutual assistance agreements, we also  recommend that the Secretary of Defense establish milestones and  identify the types of scalable federal military capabilities and the units that  could provide those capabilities in response to the full range of domestic  disasters and catastrophes covered by DOD\u2019s defense support to civil  authorities plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["In a 1993 report we suggested that the Congress may want to consider  removing the statutory restriction on DOD\u2019s authority to involuntarily  activate Reserve units for catastrophic disaster relief.

In addition to partially concurring with our recommendations,  DOD\u2019s made several comments about the report that fell into two broad  categories, DOD\u2019s role during domestic disaster response and its pre- Katrina planning and exercise schedule.", "First, DOD believed the report called for a greater DOD role during  domestic disaster response but noted that it must strike a balance between  its warfighting role overseas and the need to support civil authorities at  home. While DOD said it would continue to work as part of a unified  interagency effort, it said that the goal is to enhance the domestic disaster  response capacities of other agencies. Until that goal is achieved, DOD will  be prepared to respond even more rapidly with more resources to another  catastrophe in the United States. We recognize the need to balance DOD\u2019s  overseas warfighting mission and its domestic response missions. In the  report, we note DOD\u2019s role is primarily that of a supporting agency under  the NRP, and that the nature of the military response will vary depending  on the nature of the emergency. However, given the military\u2019s capabilities,  its response and level of support to civil authorities is likely to be more  significant during large disasters and catastrophes.", "Second, DOD said that the title of the report is misleading because it does  not recognize DOD\u2019s extensive planning and exercise schedule prior to  August 29, 2005, such as specific preparations in response to six 2005  hurricanes. We added additional information about these efforts. However,  we continue to believe that the title accurately reflects the report\u2019s  findings and recommendations. As stated in the report, DOD had  periodically held modest military support to civil authorities exercises but  the exercises used underlying assumptions that were unrealistic in  preparing for a catastrophe. We also note that DOD\u2019s comments  acknowledge the need to improve its plans and exercises. In fact, DOD\u2019s  comments acknowledged the need to conduct at least one fully integrated  major exercise with the Department of Homeland Security each year  rather than the separate exercises that have been conducted in the past.", "DOD also commented on our four recommendations, partially concurring  with each of them. With respect to our first recommendation\u2014to revise  the NRP to fully address the proactive functions that the military will be  expected to perform during a catastrophic incident\u2014DOD  said that  proactive military functions can be identified in all 15 major disaster  scenarios and said it is working with the Department of Homeland  Security to revise the NRP. While DOD stated that the long-term focus of  the U.S. government should be to develop more robust domestic disaster  capabilities within the Department of Homeland Security, it acknowledged  that DOD will need to assume a more robust response role in the interim  period, and when other responders lack the resources and expertise to  handle a particular disaster.", "With respect to our second recommendation that concerned the  development of detailed plans and exercises, DOD listed a number of steps  it is taking to improve its disaster response planning and exercises and  said that consistent with its Strategy for Homeland Defense and Civil  Support the active component should complement, but not duplicate, the  National Guard\u2019s likely role as an early responder. The DOD comments  also said that planning and exercises should include local, state, and  federal representatives and should stress the responders with the highest  degree of realism possible\u2014to the breaking point if possible. However, the  comments said that logistics planning and execution is the clear  responsibility of FEMA and individual states, and DOD would remain  ready in a supporting role. We agree with DOD that effective disaster plans  and exercises require stressing scenarios with the active participation of  representatives from all levels of government. We also agree that FEMA  and states have logistics responsibilities. However, we continue to believe  that DOD should plan and prepare to assume additional emergency  support function responsibilities during catastrophes when other  responders may be overwhelmed.", "DOD also partially concurred with our third recommendation\u2014that the  Chief of the National Guard Bureau work with the state governors and  adjutants general to develop and maintain a list of the types of capabilities  the National Guard will likely provide in response to domestic natural  disasters under state-to-state mutual assistance agreements, along with the  associated units that will provide these capabilities. DOD said that it was  not feasible to identify the specific units that would provide these  capabilities and requested that we modify our recommendation to say  units that \u201ccould\u201d provide these capabilities rather than units that \u201cwill\u201d  provide those capabilities. We agree and have adjusted our  recommendation. In addition, DOD listed steps the U.S. Northern  Command is taking to better understand the capabilities of National Guard  units and it stated that the National Guard is creating a database to  facilitate planning its employment in support of the homeland. As part of  the database implementation, the National Guard Bureau has identified a  need to place a contractor in each of its Joint Force Headquarters-State  locations.", "Finally, DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that it identify  the types of scaleable federal military capabilities and units that will  provide those capabilities in response to the full range of domestic  disasters and catastrophes covered by DOD\u2019s defense support to civil  authorities plans. DOD noted that it has developed scalable capability  packages in conjunction with pre-scripted requests for assistance and  Northern Command\u2019s Contingency Plan 2501, which is scheduled to be  signed in the spring of 2006. However, because DOD\u2019s forces can be used  to meet many different types of missions, DOD requested that we modify  our recommendation to say identify the types of scaleable federal military  capabilities and units that \u201ccould\u201d (rather than \u201cwill\u201d) provide those  capabilities. We agree and have adjusted our recommendation.", "DOD also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as  appropriate.

In analyzing these documents and others, we determined the extent to  which they addressed a mechanism for the integration of forces and  established a process to identify and communicate the military capabilities  available to civil authorities or those that could be sent by DOD following  a disaster or catastrophic event. We also reviewed after-action reports  from training exercises to determine whether assumptions for the  exercises were realistic in light of recent catastrophic disasters, to  establish the level of military involvement in recent disaster planning  exercises, and to determine whether the training scenarios exercised  available military capabilities. We discussed our analysis with officials  from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland  Defense, Northern Command, the National Guard Bureau, and others to  determine the extent to which the directives, plans, and lessons from  exercises adequately supported the military\u2019s response to civil authority  after Hurricane Katrina.", "To examine the support that the military provided in responding to Katrina  and factors that affected that response, we obtained briefings and reports  describing the military\u2019s response to Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana and  Mississippi. We compared and contrasted data collected and resolved  discrepancies through interviews with officials from DOD, state National  Guard forces, Joint Task Force Katrina, and service, and state officials. We  specifically examined the time line of the military\u2019s response, the size and  nature of the forces that responded, and the challenges faced in  supporting civil authorities. To compare this response to prior military  responses, accounting for differences in storms, we analyzed testimony  and reports about the military\u2019s response to other natural disasters. We  analyzed relevant documents and lessons learned reports from the military  to specifically examine the damage assessment, logistics, communication,  search and rescue, and security/law enforcement response to determine if  previously identified concerns had been addressed prior to Hurricane  Katrina.", "Additionally, to determine what actions, if any, the military is taking to  address lessons learned from Katrina, we collected and analyzed briefings  and lessons learned reports from organizations participating in the  response.

We continue to believe that \u201cDOD is beginning to  take action\u201d is accurate.  3.  Our report distinguishes between disasters and catastrophes and  emphasizes the need to plan for extensive use of DOD capabilities  during catastrophes, when other responders are overwhelmed.  Our  report does not call for expanded use of DOD capabilities during  disasters.  4.

Our report makes reference to DOD\u2019s use of reconnaissance assets  during Hurricane Rita.  11. While we have added additional information about DOD\u2019s integration  efforts, these additional efforts do not diminish our finding that  integration problems led to inefficiencies and duplication of effort.  12. Although aviation officials expressed safety concerns to us, we agree  that the fact that military search and rescue efforts were conducted  under extreme conditions without any aviation accidents constitutes a  considerable accomplishment, so we have revised our search and  rescue section.  13. We evaluated these technical comments and incorporated them as  appropriate.  14. Our report recognizes that the military forces, which responded to  Hurricane Katrina, were operating within existing regulatory and  policy guidelines, such as the NRP, DOD\u2019s Strategy for Homeland  Defense and Civil Support, and the current mobilization authorities,  and the report recommends adjustments to some of these guidelines.   15. The focus of this report was the preparation for and response to  Hurricane Katrina, not Hurricanes Rita and Wilma. However, where  appropriate, we have incorporated information about lessons learned  from Katrina, such as the use of reconnaissance assets to assess  damage from Hurricane Rita.  16. We modified the report to show that commands had issued planning  and warning orders prior to Katrina\u2019s landfall. However, our report  emphasizes the need for deliberative, advanced planning in addition to  crisis action planning.   17. We continue to believe that the solution to long-standing damage  assessment problems requires military involvement.  18. The First Army comments provide additional information about the  aviation picture over New Orleans, but as stated in the report, search  and rescue tasks were being assigned from two sites that were not  integrated. This led to some duplication of effort.  19. Military officials told us that many of their troops worked directly   with local officials and performed whatever tasks were most needed.  They said that many of these tasks were not captured in official  statistics or mission assignments.  20.
