In the months to follow, thousands of people who returned to the area to live and work, as well as responders who were involved in the search for remains and site cleanup, were also exposed. In addition, people in New York City and across the country were exposed to the emotional trauma of a terrorist attack on American soil. Concerns have been raised about the short- and long-term physical and mental health effects of the attack. Various government agencies and private organizations established efforts to monitor and understand these health effects. GAO was asked to describe the health effects that have been observed in the aftermath of the WTC attack and the efforts that are in place to monitor and understand those health effects. GAO searched bibliographic databases such as Medline to determine the pertinent scientific literature, reviewed that literature, and interviewed and reviewed documents from government officials, health professionals, and officials of labor groups."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In the aftermath of the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center, a wide variety of physical and mental health effects have been reported in the scientific literature. The primary health effects include various injuries, respiratory conditions, and mental health effects. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, the primary injuries were inhalation and musculoskeletal injuries. During the 10-month cleanup period, despite the dangerous work site, responders reported few injuries that resulted in lost workdays. A range of respiratory conditions have also been reported, including wheezing, shortness of breath, sinusitis, asthma, and a new syndrome called WTC cough, which consists of persistent cough accompanied by severe respiratory symptoms. Almost all the firefighters who responded to the attack experienced respiratory effects, and hundreds had to end their firefighting careers due to WTC-related respiratory illness. Unlike the physical health effects, the mental health effects were not limited to people in the WTC area but were also experienced nationwide. Because most of the information about mental health effects comes from questionnaire or survey data, what is reported in most cases are symptoms associated with a psychiatric disorder, rather than a clinical diagnosis of disorder. The most commonly reported mental health effects include symptoms associated with depression, stress, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)--a disorder that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event and includes such symptoms as intrusive memories and distressing dreams--as well as behavioral effects such as increased use of alcohol and tobacco and difficulty coping with daily responsibilities. Six programs were established to monitor and understand the health effects of the attack, and these programs vary in terms of which people are eligible to participate, methods for collecting information about the health effects, options for treatment referral, and number of years people will be monitored. Although five of the programs focus on various responder populations, the largest program--the WTC Health Registry--is open not only to responders but also to people living or attending school in the vicinity of the WTC site, or working or present in the vicinity on September 11. The monitoring programs vary in their methods for identifying those who may require treatment, and although none of these programs are funded to provide treatment, they provide varying options for treatment referral. Under current plans, HHS funding for the programs will not extend beyond 2009. Some long-term health effects, such as lung cancer, may not appear until several decades after a person has been exposed to a harmful agent. GAO provided a draft of this testimony to DHS, EPA, HHS, and the Department of Labor. In its written comments, HHS noted that the testimony does not include significant discussion of ways in which mental health symptoms have changed over time. The evidence GAO examined did not support a full discussion of changes in mental or physical health effects over time."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to be here today as you discuss the health  effects of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the World Trade  Center (WTC).

We searched 19  bibliographic databases such as Medline to determine the pertinent  literature. The studies of health effects vary in study design, measures  used, survey instruments, time periods, and populations studied, and thus  in many cases the reported results cannot be directly compared. The  federal, state, and local officials we interviewed were from the U.S.  Departments of Defense (DOD), Education, Health and Human Services  (HHS), Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (DOJ), Labor (DOL), and  Veterans Affairs (VA); the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); the  New York State Department of Health; the New York State Office of  Mental Health; and the New York City Department of Health and Mental  Hygiene.

Almost 3,000 people, including some who  were trapped above the impact zone and others who entered the buildings  to assist in the evacuation, were killed in the attack. The majority of the  estimated 16,400 to 18,800 people who were in the WTC complex that  morning were able to evacuate, however, with minor or no injuries. An  estimated 40,000 responders were at or in the vicinity of the WTC site or  the Staten Island Fresh Kills landfill, participating in rescue, recovery, and  cleanup efforts; conducting environmental and occupational health  assessments; providing crisis counseling and other treatment; providing  security; and assisting with the criminal investigation.", "The responders included personnel from many agencies at the federal,  state, and local levels, as well as from organizations in the private sector,  and various other workers and volunteers.

FDNY  sought federal support in order to provide comprehensive medical  evaluations to its firefighters, and established its WTC Medical Monitoring  Program (referred to here as the FDNY program). The Mount Sinai Clinical  Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine also sought federal  support in the weeks following the attack to develop its WTC Worker and  Volunteer Medical Monitoring Program (referred to here as the Mount  Sinai program). Through its Federal Occupational Health (FOH) services,  HHS initiated a WTC responder screening program for federal workers  (referred to here as the FOH program) involved in WTC rescue, recovery,  and cleanup activities. Similarly, the New York State Department of Health  established the medical monitoring program for New York State  responders (referred to here as the NYS program) engaged in emergency  activities related to the September 11 attack. In addition, two registries  were established to compile lists of exposed persons and collect  information through interviews and surveys in order to provide a basis for  understanding the health effects of the attack. The New York City  Department of Health and Mental Hygiene contacted ATSDR in February  2002 to develop the WTC Health Registry. ATSDR provided technical  assistance to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene  and worked with FEMA to obtain funds for the WTC Health Registry for  responders and people living or attending school in the vicinity of the WTC  site, or working or present in the vicinity on September 11.

These numbers do not  include injured people who may have been treated in more distant New  York State, New Jersey, and Connecticut hospitals, in triage stations, or  by private physicians, and those who did not seek professional treatment.  More detailed information on injuries is available from the four hospitals  closest to the WTC and a fifth hospital that served as a burn referral  center. According to the New York City Department of Health and Mental  Hygiene, between September 11 and September 13, 2001, these hospitals  treated 790 people, 2 of whom later died, for injuries related to the attack  (CDC, 2002c). The most common of these injuries were musculoskeletal  injuries\u2014such as fractures, sprains, and crush injuries\u2014and inhalation  injuries.

The disaster site was considered to be extremely  dangerous, yet no additional life was lost after September 11. Using data  from five Disaster Medical Assistance Teams (DMAT) temporary medical  facilities and the four hospitals closest to the WTC site, researchers  documented 5,222 visits by rescue workers to DMAT facilities and  emergency rooms in the first month of the cleanup period (Berrios-Torres  et al., 2003). During this month, musculoskeletal injuries were the leading  cause of rescue worker visits and hospitalizations. Other injuries included  burns and eye injuries. According to OSHA, despite logging more than   3.7 million work hours over the 10-month cleanup period, WTC site  workers reported only 57 injuries that OSHA classified as serious because  they resulted in lost workdays, yielding a lost workday injury rate of   3.1 injuries per 100 workers per year.

The most commonly reported conditions include cough,  wheezing, shortness of breath, sinusitis, and asthma. Many of the findings  on respiratory effects published to date have focused on firefighters, and  FDNY medical staff first described WTC cough, which consists of  persistent cough accompanied by severe respiratory symptoms, often in  conjunction with sinusitis, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease  (GERD).

Within 48 hours of the  attack, FDNY found that about 90 percent of its 10,116 firefighters and  EMS workers who were evaluated at the WTC site reported an acute  cough. The FDNY Bureau of Health Services also noted wheezing,  sinusitis, sore throats, asthma, and GERD among firefighters who had  been on the scene. During the first 6 months after the attack, FDNY  observed that of the 9,914 firefighters who were present at the WTC site  within 7 days of the collapse, 332 firefighters had WTC cough (Prezant et  al., 2002). Eighty-seven percent of the firefighters with WTC cough  reported symptoms of GERD. According to the FDNY Bureau of Health  Services, symptoms of GERD are typically reported by less than 25 percent  of patients with chronic cough. Some FDNY firefighters exhibited WTC  cough that was severe enough for them to require at least 4 weeks of  medical leave. Despite treatment of all symptoms, 173 of the   332 firefighters and one EMS technician with WTC cough showed only  partial improvement. FDNY also found that the risk of reactive airway  dysfunction syndrome, or irritant-induced asthma, and WTC cough was  associated with intensity of the exposure, defined as the time of arrival at  the site (Banauch et al., 2003). In addition, FDNY reports that one  firefighter who worked 16-hour days for 13 days and did not use  respiratory protection during the first 7 to 10 days was diagnosed with a  rare form of pneumonia that results from acute high dust exposure (Rom  et al., 2002). According to an official from the FDNY Bureau of Health  Services, because one of the criteria for being a firefighter is having no  respiratory illness, about 380 firefighters were no longer able to serve as  firefighters as of March 2004 as a consequence of respiratory illnesses they  developed after WTC exposure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other WTC Responders", "paragraphs": ["Studies and screenings conducted among other responders\u2014carpenters,  cleanup workers, federal civilian employees, heavy equipment operators,  ironworkers, mechanics, National Guard members, police officers,  telecommunications technicians, truck drivers, and U.S. Army military  personnel\u2014have found respiratory health effects similar to those seen in  FDNY firefighters. Some of the responders with existing respiratory  conditions reported that symptoms worsened, and others reported that  they developed new respiratory symptoms on or after September 11. The  most commonly reported symptom was cough. For example, about   63 percent of officers from NYPD\u2019s Emergency Services Unit who were  evaluated about 1 to 4 months after September 11 reported having a cough  (Salzman et al., 2004). Other symptoms observed among responders  included chest tightness, nasal congestion, shortness of breath, sore  throat, and wheezing. Unpublished results from respiratory health  assessments of WTC site workers\u2014including truck drivers, heavy  equipment operators, mechanics, laborers, and carpenters\u2014conducted by  Johns Hopkins in December 2001 show that among those who reported no  previous history of lower respiratory symptoms, 34 percent reported  developing a cough and 19 percent reported wheezing. While some  responders reported that symptoms improved or resolved a few months  after the attack, others reported that they continued to experience  symptoms. For example, initial results from screenings of 250 participants  in Mount Sinai\u2019s monitoring program show that 46 percent of these  responders were still experiencing at least one pulmonary symptom and  52 percent were still experiencing an ear, nose, or throat symptom 9  months after the attack (Herbert and Levin, 2003)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "People Living or Working in Lower Manhattan", "paragraphs": ["Surveys conducted among people living or working in lower Manhattan  show that these people experienced respiratory health effects similar to  those experienced by responders, such as nose or throat irritation and  cough.

A NIOSH  survey of federal employees working near the WTC site found that   56 percent of respondents reported having a cough (Trout et al., 2002).  Other symptoms observed among those living or working in lower  Manhattan include chest tightness, head or sinus congestion, shortness of  breath, and wheezing. Some people reported that the WTC collapse and its  aftermath exacerbated existing respiratory conditions, such as asthma,  and others reported symptoms that developed after September 11, 2001.  For example, a review of medical charts of children with existing asthma  from a lower Manhattan clinic found that after September 11 there was a  significant increase in asthma-related clinic visits among children who  lived within 5 miles of the WTC site (Szema et al., 2004).

In addition, researchers  affiliated with the New York University School of Medicine\u2019s Child Study  Center\u2019s bereavement program for families of uniformed personnel killed  in responding to the WTC attacks noted that the psychological and  emotional reactions of children and adolescents directly affected by the  attacks have diminished somewhat over time but that some children  continue to be affected by the emotional state and coping difficulties of  their parents. Of particular concern to these researchers are the widowed  mothers, who are experiencing sustained distress at twice the level  typically found in the general population and are having difficulty coping  with their daily responsibilities, such as single parenthood, almost 3 years  later. Some responders, such as members of FDNY, also report having  difficulty coping in the aftermath of September 11."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Programs Established to Monitor and Understand Health Effects Vary in Eligibility Requirements, Methods, Treatment Referrals, and Duration", "paragraphs": ["The programs established to monitor and understand the health effects of  the attack vary in terms of which people are eligible to participate,  methods for collecting information about the health effects, options for  treatment referral, and number of years people will be monitored.

Although five of the programs focus on various  responder populations, the largest program\u2014the WTC Health Registry\u2014is  open not only to responders but also to people living or attending school  in the vicinity of the WTC site, or working or present in the vicinity on  September 11. Specifically, people eligible for participation in the WTC  Health Registry include anyone who was in a building, on the street, or on  the subway south of Chambers Street on September 11; residents and staff  of or students enrolled in schools (prekindergarten through twelfth grade)  or day care centers south of Canal Street on September 11; and those  involved in rescue, recovery, cleanup, or other activities at the WTC site  and/or WTC recovery operations on Staten Island anytime between  September 11, 2001, and June 30, 2002. (See figure 1.) An estimated  250,000 to 400,000 people are eligible for the WTC Health Registry;  however, the registry was planned with the expectation that 100,000 to  200,000 people would enroll. Together the FDNY program and the Mount  Sinai program cover more than half of the estimated 40,000 WTC  responders. The FDNY program is open to all 11,000 FDNY firefighters  and all 3,500 FDNY EMS technicians, including firefighters and technicians  who were not exposed. Some 12,000 other responders are eligible to  participate in the Mount Sinai program. Responders who were government  employees are eligible for participation in programs such as the FOH  program, which is open to the estimated 10,000 federal workers who  responded to the WTC attacks, and the NYS program, which was open to  about 9,800 New York State employees and New York National Guard  personnel who were directed to respond to the WTC disaster. In addition,  approximately 12,000 members from three NYC unions and the NYC  Department of Sanitation, whether they were responders or not, were  eligible to participate in the Johns Hopkins registry.", "R e c t o r Concerns have been raised by community and labor representatives  regarding the eligibility requirements for some of these programs, and  while changes have been made to accommodate some of these concerns,  others remain unresolved, particularly with respect to the WTC Health  Registry. For example, the eligibility criteria for participation in the Mount  Sinai program were initially more restrictive, covering responders who  had been at the site at least 24 hours between September 11 and 14, 2001.  After discussions with labor representatives and CDC officials, the  program expanded its eligibility criteria to include additional responders  who may not have been there on those days but were there later in  September. In contrast, community and labor representatives have been  unsuccessful in their attempts to expand the eligibility criteria of the WTC  Health Registry. These representatives have noted that the geographic  boundaries used by the registry exclude office workers below Chambers  Street who were not at work on September 11 but returned to work in the  following weeks; office workers, including several groups of city  employees, working between Chambers and Canal Streets; and Brooklyn  residents who may have been exposed to the cloud of dust and smoke.  Registry officials told us that they understand the desire to be included but  they believe coverage is adequate to provide a basis for understanding the  health effects of the WTC attack."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Monitoring Methods and Options for Treatment Referral", "paragraphs": ["The monitoring programs vary in their methods for identifying those who  may require treatment, and although none of these programs are funded to  provide treatment, they provide varying options for treatment referral.  Some programs refer participants to affiliated treatment programs,  whereas others provide information on where participants can seek care.  The FDNY program offers a comprehensive medical evaluation that  includes collection of blood and urine for analysis, a pulmonary function  test, a chest X-ray, a renal toxicity evaluation, a cardiogram, a hepatitis C  test, and hearing and vision tests, as well as self-administered  questionnaires on exposures and physical and mental health. Funds for the  monitoring program do not cover treatment services. However, FDNY  members who require treatment after being screened can obtain treatment  and counseling services from the FDNY Bureau of Health Services and the  FDNY Counseling Services Unit as a benefit of their employment.  Similarly, under the Mount Sinai program, people receive a comprehensive  physical examination that includes blood and urine analysis, a chest X-ray,  a pulmonary function test, and complete self-administered as well as  nurse-administered questionnaires on exposure, clinical history, and  mental health. If a person requires follow-up medical care or mental  health services but is unable to pay for the services, he or she can be  referred for care to other Mount Sinai programs such as the Health for  Heroes program, which is supported through philanthropic donations.", "The FOH and NYS programs also consist of medical evaluations of  participants and self-administered health and exposure questionnaires.  The FOH program conducted about 400 medical evaluations of federal  workers. These evaluations included a physical examination, a pulmonary  function test, a chest X-ray, and blood tests. Under the NYS program, the  New York State Department of Civil Service Employee Health Service  clinics or affiliated clinics conducted medical evaluations that included a  physical examination and a pulmonary evaluation of almost 1,700 state  workers. The questionnaires for both programs are more limited than the  FDNY or Mount Sinai questionnaires; for example, they have fewer mental  health questions. Under the FOH and NYS programs, workers who require  care have been told to follow up with their primary care physicians under  their own insurance.", "Unlike most of the other monitoring programs, the WTC Health Registry  and the Johns Hopkins registry do not include a medical evaluation, and  neither effort is affiliated with a treatment facility or program. Instead, the  programs collect information from participants solely through  questionnaires and provide information on where participants can seek  care. The WTC Health Registry questionnaire is generally administered  over the telephone. The program provides all participants with a resource  guide of occupational, respiratory, environmental, and mental health  facilities in New York State, New Jersey, and Connecticut where people  can seek treatment. Some of the services provided by these facilities  require health insurance, whereas others are free of charge. If in the  course of a telephone questionnaire, a person\u2019s responses to the mental  health questions suggest that he or she may need to speak with a mental  health professional, the person is given the option of being connected  directly to a LIFENET counselor. The LIFENET counselor provides the  person with information on where to go and whom to call for help with  problems related to the WTC disaster. For the Johns Hopkins registry, the  participants complete a mail-in questionnaire on physical and mental  health. Responders who report mental health symptoms and agree to be  recontacted may receive follow-up calls to refer them to mental health  services. The referral process is facilitated by Columbia University\u2019s  Resiliency Program, which provides free, short-term mental health  services to affected people. The Johns Hopkins registry also provides  participants with brochures about health services and programs they may  find useful, including information about the Mount Sinai program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Duration and Funding", "paragraphs": ["The duration of the monitoring programs may not be long enough to fully  capture critical information on health effects. Under current plans, HHS  funding for the programs will not extend beyond 2009. For example,  ATSDR entered into a cooperative agreement with the New York City  Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in fiscal year 2003 with the  intent to continue support of the WTC Health Registry for 5 years of its  planned 20-year duration. Similarly, NIOSH awarded 5-year grants in July  2004 to continue the FDNY and Mount Sinai programs, which had begun in  2001 and 2002, respectively. Health experts involved in the monitoring  programs, however, cite the need for long-term monitoring of affected  groups because some possible health effects, such as cancer, do not  appear until several decades after a person has been exposed to a harmful  agent. They also emphasize that monitoring is important for identifying  and assessing the occurrence of newly identified conditions, such as WTC  cough, and chronic conditions, such as asthma."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Collaboration", "paragraphs": ["Although the monitoring programs began as separate efforts, some of the  programs are collaborating with each other.

It was established by NIOSH in March 2004  to coordinate the existing health monitoring of WTC responders initiated  by the FDNY and Mount Sinai programs and to facilitate data sharing. It  awarded $81 million in 5-year grants to six institutions to become clinical  centers for WTC health monitoring. FDNY and Mount Sinai serve as  coordinating centers under the consortium, and the other four institutions  are coordinated with Mount Sinai. Together, these institutions will  provide follow-up health evaluations to a total of about 12,000 NYC  firefighters and EMS technicians and up to 12,000 other WTC responders.", "Collaboration efforts have also been fostered between the monitoring  programs and outside partners and researchers. For example, the WTC  Registry has a Scientific Advisory Group that includes representatives  from the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, FDNY, the Johns Hopkins  University, Columbia University, Hunter College, New York Academy of  Medicine, New York University, the New York State Department of Health,  and the New Jersey Department of Health. The group has assisted the New  York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and ASTDR in  development of the WTC Registry protocol, selection of the eligible  population, and analysis methods. It has been meeting with WTC officials  quarterly since early 2002 to advise on such issues as data collection, study  options, and guidelines for research studies to be done using the registry.", "In addition, EPA convened an expert review panel in March 2004 to obtain  greater input on ongoing efforts to monitor the health effects of workers  and residents affected by the WTC collapse. The panel consists of  representatives from federal and NYC agencies involved in air monitoring;  from WTC health effects monitoring programs; and from academic  institutions and the affected community. The goals of the panel include  identification of unmet public health needs, gaps in exposure data, gaps in  efforts to understand the health effects of the WTC attack, and ways in  which the WTC Health Registry could be enhanced to allow better tracking  of workers and residents."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["A multitude of physical and mental health effects have been reported in  the years since the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on  September 11, 2001, but the full health impact of the attack is unknown.
