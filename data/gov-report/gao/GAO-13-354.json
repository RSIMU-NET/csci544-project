GAO was asked to examine how the agencies have implemented the MOU.", "This report examines: (1) the extent to which the agencies have established mechanisms through which the MOU can be implemented and monitored; and (2) key challenges the agencies face in implementing the MOU and the progress made in overcoming them. To conduct this work, GAO interviewed VA and IHS officials and reviewed agency documents and reports. GAO also obtained perspectives of tribal communities through attendance at two tribal conferences; interviews with tribal leaders and other tribal members, including veterans; and interviews with other stakeholders, such as health policy experts and consultants."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Indian Health Service (IHS) have developed mechanisms to implement and monitor their memorandum of understanding (MOU); however, the performance metrics developed to assess its implementation do not adequately measure progress made toward its goals. VA and IHS have defined common goals for implementing the MOU and developed strategies to achieve them. They have also created two mechanisms to implement the MOU--12 workgroups with members from both agencies to address the goals of the MOU, and a Joint Implementation Task Force, comprised of VA and IHS officials, to oversee the MOU's implementation. These steps are consistent with practices that GAO has found enhance and sustain agency collaboration. The agencies have also developed three metrics aimed at measuring progress toward the MOU's goals. However, two of the three metrics are inadequate because their connection to any specific MOU goal is not clear and, while they include quantitative measures that tally the number of programs and activities increased or enhanced as a result of the MOU, they lack qualitative measures that would allow the agencies to assess the degree to which the desired results are achieved. The weaknesses in these metrics could limit the ability of VA and IHS managers to gauge progress and make decisions about whether to expand or modify their programs and activities.", "VA and IHS face unique challenges associated with consulting with a large number of diverse, sovereign tribes to implement the MOU, and lack fully effective processes to overcome these complexities. VA and IHS officials told us the large number (566 federally recognized tribes) and differing customs and policy-making structures present logistical challenges in widespread implementation of the MOU within tribal communities. They also told us that tribal sovereignty--tribes' inherent right to govern and protect the health, safety, and welfare of tribal members--adds further complexity because tribes may choose whether or not to participate in MOU-related activities. Consistent with internal controls, VA and IHS have processes in place to consult with tribes on MOU-related activities through written correspondence and in-person meetings. However, according to tribal stakeholders GAO spoke with, these processes are often ineffective and have not always met the needs of the tribes, and the agencies have acknowledged that effective consultation has been challenging. For example, one tribal community expressed concern that agency correspondence is not always timely because it is sent to tribal leaders who are sometimes not the tribal members designated to take action on health care matters. Similarly, some tribal stakeholders told GAO that the agencies have not been responsive to tribal input and that sometimes they simply inform tribes of steps they have taken without consulting them. VA and IHS have taken steps to improve consultation with tribes. For example, VA has established an Office of Tribal Government Relations, through which it is developing relationships with tribal leaders and other tribal stakeholders. Additionally, in Alaska, VA has been consulting with a tribal health organization for insight on reaching tribes. However, given the concerns raised by the tribal stakeholders GAO spoke with, further efforts may be needed to enhance tribal consultation to implement and achieve the goals of the MOU."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the agencies take steps to improve the performance metrics used to assess MOU implementation and to develop better processes to consult with tribes.

This 2010 MOU outlined mutual goals for the  agencies\u2019 collaboration and coordination of resources and care in  providing health care services to Native American veterans.

However, questions have  been raised by members of Congress about the extent of collaboration  between the two agencies. For example, a 2012 Senate report noted that  stronger partnerships among VA, IHS, and tribally operated health  facilities are essential to ensuring Native American veterans have access  to health care services. We were asked to examine how the agencies  have implemented the MOU.

We attended a  VA tribal consultation on MOU implementation at the National Indian  Health Board Consumer Conference in Denver, Colorado, in September  2012, and attended the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI)  Annual Conference in Sacramento, California, in October 2012. At the  NCAI conference, we conducted listening sessions for tribal members to  solicit their views on MOU implementation. We also interviewed various  other tribal health representatives outside of the listening sessions and  the conferences. In all, we interviewed 34 tribal members and other  representatives (collectively referred to in this report as tribal  stakeholders), including tribal leaders, tribal veterans, tribal health  directors and administrators, and tribal health policy experts and  consultants. The tribes represented in our interviews were geographically  varied, including representation from 9 IHS Areas and 10 Veterans  Integrated Service Networks and included representation from tribes that  varied in size from approximately 500 members to 310,000 members.

Absent this information, it is not clear how the  agencies could draw conclusions about whether improved  communication has actually been facilitated and therefore how well  the activity contributed to meeting the MOU goal of promoting patient- centered collaboration and facilitating communication.", "According to the metrics report, for Metric 2 (outreach activities  increased or enhanced as a result of MOU partnerships), eight types  of activities were increased or enhanced. However, the report lists  only seven types of outreach and does not include enough information  to determine how well the outreach contributes to meeting MOU  goals.

However, while outreach activities are measurable and tangible,  and might help to achieve goals of the MOU, the report does not state  how the agencies will determine whether the sessions actually were  effective in improving patient care or increasing access, information  that is necessary to allow the agencies to tell how well the activity  helps achieve the MOU goals.", "For each metric, the agencies report whether the activities \u201cmet the  purpose of the MOU,\u201d \u201cmet the intent of the MOU,\u201d and whether the  \u201clevel of VA-IHS-Tribal participation\u201d was poor, fair, good, or excellent.

For instance, according to some VA officials,  in some tribes as a matter of protocol, an agency must be invited on tribal  lands or be sponsored by a council member in order to address a tribal  council. Such a policy could add administrative processes that might  delay implementation and require greater sensitivity from agency officials,  adding to the challenge of consulting with tribes. As another example, the  title or position of the tribal person designated to make decisions  regarding health care may differ from tribe to tribe, complicating the  decision-making process among VA, IHS, and tribes. VA officials told us  in some tribes, for example, a tribal leader may have several roles, only  one of which is making decisions on health care, whereas in other tribes  there may be a tribal health director whom the tribal leader has  designated to manage health care in the tribal community. Potentially,  these differences can affect the speed and degree at which collective  decisions can be made.", "In addition, VA and IHS officials noted that tribal sovereignty further adds  to the logistical complexity of the efforts of the agencies to implement the  MOU. Tribal sovereignty includes the inherent right to govern and protect  the health, safety, and welfare of tribal members. Indian tribes have a  legal and political government-to-government relationship with the federal  government, meaning federal agencies interact with tribes as  governments, not as special interest groups or individuals. VA and IHS  officials told us that because of tribal sovereignty, tribally operated  facilities may choose whether or not to participate in a particular  opportunity for collaboration related to the MOU, which makes it  challenging to achieve some of the goals of the MOU. VA and IHS can  inform tribes of an opportunity but cannot require them to participate.

However, the agencies  have acknowledged that because of the large and diverse nature of the  tribes, they have struggled to reach the tribal member designated to make  health care decisions with information about the MOU. Both VA officials  and members of tribal communities told us that, because tribal leaders  are not always the tribal person designated to make decisions regarding  health care, the \u201cDear Tribal Leader\u201d letters may not always make their  way to tribal members designated to take action on health care matters.  VA officials told us that their formal consultation is conducted with tribal  leaders. However, these officials also noted that, in addition to the letters  sent to tribal leaders, they have a network of contacts within each tribe  that includes, among others, tribal health directors, and this network  receives concurrent notice of communication with tribal leaders via  conference calls, listservs, and newsletters. IHS officials said sometimes,  in addition to the tribal leader, they may also send letters to, or otherwise  communicate directly with, tribal health program directors if they know of  them. However, they also noted they do not maintain a specific record\u2014 such as a listserv\u2014of tribal health program directors. Without reaching  the tribal members responsible for decision-making on healthcare  matters, VA and IHS may not always be effectively communicating with  tribes about the status of the MOU and its related activities nor be  obtaining tribal feedback that is critical with respect to implementation of  the MOU.", "Likewise, seven tribal stakeholders we spoke with noted similar concerns  regarding the \u201cDear Tribal Leader\u201d letters as VA and IHS. For example,  one tribal stakeholder said letters should go to a specific person, such as  a tribal health director, to ensure that the information is seen by the right  people in a timely manner. It may take the tribes time to pass along letters  sent only to tribal leaders to the tribal health director or other appropriate  people, by which point any deadlines included in the correspondence  could be missed. Once the information has reached the tribal leader,  tribes bear the responsibility to ensure it is passed on to the appropriate  audience in a timely manner.", "Another specific concern tribal stakeholders that we spoke with  expressed relating to written correspondence was that the agencies  sometimes use the letters to simply inform them of steps the agencies  have taken without consulting the tribes, as called for by the agencies\u2019  tribal consultation policies. For example, some tribal stakeholders said VA  and IHS did not include them in the original development of the 2010  MOU, even though the goals and activities in the MOU could directly  affect them. According to 10 of the tribal stakeholders we spoke with,  tribes should have been included in developing the MOU, which  addresses proposed plans, policies, and programmatic actions that may  affect tribes. For example, the MOU seeks to improve delivery of health  care by developing and implementing new models of care using new  technologies, including telehealth services such as telepsychiatry.  Instead, the agencies solicited tribal comments after the agencies had  signed the MOU. According to two tribal stakeholders, the agencies were  not responsive to the comments provided on the MOU. One stakeholder  said their comments were not acknowledged upon receipt nor did IHS  ever follow up on the issues raised by their comments. The stakeholder  suggested IHS designate a point person to track feedback and ensure  follow-up. VA and IHS officials told us that they did not hold tribal  consultation meetings before the signing of the MOU because they  viewed the MOU as an agency-to-agency agreement rather than as an  agreement between the agencies and the various tribes.", "VA and IHS officials said they hold quarterly meetings with tribal  communities and also attend events, such as conferences held by Native  American interest organizations. Three tribal stakeholders told us that  when the agencies have held consultation meetings, the meetings are not  interactive enough\u2014stating that agency officials speak for the majority of  the time\u2014and that VA does not provide enough information prior to these  meetings. These tribal stakeholders said providing information ahead of  time could allow tribes to better prepare for meetings, discuss issues as a  tribe beforehand, and determine which tribal members should attend. If  tribal officials with the authority and desire to work with VA and IHS do not  receive needed information on opportunities because of an ineffective  consultation process, local facility leadership may not have readily  available access to information necessary to examine which collaborative  opportunities are present, and thus VA and IHS may be hindered in their  efforts to coordinate health care for Native American veterans.", "VA and IHS are undertaking other efforts designed to enhance  consultation with tribes. These include the following steps:  In January 2011, VA established the Office of Tribal Government  Relations (OTGR) to serve as the point of contact for tribes. According  to VA officials, this office conducted four consultation meetings in  2012 and employed five field staff to help manage communication  with tribal communities and to work with IHS on local MOU  implementation efforts.", "In February 2011, VA released the agency\u2019s tribal consultation policy.  VA officials said they are developing a report that will explain the  process for evaluating comments from tribes and making decisions  based on them. The officials expect the report to be released to the  public in the spring of 2013.", "The agencies have made more local efforts to communicate with  tribes, which have led to some success. For example, agency officials  and tribal stakeholders noted that the workgroup assigned to  implement MOU activities in Alaska used successful methods for  working with tribes. The Alaska workgroup told us they cultivated a  relationship with an Alaskan tribal health organization in order to get  advice on the appropriate customs for consulting with individual tribes  there. In addition, the workgroup said they scheduled consultation  meetings in conjunction with other meetings, which would limit the  amount of travel tribal community members would need to undertake.  VA employees also took cultural awareness training, and VA officials  visited Alaska to demonstrate the agency\u2019s dedication to providing  care to Native American veterans, which, according to the workgroup,  led to buy-in from tribal communities. VA and Alaskan tribes have  signed 26 reimbursement agreements.", "Some tribal stakeholders that we spoke with have acknowledged the  steps taken by the agencies thus far as positive but in some cases  expressed concerns regarding tribal consultation. In the case of the tribes  working with the Alaska workgroup, one stakeholder praised VA\u2019s efforts  to work with tribal health organizations to communicate with tribes. In  another example, two tribal stakeholders said they approved of OTGR\u2019s  establishment as an office dedicated to Native American veterans\u2019 issues.  However, four tribal stakeholders expressed concerns that, despite the  creation of OTGR, VA still has not always been effective in its efforts to  consult with tribes or be responsive to tribal input provided during  consultation. For example, one stakeholder questioned whether  consultation was done with every tribe and described VA\u2019s consultation  process as sporadic. This stakeholder\u2019s concern implies that VA\u2019s  outreach efforts may not be systematically reaching all tribal communities.  However, VA officials told us that, in addition to issuing notices in the  Federal Register and Dear Tribal Leader letters, they have a systematic  process of hosting training summits for tribes and scheduling regular  conference calls and presentations to tribal leadership. In another  instance, one tribal community member said OTGR lacks\u2014and thus  cannot disperse to tribes\u2014the technical knowledge necessary for tribes to  partner with VA on activities such as negotiating reimbursement  agreements. VA officials noted that OTGR staff may not always be  technical experts on a given topic but said they are able to identify those  experts and play a key role in linking tribes with them."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Coordination between VA and IHS is essential to ensuring that high- quality health care is provided to dually eligible Native American veterans.  While the 2010 MOU includes common goals that should facilitate agency  coordination, and the agencies have created workgroups tasked to  implement the MOU, we found that a critical mechanism for monitoring  the implementation of the MOU, the agreement\u2019s performance metrics,  has weaknesses. Specifically, the inadequacies we found in performance  metrics could limit the agencies\u2019 ability to measure progress towards  MOU goals and ultimately make decisions about programs or activities.", "Overcoming the challenges related to working with a large number of  diverse, sovereign tribes is also essential to successfully achieving the  goals of the MOU. Although steps have been taken to consult with tribes  regarding the MOU and related activities, consultation has not always  been effective in assuring that the people designated to make health care  decisions in each tribe are reached and tribes are included in planning  and implementation efforts. Ineffective consultation with tribal  communities could delay or limit potential VA, IHS, and tribal community  partnerships to achieve the goals of the MOU and could hinder agency  efforts to gain support for MOU activities and address the health care  needs of Native American veterans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure the health care needs of Native American veterans are  addressed most efficiently and effectively, we recommend that the  Secretary of Veterans Affairs and Secretary of Health and Human  Services take the following two actions:", "As the agencies move forward with revising the MOU\u2019s performance  metrics and measures, ensure that the revised metrics and measures  allow decision makers to gauge whether achievement of the metrics  and measures supports attainment of MOU goals.", "Develop processes to better ensure that consultation with tribes is  effective, including the following:", "A process to identify the appropriate tribal members with whom to  communicate MOU-related information, which should include  methods for keeping such identification up-to-date.", "A process to clearly outline and communicate to tribal  communities the agencies\u2019 response to tribal input, including any  changes in policies and programs or other effects that result from  incorporating tribal input.", "A process to establish timelines for releasing information to tribal  communities to ensure they have enough time to review and  provide input or, in the case of meetings, determine the  appropriate tribal member to attend the event."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided draft copies of this report to VA and the Department of  Health and Human Services for review.
