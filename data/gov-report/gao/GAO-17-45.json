GAO examined data from fiscal years 2001 through 2015 from Education's National Student Loan Data System and other administrative data from Treasury and SSA.

This withholding is called an offset. GAO's analysis of characteristics of student loan debt using data from the Departments of Education (Education), Treasury, and the Social Security Administration (SSA) from fiscal years 2001-2015 showed that for older borrowers subject to offset for the first time, about 43 percent had held their student loans for 20 years or more. In addition, three-quarters of these older borrowers had taken loans only for their own education, and most owed less than $10,000 at the time of their initial offset. Older borrowers had a typical monthly offset that was slightly more than $140, and almost half of them were subject to the maximum possible reduction, equivalent to 15 percent of their Social Security benefit. In fiscal year 2015, more than half of the almost 114,000 older borrowers who had such offsets were receiving Social Security disability benefits rather than Social Security retirement income.", "In fiscal year 2015, Education collected about $4.5 billion on defaulted student loan debt, of which about $171 million\u2014less than 10 percent\u2014was collected through Social Security offsets. More than one-third of older borrowers remained in default 5 years after becoming subject to offset, and some saw their loan balances increase over time despite offsets. However, nearly one-third of older borrowers were able to pay off their loans or cancel their debt by obtaining relief through a process known as a total and permanent disability (TPD) discharge, which is available to borrowers with a disability that is not expected to improve.", "GAO identified a number of effects on older borrowers resulting from the design of the offset program and associated options for relief from offset. First, older borrowers subject to offsets increasingly receive benefits below the federal poverty guideline. Specifically, many older borrowers subject to offset have their Social Security benefits reduced below the federal poverty guideline because the threshold to protect benefits\u2014implemented by regulation in 1998\u2014is not adjusted for costs of living (see figure below). In addition, borrowers who have a total and permanent disability may be eligible for a TPD discharge, but they must comply with annual documentation requirements that are not clearly and prominently stated. If annual documentation to verify income is not submitted, a loan initially approved for a TPD discharge can be reinstated and offsets resume."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO suggests that Congress consider adjusting Social Security offset provisions to reflect the increased cost of living.

Compared to younger borrowers, borrowers age  50 and older have considerably higher rates of default on federal student  loans. For those who are in default on their student loans, this debt is  generally not discharged in bankruptcy, and their Social Security benefits  may be reduced to repay this debt. Specifically, under the Treasury Offset  Program, the Departments of Education and Treasury coordinate to  withhold a portion of an individual\u2019s Social Security retirement or disability  benefit to pay off their outstanding federal student loan debt\u2014a process  known as administrative offset. Agencies are required to refer such debt  to Treasury for offset under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of  1996.  GAO previously reported a substantial increase in the number of  individuals whose Social Security retirement, survivor, or disability  benefits were offset to repay student loan debt for borrowers of all ages,  including those aged 65 and older, from 2002 through 2013. Concerns  have been raised about the impact of such offsets given that many older  Americans rely on Social Security payments for the majority of their  income. In addition, the number of those subject to offset may continue to  increase as the total amount of federal student loan debt owed by  Americans grows, as does the number of borrowers.", "You asked us to study Social Security offsets for older Americans with  defaulted student loan debt. In this review, we examine the experience of  older Americans subject to Social Security offsets, including: (1)  characteristics of student loan debt held by borrowers subject to offset  and the effect on their Social Security benefit; (2) the amount of debt  collected by the Department of Education (Education) through offsets and  the typical outcomes for those in offset; and (3) effects on older borrowers  as a result of program design for offsets and related relief options for  disability or financial hardship.", "To examine the experience of older Americans who are subject to Social  Security offsets for defaulted federal student loan debt, we obtained  administrative data needed for our analysis from the Department of the  Treasury\u2019s (Treasury) Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service),  Education, and the Social Security Administration (SSA). To conduct our  analysis, we linked the administrative data from Fiscal Service\u2019s Treasury  Offset Program to data on borrowers\u2019 student loans from Education\u2019s  National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) and borrowers\u2019 Social  Security benefits from SSA\u2019s Master Beneficiary Record and Disability  Control File spanning the timeframe from fiscal years 2001 through 2015.  We used the linked record-level data to determine how long borrowers  have held loans that became subject to offset, the length of time spent in  offset, the size of the reduction in Social Security income, and outcomes  for borrowers subject to offset 5 years later. We further analyzed the  linked data to determine the effect of Social Security offsets on the  balances of defaulted federal student loans, including the proportion of  offset applied to fees, interest, and principal. To provide information on  the overall population of student loan borrowers, we obtained aggregated  data from Education on the total number of borrowers in default and offset  by age.", "In addition, we reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and  documentation and interviewed agency officials to obtain information  about offsets of Social Security benefits, as well as Education\u2019s  processes for (1) discharging student loan debt in cases of disability  where the borrower is considered to have become totally and  permanently disabled, and (2) claiming an exemption or reduction from  offset due to financial hardship. To further examine the Total and  Permanent Disability (TPD) discharge process, we analyzed aggregated  data provided by Education\u2019s TPD servicer on TPD discharge  applications, approvals, and reinstatements, including the total volume  and dollar value. To identify the amount Education collected on defaulted  federal student loans through offsets and other payment mechanisms, we  analyzed data provided by Education\u2019s Default Resolution Group,  including aggregated data from the Debt Management and Collection  System and information reported by guaranty agencies. In addition, we  analyzed aggregated data provided by Fiscal Service on fees assessed  by the Treasury Offset Program for Social Security offsets for Education  and other federal agencies.

Borrowers  may elect a voluntary repayment option to avoid involuntary collection  efforts, such as Social Security offsets. (See table 1).", "While Education administers federal student loans, other agencies may  become involved in the event that a borrower fails to make repayment.  For example, as described in table 1, Education coordinates with  Treasury to offset a portion of federal payments to borrowers who have  not made scheduled loan repayments. Federal payments subject to offset  include federal tax refunds, certain monthly benefits\u2014such as Social  Security retirement and disability payments\u2014and wages and retirement  benefits for federal employees. The Debt Collection Improvement Act of  1996 centralized the collection of nontax debt, including defaulted federal  student loans, at Treasury. Specifically, the Treasury Offset Program  within Fiscal Service carries out the transactions for offsetting all federal  payments for nontax debt. Offsets for student loan debt through the  Treasury Offset Program began in 1999 and were first applied to Social  Security benefits starting in 2001.", "After a defaulted loan is certified as eligible for offset, certain federal  payments, such as any available tax refunds, are offset immediately.  Borrowers with monthly federal benefits available for offset, such as  Social Security benefits, are informed by mail that their benefits will be  offset in 60 days and again 30 days before the offset is taken, allowing  borrowers an additional 2 months to resume payment on their loan before  offset begins. In addition, Education sends a notice which provides details  on the loans eligible for offset and describes options a borrower has to  avoid offset. Treasury assesses a fee for each offset transaction, which is  subtracted from the offset payment. For fiscal year 2015, Treasury\u2019s fee  was $15 for each monthly offset of benefit payments and $17 for a single  tax refund offset.", "Monthly Social Security benefit payments that are eligible for offset are  the primary source of income for many older Americans at or near  retirement. According to the Social Security Administration (SSA), Social  Security benefits accounted for 90 percent or more of income for about 1  in 3 beneficiaries age 65 and older in 2014. Social Security\u2019s retirement  benefits, which individuals may claim as early as age 62, provide monthly  income based on an individual\u2019s work and earnings history and are  intended to help ensure an adequate retirement income. Disability  benefits replace a portion of an eligible workers\u2019 income if they are unable  to work due to a long-term disability. When individuals receiving Social  Security disability benefits reach Social Security\u2019s full retirement age\u2014 currently age 66 for people born in 1943-1954\u2014their benefits convert  from disability to retirement. Both types of monthly Social Security  benefits are eligible for offset if the beneficiary is in default on a federal  student loan. Social Security\u2019s Supplemental Security Income benefits,  which provide monthly cash assistance for eligible individuals with limited  financial means, have been exempted from offset.", "Certain borrowers may be eligible to discharge their federal student loan  debt because they are totally and permanently disabled, regardless of  whether or not they are in default. For example, borrowers of any age  receiving Social Security disability benefits are eligible for a Total and  Permanent Disability (TPD) discharge if SSA has determined that they  have a disability for which medical improvement is not expected.  Borrowers who are approved for a TPD discharge are generally subject to  a 3-year monitoring period during which the discharged loans may be  reinstated for several reasons, including that the borrower earned income  over a specified threshold. The value of the discharged loan is generally  treated as taxable income at the close of the 3-year monitoring period.", "The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 specified limits on the  amount that Treasury can offset from monthly federal benefits. In 1998,  Treasury further exempted all but 15 percent of Social Security benefit  payments from offset. As a result, the amount of allowable offset is the  lesser of 15 percent of the monthly benefit payment, the amount by which  the benefit payment exceeds $750 per month, or the outstanding amount  of the debt. For example, if a borrower with a Social Security benefit of  $1,000 per month owes more than $150 in student loan debt, the  borrower would have an offset of $150. This is because $150\u2014equivalent  to 15 percent of the benefit\u2014is less than the amount of the benefit over  $750, which is $250. In addition to the offset threshold, creditor agencies,  such as Education, are permitted to grant relief in cases of financial  hardship by certifying to Treasury that the offset allowable by law would  result in financial hardship.

Such is the case for a growing number of older  borrowers whose Social Security benefits have fallen below the poverty  guideline because the offset threshold is not adjusted for increases in  costs of living. The threshold for Social Security offsets was established  to prevent undue financial hardship on borrowers who rely on benefits for  a substantial part of their income and who may be unable, rather than  unwilling, to repay debts. This is consistent with the policy underlying  the Social Security program that benefits are intended to help ensure  older Americans have adequate retirement incomes and do not have to  depend on welfare. According to SSA, Social Security benefits  represented 90 percent or more of total income for about one-third of  beneficiaries 65 and older in 2014. At the time it was set, in 1998, the  threshold for Social Security offsets was above the poverty guideline\u2014 $750 a month represented about 112 percent of the poverty guideline for  a single adult that year. However, in the absence of cost of living  adjustments, the relative value of the offset threshold has declined over  time to well below the poverty guideline. In 2016, the poverty guideline for  a single adult equated to a monthly income of about $990, and the $750  threshold represented about 76 percent of this amount. Consequently,  an increasing number of older Americans subject to Social Security  offsets received benefits below the federal poverty guideline. In fiscal year  2004, about 8,300 borrowers in the 50 and older age category had  benefits below the poverty guideline compared to almost 67,300 in fiscal  year 2015 (see fig. 9). As a share of borrowers in the 50 and older age  category, this growth was equivalent to an increase from 38 percent in  fiscal year 2004 to 64 percent in fiscal year 2015.

For those 50 and older who were  initially subject to offset between fiscal years 2001-2010, TPD discharges  represented about 90 percent of all non-death related discharges within 5  years after the initial offset. In total, after 5 years, about 8 percent of those  50 and older at the time of their initial offset applied for and successfully  obtained a TPD discharge of their loans, while about 6 percent more were  initially approved, but were still in the conditional 3-year monitoring  period.", "Education\u2019s TPD discharge process permits such discharges for certain  recipients of Social Security disability benefits of any age. Effective July 1,  2013, the eligibility criteria for TPD discharges were modified to include  borrowers receiving Social Security disability benefits if SSA has  determined they have a disability in which medical improvement is not  expected. Borrowers who receive disability benefits but are not in this  status, as well as other borrowers who do not receive disability benefits,  may still apply for a TPD discharge based on a physician\u2019s certification or  a determination from the Department of Veterans Affairs.

According to Education  officials, effective from April 2016, offsets are suspended on the  borrower\u2019s loans during the 120-day application period. Once borrowers  submit their completed application, Education determines if they are   eligible for a discharge. As described earlier, borrowers approved for a  TPD discharge are generally subject to a 3-year monitoring period during  which the discharged loans may be reinstated for several reasons,  including that the borrower earned income over a specified threshold.  Once the 3-year monitoring period has been completed and the discharge  processed, the loans cannot be reinstated. The value of the discharged  loans is generally treated as taxable income at the close of the 3-year  monitoring period, as described in the sidebar.", "While TPD discharges represent the largest share of loan discharges for  older Americans in offset, data from Education indicate that a  considerable number of borrowers of any age, including those age 50 and  older, who are eligible for a TPD discharge have not fully completed the  application process. Education has taken steps to identify and conduct  outreach to such borrowers of all ages, many of whom are certified for  offset. Specifically, in December 2015 Education began matching NSLDS  data with SSA records to identify borrowers who receive disability benefits  and who are eligible for a TPD discharge because SSA had determined  that their medical improvement was not expected. Once identified,  borrowers were sent a letter explaining they are eligible for a TPD  discharge and describing the actions they must take to apply. Based on  this data matching, Education reported in April 2016 that it had initially  identified approximately 387,000 borrowers of any age eligible for a TPD  discharge. Of these, over 100,000 borrowers were in default and had  been certified for offset. According to Education, as of July 31, 2016,  TPD discharge applications were sent to about 234,000 borrowers based  on the data matching and slightly more than 19,000 applications had  been submitted and approved.

Education officials  said that the agency will do additional follow up to increase the number of  applications submitted and subsequently approved.

According to Education  officials, the agency decided in April 2016 to suspend offsets of any  federal payments through the Treasury Offset Program for borrowers  identified as eligible for a TPD discharge through the data-matching effort,  regardless of whether or not the borrower returns the application form.  The suspension from offset for those eligible but not approved for a TPD  discharge continues for as long as Education identifies through its  quarterly data match that the borrower has a disability in which medical  improvement is not expected. During the time that offsets are suspended  a borrower\u2019s loan continues to be in defaulted status, and Education  officials said that interest would continue to accrue on a borrower\u2019s loan  balance. Education officials also said that once disabled borrowers are  converted to Social Security retirement benefits at their full retirement  age\u2014currently age 66 for people born in 1943-1954\u2014offsets would  resume unless the borrower applied and was approved for a TPD  discharge or a financial hardship exemption.

For example, Education has not  informed borrowers that they are suspended from offset even if they do  not apply for the TPD discharge. Further, Education has not provided  information to borrowers about the potential consequences from  continuing to accrue interest without applying for the TPD discharge, or  that their offsets may later resume if their benefits are converted.

Further, the effects of  Education\u2019s program design for TPD discharge are not limited to older  borrowers but also impact disabled borrowers of any age who apply for  the discharge. Using summary data from Education for all borrowers who  applied for TPD discharge, we identified that almost 110,000 individuals  were approved for TPD discharge in fiscal year 2014, while an additional  almost 103,000 were approved in fiscal year 2015. The total loan  balances discharged in those years were over $2.7 billion and nearly $2.6  billion, respectively. Education\u2019s data show that a large number of those  approved for a TPD discharge had their loans reinstated during the 3-year  monitoring period. According to summary data provided by Education\u2019s  TPD servicer, in fiscal year 2015, 61,536 borrowers initially approved for  a TPD discharge had loans reinstated during the 3-year monitoring period  with a total value of about $1.2 billion.

Specifically, documentation provided by  Education to borrowers in the 3-year monitoring period does not clearly  and prominently state all requirements to report income annually. Federal  agencies are directed to use language that is clear, concise, and well- organized that the public can understand in documents that explain how  to comply with requirements the federal government administers or  enforces. Moreover, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government state that the agency should externally communicate the  necessary quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s objective. However,  we found that the forms the TPD servicer provides to borrowers may not  clearly communicate all requirements to avoid loan reinstatement. In  particular, the TPD discharge approval form sent to borrowers states that  violating certain requirements will result in loan reinstatement, such as  earning income from employment above the poverty guideline amount for  a family of two in their state. However, the additional annual reporting  requirement may be unclear because the form does not explicitly state  that the loan will be reinstated if the borrower does not return the annual  income verification form\u2014even if they have no earnings\u2014to document  that their earnings from employment are below the poverty guideline for a  family of two in their state. In addition, we found that the annual income  verification form sent by Education\u2019s TPD servicer each year during the 3- year monitoring period does not state that failure to submit the form will  result in loan reinstatement (see app. IV for a copy of documentation  provided by Education\u2019s TPD servicer). According to Education, if a  borrower does not return the income verification form, the TPD servicer  resends the form two additional times, but the follow up attempts do not  include any additional language to alert the borrower that failure to return  the form will result in loan reinstatement. For borrowers who fail to return  the annual income verification form, their loans are reinstated and offsets  may resume.

The notice sent to borrowers  informing them of the loan reinstatement provides the reason for the  reinstatement and information on how to appeal. The borrower may  appeal by mail or online through Education\u2019s TPD servicer\u2019s website.  However, most borrowers who have their loans reinstated do not  successfully appeal. According to Education\u2019s data for borrowers of any  age in the 3-year monitoring period, 20,368 reinstatement appeals were  approved in fiscal year 2015, but 62,303 loans were reinstated during the  prior fiscal year. Borrowers who do not appeal their loan reinstatement  may have offsets resume.", "In addition, even with improvements to clarify forms sent to borrowers, it  may be difficult for disabled borrowers to comply with documentation  requirements. Although Education officials recognize that the population  of borrowers approved for a TPD discharge may have difficulty in  providing documentation due to the severity of their disabilities, borrowers  must take action to manually submit the income verification form each  year during the 3-year monitoring period. In contrast to manual  activities, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state  that automated control activities tend to be more reliable because they  are less susceptible to human error and are typically more efficient.  While Federal Student Aid\u2019s responsibilities include improving operational  efficiency and the quality of service for customers across the entire  student aid life cycle, the agency has not taken steps to reduce burdens  for disabled borrowers in providing the income verification form. In  contrast for another process that involves income verification, Education  has taken steps to improve operational efficiency and the quality of  customer service by reducing burdens on borrowers through a tool that  automatically identifies income information. Specifically, the application  process for income-driven repayment plans includes a feature\u2014the IRS  Data Retrieval Tool\u2014to transfer income information from a borrower\u2019s  federal tax return. According to Education, this tool has helped simplify  and streamline the process for borrowers while improving both speed and  accuracy. Because Education has not included such a method to  automate annual income verification and streamline the annual income  verification process for the TPD discharge, Education has not made it  easy for some borrowers to comply with the requirements of the 3-year  monitoring period and avoid having their loans reinstated and offsets  resume.", "Education\u2019s annual income verification process may also result in under- reporting of earnings from some borrowers. For example, Education does  not independently verify earnings for borrowers who submit the form and  report they have no earnings. The borrower is required to sign and return  the form certifying they had no earned income during the specified time  period and is notified that there can be a penalty for making false  statements or misrepresentations. However, Education officials said that  they do not take action to verify this reported information. Borrowers who  do report earnings are required to provide supporting documentation,  such as their W-2. Education\u2019s current verification process also does not  address instances in which a borrower with income from multiple  employers only includes income and supporting documentation from  some, but not all, of them. This could result in borrowers receiving a TPD  discharge when their loan should have been reinstated.

In  addition, the financial hardship exemption application form is not included  under \u201cOffset Forms\u201d in the website\u2019s section on \u201cForced Collections.\u201d  Education officials said that borrowers may use the Financial Disclosure  Statement for Wage Garnishment Hearings available on the website\u2014 instead of the Financial Status Statement sent by Education to those who  initially contact and inform the agency of their financial hardship\u2014to  submit their income and expenses for the financial hardship exemption  review. However, this option is not noted on the website. Moreover, the  offset notice sent to borrowers does not provide information on the  financial hardship exemption option or process. This notice is sent to  borrowers 65 days prior to the start of an offset and informs them of  options for objecting to collection of the debt. In contrast, the notice IRS  sends to individuals with delinquent federal tax debt subject to the  Federal Payment Levy Program provides information on how to avoid  having Social Security income withheld in cases of financial hardship.

To that end, the Social Security offset  threshold was implemented in 1998 to reflect this balance by establishing  a minimum monthly benefit payment above the poverty guideline at that  time. Although Social Security benefits are adjusted for increased costs of  living, the effect is diminished because the offset threshold is not  comparably adjusted. The result is that thousands of individuals subject to  offset are left with benefits below the poverty guideline.

Specifically, we obtained and linked administrative data from  Fiscal Service\u2019s Treasury Offset Program to Education\u2019s National Student  Loan Data System (NSLDS) and SSA\u2019s Master Beneficiary Record (MBR)  and Disability Control File (DCF) in order to examine the student loan  history and outcomes for older Americans with Social Security offsets. We  also examined aggregated data provided by Education on the total  number of borrowers in default and offset by age and the total  outstanding federal student loan balance by age.", "In addition, we reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and  documentation. We also interviewed agency officials to obtain information  about offsets of Social Security benefits, as well as Education\u2019s  processes for discharging student loan debt in cases of disability and  claiming an exemption or reduction from offset due to financial hardship.  We obtained documentation from agency officials, including forms sent to  borrowers during the application and approval process for both Total and  Permanent Disability (TPD) discharges and financial hardship  exemptions. To further examine the TPD discharge process, we analyzed  aggregated data provided by Education\u2019s TPD servicer on TPD discharge  applications, approvals, and reinstatements, including the total volume  and dollar value. To identify the amount Education collected on defaulted  student loans through offsets and other payment mechanisms, we  analyzed data provided by Education\u2019s Default Resolution Group,  including aggregated data from the Debt Management and Collection  System and information reported by guaranty agencies. We also  analyzed aggregated data provided by Fiscal Service on fees assessed  by the Treasury Offset Program by type of offset for Education and other  federal agencies.", "Finally, we analyzed published data from the 2013 wave of the Federal  Reserve Board\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) to update figures  which we previously reported on the overall share of households with  student loan debt with the most recent data available. This updated data  is available in appendix III. The SCF gathers various economic and  financial data at the household level, such as student loan, mortgage, and  credit card debt, and is conducted once every 3 years. Because survey  responses are based on the financial situation of an entire household, not  just the head of household, it is possible that the reported student loan  debt for some households headed by older Americans is held by children  or other dependents that are still members of the household."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Treasury Offset Program data", "paragraphs": ["The Treasury Offset Program carries out transactions for offsetting  federal payments for delinquent nontax debt.

Analyses that used  NSLDS data on loan balances were restricted to fiscal year 2006 forward  because NSLDS did not consistently retain detailed loan balance history  prior to 2006.

We excluded all other loans that  were paid off prior to offset.", "Application of offset payments: NSLDS did not always contain  complete information on the application of offset payments across  loan principal, interest on the outstanding balance, and program fees  due to data reporting issues. We measured the total amount of offset  payments and the number of individual offset transactions per  borrower using Treasury Offset Program data.
