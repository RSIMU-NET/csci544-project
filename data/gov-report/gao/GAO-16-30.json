In 2014, women comprised about 16 percent of board seats in the S&P 1500, up from 8 percent in 1997. This increase was partly driven by a rise in women's representation among new board directors. However, even if equal proportions of women and men joined boards each year beginning in 2015, GAO estimated that it could take more than four decades for women's representation on boards to be on par with that of men's.", "Based on an analysis of interviews with stakeholders, board director data, and relevant literature, GAO identified various factors that may hinder women's increased representation among board directors. These include boards not prioritizing recruiting diverse candidates; few women in the traditional pipeline to board service\u2014with Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or board experience; and low turnover of board seats.", "Stakeholders GAO interviewed generally preferred voluntary strategies for increasing gender diversity on corporate boards, yet several large investors and most stakeholders interviewed (15 of 19) supported improving Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosure requirements on board diversity. SEC currently requires companies to disclose information on board diversity to help investors make investment and voting decisions. As stated in its strategic plan, one of SEC's objectives is to ensure that investors have access to high-quality disclosure materials to inform investment decisions. A group of large public pension fund investors and many stakeholders GAO interviewed questioned the usefulness of information companies provide in response to SEC's board diversity disclosure requirements. Consequently, these investors petitioned SEC to require specific disclosure on board directors' gender, race, and ethnicity.

Of the 17 stakeholders who expressed  an opinion, all supported expanding board searches beyond the  traditional pool of CEO candidates to increase representation of  women on boards. Several stakeholders suggested, for example, that  boards recruit high performing women in other senior executive level  positions, or look for qualified female candidates in academia or the  nonprofit and government sectors. According to aggregate Employer  Information Report (EEO-1) data, roughly 29 percent of all senior  level managers in 2013 were women, suggesting that if boards were  to expand their director searches beyond CEOs more women might  be included in the candidate pool. Our analysis of EEO-1 data also  found that at the largest companies\u2014those with more than 100,000  employees\u2014women comprised 38 percent of all senior-level  managers in 2013, up from 26 percent in 2008.

One board director said  individuals are more likely to be asked to serve on additional boards  once they have prior board experience and have demonstrated they  are trustworthy.", "Potential strategies that boards could implement to address the small  number of new directors that are appointed to boards each year could  include:", "Expanding board size. Nine stakeholders we interviewed expressly  supported expanding board size either permanently or temporarily to  include more women, with five specifically supporting this strategy  only as a temporary measure.For example, one stakeholder\u2019s board  temporarily expanded in size from 8 directors to 11 in anticipation of  retirements, but the stakeholder was not in favor of permanently  expanding the board size. Some stakeholders noted that expanding  board size might make sense if the board is not too large but  expressed concern about challenges associated with managing large  boards. Three stakeholders were not in favor of expanding board size  permanently or temporarily to increase the representation of women  on boards.", "Adopting term limits or age limits. Five stakeholders we  interviewed supported boards adopting either term or age limits to  address low turnover and increase the representation of women.  However, most stakeholders were not in favor of these strategies and  several pointed out trade-offs to term and age limits. For example, a  CEO we interviewed said he would be open to limitations on tenure  for board directors, especially as the board appoints younger  candidates. However, he said directors with longer tenure possess  invaluable knowledge about a company that newer board directors  cannot be expected to possess. Many of the stakeholders not in favor  of these strategies noted that term and age limits seem arbitrary and  could result in the loss of high-performing directors.", "Conducting board evaluations. Twelve stakeholders we interviewed  generally agreed it is good practice to conduct full-board or individual  director evaluations, or to use a skills matrix to identify gaps.  However, a few thought evaluation processes could be more robust or  said that board dynamics and culture can make it difficult to use  evaluations as a tool to increase turnover by removing under- performing directors from boards. The National Association of  Corporate Directors encourages boards to use evaluations not only as  a tool for assessing board director performance, but also as a means  to assess boardroom composition and gaps in skill sets. Several  stakeholders we interviewed discussed how it is important for boards  to identify skills gaps and strategically address them when a vacancy  occurs, and one stakeholder said doing so may help the board to think  more proactively about identifying diverse candidates.", "In addition, almost all of the stakeholders we interviewed (18 of 19)  indicated that either CEOs or investors and shareholders play an  important role in promoting gender diversity on corporate boards. For  example, one stakeholder said CEOs may encourage boards to prioritize  diversity efforts by \u201csetting the tone at the top\u201d of companies and  acknowledging the benefits of diversity. In addition, several stakeholders  said that CEOs may serve as mentors for women and sponsor, or vouch  for, qualified women they know for board seats. One stakeholder we  interviewed developed a program to help women in senior management  positions become board-ready and has also recommended qualified  women when he was asked to serve on the board of other companies.  Nearly all of the stakeholders we interviewed (18 of 19) said that investors  play an important role in promoting gender diversity on corporate boards.  For example, almost all of the board directors and CEOs we interviewed  said that investors or shareholders may exert pressure on the companies  they invest in to prioritize diversity when recruiting new directors.  According to one board director we interviewed, boards listen to investors  more than any other actor, and they take heed when investors bring  attention to an issue."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Large Investors and Many Stakeholders We Interviewed Supported Improving Federal Disclosure Requirements on Board Diversity", "paragraphs": ["While most stakeholders we interviewed emphasized their preference for  voluntary efforts by business to increase gender diversity on corporate  boards over government mandates such as quotas, several large public  pension fund investors and many stakeholders we interviewed (15 of 19)  supported improving federal disclosure requirements on board diversity.  Stakeholders were generally supportive of the government undertaking  efforts to raise awareness about gender diversity on boards or to collect  and disseminate information on board diversity. Most stakeholders we  interviewed (16 of 19), however, did not support government quotas as a  strategy to increase board gender diversity in the United States. Several  suggested that quotas may have unintended consequences\u2014boards may  strive to meet the quota, but not to exceed it; boards may appoint  directors who are not the best fit for the board just to meet the quota; and  there may be the perception that women did not earn their board seat  because of their skills, but instead were appointed for purposes of  meeting a requirement. However, a few stakeholders and other  organizations and researchers we interviewed stated that quotas are an  effective means of achieving increased representation or that the  prospect of quotas may spur companies to take voluntary actions to  address gender diversity on boards.", "While the SEC seeks to ensure that companies provide material  information to investors that they need to make informed investment and  voting decisions, we found information companies disclose on board  diversity is not always useful to investors who value this information.  According to SEC\u2019s 2014-2018 Strategic Plan, one of the Commission\u2019s  objectives is to structure disclosure requirements to ensure that investors  have access to useful, high-quality disclosure materials that facilitate  informed investment decision-making. The SEC notes in its strategic  plan that it is helpful for information to be provided in a concise, easy-to- use format tailored to investors\u2019 needs. In addition, the SEC  acknowledges that the needs of investors may vary and that investors\u2019  needs are affected by their backgrounds and goals.", "Several large public pension fund investors and many of the stakeholders  we interviewed (12 of 19) called into question the usefulness of  information companies provide in response to SEC\u2019s current disclosure  requirements. Specifically, in a recent petition to the SEC (investor  petition) to improve board nominee disclosure, a group of nine public fund  fiduciaries supervising the investment of over $1 trillion in assets stated  that some companies have used such broad definitions of diversity that  the concept conveys little meaning to investors. In its requirements for  company disclosure on board diversity, SEC leaves it up to companies to  define diversity in ways they consider appropriate. As a result, there is  variation in how much information companies provide in response to the  requirements as well as the type of information they provide. A recent  analysis of S&P 100 firms\u2019 proxy statements from 2010 through 2013  found that most of the companies chose to define diversity to include  characteristics like relevant knowledge, skills, and experience.  Approximately half of the companies reported defining diversity to include  demographic factors such as gender, race, or ethnicity. Figure 6  illustrates the range of information companies provide on board diversity.  For example, Company A and Company D provide information on  demographic diversity and specifically disclosed the number of women on  the board; Company C combined information on gender diversity with  other demographic information; and Company B did not provide any  numerical information on demographic characteristics, including gender  diversity.", "Furthermore, SEC\u2019s requirement for companies to disclose information  related to a board policy for considering diversity in the nomination  process, if they have such a policy, may not yield useful information. For  example, the recent analysis of S&P 100 firms\u2019 proxy statements  previously mentioned found that 8 of the 100 companies reviewed  disclosed the existence of a diversity policy in 2010 through 2013.  In  addition, according to the analysis, a substantial number of companies  disclosed the absence of a policy or were silent on the topic. According to  SEC\u2019s requirements, if a board does have a policy, then it must provide  additional information on how the policy is implemented and assessed,  leading some investors and others we interviewed to question whether it  creates a disincentive for companies to disclose a policy.", "The investor petition to the SEC supported improving existing disclosure  requirements and requested that the SEC require new disclosures on  board diversity specifically to indicate directors\u2019 gender, racial, and ethnic  diversity in a chart or matrix in addition to their skills and experiences.  Those who submitted the investor petition believe there are benefits to  diverse boards, such as better managing risk and including different  viewpoints, and that having more specific information on individual  director diversity attributes is necessary for investors to fully exercise their  voting rights. They said that as large investors, they have an interest in  electing a slate of board directors who are well-positioned to help carry  out a company\u2019s business strategy and meet their long-term investment  needs, and that for at least some investors, demographic diversity is an  important factor to consider when electing board directors.", "Most of the 19 stakeholders we interviewed (15 of 19) also supported  improving SEC rules to require more specific information from public  companies on board diversity. In addition to increasing transparency,  some organizations and researchers we interviewed highlighted that  disclosing information on board diversity may cause companies to think  about diversity more and thus may be a useful strategy for increasing  pressure on companies to diversify their boards. Twelve stakeholders  we interviewed explicitly supported SEC requiring companies to  specifically disclose the number of women on the board; five others were  not opposed to disclosing this information; and two questioned whether  this specificity was necessary as companies already include the names of  board directors in their proxy statements or may include photos of  directors. While the investor petition acknowledged that some companies  provide aggregate board diversity information on gender and race, they  said diversity information at the board level is not available for all  companies. They also stated that it can be difficult to determine gender  diversity through proxy statements and is time-consuming to collect this  information on their own. Without specific information on board diversity  that is concise and easy-to-use, investors may not be fully informed in  making decisions. SEC officials told us they intend to consider the  investor petition requesting changes to board diversity disclosure as part  of its Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative\u2014an ongoing review of all SEC  disclosure requirements to improve them for the benefit of companies and  investors.

Thus, our analysis is a point in time estimate for the index  based on the indices as they were in a certain year. The ISS data did not  include industry or sector for the companies in the dataset. We used data  from the Bloomberg Industry Classification System to identify the  industries for the companies in the ISS dataset by matching up the stock  market ticker. We were able to make these matches for 96 percent of the  director observations in the ISS data. When we could not make a match,  it was typically because we could not locate the ticker in the Bloomberg  data. This could be the case, for example, if a company experienced a  merger or dismantled.", "In addition to presenting past trends and descriptive statistics on board  membership, we used the ISS data to determine the likelihood of a board  adding a woman based on the number of women already on the board.  Specifically, we computed how the percentage of boards that have added  a woman changes with the number of women already on the board. To do  this, we determined the proportion of companies with 0, 1, or 2 women on  the board that added a woman in that year. While we did not control for  other factors, such as industry, we did do this analysis separately for  large, medium, and small firms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Projection Analysis", "paragraphs": ["We also developed two hypothetical projections to illustrate future gender  representation on corporate boards. Neither of these projections is meant  to be predictive of what will happen over the coming decades. In one  scenario, we assumed an equal proportion of men and women join  boards each year starting in 2015. In the second scenario, we assumed  only women join boards as new board directors beginning in 2015. For  both projections, we made the following assumptions based on ISS data  on directors in the S&P 1500 from 1997 through 2014:", "The total number of board directors in the S&P 1500 will stay constant  at 14,000 each year, based on the average of the total number of  board directors in the S&P 1500 in 2013 and 2014.", "The total number of new board directors joining companies in the S&P  1500 will stay constant at 600 new directors each year, which is the  total average number of new board directors joining companies in the  S&P 1500 for the years of our analysis.", "We used 600 as an indicator of the number of board directors leaving  their board positions each year. Women on boards tend to be younger  than men and have had less tenure in 2014. Therefore, we wanted to  assume that women leave the board at a slightly lower rate than men,  so we estimated the proportion of women among the 600 departing  board directors in each year would equal the proportion of women  who were on boards 10 years prior (when women were less  represented)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Stakeholders We Interviewed", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Name / Current Title", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the affiliations above, the CEOs and board directors we  interviewed collectively have experience serving at companies in a wide  range of industries, including the following:", "Agilent Technologies, Inc.", "Avaya", "Avon Products, Inc.", "Inc.", "Companies Inc. eHealth, Inc.", "Engility Holdings, Inc.", "Exelixis, Inc.", "Integrated Device Technology", "Time Inc.", "TJX Companies, Inc.", "UNUM Corporation", "Walmart  (IDT)", "ION Media", "Juno Therapeutics, Inc.", "Kohl\u2019s Corporation", "Kraft Foods, Inc.", "Westinghouse", "Xerox Corporation", "Yahoo!
