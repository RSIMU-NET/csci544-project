To help achieve NOAA's program goals, it relies on management and administration (M&A) services, such as legal support and information technology. In response to the fiscal year 2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act Conference Report, GAO (1) examined how NOAA's M&A services are funded, (2) assessed the extent to which NOAA's policies and procedures for M&A services conform to applicable standards, and (3) estimated salaries and expenses for NOAA's budget for fiscal year 2009. Among other things, GAO reviewed documents on M&A services and data on M&A costs from NOAA officials for its headquarters; line offices, which are responsible for executing NOAA's programs; and a subset of financial management centers (FMC) within the line offices, which manage specific programs and projects."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["M&A services at NOAA are provided at four levels--Commerce, NOAA's headquarters, line offices, and FMCs--and each level funds its services in different ways. First, Commerce uses NOAA payments to the department's Working Capital Fund to support M&A services, such as legal services, that can be more efficiently provided centrally. It also uses payments to its Advances and Reimbursements Account for, among other things, payments to external parties for M&A services provided to the department as a whole. Commerce uses funds appropriated for departmental management to provide leadership services for the whole department, including NOAA. Second, NOAA's headquarters funds most of its M&A services using its corporate administrative services appropriation. NOAA's headquarters also uses a direct billing process to provide some unplanned services, such as issuing new identification cards, as well as pooled and additional services requested by line offices. Third, line offices fund the M&A services they provide by assessing their programs, projects, and activities in various ways. Finally, some FMCs fund M&A services through assessments of their subunits, while others do not track or separately define their M&A costs. NOAA's headquarters, line offices, and FMCs have documented some of their policies and procedures for M&A services, but they have not done so to the full extent required by applicable internal control and federal cost accounting standards. Taken together, these standards require agencies to document in a manual or handbook (1) their policies regarding the types of M&A services they provide; (2) the procedures they use each year to determine the budgets for their M&A services; (3) their policies and procedures for assigning the costs of their M&A services to specific programs, activities, or outputs that benefit from the services, and the results of that assignment; and (4) the justification for why those assignments are appropriate. NOAA's headquarters has documented some of its policies and procedures for its M&A services in written yearly operating and spending plans, but has not done so in a manual or handbook. In addition, the line offices and FMCs have no or limited documentation of their policies and procedures for the M&A services they provide. This lack of documentation limits the availability of information on M&A services for agency officials and congressional decision makers and may hamper financial management and management decision making. Estimated salaries and expenses for NOAA were about $3.8 billion for fiscal year 2009, with approximately $1.38 billion in estimated salaries and $2.46 billion in estimated expenses. NOAA does not separately report salaries and expenses for each line of its budget. Therefore, GAO estimated salaries and expenses based on budget object class data. These estimates are approximate because salaries and expenses could be higher if they were accounted for in object classes that GAO did not include in its estimates."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that NOAA require its headquarters, line offices, and FMCs to document in a manual or handbook their policies and procedures for the M&A services they provide in line with federal cost accounting and internal control standards.

However, concerns have been raised about the availability of such  information at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  (NOAA), a bureau within the Department of Commerce (Commerce).", "NOAA has a broad mission to understand and predict changes in the  earth\u2019s environment and conserve and manage coastal and marine  resources to meet the nation\u2019s economic, social, and environmental needs.  To carry out this mission in fiscal year 2010, NOAA received an  appropriation of about $4.7 billion and relied primarily on five line offices  to execute its programs: the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and  Information Service (NESDIS); National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS);  National Ocean Service (NOS); National Weather Service (NWS); and the  Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR). Each line office is  divided into financial management centers (FMC) to perform the mission- related work of the line office, as well as to assign and track resources.

Line office headquarters units house NOAA\u2019s assistant  administrators and perform a variety of policymaking, budgeting,  coordination, and oversight activities. FMCs below the line office level  manage specific programs and projects within the purview of each line  office and manage their own FMC activities. For example, 13 FMCs at OAR  provide M&A services below the line office level, including the Office of  Ocean Exploration and Research, which uses advanced undersea  technologies to research and explore the oceans.", "Each of the five line offices receives funding from NOAA\u2019s overall  appropriation in two main budget accounts: Operations, Research and  Facilities (ORF) and Procurement, Acquisition, and Construction (PAC).  According to NOAA officials, in general, the ORF account funds salaries,  benefits, utilities, and other programmatic services (such as legal services  and IT). The PAC account does not fund program services, rather it funds  capital assets and investments of $75 million or greater, such as the  purchase of a new satellite. The ORF and PAC budget accounts each fund  numerous programs, projects, or activities (PPA). For example, in fiscal  year 2010, the ORF account funded 285 PPAs. Each FMC receives funding  from one or more PPAs, and the FMC decides how it will fund its program  and M&A services. For example, in fiscal year 2010, OAR\u2019s National Sea  Grant College Program received funding from three PPAs: (1) National Sea  Grant College Program Base, (2) Aquatic Invasive Species Program, and  (3) Marine Aquaculture Program.

For example, they  should document what portion of the total costs for IT services is  attributable to specific programs, activities, and outputs that benefit from  the service. According to the standards, cost accounting helps improve  financial management and managerial decision making by providing useful  information to people inside and outside an agency on its budget and  performance.", "The objectives of the federal cost accounting standards include:    providing relevant and reliable information to program managers  regarding the full costs of programs, their activities, and their outputs;    providing relevant and reliable information to assist congressional and  other decision makers in allocating federal resources, authorizing and  modifying programs, and evaluating program performance; and   ensuring consistency between costs reported in financial reports and costs  reported to program managers.", "The standards do not impose a specific methodology on federal agencies  to satisfy these objectives but allow them the flexibility to design their  own cost accounting systems. However, the standards call for all cost  accounting activities, processes, and procedures to be documented by a  manual, handbook, or guidebook. The documentation should (1) outline  the specific programs, activities, and outputs for which costs will be  determined; (2) provide instructions for procedures and practices to be  followed in assigning costs, including M&A costs, to those program,  activities, and outputs; and (3) contain examples of forms and other  documents to be used.", "In addition, standards for internal control in the federal government call  for federal agencies to document their policies and procedures, which help  managers exercise control over agency activities, including activities  undertaken to manage and administer programs. Policies and procedures  include the methods federal agencies use to assign their M&A costs. The  internal control standards also state that the documentation should be  complete and periodically updated to reflect any changes to the policies  and procedures.", "To adhere to both internal control and federal cost accounting standards,  as they relate to M&A services, federal agencies need to document their  policies and procedures.

In addition, according to Commerce  officials, Commerce uses the Advances and Reimbursements account for  two things: (1) pass-through payments to external organizations for  services provided to the department as a whole, and (2) payments for  short-term projects that benefit Commerce\u2019s bureaus. The services funded  through both the Working Capital Fund and the Advances and  Reimbursements account include services such as mail management,  library services, and legal counsel. The services funded through the  Advances and Reimbursements account include services provided by the  National Finance Center to support processing NOAA\u2019s payroll and  services provided by Commerce\u2019s Office of Budget to prepare and finalize  the department\u2019s Performance and Accountability Reports as required by  the Government Performance and Results Act.

Commerce\u2019s documents show that its billings to NOAA for the  Working Capital Fund were about $34 million in fiscal year 2007, about  $34.5 million in fiscal year 2008, and about $36 million in fiscal year 2009.  Commerce\u2019s billings to NOAA for the Advances and Reimbursements  account ranged from about $5.6 million in fiscal year 2007 to about $8.9  million in fiscal year 2009. In fiscal year 2009, according to NOAA  documents, NOAA paid for 39 projects through the Working Capital Fund,  ranging in cost from $6,800 to help pay for the upkeep of facilities shared  by several Commerce bureaus, to about $5.2 million to pay for NOAA\u2019s  share of costs for the Commerce Business System, which is the  department\u2019s financial management system. In that same year, Commerce  documents show, Commerce billed NOAA for 31 projects through the  Advances and Reimbursements account, ranging in cost from about $5,200  to pay for Commerce\u2019s grant management support for funding provided  through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to about  $1.8 million for rent to the U.S. General Services Administration.", "In contrast, Commerce does not charge NOAA for the M&A services it  provides through the Salaries and Expenses subaccount of its  Departmental Management account, according to Commerce officials.

According to NOAA documentation, obligations  associated with these services from fiscal years 2007 to 2009 ranged from  $164 million (fiscal year 2009) to $167.5 million (fiscal year 2007), or about  85 percent of the total cost for M&A services provided by NOAA\u2019s  headquarters.", "NOAA\u2019s headquarters funds the remaining 15 percent of M&A services  through direct billings\u2014that is, NOAA\u2019s headquarters internally bills those  receiving services, who then pay for these services with their allocated  funds. NOAA officials told us that they use the direct billing process to pay  for three types of services:    Unplanned services. If there are M&A services that NOAA\u2019s headquarters  must provide but did not anticipate during the annual budget process, it  can use the direct billing process to pay for the services. For example,  according to NOAA officials, in fiscal years 2008 and 2009 NOAA was  required to issue new identification cards to employees and contractors in  compliance with a federal security directive. NOAA had not planned for  this expense, and NOAA used the direct billing process to pay for that  service. Each office was billed for the cost of providing the cards to their  employees and contractors.", "Pooled services. In some cases, NOAA officials determine that it is more  appropriate to procure M&A goods or services at NOAA\u2019s headquarters  level. According to NOAA officials, this procurement approach is used  when it will decrease overall costs and increase efficiency. For example,  NOAA\u2019s headquarters has used its direct billing process to procure IT   infrastructure and e-mail services for all NOAA users, rather than have  individual line offices, FMCs, or programs procure such services  individually.", "Additional services requested by line offices. When line offices request  services not provided by NOAA\u2019s corporate administrative services  appropriation, NOAA officials told us that they can request and pay for  them through the direct billing process. These services have included, for  example, additional legal services requested by NMFS to carry out its  regulatory responsibilities or additional acquisitions support requested by  NESDIS to help complete specialized satellite acquisitions.", "Total direct billing charges varied across offices because NOAA bills each  office the same amount for some services but different amounts for other  services. NOAA\u2019s headquarters bills each office the same amount to pay  for some services, such as developing NOAA\u2019s new strategic plan and  funding the office that staffs NOAA\u2019s Science Advisory Board. For fiscal  years 2007 through 2009, NMFS had the highest direct billing charges of all  offices. According to NMFS officials, this was in part because NMFS uses  the most legal support to carry out its regulatory responsibilities.  Conversely, OAR, with the lowest budget among line offices, had the  lowest direct billing charges.", "Table 2 provides information on NOAA\u2019s reported direct billings by office  for fiscal years 2007 through 2009.", "According to NOAA documents and officials, in fiscal year 2009, the direct  billing process was used to fund 29 projects, ranging in cost from $151,700  to fund a travel management system for NOAA employees in the  Washington, D.C. and Silver Spring offices, to about $12 million for  NOAA\u2019s Office of General Counsel to provide specified legal services to  line offices. NOAA documents indicated that total obligations for direct  bills for fiscal years 2007 through 2009 ranged from $27.2 million to $30.3  million. While some billings were added or increased in those years, others  stayed the same and still others decreased or were no longer funded in  2009. For example, according to NOAA documentation, billings to support  NOAA\u2019s creation of its new strategic plan and to support computerized  legal research contracts did not occur in fiscal year 2007, but were added  in 2009. Furthermore, billings for Office of General Counsel support and  for NOAA\u2019s e-mail services steadily increased from fiscal year 2007  through fiscal year 2009. For example, NOAA officials told us that billings  for the Office of General Counsel increased during those years owing to  increased regulatory responsibilities, largely due to NMFS\u2019s additional  responsibilities related to reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.  Other billing amounts stayed the same in those years, such as those for  NOAA\u2019s Grants Online service or for NOAA\u2019s Science Advisory Board.  Several billings from fiscal year 2007 were no longer funded in fiscal years  2008 and 2009, including billings for a celebration recognizing 200 years of  service by NOAA and its predecessor agencies and NOAA\u2019s initiative on  business process reengineering.", "According to officials in NOAA\u2019s headquarters, using both the corporate  administrative services appropriation and the direct billing process to fund  M&A services provides a good blend of funding mechanisms.

According to NESDIS officials, the line office assessed each of its  PPAs a flat 13.8 percent of the PPA\u2019s federal labor costs and a  supplemental amount. NESDIS officials told us that they used a  supplemental assessment because much of the line office\u2019s funding is for  activities, such as purchasing satellites, where the federal labor costs are  relatively low, and NESDIS does not want to unfairly burden other more  labor-heavy PPAs. For example, NESDIS documents show that for the  Polar Convergence National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental  Satellite System PPA, a PPA with relatively low federal labor costs,  NESDIS assessed 13.8 percent of its federal labor costs (about $1.4  million) but added a supplemental assessment of about $4.1 million. In  contrast, NESDIS assessed its Satellite Command and Control PPA, a PPA  with relatively higher federal labor costs, 13.8 percent of its federal labor  costs, for an assessment of about $2.2 million, but only added a  supplemental assessment of $50,000. Overall, in fiscal year 2009, about 49  percent of NESDIS\u2019s total assessment came from the 13.8 percent charge,  while about 51 percent came from the supplemental assessment.

According to an NOS official, the line office assessed each of its  eligible PPAs a flat percentage of about 8.9 percent of their budgets for  fiscal year 2009. For example, NOS documentation indicated that the line  office assessed its Ocean Health Initiative PPA $356,843 or about 8.9  percent of that PPA\u2019s $4 million budget. Congress placed limits on the  amount of M&A costs that certain NOS PPAs could incur in certain fiscal  years, including fiscal year 2009, and NOS officials told us they made  assessments in accordance with those limits. According to NOS  documentation, the line office\u2019s M&A obligations ranged from about $26.7  million in fiscal year 2007 to about $28 million in fiscal year 2009.", "NWS. According to an NWS official, the line office assessed selected PPAs  different percentages of their budgets, ranging from about 4.2 percent to 5  percent for fiscal year 2009. For example, according to NWS  documentation, NWS assessed the Local Warnings and Forecasts Base  PPA 4.9 percent of that PPA\u2019s roughly $600 million budget, for a total  assessment of about $29.5 million. In addition, NWS assessed the Central  Forecast Guidance PPA about 4.2 percent of that PPA\u2019s allocation of about  $67 million, for a total assessment of about $2.8 million.

In addition, NOAA\u2019s  headquarters documents its procedures for assigning its M&A costs to its  mission support programs. However, this documentation has not been  compiled into a handbook or manual as called for by applicable federal  standards, which makes it more difficult for an independent third party,  such as an auditor, to readily evaluate the appropriateness of the policies  and procedures and may also hamper oversight.", "In addition, for its corporate administrative services appropriation,  NOAA\u2019s headquarters does not assign its M&A costs to the mission  programs they ultimately serve, as would be consistent with federal cost  accounting standards. Specifically, NOAA\u2019s strategic plan has four broad  mission goals (ecosystems; climate; weather and water; and commerce  and transportation) and one mission-support goal. NOAA has numerous  programs under each goal designed to achieve that goal. Programs under  the mission-support goal provide M&A services, such as information  technology and facilities services, to support NOAA\u2019s mission goals and  programs. While officials told us that NOAA assigns costs related to the  corporate administrative services appropriation to programs under its  mission-support goal, it does not assign these costs to NOAA\u2019s other four  goals, which limits information on how much the work related to these  goals costs. This situation represents a change since 2004. Before 2004,  NOAA billed each of its line offices to pay for its corporate administrative  services, but the Senate Committee report accompanying NOAA\u2019s  appropriation in fiscal year 2004 directed the agency to end this cost  assignment.", "NOAA\u2019s documentation of its policies and procedures for the direct billing  process adheres to most but not all of the applicable federal cost  accounting and internal control standards. Specifically, according to  NOAA\u2019s headquarters officials, they do not document in a manual or  handbook their policies regarding the types of M&A services that may be  provided through the direct billing process. This lack of documentation  makes it difficult to ensure that NOAA managers and line office officials  have a clear understanding of what types of M&A services can be provided  through the direct billing process compared to the corporate services  appropriation, especially when staffing changes occur. Officials at NOAA\u2019s  headquarters acknowledged this lack of documentation, and told us that  they plan to draft guidance on the direct billing process that will include  information on the types of M&A services they can provide.", "In contrast, NOAA\u2019s headquarters has documented the procedures it uses  each year to determine the budget for M&A services funded by this  process and its policies and procedures for assigning the costs to the  offices that will benefit from the services. This documentation has  included an annual memo to line and staff office officials outlining the  steps for the direct billing procedure for the upcoming fiscal year. The  memo has noted that line and staff offices requesting directly billed  services must submit their proposed requests to NOAA\u2019s Budget Office  prior to a final review by the Chief Financial Officers\u2019 Council. In addition,  the memo requires a template to be completed that includes information  on what service is being proposed and how much the service will cost. The  template also documents the assignment of the cost of M&A services to  the specific offices that will benefit from the services funded through the  direct billing process, and the justification for why those assignments are  appropriate. Specifically, NOAA\u2019s headquarters requires that direct billing  proposals include documentation of cost assignments to the specific line  and staff offices that will benefit from the services. For example, in 2009,  NOAA\u2019s Office of the Chief Information Officer submitted a proposal  outlining a service to integrate the agency\u2019s e-mail software with its  Blackberry devices, to ensure that these devices could be fully used. The  proposal listed a description and expected cost of the service, and  explained how the cost for the service would be assigned to each line and  staff office. According to NOAA officials, NOAA\u2019s Chief Financial Officers\u2019  Council reviews these proposals and determines, based on a majority vote,  whether line offices should pay for the proposed services. However,  because each directly billed service is submitted to a vote by those who  will pay it, this transparency and the available documentation of the  process provides evidence that costs have been fairly assigned, according  to line office officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Line Office Documentation of Policies and Procedures for M&A Services Generally Does Not Conform to Applicable Federal Standards", "paragraphs": ["The five line offices have no or very limited documentation of their  policies regarding the types of M&A services they provide to the FMCs,  which is not consistent with applicable federal cost accounting and  internal control standards.

Only one office\u2014NMFS\u2014 has limited documentation on the types of M&A services it provides. The  documentation consists of a set of internal guidelines the line office issued  in 1999; however, the guidelines include only general information and have  not been updated. We believe the lack of documentation of the line offices\u2019  policies regarding the types of M&A services they provide decreases FMC  officials\u2019 understanding of what their assessments may fund. For example,  officials from the majority of OAR\u2019s FMCs that provide M&A services told  us they do not receive information from the line office on the M&A  services the line office provides, and that they are not sure what services  they receive for the assessments they pay.

In contrast, according to NESDIS and  NWS officials, they perform a yearly needs assessment to develop their  budget estimates. OAR officials told us that to determine their M&A  budget, they develop specific operating plans. In addition, according to  line office officials, OAR\u2019s Chief Financial Officer chairs a committee that  reviews the budget. However, none of the five line offices could provide us  with documentation that clearly showed the procedures they followed to  ensure consistent implementation from year to year and continuity of the  process if staffing changes occurred.", "Furthermore, the line offices have no or limited documentation of their  policies and procedures for assigning M&A costs and justifications for  those assignments. Specifically, NESDIS, NOS, NWS, or OAR do not  document the assignment of their M&A costs to the specific programs,  activities, or outputs that benefit from M&A services, and they do not  justify why the assignments are appropriate. NMFS has limited  documentation\u2014in the form of an e-mail\u2014that instructs FMCs to draw  their assessments from six specific PPAs. However, we believe that this  documentation is not detailed enough to provide a full understanding of  NMFS\u2019s assessment process or its justification. The line offices\u2019 lack of  documentation of their policies and procedures limits their ability to  explain their assignments to those paying the assessments as well as those  overseeing the process, including NOAA\u2019s headquarters\u2019 officials and  congressional decision makers. Furthermore, a lack of documentation  limits line office officials\u2019 ability to demonstrate that they have chosen the  most appropriate method for assigning M&A costs. For example, NOS  assesses all of its PPAs equally to fund its Office of Special Projects.  However, according to NOS officials, program managers have expressed  concern that the activities of the Office of Special Projects do not equally  benefit all of the PPAs being assessed. NOS officials acknowledge that  there may be more equitable methods for funding some of the costs within  the Office of Special Projects to more accurately align assessments with  benefits. NOS officials told us that they are considering changes to the way  NOS funds projects in the Office of Special Projects.", "Finally, none of the line offices have compiled a handbook or manual  detailing their policies and procedures for their M&A services as called for  by applicable federal standards.

Officials in the NOAA Budget Office  acknowledged that line offices have no or limited documentation of their  policies and procedures for their M&A services.

Specifically, for services  provided by Commerce, we gathered and reviewed data on Commerce\u2019s  billings to NOAA for its Working Capital Fund and Advances and  Reimbursements accounts for fiscal years 2007 through 2009. For services  provided by NOAA\u2019s headquarters, we obtained data from NOAA\u2019s Budget  Office on its (1) obligations from its appropriation for corporate  administrative services and (2) direct billings for M&A services to line and  staff offices.

We used object class  data to estimate NOAA\u2019s salaries and expenses because NOAA does not  separately report salaries and expenses. However, 6 of the 11 budgets  submitted under Commerce do separately report salaries and expenses.  Using the 10 object classes common to the separately reported salaries  and expenses in these six budgets, we were able to estimate NOAA\u2019s  spending related to salaries and expenses. The 10 object classes common  across Commerce bureaus that separately account for salaries and  expenses are object classes (11) personnel compensation; (12) personnel  benefits; (13) benefits for former personnel; (21) travel and transportation  of persons; (22) transportation of things; (23) rent, communications and  utilities; (24) printing and reproduction; (25) other contractual services;  (26) supplies and materials; and (31) equipment. We included object  classes 11, 12, and 13 in the estimation of salaries, and object classes 21,  22, 23, 24, 25, 26, and 31 in the estimation of expenses. The NOAA object  class data we used were extracted by NOAA officials from the agency\u2019s  Management Analysis and Reporting System (MARS). At our request, the  lowest level of detail in the data provided by NOAA officials was at the  program, project, or activity level (PPA).", "In the letter portion of this report, we provided information and estimates  related to NOAA\u2019s salaries and expenses at a summary level. To do so, we  aggregated multiple object classes to estimate both salaries and expenses.  In addition, we aggregated object class spending data to make estimates  by activity, for example, the total estimated salaries and expenses for  NMFS. We determined that the object class data were sufficiently reliable  to report in the aggregate. We based this conclusion on interviews with  NOAA officials, who stated they adhere to internal controls and  consistently use the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s object class  standards and object class definitions throughout NOAA. In addition, we  reviewed documentation including yearly audit reports on Commerce\u2019s  and NOAA\u2019s financial statements and reports outlining findings and  corrective actions from internal reviews of NOAA\u2019s information  technology systems. Nonetheless, the apparent precision of object class  data can be misleading because similar types of spending can be assigned  to different object classes even though they are for the same type of  service. For example, for personal services contracts with federal  employees, basic pay and compensation above the basic pay would be  classified in object class 11, personnel compensation. On the other hand,  payments for personal services contracts for operation and maintenance  of facilities would be classified under object class 25, other contractual  services. In this example, even though both instances of spending were for  labor, they were assigned to different object classes. In addition, the data  may lack precision if NOAA did not include a salary or expense spending  amount in 1 of the 10 object classes we used to estimate salaries and  expenses. In that case, the expense would not be included in our estimate.  For example, NOAA line office officials also told us that object class 77 is  used by some line offices to record obligations that may include salaries  and expenses.", "More detailed estimates of NOAA\u2019s salaries and expenses for fiscal year  2009, on the basis of obligations data reported by NOAA for selected  object classes, are listed in appendix II.
