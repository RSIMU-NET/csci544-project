As the administrator of FECA, DOL has responsibility and authority for managing all claims, but employing agencies have roles in returning employees to work. DOD FECA program managers, injury compensation specialists, and liaisons GAO interviewed reported experiencing some challenges in instances requiring DOL action or approval, such as determining whether a potential job is suitable in order to return an injured employee to work. According to DOD officials, in some instances such determinations have taken over a year, which could affect DOD as it must both hold the job unfilled and continue to pay compensation until a decision is made. According to DOL, this process can take several months due to the amount of information and communication required among the employing agency, the injured employee, DOL, and other parties, such as an employee's physician. Additionally, DOD has not monitored the timelines associated with requesting DOL action to determine the extent to which delays or related issues may exist across DOD, any known reasons for these issues, and any effect possible delays may have on DOD's return-to-work efforts. DOD officials said that such monitoring could help them understand any issues. DOL officials stated that if DOD experiences challenges, more information could help DOL find a solution.

In instances where federal employees\u2014 including DOD civilians\u2014become injured or ill as a result of a work- related incident, they are covered under the Federal Employees\u2019  Compensation Act (FECA) program. The FECA program provides cash  payments, medical care, and other benefits to employees who sustain  disabilities resulting from work-related injuries or diseases, and also aims  to return injured employees to work whenever possible. The FECA  program is administered by the Department of Labor\u2019s (DOL) Office of  Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs. As of June 30, 2015, approximately  277,775 federal employees had submitted claims for FECA benefits over  the preceding 12 months, and benefits paid during that period amounted  to approximately $3.1 billion.", "Employing departments and agencies, including DOD, play a critical role  in assisting DOL\u2019s management of claims and are the program\u2019s first  point of contact with the injured worker\u2014notifying employees of their  rights under FECA and submitting the initial claim. Program regulations  allow employing agencies to controvert or otherwise contest facts  presented in an injured worker\u2019s claim for FECA benefits. Once a claim  has been accepted by DOL, employing agencies continue to play a role in  the program, for example by monitoring the claim and assisting  employees with their return to work once DOL determines that an injured  employee can return to work.", "In March 2012, we identified four areas of FECA management challenges  reported in past reviews conducted by DOL and employing agencies\u2019  inspectors general. These challenges involve (1) oversight, (2)  information technology, (3) legislative reform, and (4) other factors. For  example, we found that federal agencies\u2019 inspectors general\u2014citing  ongoing program weaknesses mostly related to oversight\u2014reported  avoidable costs at agencies, which one department reported were as high  as $41 million in 2011.

These data covered the period  from July 1, 2014, through June 30, 2015. We chose these data because  they were the most recent complete data available. We analyzed these  data for the following characteristics of claimants and beneficiaries: (1)  total- and partial-disability status, (2) age, (3) age at time of injury, (4)  number of years since injury, (5) type of benefit, and (6) benefit amount.  We also analyzed the data for FECA beneficiaries over their full Social  Security retirement age, based on their date of birth. We further analyzed  the data regarding the specific population of total-disability beneficiaries  since they represented a large proportion of DOD\u2019s total FECA cash  payments. We assessed the reliability of the data elements we used by  (1) electronically testing required data elements, (2) reviewing information  about the data and the system that produced them, and (3) interviewing  agency officials knowledgeable about the data. We determined that the  data elements we used were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  reporting objectives.", "For the second objective, we obtained and analyzed relevant federal law,  regulations, policies, procedures, and guidance for information on the  FECA program and to identify the roles and responsibilities of DOL, DOD,  and the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.

Partial-disability FECA beneficiaries with eligible  dependents receive a FECA benefit that is 75 percent of the difference  between their preinjury and postinjury wage-earning capacity, and those  without dependents receive 66-2/3 percent of the difference.  Additionally, benefits are adjusted annually for cost-of-living increases  and are neither subject to age restriction nor taxed. See figure 1 for an  example of how disability benefit payments are calculated.", "There are certain restrictions or offsets for FECA beneficiaries if they are  eligible for or receive other federal benefits, such as from federal  retirement plans or other disability benefits. For instance, while  beneficiaries who receive medical benefits or schedule awards can  receive federal retirement benefits concurrently, such as benefits under  the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), beneficiaries  receiving wage-loss compensation (i.e., disability benefits) must elect to  receive one or the other. However, FECA does not require beneficiaries  to retire at a certain age and transition to their designated federal  retirement program. FECA beneficiaries can continue receiving FECA  compensation payments for as long as they remain unable to work due to  a workplace injury. Beneficiaries who are eligible for both FECA and  disability benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs or the Social  Security Administration face restrictions on concurrent benefits for the  same injury.

One possible disincentive is the  greater rate of compensation for beneficiaries with at least one  dependent. DOL has reported that most FECA beneficiaries fall into this  category and receive 75 percent of their preinjury wages tax-free, which  can in certain instances result in compensation greater than the injured  worker\u2019s usual take-home pay. As FECA benefits do not have an age  limit, a second potential disincentive to return to work may exist if FECA  benefits are more generous than the retirement benefits that an individual  would receive as a federal annuitant.", "An incentive to return to work within the FECA program is the reduction of  benefits for partial-disability beneficiaries, as noted in our prior work.  Specifically, benefits for partial disability are reduced based on wage- earning capacity by taking into account the income a beneficiary could  earn\u2014whether a beneficiary finds a job or not. As such, in order for an  injured worker to maximize total income, he or she has an incentive to  find work that meets his or her work capabilities.", "In our 2012 work, we examined FECA benefit levels in relation to take- home pay and retirement benefits, as some policymakers raised  questions about the level of FECA benefits, especially compared to  retirement benefits.

Our simulations  showed that for 2010 total-disability beneficiaries, a median of 80 percent  of take-home pay was replaced by FECA for non-U.S. Postal Service  employees and a median of 88 percent for Postal employees.  Additionally, the median percentage of take-home pay replaced by FECA  was 3 percentage points greater for beneficiaries with an eligible  dependent than for those without eligible dependents.", "Our comparison between simulated FECA benefits and retirement  focused on the retirement benefits package under the current Federal  Employees Retirement System (FERS), which consists of a pension  based on years of service and salary, the 401(k)-like Thrift Savings Plan,  and Social Security benefits.

According to the DOL FECA Procedure  Manual, this process can involve a variety of considerations and  information that is submitted by multiple parties including the employing  agency, the claimant, often the claimant\u2019s physician, and other medical  referrals as necessary. Second opinions may be requested by DOL to  obtain an additional medical evaluation to clarify the claimant\u2019s condition,  the extent of a disability, work capacity, or other issues. During our  review, 9 of the 12 injury compensation specialists and liaisons we spoke  with, as well as all four of the program offices, reported experiencing  some challenges pertaining to lengthy response times from DOL\u2019s claims  examiners, such as when submitting requests to DOL for suitability  determinations and second opinions. For instance, according to Defense  Civilian Personnel Advisory Service officials, DOD has experienced what  they perceive as lengthy periods waiting for suitability determinations from  DOL, in some instances over a year. DOL officials told us that the  process can take several months due to the exchange of information  among each of the parties involved, including DOL, the employing agency  (such as DOD), and the claimant. Additionally, the claimant is entitled to  due process of between 20 and 45 days depending on the circumstances  of the claim, according to DOL officials.", "Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service officials stated that they  understand it takes time to make decisions about claims, especially given  the claims examiners\u2019 caseloads, and the amount of documentation they  must review, including the required information they must collect from  doctors and the claimant. However, waiting for such long periods,  according to DOD officials, creates a hardship on the employing agency,  as it must both keep the position open for the injured employee, as well  as continue to pay the claimant until a decision is made. Although officials  from the Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service and all three  military department FECA program offices we spoke to cited the lengthy  response times for suitability determinations as a difficulty they  experience, officials did not provide further data or information on these  instances, and Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service officials said  such cases are not monitored across the department. Additionally,  according to DOL officials, even after DOL has reached a decision there  is often continued back and forth between DOL and the claimant to  provide additional documentation, or between DOL and the employing  agency in order to provide additional or revised documentation. According  to DOD and DOL officials, they seek to resolve such delays or other  issues at the case-management level\u2014between the DOD injury  compensation specialist and the DOL claims examiner\u2014so the reasons  for the delay may not be elevated to higher levels, or monitored across  the department, if they are ultimately resolved.", "In addition to concerns with response times for suitability determinations,  three of the four FECA program managers we spoke with, as well as five  injury compensation specialists, specifically cited the length of time it  takes DOL to approve or process second opinions as a key challenge  they perceive during the return-to-work process. For example, one  program manager stated that when a second opinion medical evaluation  is conducted, that evaluation is valid for 1 year, so if DOL does not review  and act on the information in a timely manner it may result in the need for  an additional medical evaluation. Further, according to that program  manager, second-opinion evaluations can cost between $2,000 and  $7,000, and this cost is borne by the employing agency, as well as the  cost of a subsequent second opinion if the first one expires. However, this  official did not provide specific examples or the frequency with which this  issue occurred, and Defense Civilian Personnel and Advisory Service  officials do not know the extent to which this may be a problem across the  department. All three DOD liaisons we spoke with, as well as DOL, said  that it is difficult to provide expectations for the amount of time it may take  DOL to take action, in part because of elements outside of DOL\u2019s control,  such as the scheduling of appointments and submission of medical  documentation, and because every claim has its own set of facts and  circumstances.", "DOL procedures require claims examiners to respond to employing  agencies within some established time frames, according to DOL officials,  but there is no established time frame within which they are required to  make suitability determinations, approve a second-opinion request, or  complete the review of related medical documentation. There are also  instances, according to DOL officials, when a DOL claims examiner may  not agree that a second opinion is appropriate. According to the DOL  FECA Procedure Manual, however, employing agencies should expect to  receive information from DOL relevant to the claim-management process,  including prompt determinations on medical issues and the suitability of  job offers when needed. DOL officials stated that they generally expect  to respond to agency requests from employing agencies within 30 days,  and if they are aware of any overdue requests or issues with claims  examiner performance they try to resolve them between the claims  examiner and the employing agency at the lowest possible level, and the  issue is only raised to the district office or higher if it is not resolved.  Officials added that it is challenging to establish expected standard time  frames for certain requests, such as suitability determinations, given the  variability of requests and the specific circumstances and details of each  case.", "One of the ways DOD injury claims specialists seek information on  suitability determinations and second-opinion requests, among other  claims-related information, is through DOL\u2019s central phone system. Many  of the DOD officials we spoke with cited the reliance on this phone  system for direct communication as a complicating factor in attempting to  discuss these and other information requests with DOL claims examiners.  Specifically, 7 of the 12 injury compensation specialists and liaisons  identified issues related to DOL\u2019s consistency and timeliness in  responding to agency requests using DOL\u2019s centralized phone system.  For example, FECA program managers from all three military  departments, as well as two injury compensation specialists, noted  instances in which DOL either did not respond in a timely manner or  never returned the phone call. The DOL FECA Procedure Manual  requires that DOL claims examiners respond to phone calls within 2 work  days, and DOL officials stated that leaving a voice-mail message is  sufficient to meet this deadline. According to DOL officials, agency  requests can be submitted to DOL claims examiners through ECOMP or  via postal mail, in addition to DOL\u2019s central phone system. One DOD  injury compensation specialist stated that, due to the challenges  experienced in reaching a claims examiner by phone, it is more efficient  to use ECOMP\u2014which allows adding additional notes to previous entries  into the system\u2014to ensure the DOL claims examiner receives the  updates. However, this specialist added that ECOMP does not convey  whether or not the claims examiner has taken action on these follow-up  requests.", "All of the DOD officials we spoke with\u201412 injury compensation  specialists and liaisons, as well as each of the military departments\u2019  FECA program offices, and FECA management at the Defense Civilian  Personnel Advisory Service\u2014highlighted difficulties with the  communication timelines between DOD and DOL. However, while the  military departments\u2019 program offices cover the majority of the FECA  beneficiaries, we did not speak to a generalizable sample of the FECA  program staff at DOD, and the officials we spoke with could only present  their individual experiences. Further according to officials from the  Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service, DOD has not monitored  FECA program processes such as communication timelines and  response times between DOD and DOL, nor has it tracked any known  reasons or solutions to any related issues, on a department-wide basis  across its approximately 800 FECA injury compensation specialist staff.", "DOL officials stated that if DOD is experiencing ongoing challenges, more  information about these challenges would be helpful to find a solution.  They added that DOL has an open-door policy, and a number of existing  mechanisms are intended to facilitate general communication between  the employing agencies and DOL. For example, DOL officials stated that  many issues are resolved at the claims examiner level, or after being  elevated to the district-office level, and while district offices can track  responsiveness and other issues in their district to identify any issues, this  is not done across agencies. However, DOL and Defense Civilian  Personnel Advisory Service officials noted that there is ongoing staff  turnover among the DOD injury compensation specialists and DOL claims  examiners. According to Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service  officials, such turnover can make monitoring the claims process more  difficult at the injury compensation specialist level, though they noted that  the role of the DOD liaisons can mitigate this by providing continuity  across the FECA program. According to DOD officials, the DOD liaisons  serve a key function in providing information to DOD injury claims  specialists as well as facilitating communication at the DOL district-office  level since they are colocated with DOL claims examiners at these offices  and are able to be in more immediate contact.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  ongoing monitoring should occur in the course of normal operations.  Monitoring should assess the quality of performance over time and  ensure that the findings are promptly resolved. DOD has monitored  high-level program metrics such as return-to-work rates and overall  timelines, but Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service officials stated  that particular claims-processing timelines\u2014such as response times  between DOD and DOL\u2014are not specifically collected or monitored.  According to Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service officials, DOD  has internal mechanisms through which such monitoring or information  gathering of the FECA process could occur, such as the function of  liaisons in DOL district offices and installation-level working groups, as  well as periodic program office\u2013level meetings. Additionally, Defense  Civilian Personnel Advisory Service officials stated that the increased  access to ECOMP will provide further visibility of FECA claims and the  decisions and actions that DOD is waiting for from DOL.", "Based on our interviews with FECA program officials at DOD, issues such  as difficulties contacting DOL claims examiners and lengthy response  times occur between DOD and DOL. However, the extent to which this is  a problem across the department is unknown. In our past work we have  found that leading practices for results-oriented organizations state that it  is important for organizations to have complete, accurate, and consistent  information to support decision-making. Further, leading practices for  effective interagency collaboration state that frequent communication is a  means to work across agency boundaries and prevent  misunderstanding. Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service officials  stated that monitoring information like response times could help them  further understand any issues or problems they may experience and help  inform future communication with DOL. DOL officials added that if there is  an issue within DOD that is not being elevated or reported up their own  chain of command, then DOL is likely unaware of the issue as well.  Without monitoring or collecting information on issues DOD may  experience, including any known reasons for or resolutions to delays,  department leadership will not be positioned to identify and assess the  nature of any problems, and make any appropriate internal improvements  or external improvements in collaboration with DOL."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In 2015, DOD employees constituted nearly one-fifth of all FECA  beneficiaries across the federal government\u2014the highest number outside  the U.S. Postal Service.

Given the substantial monetary outlay this  represents, DOD needs accurate information on the operation of the  FECA program, including the timeliness of its various processes.  Facilitating return-to-work outcomes can depend on timely job-suitability  determinations. While not generalizable, our discussions with the military  departments\u2019 injury compensation specialists, DOD liaisons, and FECA  program managers indicate that the department may face challenges in  its efforts to work with DOL to effectively manage DOD\u2019s FECA process.
