Newborn screening is a state public health activity, and includes the collection of a blood specimen from the newborn, specimen arrival at a state's lab, and results reporting. Barriers at any stage of this process can lead to delays in treatment and potential harm to the newborn. The Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2014 included improving timeliness as an explicit goal for HRSA-supported newborn screening programs, which include technical assistance for and data collection from participating states.", "The act included a provision for GAO to review newborn screening timeliness. This report examines (1) what is known about the timeliness of newborn screening for heritable conditions; and (2) barriers identified as contributing to screening delays, and strategies used to address them. GAO reviewed time-frame goals from the advisory committee, an August 2016 report from NewSTEPs with an analysis of annual timeliness data from states for 2012 through 2015 (the most recently available data), and a 2014 report on a survey conducted for the advisory committee. GAO also reviewed relevant documents and interviewed officials from NewSTEPs, two advisory committee members who worked on timeliness issues, and newborn screening officials in four states selected because they were focusing on activities related to newborn screening timeliness."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Most states that reported timeliness data had not screened newborns within recommended goals to detect conditions that may require treatment. The Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children recommended time-frame goals in 2015 for newborn screening, such as reporting all results within 7 days of birth. Data provided by 38 states for 2012-2015 showed that states generally had not met the committee's suggested benchmark of meeting each time-frame goal for at least 95 percent of specimens, which the committee encouraged states to achieve by 2017. Missing data and variations in data collection limit a full understanding of timeliness trends, but HHS's Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) has supported activities to address these challenges. HRSA supports the Newborn Screening Technical assistance and Evaluation Program (NewSTEPs), which collects newborn screening data. NewSTEPs has been taking steps to improve data for future analysis, such as by clarifying data definitions and working with states to help ensure they use these definitions when submitting timeliness data.", "State newborn screening officials identified numerous barriers to timely newborn screening, and a variety of strategies to address them. Newborn screening officials who responded to the advisory committee's 2014 survey identified barriers, such as a lack of understanding of the importance of timely screening for out-of-hospital births, limited courier availability to transport specimens to a lab, and insufficient lab hours. Selected state newborn screening officials interviewed by GAO reported developing various strategies to address these barriers. For example, one state increased courier service so rural hospitals located far from the state's lab could shorten specimen transport time. HRSA has been providing states with technical assistance, but it is too soon to determine which strategies developed through this technical assistance, if any, will have a measurable impact on timeliness.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, HHS generally agreed with the report's findings, but questioned the use of 2017 benchmark goals to measure performance and the exclusion of two conditions. GAO believes its use of the 2017 benchmark and scope were appropriate, as discussed in the report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each year, more than 12,000 newborns are born with heritable or other  conditions that require early detection and treatment to prevent serious  illness or death. Early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of these  conditions may prevent a child\u2019s death, serious illness, or disability. For  example, newborns with galactosemia cannot properly digest a certain  type of sugar and must avoid milk products to prevent organ damage or  death. Newborns with maple syrup urine disease cannot properly break  down certain proteins that can build up in the blood to toxic levels; if  untreated, these newborns are at risk for brain damage, coma, or death.", "Virtually all newborns in the United States (about 4 million each year) are  screened for heritable and other conditions, but barriers experienced in  any stage of the newborn screening process can lead to delays in  reporting results and beginning needed treatment. Newborn screening  involves three stages. First, after birth, a health care provider collects a  blood specimen from the newborn on a card. Next, this specimen is sent  to a state lab for testing. Lastly, the results are reported to the newborn\u2019s  provider. Newborn screening is a state public health activity, with each  state responsible for designing and implementing its own newborn  screening system. As a result, states may experience varying barriers to timely screening\u2014such as problems with timely preparation of specimens  for shipment to the lab\u2014and use different strategies to address such  barriers.", "While largely a state public health activity, the federal government has a  role in newborn screening. For example, the Children\u2019s Health Act of  2000 authorized the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to  award grants to improve the ability of states to provide newborn screening  for heritable conditions. In addition, Congress created a clearinghouse  for newborn screening information under the Newborn Screening Saves  Lives Act of 2007. Time-frame goals for completing newborn screening  were initially identified in a 2005 report prepared for HHS\u2019s Advisory  Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children.  Subsequently, following news reports in late 2013 and an advisory  committee survey of states in early 2014, concerns were raised that many  states were not performing newborn screening in a timely manner. Soon  after, the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2014  was enacted, incorporating timeliness improvement as an explicit goal for  newborn screening efforts supported by HHS\u2019s Health Resources and  Services Administration (HRSA). These efforts involve newborn  screening education, data collection, technical assistance, and other  activities. For example, HRSA supports the Newborn Screening Technical  assistance and Evaluation Program (NewSTEPs), which involves the  collection of newborn screening data from states on a voluntary basis  through a data repository. In 2015, the advisory committee identified new  time-frame goals and NewSTEPs updated the data repository to allow for  states to submit timeliness data on the new goals.", "The Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2014  included a provision for GAO to report on the timeliness of newborn  screening for heritable conditions.

For its report,  NewSTEPs requested data from all 53 states for 2012 through 2015, and  38 states submitted annual timeliness data that were included in the  report. This included 20 of the states that had signed a memorandum of  understanding (MOU) with APHL to enter data into the data repository  under NewSTEPs and 18 other states that submitted timeliness data  using an equivalent spreadsheet. We also reviewed documents provided  by NewSTEPs, and interviewed officials from APHL and the University of  Colorado\u2019s School of Public Health regarding the data repository,  including methods for entering data into the repository, and regarding the  NewSTEPs August 2016 report.", "In addition, we reviewed the advisory committee\u2019s April 2015 letter to the  Secretary of Health and Human Services that included the committee\u2019s  time-frame goals and the benchmark that states should meet each of  these time-frame goals for at least 95 percent of specimens by 2017. We  also interviewed APHL and University of Colorado School of Public  Health officials about any plans to track newborn screening timeliness in  the future. We interviewed newborn screening stakeholders identified by  APHL officials and on HRSA\u2019s website to learn about efforts to track  newborn screening timeliness. These stakeholders included a member of  the advisory committee who co-chaired a timeliness workgroup, a  member of the advisory committee who conducted research related to  newborn screening barriers, and officials from associations (including the  Association of Maternal & Child Health Programs, Association of State  and Territorial Health Officials, Genetic Alliance, and March of Dimes).", "We assessed the reliability of the annual timeliness data in the  NewSTEPs August 2016 report by, for example, reviewing whether the 38  states that submitted data used common data definitions and whether  there were mechanisms in place to mitigate data entry errors (such as  automatic calculations of percentages), and determined that they were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. These timeliness data are not  generalizable to other states, but provided valuable insight on what is  known about newborn screening timeliness in the reporting states.", "To examine barriers identified as contributing to delays in newborn  screening for heritable conditions, and strategies being used to address  them, we reviewed documents, including reports and presentations on  newborn screening timeliness. Specifically, we reviewed the advisory  committee\u2019s 2014 Newborn Screening Timeliness Survey Report, which  identified barriers to and strategies for timely newborn screening based  on survey results from newborn screening officials in 51 states. From the  survey report, we selected barriers identified by respondents as having a  major or moderate impact on timeliness; barriers that were frequently  reported by survey respondents in written responses; and barriers in the  survey that were also highlighted by a number of state newborn screening  officials in published presentations and reports. Through a combination of  written responses and interviews, we then collected more detailed  information about these barriers and strategies developed to address  them from officials in four selected states: Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota,  and Wisconsin. We selected these states because they were focusing on  activities related to newborn screening timeliness, which would allow  them to provide more detailed information on a number of barriers and  strategies. The information from these states is not generalizable to other  states, but provided information on strategies used to address identified  barriers.", "We reviewed documents provided by APHL officials, including the  NewSTEPs August 2016 report, which contained information on steps  some states had undertaken to improve timeliness. We interviewed  officials from APHL and the University of Colorado\u2019s School of Public  Health to learn about plans to share information from NewSTEPs 360,  which is a program administered by these organizations to provide  technical assistance focused on newborn screening timeliness to states  through grants. We also interviewed these officials to clarify or elaborate  on barriers to timely newborn screening and strategies to address them.

According to these officials, this protocol can  result in late collection of some specimens; for example, among  newborns born via Caesarean-section, who often have longer hospital  stays. To improve the timeliness of specimen collection, this state  recommended that hospitals make nursing protocols consistent with the  advisory committee goal to collect specimens within 24 to 48 hours of  birth, and has developed educational strategies to advise providers to aim  for collection to take place within 24 hours of birth.", "A lack of feedback from state newborn screening officials to hospitals was  also identified as a barrier to timely specimen collection, according to  newborn screening officials who responded to the 2014 survey, because  providers may be unaware that they are not meeting timeliness goals.  Officials we interviewed from three states reported developing or  improving methods of providing feedback to hospitals through online  quality reports or report cards. For example, newborn screening officials  in one state we interviewed said they provide feedback to hospitals  through report cards that evaluate hospital performance based on the  advisory committee\u2019s goal for timely specimen collection. The report  cards are disseminated monthly and include an outlier report that alerts  facilities when specific specimens do not meet the timeliness goal.  According to the officials, these outliers showed problems with timeliness  at neonatal intensive care units (NICU). As a result, the state began  reporting NICU timeliness separately on the report cards; subsequently,  newborn screening officials reported that NICU timeliness has improved.", "Arizona\u2019s Efforts to Address Barriers to Timely Screening for Out-of-Hospital  Births  Newborn screening officials in Arizona have focused on improving the timeliness of  newborn screening for out-of-hospital births. Generally, according to newborn screening  officials, babies born outside of a hospital\u2014such as in birthing centers (freestanding  facilities separate from hospitals) and home births\u2014have higher rates of delayed  specimen collection. Newborn screening officials in Arizona attributed this to a variety of  causes, including a lack of understanding among providers about the importance of  timely screening, and a lack of standardization of protocols for birthing centers and  home births. For example, for healthy, low-risk deliveries outside of hospitals, midwives  often leave 4 hours after the baby is born and may not follow up during the period when  specimen collection should occur. Since 2011, Arizona has provided education and  basic background training on newborn screening to midwives individually and through  the state\u2019s midwifery association to help address this barrier. Newborn screening  officials explained that following the increased outreach and training, newborn  screening timeliness for out-of-hospital births has improved, but noted that midwives  continue to have problems seeking reimbursement for newborn screening services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stage 2: Specimen Collection to Lab Arrival", "paragraphs": ["Newborn screening officials who responded to the 2014 survey identified  a variety of barriers that may delay the arrival of newborn screening  specimens at the state lab, including hospitals and other providers waiting  to send specimens to the lab in batches, insufficient lab operating hours,  and a lack of courier services for transporting specimens. (See table 7.)", "One barrier to timely completion of stage 2 (collection to lab arrival)  identified by officials responding to the 2014 survey was providers waiting  to send specimens to the lab in batches. To address this practice,  known as batching, officials from selected states reported employing  strategies that involved providing feedback and training to providers at  hospitals. According to newborn screening officials in one state, when  specimens take more than 3 days from birth to arrive at a lab\u2014which  corresponds with the combined time-frame goals for stage 1 and stage  2\u2014hospitals are asked to review those cases and avoid batching in the  future.", "Another barrier identified by officials responding to the 2014 survey is that  lab staff are not always available to receive newborn screening  specimens, because the lab\u2019s operating hours do not align with courier  service, mail, or other delivery service times. In three of the selected  states, state officials told us that they addressed this barrier by having lab  staff available on Saturday to receive and test specimens or to ensure  they can be tested first thing Monday morning. Officials in one of these  states also reported developing a process for cases in which a geneticist  believes a baby\u2019s specimen is likely positive for a time-critical condition.  Under this process, the baby\u2019s physician calls the state newborn  screening program, and a courier or a state health official will pick up the  specimen within 2 hours for transport to the lab for immediate testing.", "Colorado\u2019s Efforts to Expand Courier Service to Mitigate Geographic Challenges  Newborn screening officials in Colorado told us that they expanded courier service to all  hospitals in 2015 to address barriers to timely arrival of specimens at the state lab after  specimen collection. According to these officials, prior to 2015, rural hospitals facing  geographic challenges, such as long distances to the state lab, relied on mail services  to transport newborn screening specimens to the lab. Beginning in April 2015, the  newborn screening program\u2019s courier service was expanded to all hospitals in the state,  including these rural hospitals. Newborn screening officials explained that courier  service is particularly beneficial for hospitals located long distances from the state lab,  because it can include direct transport from the hospital to a nearby airport, a flight, and  direct transport from the airport to the lab. In addition, courier service was expanded to  have pick-up 6 days per week for all hospitals. This increase in courier service provides  additional opportunities for timely specimen pick up from the hospital for transporting to  the lab.

Officials from one state told us that their strategy to  address this barrier included expanding lab operating hours to 6 days a  week: specimens are processed Monday through Saturday, allowing the  lab to report results for time-critical conditions to providers on Sunday  instead of waiting until Monday.", "Additionally, according to some state newborn screening officials we  interviewed, another barrier to timely reporting is that some labs report  results to providers via mail; as a result, providers could wait up to a week  to receive results after they are sent. Newborn screening officials in one  state told us that they updated provider records to include fax numbers  and began faxing newborn screening results to providers. Newborn  screening officials in two other states told us that they are beginning or  planning to report presumptive positive results electronically prior to  sending them by mail; for example, seven hospitals in one of these states  are piloting a program that allows providers to electronically access  results as soon as screening tests are completed at the lab.", "Wisconsin\u2019s Efforts to Improve Its Laboratory Information Management System  Newborn screening officials in Wisconsin reported updating their laboratory information  management system (LIMS) to align with newborn screening quality indicators to  provide better feedback on newborn screening timeliness to hospitals, and to allow  electronic messaging between hospitals and labs in the future, increasing record  accuracy and reducing the need for manual entry. State newborn screening officials  told us that to align LIMS with newborn screening quality indicators, they added new  fields to LIMS to accurately measure time taken to complete the stages of the newborn  screening process. For example, they explained that by adding a field in LIMS to record  the time a specimen was received at a lab they can more accurately measure the  amount of time between specimen collection and receipt at the lab. Newborn screening  officials said that with this feedback, hospitals should be able to better identify changes  needed to improve timeliness. Wisconsin also reported updating its LIMS to meet  Health Level 7 standards, known as HL7, which provide a framework for health  information retrieval and exchange from one information system to another (in this case  from hospitals\u2019 information systems to LIMS). Wisconsin newborn screening officials  are working with hospitals to standardize information in their electronic health  information systems so that newborn screening tests can be ordered electronically and  LIMS can automatically retrieve and exchange demographic and other information from  hospital systems, reducing the need for manual entry of information and increasing  accuracy.

The goal of these coaching calls is to help states achieve  the advisory committee\u2019s benchmark of timely reporting of newborn  screening results for 95 percent of newborn screening specimens by  2017. According to newborn screening officials from two states that  participate in NewSTEPs 360, the coaching calls help states prioritize  their efforts to improve newborn screening timeliness and help states hold  themselves accountable for meeting milestones, because they report on  progress made during each monthly call. In addition, these officials said  that participating in NewSTEPs 360 allows them to learn about strategies  developed by other participating states. For example, officials in one state  told us that they formed a small group of officials from states working to  update their LIMS to meet Health Level 7 standards (known as HL7) for  electronic health information exchange. (These standards provide a  framework for health information retrieval and exchange from one  information system to another\u2014in this case from hospital information  systems to LIMS.)

This  includes, for example, free education on newborn screening specimen  collection through an online training portal. According to an official at  Genetic Alliance, the organization is also involved in identifying barriers  that contribute to newborn screening delays and strategies to address  such barriers. Based on information gathered in focus groups with  nursery and NICU nurses held in June 2016, Genetic Alliance drafted a  number of recommendations for hospitals and nurses to help address  barriers to timely newborn screening. These recommendations include  working with nurses to better integrate updated newborn screening  guidance\u2014such as the advisory committee\u2019s 2015 time-frame goal for  collecting newborn screening specimens\u2014into nurses\u2019 protocols for  newborn screening.", "It is too soon to determine which strategies, if any, developed through  HRSA-supported technical assistance have a measurable impact on  improving timeliness in states participating in NewSTEPs 360, and  whether these strategies could be effective in additional states.

Our analysis is of the most recent data available, and our  report states clearly that the advisory committee recommended states  achieve these goals by 2017. Time-frame goals for completing newborn  screening were initially identified in 2005, and concerns about the  timeliness of screening date back to at least late 2013.

The August 2016 report included data collected  from states through a data repository maintained by APHL under  NewSTEPs.", "The data repository includes (but is not limited to) annual timeliness data  collected from states participating in NewSTEPs. These annual  timeliness data are based on time-frame goals recommended by HHS\u2019s  Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children in  April 2015 and data definitions developed by a workgroup composed of  newborn screening experts and stakeholders convened by APHL. For  individual newborn screening stages (e.g., specimen collection to lab  arrival) or the full newborn screening process, the data measure the  percentages of a state\u2019s specimens screened within the advisory  committee\u2019s time-frame goals. For example, the data measure the  percentage of specimens for which all results for all conditions were  reported within the advisory\u2019s committee\u2019s goal of 7 days after birth. For  the August 2016 report, NewSTEPs requested annual timeliness data  from all 53 states, and 38 states submitted data that were included in this  report. (See table 9.) Of the 38 states reporting timeliness data included  in the report, 20 states entered data directly into the data repository and  18 additional states did not have a signed memorandum of understanding  (MOU) and submitted equivalent data using a spreadsheet provided by  NewSTEPs. For all 38 states included in the report, NewSTEPs  determined the percentages of specimens screened within each of the  committee\u2019s 2015 time-frame goals (for the full newborn screening  process or individual stages) in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. The  NewSTEPs report also included the median, quartiles, minimum, and  maximum percentage meeting the 2015 time-frame goal in each year.", "We assessed the reliability of the annual data in the NewSTEPs August  2016 report for the purposes of examining what is known about the  timeliness of newborn screening by taking several steps. For example, we  reviewed spreadsheets sent to states without an MOU and confirmed that  the spreadsheets were based on the same definitions as the data  repository (used by states with signed MOUs). We also confirmed that the  spreadsheets had a built-in mechanism to mitigate data entry errors, such  as automatic calculation of percentages. We interviewed officials from  APHL and the University of Colorado\u2019s School of Public Health to confirm  that the data repository also had mechanisms to reduce risks of error. For  example, these officials said the data repository can automatically  calculate percentages and identify obvious data errors, such as values  over 100 percent. These officials also noted that the data combined from  the data repository and spreadsheets were based on common data  definitions and that the data were carefully reviewed and searched for  outliers before being reported. Based on these steps, we determined that  these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report.

Hb  S/C tends to be milder than Hb SS; therefore, treatment with penicillin may not be  recommended.", "Without early testing, most babies with hearing loss are not diagnosed until age two or  three. By then, they often have delayed speech and language development. Early  diagnosis allows use of hearing aids by six months, helping prevent serious speech and  language problems.", "Lack of an enzyme that converts the amino acid homocysteine into cystathionine, needed  for normal brain development. Untreated, leads to mental retardation, eye problems,  skeletal abnormalities, and stroke.  Treatment consists of a special diet, one or more vitamins (B6 or B12), and other  supplements.", "Inherited vitamin metabolism defect. Can lead to buildup of acids in blood, brain damage,  seizures, paralysis, coma, and death.  Treatment includes B12 injections and a low-protein diet.", "Thyroid hormone deficiency that severely retards growth and brain development.  Treatment includes thyroid hormone replacement therapy with dietary restrictions.", "A group of rare inherited disorders characterized by defects in two critical immune system  cells that are normally mobilized by the body to combat infections. SCID has also been  referred to in the popular media as the \u201cbubble boy disease.\u201d Without treatment, infants  with SCID are more susceptible to and can develop recurrent infections, leading to failure  to thrive and often death.", "Sickle cell disease is an inherited disease of red blood cells. Individuals with sickle cell  disease have abnormal hemoglobin, the protein inside red blood cells that carries oxygen  to every part of the body.", "Description   Lack of an enzyme that causes the byproducts of the amino acid tyrosine, particularly a  very toxic compound (succinylacetone), to build up in the liver. Fatal liver and kidney  failure may result.  Treatment includes dietary restrictions and medication to help protect the brain, liver, and  kidneys.", "In 2014, the advisory committee identified 16 of 32 conditions as \u201ctime-critical\u201d conditions.

To screen for such conditions, health care providers collect blood samples from newborns and send them to labs for testing.", "However, states face barriers to timely screening\u2014such as issues with sending samples to labs\u2014that can delay treatment. Most states had not yet met their goal to screen 95 percent of blood samples within 7 days of birth by 2017, although some have improved screening time. For example, one state expanded courier service so all rural hospitals can get their samples to the lab more quickly."]}
