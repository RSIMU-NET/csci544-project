Estimates of the population of platform workers lack certainty, but generally range from around 1.5 million to 2 million workers for recent years and suggest that the platform workforce may be growing. According to stakeholders, such as researchers and tax preparers, platform workers may not realize that a company is treating them as independent contractors rather than employees and that they must comply with different tax requirements. To help address this challenge, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) developed a communications plan aimed at workers in the platform economy (which IRS calls the gig economy).", "The communications plan incorporates leading practices for redesigning web pages and improving the online user experience, but lacks a monitoring plan to help assure IRS's efforts address platform workers' tax challenges.", "GAO found that platform workers may not receive information on their earnings, creating compliance challenges for them and enforcement challenges for IRS. GAO identified actions that could promote compliance. For example, some platform companies only report total annual payments for workers if they exceed $20,000 and 200 transactions\u2014an amount that exceeds the average gross pay from a single company for many platform workers. Amending this rule to lower the reporting thresholds would provide workers with more information to help them comply with their tax obligations. The change could also enhance IRS's ability to ensure that these workers are correctly reporting their income. Additionally, IRS could implement voluntary withholding on payments to independent contractors (including platform workers). IRS data indicate that tax withholding substantially increases the compliance rate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making seven recommendations to IRS, including actions to enhance its communications plan, increase information reporting for platform workers, and allow voluntary withholding.

Its rise has been tied to the  development of the iPhone and Apple\u2019s app store, which launched in  2008. Smart phones and apps made it easier for people to develop online  marketplaces where buyers and sellers could connect to exchange  goods. Since then, more platform companies have emerged, expanding  into marketplaces for a host of services. This expansion has increased  the ways in which people could sell their services or goods and lowered  the barriers to entering this type of work.", "Platform companies generally facilitate the match, transaction, and  payment between those seeking goods or services online and those  providing them. Platform companies can be divided into marketplaces for  services or goods and can be further divided into two types of services\u2014 transportation or other types of services\u2014and two types of goods\u2014retail  or short-term rental. See figure 1 for a description of the different platform  company marketplaces.", "Transportation platforms comprise the largest sector of the platform  economy\u2014by revenue and number of workers\u2014and include companies  like Uber and Lyft. Examples of platform companies providing other  types of services include Care.com (child or senior care) and Upwork (a  range of freelance services). Retail platforms like Etsy and eBay provide  an online marketplace for goods. Companies that facilitate short-term  rental include Airbnb (property) or Kerb (parking spaces).", "Platform companies also vary by the number and degree of specialization  of services offered. For example, platform companies could be  differentiated by the range of services offered, from those that offer a  single service, such as transporting people and goods, to those that are a  one-stop source to access workers specializing in an array of fields such  as legal, information technology, marketing, writing, design, and  accounting. Further, companies have adopted different business models.  Some set prices while others allow the worker and customer to negotiate  a price for the good or service provided.", "While platform workers can choose whether to accept work, companies  are not committed to pay workers for a set number of hours, which allows  companies to more easily manage demand fluctuations. Many platform  companies classify workers providing services as independent  contractors rather than as employees. This classification has implications  for companies and workers. For independent contractors, companies are  not responsible for paying a minimum wage or overtime and do not  typically provide benefits such as paid leave, health insurance, or  retirement plans. Furthermore, numerous labor protections that apply to  employees do not apply to independent contractors.", "Companies also do not have to withhold and remit federal income or  employment taxes for independent contractors. Instead, the worker is  responsible for estimating, saving, and remitting these taxes each quarter  to IRS. Furthermore, a platform company that operates as an  intermediary between buyers and sellers to transfer funds for  transactions\u2014for example, a ride-hailing company that matches drivers  and riders and processes those riders\u2019 payments to drivers\u2014may act as a  third party settlement organization (TPSO) under IRS regulations,  depending on its circumstances. Acting as a TPSO can further reduce  the tax reporting requirements for these companies.", "SB/SE oversees taxpayers filing tax returns as self-employed individuals  with business income, such as independent contractors, and businesses  with less than $10 million in total assets. SB/SE aims to promote  compliance among this population by raising awareness through outreach  and education about tax obligations and how to comply.

We  use the term platform worker for those workers that platform companies  classify as independent contractors, which is the focus of our report. A  major similarity is that all three types of workers provide services to  customers in a business transaction, regardless of whether the customer  is another business or an individual such as a homeowner. However, the  three types of workers differ in terms of payments, tax responsibilities,  and the information reported to IRS and workers. Figure 2 summarizes  these differences, which are discussed below.", "A major difference is how these workers provide their services and  receive payments. Traditional independent contractors directly provide  their services to and receive payments from a business or an individual  customer. Employees provide services through an employer who pays  them wages. Unlike the other two types of workers, the platform worker  provides services through a third party intermediary\u2014the platform  company\u2014that uses online tools to connect workers with customers and  facilitates payment between them.", "Platform workers that are classified as independent contractors have  different tax obligations than employees. Independent contractors are  generally expected to pay the full amount of their personal federal income  and self-employment taxes\u2014which are comprised of Social Security and  Medicare taxes\u2014through quarterly estimated tax payments to IRS. For  employer-employee relationships, both the employer and the employee  each pay roughly half of the Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA)  taxes\u2014which are comprised of Social Security and Medicare taxes. An  employer is required to withhold income taxes and the employee portion  of FICA taxes from wage payments made to the employee and pay these  taxes to IRS. Additionally the employer is required to pay its own portion  of the FICA taxes to IRS.", "These workers have different requirements for filing annual tax returns.  Generally, independent contractors, including those that are platform  workers, are to use Schedule C, Profit or Loss from Business (Sole  Proprietorship), to report their self-employment revenues and expenses,  and to calculate net income; the Schedule C is to be attached to their  Form 1040. Employees are to report wage amounts received on their  Form 1040.", "Businesses also differ in information-reporting obligations for workers  classified as independent contractors and employees. Generally  speaking, when a business pays an independent contractor, the business  is required to report annual payments of $600 or more on Form 1099- MISC; for tax year 2020, businesses are to start using Form 1099-NEC to  report such payments. Instead of a Form 1099-MISC (or Form 1099- NEC), TPSOs are required to file Form 1099-K to report annual payments  made through their payment networks that exceed $20,000 and 200  transactions. When paying employees, businesses are to file a Form W- 2 annually to report all wages paid.", "A difference between platform workers and traditional independent  contractors is that platform companies often have information on workers\u2019  earnings and some expenses that could help workers file tax returns. For  example, a ride-hailing company has information on fares, tips, and miles  driven for each customer as well as fees and other charges. Traditional  independent contractors who provide rides to individuals typically have no  equivalent third party to provide such information."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Platform Workforce Size and Characteristics Are Uncertain but Many Believe It Is Growing", "paragraphs": ["The population of platform workers is difficult to count, due in part to the  variation in terms and definitions used to describe these workers such as  gig, on-demand, sharing economy, contingent, and freelance, among  others. As a result of these and other barriers, efforts to measure the  size of the platform workforce through household surveys or  administrative data have produced estimates that lack certainty; these  estimates of the workforce size generally have ranged from around 1.5  million to 2 million for recent years and suggest that the platform  workforce may be growing.", "In 2017, the Department of Labor\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)  collected data on alternative employment.

However, in January 2019  we reported that several factors may have contributed to an undercount  of platform workers. For example, survey questions may not have  captured individuals who engage in platform work on a part-time or  sporadic basis. BLS has stated that it will not use the same questions  again and it is working with stakeholders and the Committee on National  Statistics of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and  Medicine to address survey limitations.", "Despite the difficulties estimating the size of the workforce, two studies  and stakeholders we interviewed have concluded that the platform  workforce is growing. For example, in a review of customer checking  account transactions, the JP Morgan Chase Institute documented a five- fold increase between 2012 and 2018 to about 2.3 million families  receiving at least one payment from known platform companies.", "Two studies have also found that the majority of platform workers work  part time, for a short time, for secondary income, and for relatively low  earnings. For its sample, the JP Morgan Chase & Co. Institute found that  platform work was not the primary source of income for most families that  participated in the platform economy between 2012 and 2018. Yet the  study also found that platform work can account for roughly 20 percent of  workers\u2019 income during months when they are actively engaged in  platform work. Also, while the number of platform workers who provide  transportation has increased, their average monthly earnings fell steadily  between 2014 and 2018.", "In another study, IRS used tax data to attempt to estimate the population  of platform workers, which it termed \u201cgig workers.\u201d Similar to BLS, IRS  attempted to count workers who use websites and mobile apps to  connect with customers to obtain short-term work and to receive payment  through the company that owns the website or mobile app. IRS identified  the names and Employer Identification Numbers of companies providing  labor services and matched Forms 1099-MISC and 1099-K issued by the  companies to workers. IRS estimated the number of workers who  received a Form 1099-K or 1099-MISC from known labor platform  companies increased from roughly 20,000 in 2012 to 1.9 million in 2016,  then dropped to 1.3 million in 2017.", "However, IRS\u2019s methodology had limitations that make the study an  uncertain source for determining the number of platform workers. First,  IRS cannot easily identify the universe of platform companies because it  is rapidly changing and not well documented. Second, according to IRS,  an unknown number of platform workers receive neither a Form 1099- MISC nor a Form 1099-K, for reasons we discuss later in the report.

For example, Schedule  C\u2014the form that independent contractors are to use to report profit or  loss\u2014includes a series of yes/no checkboxes near the top of the form;  however, it does not have a checkbox to indicate whether any reported income or expenses are from platform work. Similarly, Schedule C has  a six-digit code to indicate the type of business or activity conducted, but  it does not include a code for all platform workers. Although this  information would be self-reported and imperfect, it would provide more  information than IRS has on platform workers.", "Obtaining more information on the number of platform workers and their  tax filing and reporting behaviors could help IRS develop ways to assist  platform workers in complying with their tax obligations. For example, if  IRS had more data on the types of deductions that certain types of  workers were reporting, IRS would be better able to craft guidance on  such deductions or do outreach to help those types of workers comply.", "Further, without changes to Schedule C, IRS cannot cross-check whether  workers who self-identify as platform workers are also identified as  platform workers on Forms 1099 filed by platform companies; a cross- check would enhance IRS\u2019s understanding of the platform workforce. For  example, if the cross-check shows that the number of workers who self- identify as platform workers significantly exceeds the number of Forms  1099 filed, IRS may have to work with platform companies to understand  the filing shortfall. Conversely, if the number of filed Forms 1099 is  significantly higher, IRS may need to enhance outreach efforts to make  platform workers more aware of their tax obligations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Challenges for Platform Workers Include Awareness of Tax Responsibilities, Limited Income Information, and Saving and Remitting Quarterly Taxes", "paragraphs": ["We identified three areas of challenges for platform workers\u2019 compliance  with their tax obligations. First, according to our stakeholder interviews,  platform workers may be less aware of their tax responsibilities than  some independent contractors. Independent contractors typically have  to advertise or seek referrals to gain customers, develop a network of  peers, and learn about rules related to licensing or certifications. These  activities can educate them about the basic responsibilities of being self- employed, including their tax obligations. In contrast, entry into platform  work can be quick and workers may begin the activity without time to  learn how their tax obligations differ from those of employees.", "For example, someone with a car, a valid driver\u2019s license, and a smart  phone can start working as a ride-hailing driver after they register with an  app. Likewise, some platform workers may approach platform work as a  hobby, an artistic endeavor, or something they do for a short time or in  addition to another job. They may not realize that the company is treating  them as an independent contractor, that the platform income may affect  their taxes owed, and that they may need to track their expenses and  make quarterly tax payments.", "As a second challenge, platform workers may have limited information  about the payments they receive for their work. TPSOs are not required  to file information returns to report earnings information to workers or IRS  if the workers receive $20,000 or less in annual payments or have 200 or  fewer transactions. Available tax data from tax year 2016 suggest that  only around 30 percent of platform workers who were known to IRS had  gross platform-related earnings higher than $5,000. Hence, most platform  workers are likely not receiving an information return from the company.  As a result, workers may not be aware that their income is taxable and  IRS is less able to the check the workers\u2019 tax compliance.", "A third challenge, according to stakeholders, is the burden associated  with the steps platform workers must take to estimate, save, and remit  quarterly tax payments. Because earnings of some platform workers may  be low and earnings and expenses may fluctuate, they can have difficulty  estimating their taxes owed and setting aside money to pay the taxes.  They may also find it time consuming or costly to track expenses and  determine profit. To the extent these burdens and difficulties confuse  workers, they are less likely to pay the estimated tax payments fully and  on time and may incur a penalty as a result. One stakeholder from a large  tax preparation firm raised the concern that if the penalty or amount owed  is more than workers can afford, they are at risk of falling into a cycle of  noncompliance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS\u2019s Strategy to Promote Compliance by Platform Workers Features Enhanced Communication, but Lacks Key Details for Monitoring Feedback and Clarifying Guidance", "paragraphs": ["In response to a February 2019 recommendation by the Treasury  Inspector General for Tax Administration, IRS formed a team of officials  from across the agency to develop a strategy to promote compliance  among platform workers. The strategy focuses on two challenges for  platform workers: (1) raising awareness about federal tax obligations, and  (2) easing burden by identifying improvements to instructions, guidance,  or forms that platform workers are likely to use.

Individuals who were generally not engaged in business or not producing  a profit, such as casual sellers of goods, would likely fall below these  thresholds.", "Second, IRS created a \u201ctie-breaker rule\u201d to avoid duplicative reporting  which also led to no Form 1099 being filed in some cases. Businesses,  including TPSOs, are in general required to report certain transactions on  Form 1099-MISC, while TPSOs are also required to report certain  transactions on Form 1099-K. IRS instituted a rule to break the \u201ctie\u201d that  exists when a TPSO is required to report the same transactions on both  Forms 1099-MISC and 1099-K. Specifically, the rule states that payments  made through a TPSO\u2019s payment network are not required to be reported  on Form 1099-MISC, subject to an annual $600 threshold. Instead,  TPSOs\u2019 payments are required to be reported on Form 1099-K, subject to  the annual $20,000 and 200 transactions thresholds.", "Third, since 2008, new platform companies have emerged that fit the  TPSO designation but that facilitate payments for workers providing  services rather than goods. These payments often fall below the  combined annual $20,000 and 200 transaction thresholds.", "Options to increase information reporting for platform workers would help  raise awareness about their tax obligations while lowering their burden.

Given the much lower threshold for the Form 1099-MISC versus the  thresholds for the Form 1099-K, more workers would receive reports on  their payments and IRS would receive more reports, too.", "Information reporting under the regulations related to IRC Section 6041  would generally increase for TPSOs that facilitate the provision of  services. If the TPSO makes a payment for a service on behalf of another  and performs management or oversight for the payment, then that TPSO  would generally be responsible for filing a Form 1099-MISC, subject to  the annual $600 threshold. Also, TPSOs that facilitate payments of  rentals and also provide management or oversight of those payments  would likely be subject to the $600 threshold.", "Reporting would remain unchanged for some types of companies.  Because payments for goods are generally not reportable under IRC  Section 6041, reporting would not change for online marketplaces that  facilitate the sale of goods only. Because of the management and  oversight requirements of IRC Section 6041, TPSOs that only facilitate  payments would also generally not be affected by a change to the tie- breaker rule (see fig. 6).", "IRS Counsel has discussed amending the tiebreaker rule, but has yet to  take action. According to IRS, Counsel has had to address other  priorities, such as reviewing rules and publishing guidance related to  Public Law 115-97, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of  2017. Without amending this rule, the lack of information-return  reporting for many workers complicates their efforts to comply with their  tax obligations and IRS\u2019s ability to ensure that these workers are correctly  reporting their income. When workers do not receive forms related to their  self-employment income, they have more difficulty determining how much  money they made for computing taxable income. IRS analysis indicates  that taxpayers are more likely to report their income that is subject to  some information reporting (an estimated 83 percent compliance)  compared to little or no information reporting (an estimated 45 percent).

The 1099-MISC threshold was enacted in 1954 and the 1099-K reporting  threshold was enacted in 2008; neither reflect the development of the  platform economy. These changes include the emergence of companies  that facilitate workers\u2019 earning income by renting their houses or by  providing transportation services, among many other activities.", "Informed stakeholders suggested that the current 1099-K thresholds may  be appropriate for some TPSOs, such as online marketplaces that  facilitate the sale of goods or companies with a primary function of  facilitating payments. Different thresholds may be more appropriate for  other activities facilitated by platform companies, such as renting houses  or other assets. For example, a lower dollar threshold and no transaction  threshold may be appropriate for home rentals because substantial  income could be generated from even one transaction and provider costs  may be limited. However, some service providers incur significant costs,  such as drivers who must pay to own and operate a vehicle. Some  stakeholders suggested that a threshold of $600 was more appropriate  than a threshold of $20,000 and 200 transactions. Even so, some  stakeholders suggested that typical costs to service providers may justify  a threshold higher than the $600 threshold set in 1954.", "We found no available analysis of tax or other data showing whether the  reporting thresholds for Forms 1099-MISC and 1099-K are appropriate for  today\u2019s economy or what the thresholds should be. The NEW GIG Act of  2019, which was introduced in Congress in March 2019, would raise the  Form 1099-MISC reporting thresholds from $600 to $1,000. It would also  lower the Form 1099-K reporting threshold from $20,000 and 200  transactions to $5,000 or 50 transactions for TPSOs making payments to  those primarily engaged in the sale of goods, among other actions.

According to IRS officials, IRS and  Treasury have not determined whether they intend to pursue such an  action.", "Voluntary withholding could be implemented by adjusting existing  procedures and using the existing requirements for paying estimated  taxes each quarter as a foundation. For example, to enable companies to  solicit workers\u2019 choices on when and how much to withhold, IRS could  create a form similar to the Employee\u2019s Withholding Certificate, Form W- 4, which employees complete so that employers can withhold the correct  estimated federal income tax from employees\u2019 wages.

Alternatively,  IRS could create guidance similar to what exists for workers who opt-in to  electronically receive tax forms from their companies.

Companies  would need to develop other design features, such as how they inform  workers about participation.", "If the withholding is voluntary for companies, any burden is limited to  those companies that choose to participate. For workers who choose to  participate, they would still have the burden of estimating the amount of  taxes owed for each quarter, but their burden to save and remit those  taxes could be reduced. If some workers find that withholding is not  appropriate for them, they could continue to use the existing system for  quarterly tax payments. As long as workers choose withholding amounts  that satisfy these quarterly estimated tax requirements, IRS would not  need to design default percentages or dollar amounts to be withheld.", "While withholding could potentially help all types of independent  contractors, voluntary withholding would specifically address some  challenges that platform workers face.

Further, we did not  intend that IRS use the data to initiate compliance against the workers;  our report discussed using the data to identify workers and their reporting  behaviors to improve services and voluntary compliance. IRS concluded  that the additional taxpayer burden and its costs were not warranted at  this time. IRS did not identify the level of burden or costs, and the burden  from checking a box on Schedule C does not seem high. We asked about  the costs to revise the forms to add a checkbox but IRS did not provide  them. As for IRS\u2019s costs to capture the data, we note that IRS\u2019s costs to  transcribe the data would be zero for returns filed electronically. Individual  taxpayers (including platform workers) electronically filed 138 million of  156 million (89 percent) tax returns\u2014which includes the Schedule C\u2014 during 2019.

They also expressed concerns that platform workers might rely on this  information, and not maintain their own records, which could cause  challenges if platform companies do not track all available expenses or  income.

This includes refunds, fees,  discounts, and other items. IRSAC recently recommended that the  definition of \u201cgross amount\u201d for the purposes of reporting on Forms 1099- K should exclude these items, which are not taxable income for the  platform worker, and include only payments to the workers for their  service.", "IRS officials have identified some practical drawbacks to implementing  this proposal. For example, determining what is includable and what is  excludable from the \u201ceconomic transaction\u201d can vary from industry to  industry and from taxpayer to taxpayer. Depending on the industry or  activity, the gross transaction amount may not be itemized to specify what  is included; for example, many payment settlement entities would not  know whether sales tax is included in a transaction amount.

The default delivery method is mail, and workers must  opt-in to receive forms electronically. When a worker receives the form  electronically, the worker may receive an email notification that the  electronic form is available for download in a secure online account.  Platform company officials with whom we spoke said sending forms by  mail can be burdensome due to mailing costs and the costs of finding  accurate mailing addresses. However, they generally have accurate email  addresses because that is how they exchange information with platform  workers. Allowing electronic delivery of Forms 1099 by default could  reduce the burden for companies, while ensuring that more workers  receive their forms.", "However, new rules would be needed to ensure that workers are easily  able to opt-out of electronic delivery, and receive the forms on paper if  they wish.
