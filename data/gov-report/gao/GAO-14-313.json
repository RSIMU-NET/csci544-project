Certain military personnel receive the BAH, which can be used to pay rent to live in privatized housing. Since 1996, DOD has built and modernized on-installation unaccompanied personnel housing using military construction funds.

These analyses were conducted between 1997 and 2011. The Army's and the Navy's analyses compared different scenarios--such as whether to rely on privatization or use traditional military construction funding to improve housing quality--and considered information from multiple installations in these analyses. In contrast, the Air Force and Marine Corps analyzed the feasibility of privatizing unaccompanied housing at a few selected installations. For example, the Air Force based its initial analysis on information for two locations, while the Marine Corps based its 2008 analysis on information specific to one installation. The Navy and Army concluded that privatization could be used under a narrow set of circumstances at specific installations, such as where unaccompanied servicemembers were already receiving the basic allowance for housing (BAH). The Air Force and Marine Corps concluded that privatization was not suitable for meeting any of their housing needs. For example, an April 2000 Air Force memorandum indicated that privatization could have a negative effect on building unit cohesion. Other factors also played a role in the four services' decisions about whether to privatize housing, including (1) the limited availability of the BAH for junior unaccompanied personnel, which may result in not having a dedicated stream of income to pay rent for privatized housing; (2) the frequency or duration of unit deployments, which could affect the occupancy rates of unaccompanied housing; and (3) uncertainty about the future size of the military, and whether there would be sufficient demand for privatized housing.", "Between 1996 and 2013, the Army and Navy implemented seven privatized unaccompanied personnel housing projects. The Air Force and Marine Corps have not used the privatization authorities, and are instead using military construction funds to improve the quality of their unaccompanied personnel housing. Air Force housing officials told us that Air Force unaccompanied personnel housing inventory generally meets current housing needs. According to Marine Corps officials, the Marine Corps intends to eliminate existing housing deficiencies by demolishing inadequate unaccompanied personnel housing and using military construction funds to replace or renovate housing by the end of fiscal year 2014.

As part of its efforts to improve the quality of military  housing, DOD requested certain authorities from Congress that would  allow the department to use the private sector\u2019s investment capital and  housing construction and operations expertise so that the department  could replace or renovate inadequate housing. According to DOD  officials, privatization could be a faster method to improve the condition of  military-owned housing compared with constructing government-owned  housing using traditional military construction funding. In 1996, Congress  enacted the Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI), which gave  the military services the authorities to privatize housing for  unaccompanied military personnel (those without dependents) and  military families in the United States. These authorities allow for private- sector financing, ownership, operation, and maintenance of military  housing. Under the initiative, DOD can invest in the privatization efforts  and provide direct loans, loan guarantees, and other incentives to  encourage private-sector developers to construct and operate housing  either on or off military installations.", "Certain military personnel receive a basic allowance for housing (BAH),  which, when the servicemembers choose to live in privatized housing, is  typically used to pay rent to privatized housing project companies, which  are operated and managed by developers. The BAH is a cash allowance  paid from DOD\u2019s military personnel appropriation account to cover the  typical monthly costs of rent, utilities, and renter\u2019s insurance.

Specifically, we reviewed the Office of the Secretary of  Defense\u2019s program evaluation plans and, for the military services with  privatized housing projects, information about their unaccompanied  housing master plans. We also reviewed but did not evaluate analyses  that the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps documented to support  their respective housing privatization decisions. We did not evaluate  these analyses because DOD and service officials told us that they had  no plans to pursue any additional unaccompanied privatized housing  projects. Further, in cases where they did privatize, all projects are  complete except for two. To corroborate our understanding of these  analyses, we interviewed officials in the Facilities Investment and  Management Directorate and Facility Energy and Privatization Directorate  of the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Installations and  Environment) responsible for overseeing housing privatization, as well as  officials in associated offices in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine  Corps.", "For each of the seven existing privatized housing projects for  unaccompanied personnel, we reviewed information such as the location,  target population, number of beds, occupancy rates, and financial  information such as projected revenues, expenses, and net operating  income.

DOD justified the  adoption of the new standard primarily as an investment in quality of life  aimed at improving military readiness and retention. All the military  services except the Marine Corps accepted the new standard, and  developed various initiatives to implement it, as discussed below.

The  housing complex also includes laundry facilities.", "Navy: The Navy spent about $2.5 billion of military construction funds  between fiscal years 1996 and 2012 on improving the condition of its  housing for unaccompanied personnel. A key component of the  Navy\u2019s modernization program for unaccompanied housing is the  Homeport Ashore program, which was created to improve the quality  of life among ship-based junior sailors by moving them off ships and  into unaccompanied housing on shore while their ships were docked  in their homeport. The Navy expects to complete this initiative by  fiscal year 2016 utilizing both privatization and military construction  authorities. However, the BAH statute (37 U.S.C. \u00a7 403(f)) prohibits E- 1 to E-3\u2019s without dependents on sea duty from receiving the BAH,  and privatized housing projects are not generally feasible unless  military members are receiving a housing allowance. Congress, in the  Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003,  amended the housing privatization authorities by adding a new  section (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2881a) that authorized the Navy to carry out up  to three pilot unaccompanied housing privatization projects in which  junior enlisted members without dependents could be authorized  higher rates of partial BAH to pay their rent. Per 37 U.S.C \u00a7 403(n),  partial BAH is a payment at a rate determined by the Secretary of  Defense based on a specified historical rate (typically around $8 per  month, as of 2011) paid to members not authorized to receive BAH,  such as those assigned to live aboard ships or in government  quarters. The 10 U.S.C. \u00a72881a authority expired on September 30,  2009, and the Navy executed two of the three authorized projects  prior to the expiration of the authority.", "Air Force: The Air Force spent almost $3 billion of military construction  funds from fiscal years 1996 to 2012 on modernizing its dormitories  for unaccompanied personnel.

The Air Force also  implemented a policy in 1996 whereby each unaccompanied airman  permanently assigned to an installation is assigned to a private  bedroom. In 2006, the Air Force started requiring that its dorms be  built or renovated according to a four-bedroom module design, called  Dorms-4-Airmen, specifically for unaccompanied personnel in the pay  grades from E-1 to E-3 and E-4 with less than 3 years of service.

These analyses used  different scenarios and data gathered from multiple locations. The Army  documented the analytical processes used, and communicated its  conclusions to service leadership. In 2004, the Army formed a task force  to assess the feasibility and desirability of privatization of unaccompanied  personnel housing. Task-force members conducted the study over 6  months, visiting six sites, including Fort Detrick, Maryland; Fort Leonard  Wood, Missouri; Fort Lewis, Washington; Fort Stewart, Georgia; Fort  Hood, Texas; and the Presidio of Monterey, California. There appeared to  be no consistent criteria applied for site selection in the task-force study in  that the reasons for selection differed in each case. For example, Fort  Lewis was selected in part because of command interest, and Fort  Leonard Wood was selected because it is a training installation that  represents the consolidation of training missions at a larger site. Study  authors also considered 18 scenarios, 5 of which were Army-wide. These  scenarios involved different assumptions about the number and pay  grades of unaccompanied personnel housed on and off installations, as  well as the amount of money spent by the Army to construct and sustain  new facilities. The study concluded that privatization of housing for  unaccompanied personnel was financially feasible at selected  installations, such as Fort Stewart and Fort Hood, in part because a  majority of senior enlisted personnel there were already receiving the  BAH and living off the installation; however, all members of the leadership  task force responsible for the study could not reach consensus on the  study\u2019s findings. For example, the study authors suggested that soldiers  should not be mandatorily assigned to privatized housing. OMB scoring  rules require that mandatory assignment be treated as an occupancy  guarantee, which would have the effect of committing the government to  a large long-term expenditure. However, other members of the task force  questioned whether mandatory assignment might be necessary to  support the building of cohesive units, which is fostered by working and  living together as a team.", "The Army completed an additional analysis of privatization in response to  a 2009 congressional inquiry. The Army prepared a report that focused  on the privatization of housing for junior unaccompanied personnel. The  analysis included a review of privatization\u2019s effect on costs, soldiers\u2019  quality of life, and the Army\u2019s traditions and culture. The study was  conducted over a 3-month period and included modeling scenarios at Fort  Polk, Louisiana; Fort Irwin, California; and Fort Meade, Maryland, and  one U.S.-wide extrapolation. The three locations were chosen because  their barracks needed renovations and local commanders and private- sector developers supported privatization. The analysis concluded that  privatization was feasible, but the cost to privatize barracks would be  higher than what the Army was currently spending on barracks  construction and sustainment.", "The Army also conducted a series of due diligence studies at Fort  Benning, Georgia; Fort Irwin, California; Fort Knox, Kentucky; Fort  Leonard Wood, Missouri; Fort Meade, Maryland; and Fort Polk,  Louisiana, in April and May 2010. The purpose of these studies was,  among other things, to assist the Army in determining the feasibility of  implementing barracks privatization pilot projects. In July and August  2010, the results of the studies were condensed into business-case  analyses to show the potential costs or savings the Army would  experience at each of the six sites if barracks privatization projects were  executed. According to the Army report, the bottom-line finding of the  analyses was that such projects would result in a significant net cost to  the Army if executed, because the Army was not funding all barracks  requirements at 100 percent. The report further stated that the Army\u2019s  expected BAH payments would be greater than the actual barracks  funding that was currently taking place. Fort Meade was the only  exception of the six sites because less than 50 percent of the junior  servicemembers were Army, but the Army was funding all barracks for all  the services. The report concluded that the Army\u2019s expected BAH  payments at Fort Meade would be less than the current Army Military  Construction, Operation and Maintenance, and Sustainment, Restoration  and Modernization funding.", "Like the Army, the Navy developed analyses that considered multiple  scenarios. In 2009, the Navy conducted a business-case analysis using  three scenarios and data collected from site visits at San Diego,  California; and Norfolk, Virginia; which were the only Navy locations with  privatized projects for unaccompanied housing. The service used both  quantitative and qualitative data, drawing on the pro forma financial  statements and requests for proposals from the San Diego and Norfolk  privatization projects, military construction budget, and BAH data from  multiple years, as well as interviews with personnel across the Navy. The  study compared three alternative scenarios with a baseline scenario. One  of the scenarios involved privatization, another featured construction with  military construction funds, and the third assumed the community  provided the majority of the housing needs. Under the baseline scenario,  the assumptions were that the Navy would own and operate all housing  for unaccompanied personnel, and would underfund building  maintenance and support. Briefings to leadership documented the  analytical process and summarized the results of the study. The Navy  analysis concluded that privatization of housing for unaccompanied  personnel would be more cost-effective for housing junior sailors based  on their receiving a higher partial rate of BAH (versus the full BAH rate),  rather than building new quarters using traditional military construction  funding.", "In 2011, 2 years after the initial analysis, the Navy reviewed the issue of  the privatization of housing for unaccompanied personnel again and  reached similar conclusions. The Navy study found that privatization  requires lower operating costs than housing funded through annual  appropriations requested through the military construction budgeting  process and sustained at the required levels of operation and  maintenance. However, the study noted that privatization of housing for  unaccompanied personnel is only viable at select locations, such as  where there is a stable population and a need to provide sailors with  housing ashore when their ship is in its homeport. In such areas, enough  population might exist to sustain the necessary level of occupancy in  unaccompanied housing while sailors are at sea."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Air Force and Marine Corps Analyzed the Feasibility of Privatizing Housing for Unaccompanied Personnel at Selected Installations", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force and Marine Corps analyses of whether to privatize  unaccompanied personnel housing reviewed privatization at a few  selected locations. The Air Force developed three analyses reviewing  privatization over a 5-year period beginning in 1997. Air Force officials  documented the analytical processes used through reports and  memorandums and communicated the conclusions to service leadership  in briefings. The first effort, the Dormitory Privatization Feasibility Study,  lasted for 5 months and included site visits to two bases where data were  collected for a feasibility analysis. The Air Force selected the two  locations\u2014Dover Air Force Base, Delaware; and Tinker Air Force Base,  Oklahoma\u2014from eight candidate bases nominated by the major  commands, in part because both bases had housing shortages. Tinker  had the largest housing shortage of the eight candidate bases with 59  percent of the total demand for unaccompanied housing unmet,  compared with 12 percent at Dover, and both had rooms that would  require future renovation or replacement. Based on post-site-visit financial  analyses, the study authors found that privatization would be less  expensive than traditional military construction at Tinker but not at Dover.  A 51-year life-cycle cost comparison conducted in 1997, provided to us by  Air Force officials, showed the cost of privatization at Tinker to be $163.7  million, compared with the military construction cost of $205.7 million. For  Dover, the analysis showed a cost of $110.5 million for a traditional  military construction approach compared with $132.5 million for  privatization. The study authors concluded that privatization was more  suitable for installations with a slow local economy, high installation and  local support for privatization, degraded existing facilities, and a large  unaccompanied housing shortage\u2014conditions that existed at Tinker.  Further, the study concluded that since privatization of housing for  unaccompanied personnel was suitable only for certain locations, it could  be used only to augment traditional military construction funding, not to  replace it.", "Later, in 1997, the Air Force organized an exercise to discuss whether to  use privatization as a tool to construct dormitories. The team conducting  the exercise was composed of more than a dozen Air Force headquarters  housing and installation officials. The team discussed the results of the  Dormitory Privatization Feasibility Study, as well as other factors such as  the effects of utilities, leasing, and mandatory assignment of personnel to  privatized housing on OMB scoring, and leadership control over housing  residents\u2019 activities. The team recommended that the Air Force not  pursue privatization to construct dormitories, primarily because the team  found that privatization was not a cost effective alternative to using  military construction funding for building dormitories. In 2002, 5 years  later, another team composed of new members from all levels of the Air  Force met to establish a baseline for an Air Force dormitory privatization  program. This team also identified a number of issues, such as unit  integrity, the scale of necessary government commitment of funds,  enforcing discipline among tenants, and conducting inspections in a  building that was not solely government-owned, that would make  privatization projects unfeasible unless they were resolved. In an April  2000 memorandum, the Air Force Chief of Staff argued against privatizing  unaccompanied personnel housing. The official indicated that residing in  on-base dormitories ensures that junior enlisted personnel acclimate to  the Air Force, build esprit de corps with members of their unit, and have  access to base services such as medical, fitness, recreation, commissary,  and exchange facilities. Ultimately, according to Air Force officials, the Air  Force decided that military construction would meet their needs for  housing and decided against using privatization.", "In 2008, the Marine Corps completed a feasibility analysis to decide  whether to privatize housing for unaccompanied personnel at a single  location\u2014Camp Pendleton, California\u2014as it lacked sufficient high-quality  housing for unaccompanied personnel. The service documented this  analysis in a briefing submitted to Marine Corps leadership and a  memorandum prepared the following year. The feasibility analysis  included an examination of the cash contributions required from the Navy,  a participation test for the 336-bed project, and a life-cycle cost analysis.  The feasibility analysis concluded that privatization of housing for  unaccompanied personnel would be 55 percent more expensive than  building new quarters using military construction funds. A 2009 Marine  Corps summary on the subject of bachelor housing privatization noted  that Marines are assigned to barracks with others from their unit, which  promotes unit integrity and unit cohesion. However, the direct or  mandatory assignment of servicemembers to privatized housing could be  viewed as providing an occupancy guarantee to the developer, which  under the OMB guidelines would require that the full value of the  guarantee must be available and obligated \u201cup front\u201d at the time the  government makes the commitment of resources. In interviews, Marine  Corps officials stated that privatized housing is incompatible with Marine  Corps culture because Marines do not deploy as individuals; they deploy  as units. Moreover, E-1 to E-3 Marines, like E-1 to E-3 sailors on sea  duty, are assigned to shared rooms. This configuration is an important  element of the Marine Corps\u2019 philosophy and goal of fostering team  building, companionship, camaraderie, and unit cohesion, according to  the 2010 report by the LMI company on unaccompanied personnel  housing for junior enlisted members, which was commissioned by DOD to  provide a comprehensive view of housing programs for unaccompanied  personnel across the services. The Marine Corps conducted no  additional analyses of privatization for unaccompanied personnel. Starting  in 2008, the Marine Corps undertook a $2.8 billion military construction  initiative to build new barracks over a 6-year period from fiscal year 2008  through fiscal year 2014.

In interviews and in some analyses, such as the Army\u2019s  task-force study report, the services expressed reluctance to assume  any additional costs, particularly a cost relating to personnel since  such obligations to pay costs in the future must typically be funded at  the time the obligation is made. In the Army\u2019s privatization task-force  report, the Army\u2019s resource-management officials noted that even just  a few pilot privatization projects could lock the Army into a 50-year  BAH bill that must be funded, because the leases for privatization  projects generally run for 50 years.", "The frequency or duration of unit deployments: With privatized family  housing, the frequency of deployments of the servicemember  generally does not affect the rent received because the  servicemember\u2019s family remains behind and maintains the leased  property. However, unaccompanied personnel living in privatized  housing do not receive the BAH when they are deployed, if they do  not have a lease. Therefore, frequent or prolonged deployments can  reduce the occupancy rates of privatized housing. Occupancy rates  are a key indicator of a housing project\u2019s financial viability.", "The uncertainty about the future size of the force: According to a 2012  DOD budget-priorities document, the department plans to reduce the  size of the active Army from a post-9/11 peak of about 570,000 in  fiscal year 2010 to 490,000 by fiscal year 2017, and the active Marine  Corps from a peak of about 202,000 in fiscal year 2010 to 182,000 by  fiscal year 2017.

The Army\u2019s investment in the projects was in the form of land leased to  the privatized housing project companies to serve as the sites for the  projects.

The amendment to the MHPI also authorized the payment of  higher rates of partial BAH to personnel occupying housing acquired  using the pilot authority. The Navy implemented two such projects\u2014at  San Diego, California, and at Hampton Roads, Virginia\u2014before its pilot  authority expired on September 30, 2009. According to Navy officials,  these locations were selected because both are fleet concentration areas,  and the privatization projects also support the Navy\u2019s Homeport Ashore  Program. The Navy\u2019s projects include 8 existing buildings (1 at San  Diego and 7 at Hampton Roads) that the Navy conveyed to the private- sector developer and 91 new buildings (3 at San Diego; 1 mid-rise  building and 87 \u201cmanor homes,\u201d each consisting of five two-bedroom  apartments, at Hampton Roads). San Diego has 2,398 bedrooms, while  Hampton Roads has 3,682 bedrooms, for a total of 6,080 bedrooms. The  development costs for both projects totaled around $1.1 billion, of which  the Navy provided cash equity investments of about $80 million, with the  developers providing about $1 billion. The developers\u2019 costs generally  included the costs of construction, project financing, and operating  expenses.

The project included the privatization of one existing building  and the construction of three new buildings. According to Navy officials,  the existing building includes 258 \u201cmodules\u201d built to the 1995 DOD  standards for housing for unaccompanied personnel, each featuring two  sleeping rooms and a small common area. The new buildings include 941  \u201cmarket-style\u201d two-bedroom apartments, and, in total, the San Diego  project provides 2,398 bedrooms. The existing building, which was  conveyed to the developer, was intended to house junior unaccompanied  personnel (E-4/ Petty Officer Third Class and below), and the new  buildings were intended to house mid-level unaccompanied personnel (E- 4/ Petty Officer Third Class with more than 4 years of service to E-6/Petty  Officer First Class). The three new buildings became available to rent  within a 4-month period, beginning in December 2008. Navy officials told  us that delivering 1,882 new beds within 4 months caused significant  occupancy challenges, and that the target population of E-4 to E-6 has  never been realized because of the on-base location of the project. In  addition, they stated that while the sailors recognize the superior facilities  and amenities, they are reluctant to return to quarters inside the  installation\u2019s fence line with restricted access for their friends and family.  Therefore, the private-sector developer and the Navy decided to  temporarily expand the target demographic from E-4 with more than 4  years of service through E-6 to now include Homeport Ashore sailors and  junior shore-based sailors (E-4 and below).", "According to Navy officials, this shift has largely solved the occupancy  challenges, yet it has strained revenues for the private developer, as  Homeport Ashore sailors receive only a partial BAH rate based on the  market rent for the existing building, but the private-sector developer\u2019s  financial projections were based on the market rent for the new buildings.  The new buildings were constructed to higher standards compared with  the existing one, and have a higher rent structure that is equivalent to  current market rents for comparable housing in the San Diego area. The  Navy\u2019s evaluation of the developer\u2019s proposed budget for 2013 noted that  although the overall occupancy rate for the San Diego project at the end  of 2012 was about 96 percent, the revenues being received were  insufficient to sustain the project over the long term. Therefore, in June  2013, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Energy,  Installations and Environment) requested the Under Secretary of Defense  (Personnel and Readiness) to authorize a higher partial rate of the BAH  for junior unaccompanied sailors residing in the new buildings. The higher  partial rate of BAH requested would be equivalent to the market rents for  the new buildings. In September 2013, the Office of the Assistant  Secretary of Defense approved the Navy\u2019s request for an increase in the  partial rate for the BAH. The private-sector developer\u2019s cost for the project  was about $321 million, with the Navy providing a cash equity investment  of about $43 million for a total of about $364 million. Figure 1 shows a  bedroom in one of the new buildings at San Diego, California.", "The Navy\u2019s Hampton Roads, Virginia, project, awarded in December  2007, was built to house junior unaccompanied personnel (E-4/Petty  Officer Third Class with fewer than 4 years of service and below). The  project included 7 existing buildings on two installations (Naval Station  Norfolk, Virginia, and Naval Support Activity, Norfolk, Virginia) that were  conveyed to the developer and 88 newly constructed buildings on three  separate locations off the installation. Although the new buildings are off  the installation, two locations are on Navy property leased to the  developer, and one location (Newport News) is on land donated by the  city. In total, the Hampton Roads project includes 1,913 apartments and  3,682 bedrooms. Specifically, the 7 existing buildings include 723  apartments and 1,315 bedrooms, and the 88 new buildings include 1,190  apartments and 2,367 bedrooms. According to Navy officials, the  Hampton Roads project initially struggled to meet lease expectations  because of the reluctance of commanding officers to allow sailors off their  ships. As a result, the Commander, Naval Surface Force Atlantic, directed  commanding officers to comply with the Navy\u2019s Homeport Ashore  initiative by allowing sailors to move off the ship. The private-sector  developer\u2019s cost for the project was about $713 million, with the Navy  providing a cash equity investment of $37 million for a total of about $750  million.
