Small and medium-sized enterprises (SME)--firms with fewer than 500 employees--represent a key segment of exporting firms. GAO was asked to determine (1) the relationship between the Department of Commerce's (Commerce) U.S. Commercial Service (CS) and states' trade offices' export promotion programs, (2) CS's methodology and practices for determining costs and establishing user fees for export promotion services, and (3) how CS's user fees affect SMEs' use of its programs. GAO conducted a survey of states' trade offices and reviewed data such as export promotion budgets and fees, program information, government standards, and user fee studies. GAO met with officials from Commerce, the State International Development Organizations, six states' trade offices, and others."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Both CS and most states' trade offices provide various types of export promotion services. However, states have limited resources and scope when compared with CS's $235 million budget and large overseas staff. Thus, most states responding to GAO's survey reported that CS's services are important to their export promotion capabilities. State offices often partner with CS on trade missions and other activities. CS and most states focus their efforts on encouraging SMEs to participate in their programs, but user fees can influence whether firms choose to access export promotion services. CS lowers fees for SME exporters, but about a third of the states said they provide grants or payments to defray firms' costs and facilitate access to CS's programs. CS needs better information to maximize the efficient and effective operation of its programs and to ensure that there is a sound basis for setting fees. CS set user fees in May 2008 guided by the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) full cost recovery policy. However, CS has had a yearly legislative exemption from having to recover full costs through its fees and attempted to recover only a portion of the full cost of its export promotion services. CS did not support and document the methodology and assumptions it used to determine costs and cannot ensure its cost information is consistent and reliable and in accordance with government standards. GAO found significant instances where CS used incomplete and potentially inaccurate data. Complete and accurate full cost information would assist CS and the Congress in making decisions about resource allocations, evaluating program performance, and improving program efficiency. Finally, CS did not document how it established the lower user fees for SMEs and cannot show how the fees it charges different firms for each service link to costs. The extent to which CS's user fees affect SMEs' use of its export promotion programs is unclear. CS lacks reliable and sufficient data to evaluate its customer base and needs to ensure it charges firms the right fees. CS lacks reliable historical data on fees charged, firm size and status, and purchases by location and type. CS is taking steps to better evaluate its customer base. GAO's survey showed that most states reported the 2008 user fees to be reasonable but thought fees charged SMEs for some services were too high when compared with those charged by private sector providers. CS projects an increase in SMEs' demand for its services, but the projection is not based on any analysis of historical data. Relevant studies and other sources suggest that the types of services CS offers compared with other providers, the level of individualized attention provided, and service quality are factors that also affect SMEs' choice to use CS's services."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2006, SMEs comprised 97 percent of all identified exporters and accounted for 29  percent of the total value of U.S. exports.", "CS is also referred to as the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service.", "Federal export promotion programs primarily focus on SMEs and charge  fees for services.

The purpose of CS\u2019s export promotion  programs is stated through statutory authority. CS\u2019s mission is to  maximize U.S. competitiveness, and enable economic growth for U.S.  industries, and enhance job creation by helping U.S. firms take advantage  of opportunities abroad through a global network of international trade  professionals. CS operates 108 domestic offices at U.S. Export Assistance  Centers (USEAC), and maintains 124 international offices in 75 countries  that represent the significant export markets for U.S. goods and services.  CS trade specialists at these offices are tasked with assisting U.S. firms  and representing U.S. commercial interests abroad. In those countries  where CS does not have a presence, State represents U.S. commercial  interests and assists U.S. exporters. State and CS are in the process of  negotiating a memorandum of understanding to formalize this  arrangement. Currently, State can offer certain export promotion services,  but does not use CS product and customer service standards or CS pricing  policies.", "The general goal of CS is to use its network of professionals and export  promotion services to broaden and deepen the U.S. exporter base and help  U.S. firms make sales in international markets. CS reports that it helps  thousands of firms make export sales each year. Furthermore, according  to CS, the majority of these sales are by SMEs. Its services include  providing market research and supporting trade events. The Gold Key  Service, which helps firms identify international business partners, is one  of its most popular services. CS provides these services to a variety of  customers. While private U.S. firms (particularly SMEs) are CS\u2019s main  customers, CS also delivers services to other customers, including state  and local governments.", "Many U.S. states maintain state trade offices that provide varying levels of  export assistance, usually focusing on increasing exports from firms  located in their states. Most are managed by state economic development  agencies and funded by states\u2019 operating budgets. Many state trade offices  maintain both domestic and overseas offices to deliver services. In  addition, many states\u2019 trade offices partner with CS to ensure client firms  have access to services the state cannot offer, particularly in those foreign  markets where the states lack offices.", "CS is authorized to charge a user fee for its export promotion services, and  CS has adjusted its user fee structure in recent years. Prior to fiscal year  2005, CS did not have an agencywide user fee schedule for its export  promotion programs, as each overseas post decided what user fees firms  were charged for the export promotion services the posts delivered. As  part of its user fee review in fiscal year 2005, CS sought to determine the  user fees it would have to charge to recover the full costs of its services.  CS determined its user fees would have to rise significantly to recover full  costs, causing concern among firms, business leaders, and CS staff.

Based on the  2002 study, Commerce was seen as not being as well-positioned as private  providers to provide the intensive attention that transaction-related  services may require. We also spoke with officials of one large American  chamber of commerce operating in a key market who informed us that its  members, including SMEs, are attracted to private providers\u2019 intensive  \u201chandholding,\u201d which, according to these officials, CS is not well known  for providing. For example, this chamber of commerce offers a Corporate  Visa Program, which, according to the officials, actively helps its member  companies to complete paperwork and expedite the visa process within a  1-week time frame. In addition, one state trade office also said that  contractors or private consultants offer in-country coordination and  individualized attention that the CS no longer offers.", "The quality of service is also a key factor that influences SMEs\u2019 choice of  where to purchase services. A 2003 study estimated that fees for some CS  services that SMEs demand were lower than market comparisons but that  CS\u2019s market share based on total demand by SMEs for products and  services similar to CS\u2019s was relatively small; it suggested that the quality or  type of services provided by CS may not match the quality or type of  services demanded by SMEs. One DEC member also told us that  companies may perceive the quality to be better in the private sector since  prices for similar services tend to be higher in the private sector and that,  in some instances, inexperienced CS staff performed work, which may  have led some businesses to the private sector. One state trade office said  that the quality of CS\u2019s service depends on staff dynamics at the individual  post. Another state trade office said that, while price is important, the  delivery of consistent quality is more important to companies and that it  relies on CS to provide quality service. According to CS, its customer  surveys indicate that quality is a key factor in their choice of where to  purchase services. CS officials said that, in reviewing the surveys\u2019 open- ended questions, companies cited three drivers of client satisfaction:  communication, quality, and consistency. Price paid for the services,  according to the officials, has not been of equal importance.", "SIDO officials noted that another factor that may influence SMEs\u2019  participation in CS\u2019s programs is small firms\u2019 general level of awareness  about the states\u2019 and federal government\u2019s export promotion efforts. SIDO  officials expressed concern that domestic firms\u2019 awareness about U.S.  export promotion programs is less than that of foreign firms about the  programs in competing countries. However, according to the 2002 study,   small and medium-sized exporters are generally aware of government  programs that can help them export, but there is still room for  improvement. Exporters appear to be broadly familiar with Commerce.  However, SIDO advocates for more resources for CS and state outreach to  small firms in order to raise the profile of their programs and increase  participation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["CS and states\u2019 trade offices provide various types of export promotion  programs. These programs share similar goals of increasing the number of  exporting firms, especially SMEs, expanding existing markets, and  opening up new markets to U.S. exports. Targeting federal government  resources to programs that achieve the goals outlined in the National  Export Strategy requires knowledge of whether existing programs  contribute to these goals, whether customer experiences reveal  suggestions for enhancing these programs, and knowledge of the extent to  which current intergovernmental partnerships contribute to export  promotion goals.", "Commerce\u2019s $235 million export promotion program currently collects  about $10 million annually through fees on some services. Commerce  decided to collect these fees to cover at least a portion of the costs for  providing some of its services. However, Commerce lacks good  information on the true costs of providing these services, both fee-based  and those offered for free. As a result, it is unclear whether the fees they  established reflect their policy objectives or whether they optimize the  efficient and effective management of these programs.", "Similarly, Commerce lacks reliable information about the size, location,  and type of its customers, and about how its fees (or lack thereof) affect  their access to the program, or how they compare to state or private sector  fees. Fees for particular services affect firms\u2019 access to and use of federal  export promotion programs. Better information would help CS market its  program better, adjust to changes in the marketplace, and address those  areas that maximize the impact of its services on promoting U.S. exports.  Not much is known about the extent to which user fees or other factors  influence SMEs\u2019 decisions to rely on CS for export promotion services.", "Studies and other sources suggest that the types of services CS offers  compared with other providers, the level of individualized attention  provided, and service quality are factors that also affect SMEs\u2019 choice to  use CS\u2019s services.", "Better evaluation of fee-based programs and customers, including states,  could improve program continuity, help managers target their resources  more efficiently and effectively, assess costs and benefits, and help the  Congress make more informed funding decisions.

These steps could, for example, include    documenting the procedures and processes of the costing methodology in  sufficient detail so that staff who work with costing at a later point could  understand the specific procedures used and the data sources and cost  assignment methods for each step in the process; incorporating costs paid by other federal entities for CS\u2019s benefits, such as  pensions and health insurance paid for by the Office of Personnel  Management when determining the full cost of each service;    updating estimates of the amount of time staff spent performing various  activities to realize any efficiency gained and to provide more accurate  estimates of full costs; and    documenting the methods and assumptions for establishing the user fees  CS charges different firms for each service to clearly show the linkage  between costs and user fees, particularly with regard to the lower user  fees for SMEs.", "To better understand demand for CS export promotion programs and the  level of participation attributable to its user fees, we also recommend that  the Secretary of Commerce direct the Assistant Secretary for Trade  Promotion and Director General of the U.S. and Foreign Commercial  Service to (2) ensure that the design of CS databases and procedures  followed by those entering the data enable CS to produce more accurate,  reliable, and complete data on its customers and services, including all  fees charged, company size, and export status."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["Commerce concurred with our recommendations and stated that CS  would take steps to improve the collection, processing, and  documentation of cost information on its export promotion programs.

Its technical comments mentioned CS\u2019s  conversion to a new financial accounting system, Commerce Business  System, which management expects will improve information about CS\u2019s  costs of delivering services. We support CS\u2019s implementation of an  improved financial accounting system. We remain concerned, however,  that potentially outdated and inaccurate nonfinancial data that are used to  determine the unit cost of specific services, such as the time staff spend  performing various activities, may not be updated by the new system.  Updating that information will help ensure that the full costs of specific  services are considered when setting fees. In addition, although an entity\u2019s  audited financial statements and unaudited cost accounting analyses may  use the same underlying financial data, an auditor\u2019s opinion on the  financial statements does not provide assurance concerning the  reasonableness of cost analyses performed using that data.", "Commerce also noted an increase in fees collected and services provided  to SMEs in fiscal year 2008, which they believe indicates their products  and services remain accessible to SMEs. However, we believe that missing  and inaccurate data about company size mean that CS cannot reliably or  accurately estimate the volume of services provided to SMEs or the fees  collected from them. In addition, CS\u2019s response relies on aggregate  analyses between fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2008 that did not take  into account changes in the mix of services provided or longer term trends  and, therefore, does not provide useful information about the impact of its  2008 fee schedule on SMEs.", "Further, Commerce stated that its trade promotion services are greater in  depth and scope than those provided by the states, and we discussed this  in our report.

In addition, to obtain information on the  states\u2019 trade offices\u2019 export promotion programs, fees, grants, and the  importance of Commerce to their activities, we surveyed the 50 states\u2019  trade offices. We developed our survey instrument between January and  late April 2008. To ensure that the survey respondents understood the  questions in the same way, that we had used appropriate terms for this  population, and that we had covered the most important issues, we  conducted three expert reviews and three formal pretests. We received  45 responses from the 50 states\u2019 trade offices, or a 90 percent response  rate. The survey and a more complete tabulation of the results are  provided in a supplement to this report (see GAO-09-148SP). We also  conducted site visits in 6 states (California, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois,  Mississippi, and Pennsylvania). We chose these states to ensure a range of  characteristics based on the following criteria: the size of the state trade  promotion budget, the existence of a grant or subsidy program that funds  SMEs\u2019 participation in CS\u2019s export promotion programs, states\u2019 trade  offices collocated with U.S. Export Assistance Centers, the number of  overseas states\u2019 trade offices and representatives, size of the state\u2019s  economy and population, and states that do not have trade offices. We  also reviewed and analyzed information in the 2005-2007 National Export  Strategy reports and the State International Development Organizations\u2019  (SIDO) annual survey results of states\u2019 trade offices. Based on interviews  and our analysis, we determined that SIDO\u2019s data were sufficiently reliable  for our purposes. Information on all the states\u2019 export promotion budgets  were difficult to obtain, and reliable and current data were only available  from SIDO for 27 states; however, we used data for only 24 states in our  analysis because 3 states did not disaggregate their export promotion  budgets from their foreign investment recruitment budgets.", "To determine CS\u2019s procedures for determining costs and establishing user  fees, we interviewed key CS and International Trade Administration staff  and reviewed and analyzed available documentation about CS\u2019s export  promotion programs and user fees based on the 2005 and 2008 user fee  changes; CS\u2019s methodology for full cost recovery; cost templates of CS\u2019s  fee-based export promotion programs; data on CS\u2019s budget and staff; data  on staff time spent on various activities to deliver services; legislation  authorizing CS to charge a fee for services (annual appropriations and the  Mutual Education and Cultural Exchange Act); OMB Circular A-25, User  Charges; Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards 4:  Managerial Cost Accounting Standards and Concepts; GAO\u2019s Standards  for Internal Control in the Federal Government; and GAO\u2019s Federal User  Fees: A Design Guide. We did not need to perform an assessment of the  reliability of the export promotion programs\u2019 cost and user fees data  because we did not use the data but noted weaknesses in the cost-finding  methodology.", "To determine what is known about how CS\u2019s export promotion programs\u2019  user fees affect SMEs\u2019 participation in its programs, we reviewed and  analyzed past export promotion programs and user fees studies performed  for Commerce by Booz Allen and Hamilton, Inc., KPMG LLP,  and  Chemonics International. In addition, we reviewed and analyzed the  Office of Management and Budget\u2019s 2003 and 2008 Program Assessment  Rating Tool for the CS. We also reviewed and analyzed CS\u2019s fee-based  export promotion services purchased by its customers and the associated  collections from these purchases from 2004 to 2008. While we cited data  elements on clients and collections for 2008, having determined that these  elements were sufficiently reliable for our purposes, we noted that other  data elements, particularly company size and export status, are not fully  reliable for the reasons that we have elaborated upon in the report\u2019s third  objective. We also reviewed ad hoc feedback CS received on its user fees  from CS\u2019s field staff, client firms, District Export Councils, states\u2019 trade  offices, and trade and industry associations. Further, we analyzed our  survey results regarding states\u2019 trade offices\u2019 views on the impact of the  2005 and 2008 user fees changes on their purchase of CS\u2019s services. We  obtained the states\u2019 trade offices\u2019 views for several reasons: (1) they are  experts in offering export promotion programs and services; (2) they work  with SMEs that export and, in many cases, they work with the same SMEs  as CS; (3) they are purchasers and multipliers of CS\u2019s fee services, as well  as purchasers of private sector fee services and are able to compare and  contrast these service providers; and (4) our research at the beginning of  our review indicated that it would be feasible to survey the states within  our time frame and achieve an acceptable response rate.", "Further, we interviewed Commerce officials in Washington, D.C., and at  the six U.S. Export Assistance Centers we visited, as well as officials of the  six states\u2019 trade offices, District Export Councils, the Office of  Management and Budget, the State International Development  Organizations, and American chambers of commerce.", "To determine the purposes for which we could and could not use  Commerce data on customers served and the dollars collected, we  interviewed agency officials, attended a demonstration of CS\u2019s data  systems, and performed checks and analyses of the data themselves.

We  also determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to report on  selected fee services by the state of the company purchasing the service,  though with the caveat that we could not examine the data by company  size. However, we noted several limitations in the data, which we  discussed in the body of this report. In particular, the data do not provide  accurate counts by company size and export status. Moreover, the data  only provide an incomplete picture of the fee services purchased by states\u2019  trade offices.

CS does not currently have an office in Alaska, Delaware, and  Wyoming, and CS provides services to customers in these states from U.S.  Export Assistance Centers (USEAC) in neighboring states. For example,  the USEAC in Seattle provides services to customers in Alaska. In  addition, USEACs are colocated with 11 states\u2019 trade offices. CS\u2019s trade  specialists also work in 75 countries or 124 offices worldwide. In some  countries, such as Brazil, China, and India, CS has offices in 5 or more  cities. In addition, most states\u2019 trade offices have 1 or more overseas  offices. For example, in 2008, there were 34 countries in which at least one  state trade office maintained an office or representative. In some  countries, such as China, multiple states maintain offices, and individual  states maintain offices in more than one city. CS also operates offices in  each of these 34 countries. However, CS operates in 41 countries where  states do not have representation, and some states\u2019 trade offices explained  they rely heavily on CS services in these countries.

For example, CS has 104 staff in China, 30 staff in Germany,  and 12 staff in Australia. In addition, some states maintain large overseas  offices in certain countries, which tend to be staffed with full-time  employees. Other states\u2019 overseas offices are staffed by part-time private  consultants working on contract or volunteer representatives. For  example, states often maintain full-time offices in primary overseas  markets, such as Mexico and Japan, while states tend to employ part-time  consultants in smaller markets.", "Recently, CS and many states\u2019 trade offices have reduced or consolidated  their overseas offices but have maintained or opened offices in key  markets. CS has recently undertaken the Transformational Commercial  Diplomacy (TCD) initiative, which seeks to shift CS resources from more  accessible overseas markets to less accessible markets to better align the  needs of U.S. exporters with CS resources. Under the TCD initiative, CS  has closed a number of small offices in well-developed markets or in small  markets with limited commercial opportunities to open offices in new  emerging markets with greater commercial potential, such as China and  India. For example, under TCD, CS has closed 22 offices and opened 4  offices in Qatar, Tunisia, Libya, and Afghanistan. In addition, CS plans to  open additional offices in Baku, Azerbaijan; Wuhan, China; Porto Alegre,  Brazil; and Racife, Brazil; and add staff at offices in China and India.  Similarly, many states\u2019 trade offices have reduced or consolidated their  overseas offices but have maintained and opened offices in key overseas  markets. For example, some states\u2019 trade offices have consolidated their  overseas offices in multiple countries of a particular region, such as  Europe or Asia, to cover the entire region from a single office.
