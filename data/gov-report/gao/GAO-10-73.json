The previous administration's Homeland Security Council (HSC) issued the Implementation Plan for the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza (Plan) in May 2006 to help address a pandemic. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) was asked to (1) determine how the HSC and responsible federal agencies monitor the progress and completion of the Plan's action items; and (2) assess the extent to which selected action items have been completed. To do this, GAO interviewed officials from the HSC and the six federal agencies responsible for implementing most of the Plan, and analyzed a random sample of 60 action items. While this report does not assess the response efforts for the H1N1 pandemic, GAO continues to monitor the outbreak and the federal response."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["To oversee agencies' progress in implementing the Plan's action items, the HSC, which is supported by the White House National Security Staff in this administration, convenes regular interagency meetings, asks agencies for summaries of progress; and leads the interagency process that monitors the progress of the Plan. Officials from the six agencies stated that they monitor action items tasked to more than one agency by selecting one or two agencies to report a consolidated summary of progress, approved by each responsible agency, to the HSC. However, neither the HSC nor the agencies monitor or report on the 17 action items intended for nonfederal entities, including, for example, action items asking state, local, and tribal entities to ensure their preparedness plans address mass immunization, even though the information may have been available from other sources, such as the interagency review of state pandemic plans led by the Department of Health and Human Services. In addition, the Plan does not describe the types of information needed to carry out the Plan's response-related action items, although agencies may have operational plans or other existing guidance that would provide this information. The HSC reported in October 2008 that the majority of the 324 action items were designated as complete. However, GAO's review of 60 action items found that it was difficult to determine the actual status of some of the 49 designated as complete. All of the action items reviewed have both a description of activities to be carried out and a measure of performance, which the HSC stated that it used to assess completion. However, for more than half of the action items considered complete, the measures of performance do not fully address all of the activities contained in their descriptions. While the HSC's progress summaries sometimes corrected for this by either referring to activities in the action item's description or some other information not reflected in either the measure of performance or description, future progress reports would benefit from using measures of performance that are more consistent with the action items' descriptions. The Plan is predicated on a type of pandemic different in severity and origin than the current H1N1 pandemic, but it is serving as the foundation for the response to the outbreak, supplemented by an additional plan tailored specifically to the characteristics of the H1N1 pandemic. Nevertheless, the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza and Plan will still be needed for future events as most of the action items in the Plan were to be completed by May 2009. As recommended in earlier GAO work, but not yet implemented, the Plan should be updated to take into account certain missing elements and lessons learned from the H1N1 pandemic; the update should also address the monitoring and assessment improvements GAO identified in this report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["An influenza pandemic remains a real threat to our nation and to the  world, as we are witnessing during the current H1N1 pandemic, which  began in spring 2009 and continues today. The previous administration\u2019s  Homeland Security Council (HSC) took an active approach to the potential  disaster of an influenza pandemic by, among other things, issuing the  National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza (Strategy) in November 2005,  and the Implementation Plan for the National Strategy for Pandemic  Influenza (Plan) in May 2006. The Strategy lays out high-level goals to  prepare for and respond to an influenza pandemic, while the Plan is  intended to support the broad framework and goals articulated in the  Strategy by outlining specific steps that federal departments and agencies  should take to achieve the goals. The Plan includes 324 action items, a  majority of which have measures of performance and associated time  frames. Both the Strategy and Plan are based on a scenario that assumes a  severe pandemic originating outside the United States, spreading first  among animal populations and then transmitted to humans. While the  current pandemic does not share these characteristics, according to the  Director of Medical Preparedness Policy for the White House National  Security Staff (NSS), which supports the HSC in the current  administration, the Strategy and Plan provide the foundation for an  additional planning document, the National Framework for 2009-H1N1  Influenza Preparedness and Response, that was developed this year to  respond to the H1N1 pandemic. The framework for the 2009 H1N1  pandemic has not yet been made publicly available.", "In August 2007, we reported that while the development of the Strategy  and Plan were an important first step in guiding national preparedness, the  Plan lacked a prescribed process for monitoring and reporting on  progress, which is one element of the six desirable characteristics of a  national strategy. To address this and other areas that we had identified,  we recommended that the HSC establish a specific process and time frame  for updating the Plan, including lessons learned from exercises and other  events, such as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. For this report, you asked us to  focus on the progress in implementing the action items in the Plan,  specifically (1) determining how the HSC and the responsible federal  agencies are monitoring the progress and completion of the Plan\u2019s action  items; and (2) assessing the extent to which selected action items have  been completed, whether activity has continued on the selected action  items reported as complete, and the nature of that work. We did not assess  the response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in this report, but we are  continuing to monitor the outbreak and the federal government\u2019s  response.", "To address these objectives, we conducted an in-depth analysis of a  random sample of 60 action items in the Plan. These 60 action items are  listed in appendix II. We drew a random sample from the 286 action items  involving six federal agencies with primary responsibility for ensuring  completion of the large majority (88 percent) of the 324 action items.  These six agencies include the Department of Defense (DOD), Department  of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Homeland Security  (DHS), Department of State (DOS), Department of Transportation (DOT),  and the Department of Agriculture (USDA). We do not generalize the  results of our analysis because the particular analytical steps we took  across the selected action items varied, and as a result there was no  common underlying measure on which to generalize the results to all of  the action items in the Plan. In addition, we did not review all of the action  items in the Plan in depth because our analyses involved multiple  assessments for each action item, including the review of large volumes of  agency documentation in determining the level of evidence for completion  of the action item. See appendix I for a more detailed discussion of our  scope and methodology.", "For both objectives, we interviewed officials and obtained documentation  from the six agencies. We also reviewed the HSC\u2019s 6-month, 1-year, and 2- year progress reports, and the HSC\u2019s 1-year summary report on the  implementation of the action items in the Plan. In addition, we interviewed  a senior HSC official in the previous administration and the Director of  Medical Preparedness Policy for the NSS in the current administration,  who is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Plan. We also  relied on our prior pandemic work, including a review of whether the  Strategy and Plan contained all the characteristics of an effective national  strategy, to inform our analysis. To address the first objective, we  assessed information from interviews and documentation on how the HSC  and the selected agencies monitored the progress and completion of all  action items. We also interviewed representatives from nonfederal entities  that agency officials had identified as working on specific action items,  such as the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Denver  Health Medical Center, to determine whether they had been consulted on  the status of those action items. To address the second objective, we  analyzed the 49 action items designated as complete in the HSC\u2019s 2-year  progress report from the random sample of 60 action items, along with  collected documentation and interviews with selected agency officials and  a senior HSC official from the prior administration. To describe the extent  to which action items had been completed, we analyzed information on  the 49 selected action items in the Plan, the HSC progress reports, and  documentation on each of the 49 action items. To evaluate the extent of  work that has continued on the 49 action items in our sample designated  as complete and the nature of that work, we asked all selected agencies  with primary responsibility if they had performed additional work and, if  so, to provide a brief description of the nature of that work. In addition,  for the 34 selected action items designated as complete in the HSC\u2019s 1-year  progress report, we analyzed each action item\u2019s summary in the HSC\u2019s 1-  and 2-year progress reports for any new information on work conducted in  that period.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2008 to November 2009 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives.

Unlike incidents that are discretely bounded in space or  time (e.g., most natural or man-made disasters), an influenza pandemic is  not a singular event, but is likely to come in waves, each lasting weeks or  months, and pass through communities of all sizes across the nation and  the world simultaneously. While a pandemic will not directly damage  physical infrastructure such as power lines or computer systems, it  threatens the operation of critical systems by potentially removing the  essential personnel needed to operate them from the workplace for weeks  or months.", "On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a  pandemic based on the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus currently in wide  circulation by raising the worldwide pandemic alert level to Phase 6\u2014the  highest level. Figure 1 shows the WHO phases of a pandemic,  characterizing Phase 6 as community-level outbreaks in at least one  country in a different WHO region in addition to the criteria defined in  Phase 5. This action was a reflection of the spread of the new H1N1 virus,  not the severity of illness caused by the virus. At that time, more than 70  countries had reported cases of 2009 H1N1 and there were ongoing  community-level outbreaks in multiple parts of the world. As of November  8, 2009, WHO reported over 503,536 confirmed cases and at least 6,260  deaths, acknowledging, however, that the number of cases was actually  understated since it is no longer requiring affected countries to count  individual cases and confirm them through laboratory testing.", "Similar to the seasonal influenza, the 2009 H1N1 influenza can vary from  mild to severe. Given ongoing H1N1 activity to date, the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated that it anticipates that there  will be more cases, more hospitalizations, and more deaths associated  with this pandemic in the United States in the fall and winter. The novel  H1N1 virus, in conjunction with regular seasonal influenza viruses, poses  the potential to cause significant illness with associated hospitalizations  and deaths during the U.S. influenza season. The United States continues  to report the largest number of 2009 H1N1 cases of any country  worldwide, although most people who have become ill have recovered  without requiring medical treatment. The 2009 H1N1 influenza has been  reported in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, American Samoa,  the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the  U.S. Virgin Islands."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "National Planning Efforts for an Influenza Pandemic", "paragraphs": ["As shown in figure 2, the Strategy lays out three high-level goals to prepare  for and respond to an influenza: (1) stop, slow, or otherwise limit the  spread of a pandemic to the United States; (2) limit the domestic spread of  a pandemic and mitigate disease, suffering, and death; and (3) sustain  infrastructure and mitigate impact on the economy and the functioning of  society. These goals are underpinned by three pillars that are intended to  guide the federal government\u2019s approach to a pandemic threat, including:  (1) preparedness and communication, (2) surveillance and detection, and  (3) response and containment. Each pillar describes domestic and  international efforts, animal and human health efforts, and efforts that  would need to be undertaken at all levels of government and in  communities. The Plan outlines steps for federal entities and also provides  expectations for nonfederal entities\u2014including state, local, and tribal  governments; the private sector; international partners; and individuals\u2014 to prepare themselves and their communities.", "Of the 324 action items in the Plan, 144 are related to pillar 1 on  preparedness and communication; 86 are related to pillar 2 on surveillance  and detection; and the remaining 94 are related to pillar 3 on response and  containment.

Most of the action items in the Plan\u2014those that were not tied to  response\u2014were expected to have been completed in 3 years, by May 2009.  Since the issuance of the Plan in May 2006, the HSC publicly reported on  the status of the action items at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years in December  2006, July 2007, and October 2008, respectively. Although this  administration has not yet publicly reported on the 3-year status of  implementing the Plan\u2019s action items, an NSS official stated that the 3-year  progress report had been in development prior to the 2009 H1N1  pandemic, and may be released shortly."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The HSC Monitors Agencies\u2019 Progress on Most Action Items", "paragraphs": ["The HSC monitors the status of action items in the Plan tasked to federal  agencies by convening regular interagency meetings and requesting  summaries of progress from agencies.

The former HSC official stated that these meetings are a forum for  monitoring the status of the Plan\u2019s action items. These meetings were held  weekly after the release of the Plan and biweekly after the spring of 2008,  according to the former HSC official. Officials from several of the selected  agencies stated that the interagency meetings facilitate interagency  cooperation and coordination on the action items in the Plan. Officials  also said that these meetings provide a venue to raise and address  concerns relating to how to implement particular action items, and enable  them to build relationships with their colleagues in other agencies. In  addition, the HSC requested that agencies provide the Council with  periodic summaries of their progress on the action items in preparation for  the HSC\u2019s progress reports, according to officials from all of the selected  agencies.", "Officials from the six selected agencies informed us that, in this  administration, the NSS continues to lead the interagency process used to  monitor progress of the Plan. Officials from several of the selected  agencies stated that the NSS continues to hold meetings at the Sub- Interagency Policy Committee level to monitor efforts related to influenza  pandemic, with a primary focus on the 2009 H1N1 response. According to  an NSS official, the NSS has also requested periodic summaries of  progress from agencies on the action items.", "For action items that involve multiple federal agencies, the six agencies  monitor the action items assigned to them by designating one or two  agencies to report one consolidated summary of progress for each action  item to the HSC, according to agency officials. Some action items task  additional federal agencies with a support role as well. According to  agency officials, all agencies tasked with responsibility for an action item  have to approve its summary of progress before it is provided to the HSC.  The HSC\u2019s 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year progress reports state that the  action items\u2019 summaries in the reports were prepared by relevant agencies  and departments. Officials from all six agencies said that the HSC does not  always require them to submit supporting documentation along with their  summary of progress to determine if an action item is complete. For  instance, officials at three of the agencies said that the HSC does not  require them to submit supporting documentation, while officials from  two other agencies said that additional information is required by the HSC  if it is not convinced about the completeness of an action item, or if it is  unclear that the respective measure of performance was met based on the  summary of progress.", "For the 112 action items in the Plan that include both federal agencies and  nonfederal entities, the responsible federal agencies determined how they  would work with and monitor the nonfederal entities. According to the  former HSC official, the responsible agencies determined how these action  items would be implemented, including deciding which nonfederal entities  they would work with and in what manner they would work with them.  Among the six agencies we reviewed, five said that they worked with  nonfederal entities to implement some of the action items in the Plan. For  example, DOT officials stated that they worked with professional  associations to develop guidelines and recommendations for Emergency  Medical Services (EMS) and 9-1-1 call centers, and HHS officials told us  that they worked with medical experts to develop guidance on mass  casualty care. We interviewed representatives of nine of these nonfederal  entities and all of them confirmed that the status of the action items with  which they were associated had been accurately reported.

An  interagency group led by the HSC reviews the agencies\u2019 summaries of  progress to help determine if action items are complete.

Moreover, the Plan states that in the event of an influenza pandemic,  the distributed nature and sheer burden of disease across the nation would  mean that the federal government\u2019s support to any particular community is  likely to be limited, with the primary response to a pandemic coming from  state governments and local communities. In our June 2008 report on  states\u2019 influenza pandemic planning and exercising, officials from selected  states and localities confirmed that they were not directly involved in  developing the Plan.

According to the former HSC  official in the prior administration and an NSS official in the current  administration, the HSC is not in a position to assess progress on these  action items because the federal government cannot direct nonfederal  entities to complete them. Therefore, these 17 action items do not contain  measures of performance against which to measure progress.

These priority areas included mass vaccination, law  enforcement, and community containment, which includes community- level interventions designed to limit the transmission of a pandemic virus  with emphasis on isolation and quarantine, closing schools, and  discouragement of large public gatherings, at a minimum. This HHS-led  review found major gaps in these three areas, which are activities cited in  the two action items noted above. Since our 2008 report, HHS led a second  interagency assessment of state influenza pandemic plans, which found  that although states have made important progress toward preparing for  combating an influenza pandemic, most states still have major gaps in  their pandemic plans.

Measure of performance: Number and  range of target audiences reached with core public affairs and public  diplomacy messages, and impact of these messages on public  responses to avian and pandemic influenza."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Work Was Conducted on Some Selected Action Items Designated as Complete", "paragraphs": ["We found that work has continued on some of the selected action items  the HSC designated as complete, including providing additional guidance,  training and exercises.

In addition, according to the HSC\u2019s  progress reports, a determination of \u201ccomplete\u201d indicates that the measure  of performance has been achieved but does not necessarily mean that  work on the action items has ended; the work is ongoing in many cases.", "Our analysis of the 1-year and 2-year progress reports confirmed that there  was additional work conducted for 20 of the 34 selected action items  initially designated complete as of the 1-year report. For example, one of  the action items called for national spokespersons to coordinate and  communicate messages to the public. The HSC\u2019s 1-year report stated that  for this action item, which was designated as complete, the federal  government had engaged various spokespersons by providing training for  risk communications and supporting community and individual actions to  reduce illness and death. In the HSC\u2019s 2-year report, the HSC provided new  information on an influenza pandemic communications plan, which  included messaging and spokesperson development components and  numerous regional and local crisis and emergency risk communications  trainings. In another example, an action item required all hospitals and  health facilities funded by HHS, DOD, and the Department of Veterans  Affairs (VA) to develop and publicly disseminate guidance materials on  infection control. In its 1-year report, the HSC provided information on  guidance documents issued by HHS on hospital infection control and VA\u2019s  national infection prevention campaign, whereas in its 2-year report, the  HSC reported on new information related to two DOD guidance  documents on preparation and response health policy and clinical and  public health guidelines for the military health system.", "Action items 6.1.1.3., 7.3.2.1., and 9.1.2.2. implementation of a national animal vaccination program. An official  from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) also confirmed that  additional work had continued for this action item in conjunction with the  World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) in developing joint strategies  for highly pathogenic avian influenza."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In 2007, we recommended that the HSC establish a specific process and  time frame for updating the Plan to include a number of features we  identified as important elements of a national strategy, including a process  for monitoring and reporting on progress. While the Plan\u2019s assumptions  are not matched to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, making some of the action  items less relevant to current circumstances, the process for monitoring  and reporting on the status of pandemic plans is not particular to any one  type of pandemic scenario. The lessons learned from developing and  monitoring the 2006 Plan should be relevant to all future pandemic  planning efforts.", "In particular, although the HSC, which is supported by the NSS, has  monitored progress on the Plan, it has not yet established a process for  updating the Plan, as previously reported, and we have found additional  areas for improvement in how the Plan has been monitored and the status  of action items assessed. For one thing, the NSS and the responsible  federal agencies have not been monitoring or reporting on action items in  the Plan intended for state and local governments and other nonfederal  entities, even though, in some instances, they have information available  that would allow them to do so, such as the interagency assessment of  state pandemic plans led by HHS. Given that the Plan states that in a  pandemic the primary response will come from states and communities,  this information should be in the progress reports, notwithstanding that it  may be available in other sources. Similarly, while agency operational  plans or guidance may provide the information under which the response- related action items would be undertaken, the Plan itself contains no such  information. As a result, it is unclear whether the information that would  be needed to activate the response-related action items in the Plan has  been identified or worked out in advance.", "The HSC designated about 75 percent of the action items in the Plan as  completed, as of October 2008. However, based on our review of 49 of the  245 action items designated as complete, it is difficult to determine the  actual status of some of the selected action items designated as complete.  The HSC and the responsible federal agencies generally relied on the  measures of performance to assess progress in completing the selected  action items. However, for more than half of the selected action items, we  found that the measures of performance did not fully reflect all of the  activities called for in the action items\u2019 descriptions. While the HSC\u2019s  progress summaries sometimes corrected for this by referring to activities  in the action item\u2019s description omitted from the measures of  performance, future progress reports would benefit from using measures  of performance that are more consistent with the action items\u2019  descriptions. This would, in turn, provide a more consistent and complete  basis for describing progress in implementing the Plan.", "Finally, although the administration has prepared an additional planning  document tailored specifically to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the Strategy  and Plan will still be needed for future events. Because most of the action  items were to be completed by May 2009, the Plan should be updated, as  we earlier recommended, to include all the elements identified in our 2007  report and to take into account the lessons learned from the 2009 H1N1  pandemic. As part of the process for monitoring the progress made in  preparing the nation for an influenza pandemic, the Plan should address  the monitoring and assessment improvements we identified in this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve how progress is monitored and completion is assessed under  the Plan and in future updates of the Plan, the HSC should instruct the  NSS to work with responsible federal agencies to    develop a monitoring and reporting process for action items that are  intended for nonfederal entities, such as state and local governments;  identify the types of information needed to decide whether to carry out  the response-related action items; and    develop measures of performance that are more consistent with the  descriptions of the action items."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Homeland Security Council  (HSC), and to the Secretaries of Agriculture, Defense, Health and Human  Services, Homeland Security, State, and Transportation for their review  and comment.", "In written comments on our draft report, the Principal Deputy Counsel to  the President, on behalf of the administration, stated that our report is one  notable source of suggestions for improving national pandemic planning,  and that the administration would give consideration to our findings and  recommendations as it continues its work in this area. The HSC also  provided us with technical comments, which we incorporated as  appropriate.", "HHS noted in its comments that important questions and analysis that  underpin our findings and recommendations were not presented or  addressed in this report, including whether (1) the original Plan was  adequate, (2) the priorities selected were appropriate, (3) the measures  selected for monitoring progress were appropriate, and (4) the monitoring  parameters selected were measurable or even achievable. We agree that  these are important questions. However, the objectives of this report were  to (1) determine how the HSC and responsible federal agencies monitor  the progress and completion of the Plan\u2019s action items and (2) assess the  extent to which selected action items have been completed.  As such, we  believe that we have in fact addressed the issues raised by HHS in this  report in our examination of action items and related measures of  performance, as well as in our prior recommendation that has not yet been  implemented to incorporate into future updates of the Plan the lessons  learned from exercises and other events, such as the H1N1 pandemic.", "HHS also provided two other general comments.  First, regarding our  discussion related to the lack of details in the Plan on the information that  would be used to activate the response-related action items, HHS stated  that it would be inappropriate to set specific trigger points to activate  specific responses because an influenza virus has an infinite range of  potential characteristics, which are not predictable, and that flexibility is  necessary.  HHS further stated that it would be more appropriate to  discuss the \u201ctypes\u201d of circumstances and responses that should be planned  for. We agree that flexibility is necessary to assess the specific  circumstances under which to implement the response-related action  items in the Plan, given the changing nature of an influenza virus. We agree  with HHS that the Plan should discuss the types of circumstances that  should be planned for in a pandemic. We have made changes to the report  to clarify this point.", "Second, with respect to our discussion of additional work conducted on  selected action items designated as complete, HHS noted that  preparedness is a continuous and  iterative improvement process based on  lessons learned, and that ongoing training and exercises should be  iterative and adapt to lessons learned.  We agree. As we noted in this  report, in some instances, continued efforts on action items may be  warranted\u2014for example, when new information or circumstances might  require an update of guidance. Our concern, however, is that it is unclear  what additional work or progress had been made on these action items,  since the HSC had designated them as complete.", "DHS stated that the information in our report is generally accurate and  had no substantive comments on the content of the report. DHS further  stated that while improvements can be made in the Plan as we outlined in  our report, there has been significant work accomplished in pandemic  preparedness as a direct result of the Plan.  For example, DHS noted that  significant collaboration at all levels of government and the private sector  has occurred, which enabled a more efficient and coordinated response  for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.", "DOT provided us with technical comments, which we incorporated. DOD,  DOS, and USDA informed us that they did not have any comments on the  draft report. The White House, HHS, and DHS provided written comments  on a draft of this report, which are reprinted in appendixes III, IV, and V,  respectively.", "As agreed with your office, we plan no further distribution of this report  until 30 days from its date, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier. At that time we will send copies to the HSC, Secretary of  Agriculture, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Health and Human  Services, Secretary of Homeland Security, Secretary of State, Secretary of  Transportation, and other interested parties.

We did not assess the response  efforts for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in this report, but we continue to  monitor the outbreak and the federal government\u2019s response.", "To address these objectives, we conducted an in-depth analysis of a  random sample of 60 action items in the Plan. We drew a random sample  from the 286 action items involving six federal agencies with primary  responsibility for ensuring completion of the large majority (88 percent) of  the 324 action items. These six agencies are the Department of Defense  (DOD), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of  Homeland Security (DHS), Department of State (DOS), Department of  Transportation (DOT), and the Department of Agriculture (USDA). Of the  60 action items selected for our sample, the HSC reported that 49 were  completed, 3 were in progress, and 8 had no status updates in its 2-year  progress report. The purpose of this random sampling was not to be able  to generalize our findings to the entire population of 286; rather, it was to  produce a sample that had a distribution of items generally mirroring that  of the overall population of 286 using the following variables so that the  sample would include action items that represented (1) the six agencies  with primary responsibility for implementing the Plan, (2) the three pillars  in the Plan, (3) the presence of collaboration between federal agencies  and nonfederal entities (i.e. state, local, and tribal entities, the private  sector, international organizations, and nongovernmental organizations),  and (4) various time frames of when they should be completed, which  range from within 24 hours of an outbreak to 60 months from the release  of the Plan in May 2006, among other time frames. We do not generalize  the results of our analysis because the particular analytical steps we took  across the selected action items varied and as a result there was no  common underlying measure on which to generalize results to all of th action items in the Plan. In addition, we did not review all of the action  items in the Plan in depth because our analyses involved multiple  assessments for each action item, including the review of large volumes of  agency documentation in determining the level of evidence for completi on  of the action item.", "For both objectives, we interviewed officials and obtained documentat from the six federal agencies. We reviewed the HSC\u2019s 6-month 2-year progress reports and the HSC\u2019s 1-year summary report on the  implementation of the action items in the Plan. In addition, we interv a senior HSC official from the previous administration and the Director of aff  Medical Preparedness Policy for the White House National Security St (NSS) in the current administration responsible for overseeing the  implementation of the Plan.  We also relied on our prior pandemic work  to inform our analysis.  ion  , 1-year, and  To address the first objective on how the HSC and responsible federal  agencies are monitoring the progress and completion of the Plan\u2019s action  items, we assessed information from interviews and documentation, such  as the HSC\u2019s progress reports, on how the HSC and the selected agencies  monitored the progress and completion of all action items. We also  requested information from the six agencies on how the NSS is currently  overseeing the interagency process used for monitoring the  implementation of action items in the Plan. We also interviewed  representatives from nine nonfederal entities, such as the World  Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Denver Health Medical  Center, which agency officials had identified as working collaboratively  with them on four action items in our sample, and asked these  representatives whether the agencies asked for information on the  progress of implementing these action items. In addition, we reviewed the Plan and the HSC\u2019s 2-year progress report to identify specific  circumstances that would trigger the response-related action items that  are activated by an animal outbreak or pandemic. We also collected  information from the four selected agencies that had primary  responsibility for the 10 response-related action items in our sample  regarding criteria that would trigger these action items.", "To address the second objective, we analyzed the 49 action items in our  random sample that the HSC\u2019s 2-year progress report designated as  complete. We also collected documentation and conducted interview with selected agency officials from the six agencies and a senior HSC  official from the prior administration. To describe the extent to which  action items had been completed, we analyzed information on the 49  selected action items in the Plan, the HSC progress reports, and  supporting documentation provided by the six agencies with primary  f the 49 action items to demonstrate how the  responsibility for each o measures of performance were achieved based on the HSC\u2019s criteria for  completion. Specifically, we analyzed the 49 selected action items  designated as complete to assess whether  1.  the measures of performance fully addressed, partially addressed, or  did not address their respective action item description;  2.  the summaries contained in the HSC\u2019s 2-year progress report fully  addressed, partially addressed, or did not address how th performance were achieved; and  3.  the measures of performance could be accomplished solely b responsible entities that are tasked to work on the action items.", "To evaluate the extent of work that has continued on the 49 ac in our sample that were designated as complete, and the nature of that  work, we gathered information in two ways. First, we compared the H 1-year and 2-year progress reports for 34 selected action items designated as complete as of the 1-year report by analyzing each actio item\u2019s summary in the HSC\u2019s 1- and 2-year progress repor information on work conducted. Second, we asked the six agencies with n  ts for any new  primary responsibility if they had performed additional work after action items were designated as complete and, if so, to provide a brief desc of the nature of that work. For 27 of the 49 action items designated as  complete, the agencies indicated that they had performed additional w after the action items were designated as complete. For 22 of those 27  action items, the agencies also specified the nature of the additional w GAO  To ensure consistency and accuracy of our analysis, at least two  analysts independently analyzed the data we received for the 49 select action items in our sample designated as complete and then compared their results.
