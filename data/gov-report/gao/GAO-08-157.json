Determining agencies' IP enforcement resources is challenging because few staff are dedicated to this area, and not all agencies track staff time spent on IP enforcement. Agencies carry out some enforcement actions through their headquarters, but significant enforcement takes place in the field. Federal enforcement actions generally increased during fiscal years 2001-2006, but the key agencies have not taken key steps to assess their achievements. For example, most have not systematically analyzed their IP enforcement statistics to inform management and resource allocation decisions, collected data on their efforts to address IP crimes that affect public health and safety, or established IP-related performance measures or targets to assess their achievements. Also, Customs and Border Protection's enforcement of exclusion orders, which stop certain IP-infringing goods from entering the country, has been limited due to certain procedural weaknesses. The National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center, an interagency mechanism created to coordinate federal investigative efforts, has not achieved its mission and staff levels have decreased. Currently, only one agency participates in the center's activities, which focus on private sector outreach. Agencies have lacked a common understanding of the center's purpose and agencies' roles.

To examine agencies\u2019 resources for IP-related  enforcement, we obtained information on staff resources, where available.  To evaluate IP-related enforcement trends and achievements, we reviewed  agency statistics for fiscal years 2001 through 2006, including IP-related  seizures, investigations, and prosecutions.

It grants protection by approving patents or registering  copyrights and trademarks. It enforces IP rights by taking actions against  those accused of theft or misuse. Enforcement actions include both civil  and criminal penalties. U.S. laws criminalize certain types of IP violations,  primarily copyright and trademark violations, and authorize incarceration  or fines. These laws are directed primarily toward those who knowingly  produce and distribute IP-infringing goods, rather than those who  consume such goods. Although U.S. laws do not treat patent violations as  a crime, the federal government does take actions to protect patents and  authorizes civil enforcement actions against infringers.

While the U.S. International Trade  Commission issues relatively few exclusion orders each year, these orders  can affect large volumes of trade, according to CBP officials. As of July  2007, 66 exclusion orders were in effect, according to CBP. CBP takes two  basic steps to enforce these orders: (1) CBP posts written guidance, called  Trade Alerts, to its intranet to inform ports about new orders, and (2) it  creates electronic targeting instructions that alert ports about incoming  shipments that need to be examined for potential infringing goods related  to the order. When its exams identify goods that should be excluded, CBP  does not allow the goods to enter the country and issues a notice of  exclusion to the importer. According to CBP officials, CBP does not  maintain data on the number of exclusion notices, either in total or by  order, nor does it alert the rights holder of the exclusion. However, CBP  does maintain data on the total number of exclusion order exams it  conducts and the number of times these exams reveal any IP  discrepancies. As shown in figure 4, the number of exclusion order  exams have declined since fiscal year 2002, and a very small number of  discrepancies have been found. CBP explained that the decrease in  exams from fiscal years 2002 to 2004 was due to the termination of  targeting for one exclusion order that had been generating most of the  exams.", "CBP\u2019s limited and declining enforcement of exclusion orders has been of  concern to certain private sector representatives, notably the companies  that have sought such orders or the attorneys that represent them.  Representatives said companies spend millions of dollars in legal fees to  win a U.S. International Trade Commission ruling for their products, but  that the effectiveness of the ruling is weakened by poor enforcement at  CBP. Private sector representatives also stated that CBP\u2019s enforcement of  the orders is not transparent because CBP does not notify companies of  any exclusions that have occurred, impeding their ability to follow through  on the matter. This differs from CBP\u2019s practices when it detains or seizes  IP-infringing goods: CBP notifies both the importer and IP rights owner of  such detentions or seizures. CBP officials said the agency does not have a  regulation to permit the notification of exclusions to affected rights  owners, and they did not know whether CBP had legal authority under the  relevant statute to make such notifications.", "We found several procedural weaknesses in CBP\u2019s exclusion order  enforcement, including a lack of intranet Trade Alerts for about half of the  orders currently in force, delays in posting Trade Alerts to its intranet,  minimal use of electronic targeting, and no procedures for updating Trade  Alerts when the status of exclusion orders changes or expires. The effect  of these weaknesses has been to limit or delay the degree to which  exclusion orders are enforced; details are provided below.", "CBP does not have Trade Alerts on its intranet for all orders currently in  effect and lacks information to develop Trade Alerts for some orders. Of  the 66 orders in effect as of July 2007, CBP had posted Trade Alerts to its  internal website for 24 of them and was developing such guidance for 5  others. CBP said it had paper records for 15 older orders that it had not yet  converted to Trade Alerts due to limited resources, but lacked records for  enforcing most of these remaining orders.", "Although CBP officials said the agency is required to enforce the orders  from the date they are issued, we found that CBP\u2019s enforcement may be  considerably delayed. According to CBP officials, this is because CBP  must review and interpret large amounts of complex information  generated by the administrative process, but only two attorneys at CBP are  presently qualified to carry out this review. We determined that it took  CBP more than 60 days to post Trade Alerts for 14 of 18 orders for which it  could provide such data. According to CBP officials, work to establish  the intranet platform for IP issues began in 2003, but CBP did not have the  capability to actually begin posting Trade Alerts to its Web site until April  of 2004. Prior to that date, text-only Alerts were published to an internal  electronic bulletin board that housed them for 90-day renewable periods.", "CBP develops targeting instructions for most, but not all, of the exclusion  orders it receives. Of 10 randomly selected orders for which CBP had  posted Trade Alerts as of July 2007, we found that it had developed  targeting instructions for only 4. Also, although CBP officials said that the  agency is to enforce exclusion orders until they expire, we found that its  actual targeting instructions for an order may expire far sooner. CBP  officials said that targeting instructions that have not generated any exams  or found any IP violations after 90 days are removed from CBP\u2019s targeting  system. CBP provided data on the number of exclusion orders for which it  had targeting instructions in place in each of fiscal years 2003 through  2006. The number of orders with targeting instructions dropped from 25 in  fiscal year 2003 to 10 in fiscal year 2006\u2014far fewer than the number of  orders in force at that time.", "CBP has no process for ensuring that its Trade Alerts are adjusted to  reflect changes in the status of exclusion orders. For example, CBP  initially provided data to indicate that it had issued Trade Alerts for 29  orders, but we determined that 5 of the Trade Alerts were for orders that  had expired or been rescinded.

During this period, a total of 891 defendants were convicted and 373  received prison sentences. According to DOJ officials, the data for the  number of IP-related defendants referred to federal prosecutors from  investigative agencies should be considered independent of the data for  defendants charged with IP violations. Additionally, the difference  between the number of referred IP defendants and the number of  defendants charged with IP offenses in a given year, or period of years,  may be explained in part by the fact that IP suspects may never be charged  with IP offenses because they are instead charged with crimes carrying  higher statutory maximum sentences, or because the IP charges are  dismissed pursuant to plea agreements to more serious charges.

For example, while  all the agencies reported using IP enforcement statistics to compare  outputs from one year to the next, our discussions with agency officials  revealed that little has been done to systematically examine enforcement  statistics. Such analysis might include looking at field offices or regions  with higher or lower levels of activity to identify effective enforcement  practices and inform resource allocation decisions. It might also include  identifying the types of IP crimes that agency staff are enforcing to  understand criminal activity and help focus enforcement efforts.", "Agencies are already collecting some data that could be used to examine  enforcement efforts more systematically. In April 2007, we reported that  CBP has not analyzed variations in its IP enforcement activity by port or  conducted analysis of ports\u2019 relative enforcement outcomes. By analyzing  available CBP data, we found pockets of enforcement activity in some  areas. For example, a majority of CBP\u2019s seizure actions took place in a  limited number of locations, with nearly three-fourths of aggregate seizure  value accounted for by only 10 of more than 300 ports. These are a mix of  ports, including a few of the nation\u2019s largest and some that are smaller. In  this report, we made recommendations to CBP to improve upon and better  understand its IP enforcement activity through better analysis. We  performed a similar analysis for DOJ using data on the number of  defendants charged and number of cases filed by U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices  and also found concentrations of activity for prosecution activity. For  example, about 50 percent of IP-related cases were filed by around   10 percent of U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices during fiscal years 2001 through 2006.  The same results were true for the number of defendants charged with IP  crimes.", "We also compared the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices with the highest IP  enforcement activity with the locations where CHIP units were created as  of fiscal year 2006. Of the top 10 offices, ranked by number of IP cases  filed in 2006, 7 had CHIP units, and the 2 most active offices had the  largest CHIP units, measured by the number of attorneys working in the  unit. This analysis suggests that the number of resources in a particular  field office contributes to higher levels of activity; however, according to  DOJ, other factors, such as crime level, can also affect activity levels. Our  analyses illustrate the types of analysis that agencies can perform using  their data, and insights they can obtain, to better inform management and  resource allocation decisions. DOJ said that it performed similar analysis  before deciding where to place CHIP units, but did not provide evidence  that it conducts such analysis on a routine basis.", "While all the agencies collected statistics to report broadly on their IP- related enforcement activities, most of the agencies have not clearly  identified which IP enforcement actions relate to public health and safety  and do not have data to track their efforts in this area, despite making this  a priority enforcement area. By virtue of its mission, FDA\u2019s data on IP- related enforcement specifically reflects its efforts to address IP violations  that affect public health and safety. CBP has recently begun to monitor IP  seizures related to public health and safety. In January 2008, it released  seizure data for fiscal year 2007 that for the first time identified seizures in  product categories that may involve public health and safety, e.g.,  pharmaceutical, electrical articles, and sunglasses. CBP officials told us  that defining public health and safety seizures is difficult because not all  seizures in a given category pose public health and safety risks, and such  risks can be found across a broad range of products.", "The other agencies lack data for identifying IP enforcement actions related  to public health and safety. For example, ICE records IP enforcement  under a general data field that applies to all types of IP cases. FBI and DOJ  have some sub-categories for the types of IP investigations and  prosecutions they pursue, but none is specific to public health and safety.  Without specific data and definitions for IP-related enforcement efforts  that impact public health and safety, agencies are unable to effectively  track outcomes, inform management and resource allocation decisions,  and report to Congress on an area of significant public importance.", "Agencies have also taken few steps to clearly identify performance  measures specifically for their efforts related to IP-related enforcement  activities or establish performance targets to track their progress towards  these efforts.  We reviewed agencies\u2019 strategic plans and, while none had  specific goals on IP enforcement, the CBP and DOJ plans listed IP  enforcement as one issue to be addressed as part of working toward  broader enforcement goals. We also examined agencies\u2019 public and  internal planning documents or memos for IP enforcement and found that  some had goals and objectives, but contained few performance measures  or targets.  Moreover, most of these are internal agency documents that  are not available to the public. Neither ICE nor FDA have any additional  planning documents for IP enforcement.", "We asked agencies how they monitor their performance of IP enforcement  activities. Most said they regarded their increasing trends in aggregate IP  statistics (or outputs) as indicative of their progress. However, without  performance measures related to these statistics, it is not clear how these  statistics should be assessed because it is not clear what the agencies  sought to achieve. We recognize that establishing measures and setting  specific targets in the law enforcement area can be challenging. It is  important that agencies carry out law enforcement actions that are based  on merit and avoid the appearance that they strive to achieve certain  numerical quotas, regardless of case quality. By definition, performance  measures are a particular value or characteristic used to quantify a  program\u2019s outputs \u2013 which describe the products and services delivered  over a period of time \u2013 or outcomes \u2013 which describe the intended result  of carrying out the program.

We  believe that measures and targets remain important components of  measuring agency performance and enhancing accountability, particularly  setting outcome-based measures that provide insight into the effectiveness  of agencies\u2019 efforts, not just levels of activity. More refined performance  measurements that include outcome measures would allow agencies to  better track their IP enforcement performance against their goals and give  managers crucial information on which to base their organizational and  management decisions.

IP  crimes appear to be on the rise, and the key law enforcement agencies and  FDA need to work efficiently and effectively to contend with this trend.  Most federal IP enforcement activity has increased in recent years.  However, because IP enforcement is generally not a top agency priority,  few resources are dedicated solely to this task, and agencies may spend  fewer resources on IP enforcement than on higher priority issues. Despite  the general increases in IP enforcement activity, agencies have taken little  initiative to improve their data or evaluate their enforcement activity in  ways that would enable them to identify and track certain trends or  enforcement outcomes, like regional variations in enforcement activity  and types of IP-infringing goods commonly enforced. Performing this type  of analysis could help the agencies make further improvements in their IP  enforcement activity by making more effective management decisions and  resource allocations. At the same time, setting performance measures and  targets for IP enforcement activities could help the agencies better assess  their progress toward their goals. Finally, collecting better data, analyzing  them, and reporting on progress toward goals could help make the key IP  enforcement agencies more accountable to the public and Congress,  particularly regarding their efforts to address IP-infringement that affects  public health and safety. The need for such improvements among IP  enforcement agencies mirrors weaknesses we found previously with  NIPLECC, in which the lack of clarity over performance measures,  resource requirements, and oversight responsibilities limited NIPLECC\u2019s  ability to prioritize, guide, implement, and monitor the combined efforts of  multiple agencies to protect and enforce IP rights.", "One area where IP enforcement has not increased is CBP\u2019s enforcement of  exclusion orders.

CBP has allocated few resources to carry out its role in this complex area,  lacks data to track its enforcement of exclusion orders, and has not given  sufficient attention to addressing the procedural weaknesses that we  identify.

In light of the  agency\u2019s public health and safety mission, we determined that it was  inappropriate to require FDA to develop law enforcement-related  measures and targets, and no longer recommend this. However, given the  importance of understanding the nature of IP violations that affect public  health and safety, we now recommend instead that FDA more  systematically analyze its IP enforcement statistics (see p. 43). We believe  this is a more appropriate recommendation because FDA said that it  already monitors its IP enforcement criminal investigations to discern  trends. In response to other comments the agencies made, we also  modified two recommendations to give the agencies more flexibility in  identifying which of their IP enforcement actions relate to public health  and safety. Instead of recommending that the agencies create categories  and definitions of such actions, as we did in the draft report, we  recommend that they take steps to better identify these actions   (see p. 43).

Finally, CBP repeated comments made about our April  2007 report regarding an analysis that we proposed it could undertake to  better understand its enforcement outcomes. We disagreed with CBP\u2019s  comments at that time and continue to believe that CBP, and the other  agencies, can make better use of existing data to understand their IP  enforcement efforts and outcomes. DHS\u2019s written comments and our  detailed response appear in appendix IV.", "DOJ made several comments about ways in which it believes the report  understates its IP enforcement achievements. For example, DOJ cited  percent increases between select years for certain indicators to  demonstrate its increased enforcement results. However, the report takes  a more systematic approach to evaluating overall federal IP enforcement  efforts by examining multiple indicators at multiple agencies over a 6-year  period. We believe that the report\u2019s approach and assessment is fair and  valid. DOJ also commented we did not sufficiently acknowledge increases  in training and resource allocations for IP enforcement, particularly as  relates to its CHIP units. In fact, as was true for the draft report, the final  report discusses growth in CHIP units and numbers of IP-trained attorneys  (see p. 20). Finally, DOJ commented that the report inaccurately  characterizes its efforts to analyze IP enforcement statistics by district. We  modified the report to add information that DOJ analyzed IP enforcement  statistics when deciding where to place CHIP units; however, DOJ never  provided evidence that it conducts such analysis on a routine basis   (see p. 33). We continue to believe that systematically conducting such  analysis can help DOJ determine whether its allocation of resources is  producing the kind of increases in IP enforcement outcomes that it  desired.", "DOJ commented that the report inaccurately describes its efforts to  establish performance measures or goals to assess its IP enforcement  achievements. In response, we added information to the discussion of  performance measurement about certain DOJ documents that contain  such goals and measures, and cited again the DOJ task force reports on IP  enforcement, which had been mentioned earlier in the report (see p. 34).  However, the task force reports contain only recommendations for DOJ  action, not goals with associated performance measures. A few of these  recommendations are structured like performance goals, such as \u201ctarget  large, complex organizations that commit IP crime\u201d or \u201cprosecute IP  offenses that endanger the public\u2019s health or safety,\u201d but the task force  report provides no indication of how DOJ will measure progress toward  these recommendations. DOJ commented that developing numeric or  percentage targets linked to its performance measures could create the  potential for case quotas or thresholds. We agree that setting performance  measures and targets in the law enforcement arena is difficult, and we  added information to the report to further clarify the sensitivities  associated with doing this (see p. 35). However, we continue to believe  that it is important, and possible, for DOJ to develop performance  measures and targets to help it, and others, determine whether its overall  IP enforcement efforts are achieving performance goals and focused on  the right issues, and whether its resource allocations devoted to this area  are contributing to the desired results.

In addition, we included the Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) due to its role in investigating counterfeit versions  of products it regulates. To describe the federal structure that carries out  IP enforcement, we met with CBP, ICE, DOJ, FBI, and FDA officials at the  agencies headquarters, and, for all agencies except FDA, met with officials  in multiple field locations. The locations we visited are not disclosed in  this report for law enforcement reasons. We also met with the  International IP Enforcement Coordinator (IP Coordinator). We reviewed  agency documents to understand policies and practices related to IP  enforcement and discussed the processes by which these agencies interact  with each other in conducting IP enforcement.

In particular, we obtained data on (1) the number of criminal  investigative case hours that ICE and FDA field offices recorded under  codes used to track IP enforcement; and (2) the average number of agents  on board that were working IP criminal cases, as reported by FBI field  offices. We obtained data covering fiscal years 2001 through 2006, except  for FDA investigative case hours for counterfeit products, which the  agency has only been tracking since fiscal year 2003. We reviewed these  data for obvious errors and consistency with publicly reported data, where  possible. When we found discrepancies, we brought them to the attention  of relevant agency officials and worked with them to correct the  discrepancies before conducting our analyses. On the basis of these  efforts, we determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. To make similar comparisons across the agencies, we converted  ICE and FDA data on criminal case hours into full-time equivalents (FTE)  using information that the agencies provided and confirmed with FBI  officials that we could use FBI\u2019s measurement as equivalent to the FTE  measurement for time spent by ICE and FDA IP investigations.", "To examine agencies\u2019 IP enforcement activity, we analyzed data from  fiscal year 2001 to fiscal year 2006 on CBP IP seizures, penalties, and  exclusion activities; the number of criminal cases opened in ICE, FBI, and  FDA\u2019s Office of Criminal Investigation field offices that were recorded as  IP enforcement cases; ICE, FBI, and FDA arrests, indictments, and  convictions stemming from their IP investigations; and the numbers of  referrals of IP cases to DOJ from the investigative agencies, IP cases that  DOJ filed, defendants charged in those cases, defendants convicted of IP  crimes, defendants imprisoned, and sentences awarded. Information on  CBP seizures and penalties is drawn from our April 2007 report. In  addition, we obtained data from CBP on its Trade Alerts as of July 2007, as  well as the number of targeting instructions it had in place for each Trade  Alert in each of fiscal years 2003 through 2006 and the number of exams,  IP violations, and seizures it has recorded as a result of those instructions.  We discussed key law enforcement activities with ICE, FBI, FDA, and DOJ  and determined what data the agencies record and what activities they  report on internally. We then requested them to extract data from their  systems on these key activities when they were performed for IP  enforcement. For the most part, investigative agency data reflect activities  that are coded as IP enforcement, while DOJ data reflect activities in  which key IP enforcement statutes are cited. In general, the agencies said  that the data they provided reflected most, but perhaps not all, of their  activity related to IP enforcement.", "In order to collect uniform data on IP enforcement activities, we worked  with each agency to develop the parameters by which we would request  data from their systems. In addition, we worked with officials at each  agency to develop a thorough understanding of the data that we received.  We reviewed the data we obtained for obvious errors and consistency with  publicly reported data, where possible. When we found discrepancies, we  brought them to the attention of relevant agency officials and worked with  them to correct the discrepancies before conducting our analyses. For  example, we determined that CBP provided information on Trade Alerts  that related to Exclusion Orders that were no longer in effect. CBP agreed  and revised the number of Trade Alerts on its Web site. Also, the data we  report on ICE\u2019s arrests, indictments, and convictions are different from  data it has reported publicly in the IP Coordinator\u2019s quarterly IP  enforcement updates. ICE officials said that the system from which it  obtains this data is a \u201clive system,\u201d meaning that data pulled from the  system on different dates may not be the same. ICE officials cited updates  to case information as one reason that data might differ over time. In  addition, the parameters that ICE advised us to use when requesting ICE\u2019s  data on IP enforcement cases differed somewhat from the parameters that  ICE used. Finally, we found some inconsistencies with FBI\u2019s IP  enforcement data. We discussed these discrepancies with FBI and made  changes to the data accordingly. We asked FBI officials familiar with the  agency\u2019s IP enforcement efforts to review the final data set for accuracy.  We did not find discrepancies with FDA or DOJ data and used the most  current data sets they provided for the 6 fiscal years we requested. Based  on our discussions of internal controls and ability to address data  discrepancies with the agencies, we determined that the data are  sufficiently reliable to report IP enforcement activity. To assess federal  agencies\u2019 achievements in IP-related enforcement activity, we reviewed  agency priorities, goals, and objectives and compared them to the types of  data agencies collected. We also asked program officials how they used  their IP enforcement data to assess performance and inform management  and resource allocation decisions.", "We also talked to private sector representatives to better understand how  counterfeit and piracy affects their businesses and obtain their views on  federal IP enforcement.

We discussed health and safety issues with CBP during our review. In  January 2008, CBP released seizure data for fiscal year 2007 that for  the first time identified seizures in product categories that may involve  public health and safety, e.g., pharmaceuticals, electrical articles, and  sunglasses. We commend CBP for taking this step and modified our  report to reflect this new data (see p. 33). These data are publicly  available; therefore, GAO did not have to request them from CBP. We  added information to the draft report to state that CBP officials also  told us that creating a definition of IP seizures that affect public health  and safety is difficult because not all products within a given category  necessarily pose such risks and the potential for such risks cuts across  a broad range of products (see pp. 33-34). We modified our  recommendation to state that CBP should continue to take steps  toward better identifying IP seizures that pose a risk to public health  and safety of the American people, and collect and report this data  throughout the agency and to Congress (see p. 43).  2.  We reported on CBP\u2019s IP Rights Trade Strategy (a document that CBP  refers to in its letter as the National IPR Trade Strategy) in our April  2007 report. We added information to this report to describe this trade  strategy and note that it contains certain measures and indicators  related to IP enforcement (see p. 34.) However, we also noted, as we  did in our April 2007 report, that CBP officials told us this trade  strategy was an internal planning document, and we determined it had  limited distribution across CBP. For example, we found that revisions  to the document had not been distributed to CBP ports since 2003 and  given the document\u2019s status as \u201cFor Official Use Only,\u201d it is not  distributed to Congress or the public. Therefore, we concluded in April  2007 that this document, while containing certain measures and  indicators, has limited usefulness for holding CBP accountable for its  performance on IP enforcement. At that time, we recommended that  CBP work with OMB to include IP enforcement-related measures in its  strategic plan and are pleased that CBP states in its current comment  letter that it is in the process of taking such action.  3.  We do not understand why CBP is making comments in this report  about analysis that appeared in our April 2007 report, but that is not  reproduced in this report. That analysis showed that among the top 25  IP-importing ports in fiscal year 2005, many ports\u2019 IP seizure rates  (measured by value of IP seizures over value of IP imports) were lower  than the group average. We did this analysis because CBP had not  attempted to analyze its IP enforcement outcomes in this way. CBP  made these same comments in April 2007; we disagreed with how CBP  characterized our work at that time and continue to stand by our  analysis. In that report, we said that this and other types of analysis  contained in our April 2007 report represented approaches that CBP  could take to better understand variations in IP enforcement outcomes  across ports, inform resource allocations and management decisions,  and further improve its IP enforcement. We continue to believe that  CBP, and the other agencies, can better use existing data to  understand their IP enforcement outcomes across field locations or  product types as a way of further improving overall IP enforcement.  4.

We disagree that our report severely understates DOJ\u2019s enforcement  activities. Our analysis of federal IP enforcement efforts is a systematic  evaluation of trends in key agencies\u2019 enforcement indicators over a 6- year period. Although there were fluctuations (i.e., increases and  decreases) in individual indicators from year to year, we concluded  that all the indicators, when taken as a whole, showed a general  increase in federal IP enforcement efforts from the beginning to the  end of the period examined. Moreover, we considered all indicators  together because no single indicator from any one agency sufficiently  reflects overall trends. The DOJ statistics we examined also showed  increases and decreases during the time period. However, in its letter,  DOJ selected statistics that only reflect increases, and it did so in one  instance by comparing the lowest and highest levels for a given  indicator, regardless of the year in which they occurred, which  generated the highest possible percent increase for that indicator. We  do not believe DOJ\u2019s analysis is useful for discerning overall long-term  trends.  2.  Our report is based on agency data covering fiscal years 2001 through  2006. In several cases, fiscal year 2007 data became available as we  were finalizing our report. However, given the challenges we faced in  obtaining sufficiently reliable data from all agencies for the period we  studied (see appendix I, pp. 48-51), we were unable to systematically  update our data in a timely fashion to include fiscal year 2007  statistics.  3.  We disagree that our report gives insufficient attention to resource  increases at DOJ for IP enforcement. Our report discusses the creation  and growing number of CHIP units and also notes that the number of  Assistant U.S. Attorneys trained to prosecute IP cases has grown in  recent years (see p. 20).  4.  We agree with DOJ that statistics alone are not sufficient to accurately  show the quality of improvements in IP enforcement activity. This is  why we recommend that DOJ and the other agencies develop IP  enforcement performance measures and targets to more systematically  measure and report on their efforts. While the examples that DOJ  provides of recent enforcement cases are useful illustrations of the  types of enforcement activity that DOJ has undertaken, they do not  provide a complete picture of DOJ\u2019s overall efforts over time. For  example, as we state in our report, agencies including DOJ could  analyze the types of IP cases it most commonly prosecutes or could  report on the number of cases it has prosecuted involving IP crimes  that posed a health and safety risk (see p. 32).  5.  In section B of its letter (pp. 4-5), DOJ addresses the issue of whether  additional IP enforcement resources necessarily result in more IP  prosecutions. On page 5 of its letter, DOJ provides information that  demonstrates a correlation between increased IP resources in two U.S.  Attorney\u2019s Offices and the number of IP cases prosecuted by those  units, but then goes on to state that it would not necessarily conclude,  as it said GAO did, that more prosecutors in a district results in more  prosecutions. We agree that existing data across all U.S Attorney\u2019s  Offices with CHIP units does not necessarily show a high correlation  between increased CHIP unit resources and increased IP prosecutions,  and removed this language. We modified our report to note that  various factors, including crime levels, can affect the level of IP  enforcement activity (see p. 33).  6.  We modified our report to state that DOJ reviewed its data on U.S.", "Attorney\u2019s Office prosecutions when deciding where to place  additional CHIP units. However, at no time during this audit did DOJ  indicate, or provide documentation reflecting, that it routinely  analyzed IP prosecution data by district. We commend DOJ for  examining the fiscal year 2006 IP enforcement activity of two of the  CHIP units. Our analysis of DOJ\u2019s data on IP enforcement activity by  all 94 U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices showed a mix of activity among field  offices across the 6-year period, including those with CHIP units. We  believe that conducting such analysis on a more systematic basis can  better inform DOJ about whether its allocation of resources is  appropriate and not just inform placement of CHIP units.   7.  See comment 5.  8.  We mentioned in the draft report, under our discussion of agency  priorities that DOJ has established some goals related to its IP  enforcement efforts that are contained in an internal agency document  not available to the public (see p. 15). We added information to refer  again to this in our discussion of performance measures (see p. 35).  However, we disagree that DOJ\u2019s Task Force report is replete with  goals and measures. The Task Force report makes multiple  recommendations for improving IP enforcement efforts, but  recommendations are not the same as performance goals, and the  report does not contain performance measures. Moreover, many of  these recommendations are task-oriented actions rather than outcome- oriented. For example, one of DOJ\u2019s Task Force recommendations is  to prosecute aggressively intellectual property offenses that endanger  the public\u2019s health or safety; yet, DOJ does not provide any details on  how they plan to achieve this recommendation and how they will  measure their progress. Further, as we report, DOJ has not taken steps  to capture enforcement statistics to assess their progress in this area.  As we discuss in our report, strategic planning and assessment  requires agencies to articulate outcome-oriented goals and objectives  and to develop performance measures and targets that will enable  them and others to determine whether they are making progress  toward these goals. We added language to our report to better define  outcome-oriented performance measures.  9.  We added information to the report to further explain the challenges  associated with setting performance measures and targets in the law  enforcement area (see p. 35). Our example of a performance measure  and target was not intended to suggest that the agencies should adopt  numerical case quotas or take any steps that would otherwise  negatively affect the quality of their investigations. However, because  it was interpreted in this way, and distracted attention from the more  important discussion of adopting appropriate performance measures  and targets, we removed the example. We continue to believe that DOJ  can develop reasonable and acceptable measures and targets for IP  enforcement.    10.

While we acknowledged in our draft report that setting performance  measures and targets in a law enforcement area is difficult, we added  information to further explain why setting such measures and targets  is a sensitive issue (see p. 35). We continue to believe that setting  performance measures and targets is important, even in the law  enforcement environment. However, because FDA\u2019s primary mission is  to protect public health and safety, we reconsidered our  recommendation that FDA set law enforcement-related measures and  targets, and no longer direct this particular recommendation to FDA.  2.  We modified our report to provide additional information on the  definition of output and outcome performance measures and targets  (see p. 35). Our example of a performance measure and target was not  intended to suggest that the agencies should adopt numerical case  quotas or take any steps that would otherwise negatively affect the  quality of their investigations. However, because it was interpreted in  this way, and distracted attention from the more important discussion  of adopting appropriate performance measures and targets, we  removed the example.    3.  We commend FDA for monitoring the number of criminal  investigations to identify any trends in product areas and to develop an  understanding of the scope of counterfeiting in those areas. FDA  mentioned for the first time in December 2007 that it conducts such  analysis, but given the challenges we faced in obtaining sufficiently  reliable data from all agencies for the period we studied (see appendix  I, pp 48-51), we did not ask FDA to provide this analysis to us. Given  the increasing threat posed by IP-infringing products that affect public  health and safety, we believe it is important that the government  improves its understanding of this threat. Therefore, we modified our  recommendation to ICE, FBI and DOJ that agencies conduct analysis  of their IP enforcement outcomes to also address this recommendation  to FDA and to clarify that such analysis should be done systematically  (see p. 43)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Christine Broderick, Assistant Director; Shirley Brothwell; and Adrienne  Spahr made significant contributions to this report.
