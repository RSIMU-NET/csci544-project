As a result, the Program Manager and key stakeholders have  met all five criteria for addressing our high-risk designation, and we are  removing this issue from our High-Risk List. While this progress is  commendable, it does not mean the government has eliminated all risk  associated with sharing terrorism-related information. It remains  imperative that the Program Manager and key departments and agencies  continue their efforts to advance and sustain ISE.

Following the terrorist attacks of 2001, Congress and the executive  branch took numerous actions aimed explicitly at establishing a range of  new measures to strengthen the nation\u2019s ability to identify, detect, and  deter terrorism-related activities. For example, ISE was established in  accordance with the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of  2004 (Intelligence Reform Act) to facilitate the sharing of terrorism-related  information. Figure 1 depicts the relationship between the various  stakeholders and disciplines involved with the sharing and safeguarding  of terrorism-related information through ISE.", "The Program Manager and key departments and agencies met the  leadership commitment and capacity criteria in 2015, and have  subsequently sustained efforts in both these areas.

Key  departments and agencies also continued to allocate resources to  operations that improve information sharing, including developing better  technical capabilities.", "The Program Manager and key departments and agencies also  developed, generally agreed upon, and executed the 2013 Strategic  Implementation Plan (Implementation Plan), which includes the overall  strategy and more specific planning steps to achieve ISE. Further, they  have demonstrated that various information-sharing initiatives are being  used across multiple agencies as well as state, local, and private-sector  stakeholders. For example, the project manager has developed a  comprehensive framework for managing enterprise architecture to help  share and integrate terrorism-related information among multiple  stakeholders in ISE. Specifically, the Project Interoperability initiative  includes technical resources and other guidance that promote greater  information system compatibility and performance. Furthermore, the key  departments and agencies have applied the concepts of the Project  Interoperability Initiative to improve mission operations by better linking  different law enforcement databases and facilitating better geospatial  analysis, among other things.", "In addition, the Program Manager and key departments and agencies  have continued to devise and implement ways to measure the effect of  ISE on information sharing to address terrorist and other threats to the  homeland. They developed performance metrics for specific information- sharing initiatives (e.g., fusion centers) used by various stakeholders to  receive and share information. The Program Manager and key  departments and agencies have also documented mission-specific  accomplishments (e.g., related to maritime domain awareness) where the  Program Manager helped connect previously incompatible information  systems. The Program Manager has also partnered with DHS to create  an Information Sharing Measure Development Pilot that intends to better  measure the effectiveness of information sharing across all levels of ISE.", "Further, the Program Manager and key departments and agencies have  used the Implementation Plan to track progress, address challenges, and  substantially achieve the objectives in the National Strategy for  Information Sharing and Safeguarding. The Implementation Plan  contains 16 priority objectives, and by the end of fiscal year 2016, 13 of  the 16 priority objectives were completed.

In that report, we determined that two of those  action items\u2014demonstrating that the leadership structure has the needed  authority to leverage participating departments, and updating the vision  for ISE\u2014had been completed. In our 2015 update, we determined that  the Program Manager and key departments had achieved four of the  seven remaining action items\u2014demonstrating that departments are  defining incremental costs and funding; continuing to identify  technological capabilities and services that can be shared collaboratively;  demonstrating that initiatives within individual departments are, or will be,  leveraged to benefit all stakeholders; and demonstrating that  stakeholders generally agree with the strategy, plans, time frames,  responsibilities, and activities for substantially achieving ISE.", "For the 2017 update, we determined that the remaining three action items  have been completed: establishing an enterprise architecture  management capability; demonstrating that the federal government can  show, or is more fully developing a set of metrics to measure, the extent  to which sharing has improved under ISE; and demonstrating that  established milestones and time frames are being used as baselines to  track and monitor progress. Achieving all nine action items has, in effect,  addressed our high-risk criteria.", "While this demonstrates significant and important progress, sharing  terrorism-related information remains a constantly evolving work in  progress that requires continued effort and attention from the Program  Manager, departments, and agencies.

In  addition to DOD\u2019s inventory management, the supply chain management  high-risk area focuses on materiel distribution and asset visibility within  DOD. Based on DOD\u2019s leadership commitment and demonstrated  progress to address weaknesses since 2010, we are removing the  inventory management component from the supply chain management  high-risk area.

Both types of systems are critical to weather forecasters, climatologists,  and the military, who map and monitor changes in weather, climate, the  oceans, and the environment. Federal agencies are planning or executing  major satellite acquisition programs to replace existing polar and  geostationary satellite systems that are nearing or beyond the end of their  expected life spans. The Department of Commerce\u2019s National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is responsible for the polar  satellite program that crosses the equator in the afternoon and for the  nation\u2019s geostationary weather satellite program; DOD is responsible for  the polar satellite program that crosses the equator in the early morning  orbit.", "Over the last several years, we have reported on the potential for a gap in  satellite data between the time that the current satellites are expected to  reach the end of their lifespans and the time when the next satellites are  expected to be in orbit and operational. We added this area to our High- Risk List in 2013. According to NOAA program officials, a satellite data  gap would result in less accurate and timely weather forecasts and  warnings of extreme events\u2014such as hurricanes, storm surges, and  floods. Such degraded forecasts and warnings would endanger lives,  property, and our nation\u2019s critical infrastructures. Similarly, according to  DOD officials, a gap in space-based weather monitoring capabilities could  affect the planning, execution, and sustainment of U.S. military operations  around the world. In our prior high-risk updates, we reported on NOAA\u2019s  efforts to mitigate the risk of a gap in its polar and geostationary satellite  programs.", "With strong congressional support and oversight, NOAA has made  significant progress in its efforts to mitigate the potential for gaps in  weather satellite data on its geostationary weather satellite program.  Specifically, the agency demonstrated strong leadership commitment to  mitigating potential gaps in geostationary satellite data by revising and  improving its gap mitigation/contingency plans. Previously, in December  2014, we reported on shortfalls in the satellite program\u2019s gap  mitigation/contingency plans and made recommendations to NOAA to  address these shortfalls. For example, we noted that the plan did not  sufficiently address  strategies for preventing a launch delay,  timelines and triggers to prevent a launch delay, and whether any of its mitigation strategies would meet minimum  performance levels.", "NOAA agreed with these recommendations and released a new version  of its geostationary satellite contingency plan in February 2015 that  addressed the recommendations, thereby meeting the criterion for having  an action plan.", "We rated capacity as partially met in our 2015 report due to concerns  about NOAA\u2019s ability to complete critical testing activities because it was  already conducting testing on a round-the-clock, accelerated schedule.  Since then, NOAA adjusted its launch schedule to allow time to complete  critical integration and testing activities. In doing so, the agency  demonstrated that it met the capacity criterion.", "NOAA has also met the criterion for demonstrating progress by mitigating  schedule risks and successfully launching the satellite. In September  2013, we reported that the agency had weaknesses in its schedule- management practices on its core ground system and spacecraft. We  made recommendations to address those weaknesses, which included  sequencing all activities, ensuring there are adequate resources for the  activities, and analyzing schedule risks. NOAA agreed with the  recommendations and the Geostationary Operational Environmental  Satellite-R series (GOES-R) program improved its schedule management  practices. By early 2016, the program had improved the links between  remaining activities on the spacecraft schedule, included needed  schedule logic for a greater number of activities on the ground schedule,  and included indications on the ground schedule that the results of a  schedule risk analysis were used in calculating its durations. In addition,  the program successfully launched the GOES-R satellite in November  2016.", "Oversight by Congress has been instrumental in reducing the risk of  geostationary weather satellite gaps. For example, Subcommittees of the  House Science, Space, and Technology Committee held multiple  hearings to provide oversight of the satellite acquisition and the risk of  gaps in satellite coverage.", "As a result, the agency now has a robust constellation of operational and  backup satellites in orbit and has made significant progress in addressing  the risk of a gap in geostationary data coverage.

The  Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) ability to effectively  implement its mission of protecting public health and the environment  is critically dependent on assessing the risks posed by chemicals in a  credible and timely manner. EPA assesses these risks under a variety  of actions, including the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS)  program and EPA\u2019s Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) program.  The IRIS program has made some progress on the capacity,  monitoring, and demonstrated progress criteria. In terms of IRIS  capacity, EPA has partially met this criterion by finalizing a Multi-Year  Agenda to better assess how many people and resources should be  dedicated to the IRIS program. In terms of IRIS monitoring, EPA has  met this criterion in part by using a Chemical Assessment Advisory  Committee to review IRIS assessments, among other actions. In  terms of IRIS demonstrated progress, EPA has partially met this  criterion as of January 2017 by issuing five assessments since fiscal  year 2015.", "The Frank R.

The  new law provides EPA with greater authority and the ability to take  actions that could help EPA implement its mission of protecting  human health and the environment. EPA officials stated that the  agency is better positioned to take action to require chemical  companies to report chemical toxicity and exposure data. Officials  also stated that the new law gives the agency additional authorities,  including the authority to require companies to develop new  information relating to a chemical as necessary for prioritization and  risk evaluation.", "Using both new and previously existing TSCA authorities should  enhance the agency\u2019s ability to gather new information as necessary  to evaluate hazard and exposure risks. Continued leadership  commitment from EPA officials and Congress will be needed to fully  implement reforms.

This information is used to provide updated information for weather  observations and models. However, the department was slow to develop  plans to replace the existing satellites that provide this coverage.  Because DOD delayed establishing plans for its next generation of  weather satellites, there is a risk of a satellite data gap in the early  morning orbit.", "The last satellite that the department launched in 2014 called Defense  Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)-19, stopped providing recorded  data used in weather models in February 2016. A prior satellite, called  DMSP-17, is now the primary satellite operating in the early morning orbit.  However, this satellite, which was launched in 2006, is operating with  limitations due to the age of its instruments.

The Weather System Follow-on\u2014Microwave program does not  address these two highest-priority capabilities and the department has not  yet determined its long-term plans for providing these capabilities. As a  result, the department will need to continue to rely on the older DMSP-17  satellite until its new satellite becomes operational in 2022, and it  establishes and implements plans to address the high-priority capabilities  that the new satellite will not address. Given the age of the DMSP-17  satellite and uncertainty on how much longer it will last, the department  could face a gap in critical satellite data.", "In August 2016, DOD reported to Congress its near-term plans to address  potential satellite data gaps. These plans include a greater reliance on  international partner capabilities, exploring options to move a  geostationary satellite over an affected region, and plans to explore  options for acquiring and fielding new equipment, such as satellites and  satellite components to provide the capabilities. In addition, the  department anticipates that the demonstration satellite to be developed  as a precursor to the Weather System Follow-on\u2014Microwave program  could help mitigate a potential gap by providing some useable data.

In response, in May 2010, the Department of the  Interior (Interior) first reorganized its offshore oil and gas management  activities into separate offices for revenue collection, under the Office of  Natural Resources Revenue, and energy development and regulatory  oversight, under the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation  and Enforcement. Later, in October 2011, Interior further reorganized its  energy development and regulatory oversight activities when it  established two new bureaus to oversee offshore resources and  operational compliance with environmental and safety requirements. The  new Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is responsible for  leasing and approving offshore development plans while the new Bureau  of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) is responsible for lease  operations, safety, and enforcement.", "In 2011, we added Interior\u2019s management of federal oil and gas resources  to the High-Risk List based on three concerns: (1) Interior did not have  reasonable assurance that it was collecting its share of billions of dollars  of revenue from federal oil and gas resources; (2) Interior continued to  experience problems hiring, training, and retaining sufficient staff to  oversee and manage federal oil and gas resources; and (3) Interior was  engaged in restructuring its oil and gas program, which is inherently  challenging, and there were questions about whether Interior had the  capacity to reorganize while carrying out its range of responsibilities,  especially in a constrained resource environment.", "Immediately after reorganizing, Interior developed memorandums and  standard operating procedures to define roles and responsibilities, and  facilitate and formalize coordination between BOEM and BSEE. Interior  also revised polices intended to improve its oversight of offshore oil and  gas activities, such as new requirements designed to mitigate the risk of a  subsea well blowout or spill. In 2013, we determined that progress had  been made, because Interior had fundamentally completed reorganizing  its oversight of offshore oil and gas activities. As a result, in 2013, we  removed the reorganization segment from this high-risk area.", "However, in February 2016, we reported that BSEE had undertaken  various reform efforts since its creation in 2011, but had not fully  addressed deficiencies in its investigative, environmental compliance, and  enforcement capabilities identified by investigations after the Deepwater  Horizon incident.", "BSEE\u2019s ongoing restructuring has made limited progress enhancing the  bureau\u2019s investigative capabilities. BSEE continues to use pre\u2013 Deepwater Horizon incident policies and procedures. Specifically, BSEE  has not completed a policy outlining investigative responsibilities or  updated procedures for investigating incidents\u2014among the goals of  BSEE\u2019s restructuring, according to restructuring planning documents, and  consistent with federal standards for internal control. The use of outdated  investigative policies and procedures is a long-standing deficiency. Post\u2013 Deepwater Horizon incident investigations found that Interior\u2019s policies  and procedures did not require it to plan investigations, gather and  document evidence, and ensure quality control, and determined that  continuing to use them posed a risk to the effectiveness of bureau  investigations. Without completing and updating its investigative policies  and procedures, BSEE continues to face this risk.", "BSEE\u2019s ongoing restructuring of its environmental compliance program  reverses actions taken to address post\u2013Deepwater Horizon incident  concerns, and risks weakening the bureau\u2019s environmental compliance  oversight capabilities. In 2011, in response to two post\u2013Deepwater  Horizon incident investigations that found that BSEE\u2019s predecessor\u2019s  focus on oil and gas development might have been at the expense of  protecting the environment, BSEE created an environmental oversight  division with region-based staff reporting directly to the headquarters- based division chief instead of regional management. This reporting  structure was to help ensure that environmental issues received  appropriate weight and consideration within the bureau.", "Under the restructuring, since February 2015, field-based environmental  compliance staff again report to their regional directors. BSEE\u2019s rationale  for this action is unclear, as it was not documented or analyzed as part of  the bureau\u2019s restructuring planning. Under federal standards for internal  control, management is to assess the risks posed by external and internal  sources and decide what actions to take to mitigate them. Without  assessing the risk of reversing its reporting structure, Interior cannot be  sure that BSEE will have reasonable assurance that environmental issues  are receiving the appropriate weight and consideration, as called for by  post\u2013Deepwater Horizon incident investigations.", "When we reviewed BSEE\u2019s environmental compliance program, we found  that the interagency agreements between Interior and EPA designed to  coordinate water quality monitoring under the National Pollutant  Discharge Elimination System were decades old. According to BSEE  annual environmental compliance activity reports, the agreements may  not reflect the agency\u2019s current resources and needs. For example, a  1989 agreement stipulates that Interior shall inspect no more than 50  facilities on behalf of EPA per year, and shall not conduct water sampling  on behalf of EPA. Almost 30 years later, after numerous changes in  drilling practices and technologies, it is unclear whether inspecting no  more than 50 facilities per year is sufficient to monitor water quality.", "Nevertheless, senior BSEE officials told us that the bureau has no plans  to update its agreements with EPA, and some officials said that a  previous headquarters-led effort to update the agreements was not  completed because it did not sufficiently describe the bureau\u2019s offshore oil  and gas responsibilities. According to Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government, as programs change and agencies strive to improve  operational processes and adopt new technologies, management officials  must continually assess and evaluate internal controls to ensure that  control activities are effective and updated when necessary.", "BSEE\u2019s ongoing restructuring has made limited progress in enhancing its  enforcement capabilities. In particular, BSEE has not developed  procedures with criteria to guide how it uses enforcement tools\u2014such as  warnings and fines\u2014which are among the goals of BSEE\u2019s restructuring,  according to planning documents, and consistent with federal standards  for internal control. BSEE restructuring plans state that the current lack of  criteria causes BSEE to act inconsistently, which makes oil and gas  industry operators uncertain about BSEE\u2019s oversight approach and  expectations. The absence of enforcement climate criteria is a long- standing deficiency. For example, post\u2013Deepwater Horizon incident  investigations recommended BSEE assess its enforcement tools and how  to employ them to deter safety and environmental violations. Without  developing procedures with defined criteria for taking enforcement  actions, BSEE continues to face risks to the effectiveness of its  enforcement capabilities.", "To enhance Interior\u2019s oversight of oil and gas development, we  recommended in February 2016 that the Secretary of the Interior direct  the Director of BSEE to take the following nine actions as it continues to  restructure.", "To address risks to the effectiveness of BSEE\u2019s investigations,  environmental compliance, and enforcement capabilities, we  recommended that BSEE complete policies outlining the  responsibilities of investigations, environmental compliance, and  enforcement programs, and update and develop procedures to guide  them.", "To enhance its investigative capabilities, we recommended that BSEE establish a capability to review investigation policy and collect and  analyze incidents to identify trends in safety and environmental  hazards; develop a plan with milestones for implementing the case  management system for investigations;  clearly communicate the purpose of BSEE\u2019s investigations  program to industry operators; and  clarify policies and procedures for assigning panel investigation  membership and referring cases of suspected criminal  wrongdoing to the Inspector General.", "To enhance its environmental compliance capabilities, we  conduct and document a risk analysis of the regional-based  reporting structure of its Environmental Compliance Division,  including actions to mitigate any identified risks;  coordinate with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection  Agency to consider the relevance of existing interagency  agreements for monitoring operator compliance with National  Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits on the Outer  Continental Shelf and, if necessary, update agreements to reflect  current oversight needs; and develop a plan to address documented environmental oversight  staffing needs.", "To enhance its enforcement capabilities, we recommended that BSEE  develop a mechanism to ensure that it reviews the maximum daily  civil penalty and adjusts it to reflect changes in the Consumer Price  Index within the time frames established by statute.", "In its written comments, Interior agreed that additional reforms\u2014such as  documented policies and procedures\u2014are needed to address offshore oil  and gas oversight deficiencies, but Interior neither agreed nor disagreed  with our specific recommendations.

The federal  government has directly or indirectly supported more than two-thirds  of the value of new mortgage originations in the single-family housing  market since the beginning of the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  Mortgages with federal support include those backed by Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac, two large government-sponsored enterprises (the  enterprises). Out of concern that their deteriorating financial condition  threatened the stability of financial markets, the Federal Housing  Finance Agency (FHFA) placed the enterprises into federal  conservatorship in 2008, creating an explicit fiscal exposure for the  federal government. As of September 2016, the Department of the  Treasury (Treasury) had provided about $187.5 billion in funds as  capital support to the enterprises, with an additional $258.1 billion  available to the enterprises should they need further assistance. In  accordance with the terms of agreements with Treasury, the  enterprises had paid dividends to Treasury totaling about $250.5  billion through September 2016.", "More than 8 years after entering conservatorship, the enterprises\u2019  futures remain uncertain and billions of federal dollars remain at risk.  The enterprises have a reduced capacity to absorb future losses due  to a capital reserve amount that falls to $0 by 2018. Without a capital  reserve, any quarterly losses\u2014including those due to market  fluctuations and not necessarily to economic conditions\u2014would  require the enterprises to draw additional funds from Treasury.  Additionally, prolonged conservatorships and a change in leadership  at FHFA could shift priorities for the conservatorships, which in turn  could send mixed messages and create uncertainties for market  participants and hinder the development of the broader secondary  mortgage market. For this reason, we said in November 2016 that  Congress should consider legislation establishing objectives for the  future federal role in housing finance, including the structure of the  enterprises, and a transition plan to a reformed housing finance  system that enables the enterprises to exit conservatorship.", "The federal government also supports mortgages through insurance  or guarantee programs, the largest of which is administered by the  Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Federal Housing  Administration (FHA).

This  information is used to apportion the seats of the U.S. House of  Representatives; realign the boundaries of the legislative districts of each  state; allocate billions of dollars in federal financial assistance; and  provide social, demographic, and economic profiles of the nation\u2019s people  to guide policy decisions at each level of government. A complete count  of the nation\u2019s population is an enormous challenge as the Bureau seeks  to control the cost of the census while it implements several new  innovations and manages the processes of acquiring and developing new  and modified IT systems supporting them. Over the past 3 years, we have  made 30 recommendations to help the Bureau design and implement a  more cost-effective census for 2020; however, only 6 of them had been  fully implemented as of January 2017.", "The cost of the census, in terms of cost for counting each housing unit,  has been escalating over the last several decennials. The 2010 Census  was the costliest U.S. Census in history at about $12.3 billion, and was  about 31 percent more costly than the $9.4 billion cost of the 2000  Census (in 2020 dollars). The average cost for counting a housing unit  increased from about $16 in 1970 to around $92 in 2010 (in 2020  constant dollars). Meanwhile, the return of census questionnaires by mail  (the primary mode of data collection) declined over this period from 78  percent in 1970 to 63 percent in 2010. Declining mail response rates\u2014a  key indicator of a cost-effective census\u2014are significant and lead to higher  costs. This is because the Bureau sends enumerators to each  nonresponding household to obtain census data. As a result,  nonresponse follow-up is the Bureau\u2019s largest and most costly field  operation. In many ways, the Bureau has had to invest substantially more  resources each decade to match the results of prior enumerations.", "The Bureau plans to implement several new innovations in its design of  the 2020 Census. In response to our recommendations regarding past  decennial efforts and other assessments, the Bureau has fundamentally  reexamined its approach for conducting the 2020 Census. Its plan for  2020 includes four broad innovation areas that it believes will save it over  $5 billion (2020 constant dollars) when compared to what it estimates  conducting the census with traditional methods would cost. The Bureau\u2019s  innovations include (1) using the Internet as a self-response option, which  the Bureau has never done on a large scale before; (2) verifying most  addresses using \u201cin-office\u201d procedures and on-screen imagery rather than  street-by-street field canvassing; (3) re-engineering data collection  methods such as by relying on an automated case management system;  and (4) in certain instances, replacing enumerator collection of data with  administrative records (information already provided to federal and state  governments as they administer other programs). These innovations  show promise for a more cost-effective head count. However, they also  introduce new risks, in part, because they include new procedures and  technology that have not been used extensively in earlier decennials, if at  all.", "The Bureau is also managing the acquisition and development of new  and modified IT systems, which add complexity to the design of the  census. To help control census costs, the Bureau plans to significantly  change the methods and technology it uses to count the population, such  as offering an option for households to respond to the survey via the  Internet or phone, providing mobile devices for field enumerators to  collect survey data from households, and automating the management of  field operations. This redesign relies on acquiring and developing many  new and modified IT systems, which could add complexity to the design.", "These cost risks, new innovations, and acquisition and development of IT  systems for the 2020 Census, along with other challenges we have  identified in recent years, raise serious concerns about the Bureau\u2019s  ability to conduct a cost-effective enumeration.

It must also rigorously test individual  census-taking activities to provide information on their feasibility and  performance, their potential for achieving desired results, and the extent  to which they are able to function together under full operational  conditions.", "We have recommended that the Bureau also ensure that its scheduling  adheres to leading practices and be able to support a quantitative  schedule risk assessment, such as by having all activities associated with  the levels of resources and effort needed to complete them.

To  this end, we recommended the Bureau ensure that the methodologies for  answering the Internet response rate and IT infrastructure research  questions are determined and documented in time to inform key design  decisions. Further, given the numerous and critical dependencies  between the Census Enterprise Data Collection and Processing and 2020  Census programs, their parallel implementation tracks, and the 2020  Census\u2019s immovable deadline, we recommended that the Bureau  establish a comprehensive and integrated list of all interdependent risks  facing the two programs, and clearly identify roles and responsibilities for  managing this list. The Bureau stated that it plans to take actions to  address our recommendations.", "It is also critical for the Bureau to have better oversight and control over  its cost estimation process and we have recommended that the Bureau  ensure its cost estimate is consistent with our leading practices. For  example, the Bureau will need to, among other practices, document all  cost-influencing assumptions; describe estimating methodologies used for  each cost element; ensure that variances between planned and actual  cost are documented, explained, and reviewed; and include a  comprehensive sensitivity analysis, so that it can better estimate costs.  We also recommended that the Bureau implement and institutionalize  processes or methods for ensuring control over how risk and uncertainty  are accounted for and communicated within its cost estimation process.

The review contained three  recommendations to address the development of quality metrics, but the  PAC has only partially implemented those recommendations. We  previously reported that the executive branch had developed some  metrics to assess quality at different phases of the personnel security  clearance process; however, those metrics had not been fully developed  and implemented.", "The development of metrics to assess quality throughout the security  clearance process has been a long-standing concern. Since the late  1990s we have emphasized the need to build and monitor quality  throughout the personnel security clearance process. In 2009, we again  noted that clearly defined quality metrics can improve the security  clearance process by enhancing oversight of the time required to process  security clearances and the quality of the investigation and adjudicative  decisions. We recommended that OMB provide Congress with results of  metrics on comprehensive timeliness and the quality of investigations and  adjudications. According to ODNI, in October 2016, ODNI began  implementation of a Quality Assessment and Reporting Tool to document  customer issues with background investigations.
