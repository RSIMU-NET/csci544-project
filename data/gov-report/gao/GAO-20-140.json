GAO substantiated about $8 billion in savings, and found that USPS's cost savings estimates are likely overstated because they do not fully account for changes in work hours or tenure of employees. Also, USPS did not account for other costs such as increased turnover rates among lower-paid employees. USPS lacks guidance on what factors to consider in its cost savings estimates, and as a result may make future changes to employee compensation based on incomplete information.", "Changes to employee compensation that would require legislative change could save USPS billions, but the amount saved is dependent on USPS overcoming implementation challenges. If USPS could reduce delivery frequency and associated work hours, GAO estimated USPS could save billions a year. However, other recent USPS reductions in service have not fully achieved planned work hour reductions due to, among other things, issues with management of work hours and lack of union agreement.

These changes were  negotiated with the four unions representing the majority of postal  employees and established in CBAs. According to USPS management  officials, these actions were intended to decrease compensation costs  and increase workforce flexibility, which were necessary responses to  declining letter mail volume and revenue, growth in more labor-intensive  package volume, and increases in the number of delivery addresses. We  report USPS\u2019s estimates, and our estimates, of how much these changes  saved in employee compensation costs below; we further describe the  differences between the two estimates in the next section. For additional  technical details about our analysis, see appendix I.  1.  Lowering Pay for New Career Employees: Beginning in 2010,  USPS implemented a negotiated lower starting pay for new career  employees. More specifically, career employees hired after a  specified date have lower starting pay than previously hired career  employees. For example, a city carrier hired in January 2016 would  make about $37,640 a year compared to $48,406 a year if hired  before the new starting pay agreement. USPS estimated about $2.3  billion in savings for fiscal years 2016 through 2018 as a result of this  effort. We were not able to substantiate the estimated savings  because USPS could only provide individual data for fiscal years 2016  through 2018, which were not enough data to develop comparison  groups for employees hired before and after the pay rate change.  2.  Increasing Use of Non-career Employees: In 2010 and 2011, USPS  negotiated the ability to hire up to 20 percent of the workforce as non- career employees; the prior limit had been 10 percent for most  employee types. USPS officials told us they also changed some  work rules so that USPS could use non-career employees for some  tasks previously only allowed for career employees. Non-career  employees are less costly because they generally have lower pay  rates and are not entitled to the full federal benefits received by career  workers. According to USPS officials, non-career employees are  also \u201cmore flexible\u201d because there are fewer restrictions on their tasks  and schedules. For example, USPS management officials told us that  they use non-career employees for much of the Sunday package  delivery service and to make extra trips needed to deliver packages to  meet service targets. USPS estimated that increased use of non- career employees saved about $8.2 billion in compensation costs  since fiscal year 2016, but our analysis found that USPS likely saved  about $6.6 billion from fiscal years 2016 through 2018 from this effort.  3.  Reducing Contribution for Employee Health Insurance  Premiums: USPS decreased its contribution percentage for  employee health insurance premiums from 84 and 85 percent in 2008  to 74 percent in 2018. Based on its recent agreement with NRLCA,  USPS\u2019s contribution will decrease from 73 percent in 2019 to 72  percent in 2020. In past CBAs with the three other unions (APWU,  NALC, and NPMHU), negotiations over USPS contributions to health  insurance premiums followed those agreed to by NRLCA. USPS  officials estimated that USPS\u2019s reduced contribution percentage to  employee health insurance premiums has saved about $1.6 billion  across the types of postal employees from fiscal years 2016 through  2018. However, our analysis found that USPS likely saved about $1.4  billion for the three-year period.", "Although USPS was able to decrease its share of the health  insurance premium to achieve a larger saving in fiscal year 2018 than  in fiscal year 2017, overall USPS expenditures for its share of  employee health insurance premiums did not decrease due to annual  increases in premiums. USPS reported that employee health benefits  expenses increased from $5.0 billion in 2016 to $5.2 billion in 2018,  even as its share of premium costs decreased from 76 percent to 74  percent for employees covered by the CBAs during the same  period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Although USPS Saved Billions, Its Estimates Potentially Overstate Savings Because USPS Did Not Account for Various Factors", "paragraphs": ["Across all of its efforts, USPS estimated it saved approximately $12 billion  for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. While there are multiple valid  approaches for estimating cost savings based on policy changes, we  found that USPS did not account for some significant factors and,  therefore, potentially overstated the savings achieved. Specifically, USPS  did not account for the effects of changes in work hours or tenure of  employees. When we accounted for these additional factors, we were  able to substantiate $8 billion, of USPS\u2019s estimated $9.7 billion, in savings  over the last three fiscal years for changes to the number of non-career  employees and health insurance contributions. As noted above, we  were not able to substantiate the estimated savings of lowering pay for  new career employees.

According to  USPS, use of overtime and premium hours enables it to meet irregular  work demands (for example, spikes in volume resulting from holidays) or  delivery performance targets, particularly for Sunday package delivery.  Also, to incentivize or compensate employees for working extra or  traditionally less desirable hours, USPS routinely uses overtime and other  premium pay, such as additional pay for work at night and on Sundays.  As a result, these types of work hours cost more to compensate than  regular work hours (i.e., straight time hours) on a per hour basis.", "When calculating the savings it achieved from using lower-paid  employees, USPS compared what it actually paid in compensation to  estimates of what it would have paid in the absence of having non-career  or lower-paid workers, using average pay rates and not individual level  employee data. USPS\u2019s method therefore did not fully account for the mix  of types of hours worked in its estimates. As a result, USPS  underestimated how much the lower-paid employees are compensated in  its cost estimates. Our analysis of the last three years of data found that  lower-paid employees work a different mix of hours, and overall they work  more hours and more premium hours, factors that USPS does not  capture in its estimates. For example, from our analysis of USPS payroll  data, we found that, on average: a non-career employee worked 30 more straight hours, 73 more  overtime hours, and 23 more night and Sunday hours per year than a  career employee, and a lower-paid career employee worked a higher number of straight time  hours and, depending on the craft, also may work more overtime,  night work, and Sunday hours than a higher-paid career employee.", "USPS officials said it was not necessary to factor in work hours because  the amount of work hours was not changed by introducing lower-paid  employees. For example, USPS officials told us that, to meet the increase  in packages, more carrier work hours were needed in recent years, to  make deliveries on Sundays for instance. USPS officials also noted that  to save costs, it is preferable that these hours go to lower-paid  employees.", "However, our analysis suggests that lower-paid employees may work  different amounts and mixes of work hours than higher paid employees.  For example, newer, lower-paid employees may be more willing to work  extra hours, and being newer, their inexperience could mean that they  take longer to complete their work on average. USPS management  officials said that they do not believe newer employees are less  productive than more experienced employees, nor do they lead to  increases in overall work hours. USPS management officials also told us  that employees cannot opt into working more hours because overtime  hours are assigned as necessary by supervisors. Our analysis did not  include information that would allow us to determine whether  management was pre-approving all overtime hours. However, in June  2019, the USPS OIG reported $136.6 million in unauthorized overtime\u2014 which occurs when an employee\u2019s clock time exceeds eight hours without  prior approval\u2014for mail processing alone.", "USPS has saved billions by using a less costly and more flexible  workforce. Indeed, based on fiscal year 2018 data, we calculated that  USPS could potentially save up to an additional $4.4 billion a year if the  current cap on non-career employees was doubled to 40 percent.  However, USPS did not fully evaluate the impact of pay rates and work  hours by employees. Given the growth in work hours, particularly  overtime and premium pay hours, USPS risks overestimating savings and  making ill-informed changes to employee compensation by not including  information about employee work hours."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tenure of Employees", "paragraphs": ["USPS employees with longer tenure generally receive higher pay than  similar employees with less tenure. Based on our analysis of USPS  payroll data for fiscal year 2018, the average pay of career employees is  driven in part by the high median tenure of those employees, which was  20 years (with a median age of 54 years old) in fiscal year 2018.", "However, when calculating its savings estimates for non-career  employees, USPS did not factor in the effect of employee tenure.  Specifically, USPS\u2019s savings estimate for non-career employees  compared what it was paying for a newly hired non-career employee  against the average pay for a career employee, rather than the starting  pay for a career employee. When we accounted for tenure in our  analysis, we found that some of the savings from hiring new employees  could be explained by the shorter tenure of the lower-paid employees.  USPS officials told us that they agreed that tenure should have been  taken into account and that they would recalculate these estimates.  Without adjusting for mix of hours worked and tenure, we found the  difference in pay between career and non-career employees to be, on  average, $25 per hour. After adjusting for tenure and mix of workhours,  we found the difference in pay to be, on average, $8.27 per hour.", "There are a variety of acceptable methods for conducting cost savings  estimates, but all estimates should include all the relevant factors driving  costs and be clearly documented.

The  report noted that a high number of vacancies affected carriers\u2019 ability to  complete their routes on time, contributing to excess overtime and penalty  overtime. USPS officials stated that with very few exceptions USPS has  had little trouble attracting applicants to non-career positions. One  example of an exception USPS officials provided was that in fiscal year  2018 USPS increased pay for non-career seasonal holiday workers to  make it more competitive. USPS and postal union officials also told us  that USPS had trouble specifically hiring truck drivers at the non-career  pay scale. In addition to lower pay compared to the private sector, a high  demand for drivers and low unemployment rates across the industry has  made it challenging for USPS to find enough qualified drivers. In  addition to the lower wages, USPS and postal union officials stated that  the unpredictable non-career employee work schedules, as well as low  unemployment rates, have created additional challenges for recruiting  qualified non-career employees.

According to USPS, the  average monthly turnover rate for non-career employees has decreased  from 3.57 percent in fiscal year 2016 to 3.08 percent in fiscal year 2017  and 3.02 percent in fiscal year 2018. USPS officials told us that USPS  strives to keep the turnover rate as low as possible and that overall,  postal employees voluntarily leave their jobs at a lower rate than in the  private sector. According to two postal union estimates, it costs USPS  about $4,000 to $7,000 to hire and train new employees.

New career  employees were converted from the pool of non-career employees, who  had a lower pay rate than the new career employees, thus getting an  equivalent of a pay raise and more benefits. However, USPS provided us  with its analysis showing that the turnover rate for career employees with  a lower pay rate (average of 4.21 percent per month) was higher than for  career employees with a higher pay rate (average of 0.36 percent per  month) in fiscal year 2018.", "According to postal union officials and USPS OIG, decreases in pay and  lack of work schedule flexibility have resulted in some negative effects on  morale that increased turnover of non-career employees.

Union officials also told us  that some non-career employees do not receive the necessary training  but are expected to perform their jobs correctly from the start.

In contrast, other  employees leave USPS voluntarily for higher paid, or less difficult, work  elsewhere.

Under that scenario, USPS has reported  estimated savings of $1.4 to $1.8 billion a year.", "The 2018 Task Force report recommended that USPS be given increased  delivery flexibility by allowing USPS to determine delivery frequency.  Additional flexibility could result in a range of alternatives. For example,  USPS could deliver to addresses every other day (three or four days a  week) with optional dynamic routing as necessary up to an additional two  days a week, and could potentially save more than 16 percent. USPS has  begun to introduce technology and other options within its package  handling that might alleviate undue burden caused by such a large  decrease in service. For example, USPS now offers informed delivery,  which is an email that is sent to mail recipients with pictures of their mail  that is to be delivered, and enables people to have better insight into what  to expect and when. In 2018, we reported that USPS was piloting keyless  parcel lockers where customers could independently pick up their  packages; it is possible similar types of backups could be provided for  letters.", "Regardless of the delivery frequency, reducing mail carrier hours is more  likely to come through a decrease in non-career employee hours. USPS  reports that non-career employees are temporary in nature and can be  laid off; therefore, it would be easier to implement hour reductions in this  pool of employees. In contrast, if USPS were to reduce hours for career  employees, savings would accrue more slowly over time, because career  employees\u2019 are usually covered by no lay-off clauses in their CBAs, and  with low turnover rates, USPS would need employees to leave voluntarily.

In 2016, we found that this effort likely resulted in less  savings than USPS had estimated. According to USPS officials, this  is, in part, because USPS had to revise its plan after a union  grievance and arbitrator award required it to change the way it was  staffing post offices. We also reported concerns with USPS\u2019s  methodology for determining work hour and compensation savings.  Overall, while USPS likely achieved an overall reduction in work hours  at thousands of post offices, we found the accuracy of the saving may  have been limited by errors we identified. For example, among other  issues, we found that USPS had not included the increase in  workload, and associated costs, from increasing the number of  remotely managed post offices.", "Distribution of volume: Any reduction of delivery frequency would  require USPS to re-distribute its mail volume to the remaining delivery  days. In 2010, USPS recommended eliminating Saturday delivery and re- distributing the mail volume from Saturday to the delivery days Monday  through Friday, though USPS continues to deliver mail on Saturdays.  USPS stated that the additional volume in the remaining delivery days  would result in higher mail carrier productivity. However, we reported in  2011 that USPS\u2019s ability to efficiently absorb the cost of transferred  workload from Saturday to weekdays is a key factor in determining  potential cost savings.", "Meeting Delivery Needs: Another challenge to reducing delivery  frequency is that it could reduce the demand and value of USPS products  if customers are not getting their delivery needs met.

The direct effect implies that  a pay cut reduces the total wages paid. For example, a 10 percent  reduction in pay should reduce the total wage paid by 10 percent, other  things constant. However, workers who face pay cuts may exhibit  responses to wage cuts that include: adjusting hours worked, adjusting  their level of effort for each hour of work. These responses may negate or  reinforce additional savings from a wage cut and are examples of indirect  effects of wage cuts.", "Workers may adjust the hours of work from changes in wages, as these  wage changes produce to both substitution and income effects on hours  worked. The Substitution Effect implies that a pay cut reduces the  incentive for employees to work because each hour of work generates  less money than it did before, decreasing the opportunity cost of leisure  (the time spent not working for pay), holding income constant. Thus a  reduction in pay could lead to additional reductions in work hours that  employees are willing to supply. Consequently, the reduction in pay may  lead to additional savings for USPS in its labor costs from the substitution  effect. In contrast, the Income Effect implies that a pay cut reduces the  income of the worker; this reduction in income induces the employee to  work more hours because the employee feels poorer. The income effect  would therefore increase the hours worked, and could lead to reductions  in savings for USPS. Income and substitution effects generally run in  opposite directions, and uncertainty regarding which effect will dominate  determines the overall effect on hours worked.", "A recent review of the literature from the Congressional Budget Office  finds that combined hour elasticities that incorporate both income and  substitution effects range between 0 and 0.2. These combined hours  elasticities would suggest that a 10 percent cut in wages would reduce  hours between zero and 2 percent (0.2*10%). While we are aware that  the estimates from the general population may not extend to the USPS  workforce, we provide the above example for illustrative purposes. While  the effect on workhours from a change in wages may appear small, given  the overall hours serviced by USPS each year \u2013 adjustments in hours  arising from wage cuts may produce nontrivial changes in USPS  compensation costs.", "Changes in wage rates may change workers\u2019 morale, and consequently  the effort workers exert during work hours. Economic literature finds that  wage cuts can impact on the effort workers provide, and that productivity  may fall. For example, workers may exert less effort in an attempt to  punish the employer for the wage cut, or they may be less worried about  job loss because the cost of losing a job is lower after a wage cut.", "It is important to note that wage cuts may also induce some individuals to  leave the USPS workforce altogether. Estimates of participation  elasticities in the literature range between zero and 0.2. Participation  elasticities capture the percentage change in the share of the population  that is working resulting from a 1 percent change in wage rates. These  estimate elasticities would imply that a 10 percent wage cut could be met  with a reduction in the USPS workforce between 0 and 2 percent.
