One of the most significant changes affecting these centers has been the move by states to prepaid managed care delivery systems.

Patient fees are set using a sliding fee schedule that is tied to federal poverty levels. Patients with incomes below a certain percentage of the federal poverty level receive free care or may pay some portion\u2014a discounted fee\u2014while those in the highest income levels pay fees that cover the full service charge.

The first is the authorization of a cost-based reimbursement system for health centers and the second is centers\u2019 participation in prepaid managed care. In the late 1980s, the Congress recognized that neither Medicare nor Medicaid paid the full cost for services provided to program beneficiaries at community health centers. This was due to low reimbursement rates and because some enabling services provided by health centers were not considered as reimbursable benefits by Medicaid. As a result, health centers had fewer financial resources to subsidize care for patients who could not pay and for conducting other program activities. In recognition of this problem, the Congress\u2014as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA )\u2014created a new Medicaid and Medicare cost-based reimbursement system for health centers. Under this system, both programs were required to reimburse health centers for the reasonable cost of medical and enabling services provided to their beneficiaries.", "The second major development has been the move by states to managed care delivery systems for their Medicaid programs to address rising costs and access problems. Managed care in Medicaid is not a single health care delivery plan but a continuum of models that share a common approach. At one end of the continuum are prepaid or capitated models that pay health organizations a per capita amount each month to provide or arrange for all covered services. At the other end are primary care case management (PCCM) models, which are similar to traditional fee-for-service arrangements except that providers receive a per capita management fee to coordinate a patient\u2019s care in addition to reimbursement for the services they provide. Both systems require that beneficiaries access care through a primary care provider. Between June 1993 and June 1994, the total number of Medicaid beneficiaries in managed care programs across the country increased 57 percent, from almost 5 million to nearly 8 million, with most of the growth occurring in fully capitated managed care programs.", "Health centers may not be as assured that capitated reimbursement will cover their costs as they are under traditional Medicaid fee-for-service systems. This becomes a concern when health centers lose their cost-based reimbursement under Medicaid prepaid managed care programs. Health plans that contract with centers reimburse them on the basis of a negotiated per capita rate for a set of services. This capitation rate must be sufficient to cover the cost of the contracted services for all Medicaid health plan members enrolled at the health center. Incorrect assumptions about the cost of individual services or the frequency with which they are used may result in an inadequate capitation rate. If the rate is too low, it can lead to financial losses for the centers.", "States establishing managed care programs that require beneficiaries to enroll in a Medicaid health plan must obtain one of two types of waivers from the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). Section 1115 of the Social Security Act offers authority to waive a broad range of Medicaid requirements. Eight states have approved statewide 1115 waivers, and 12 others have waiver proposals pending with HCFA. A second type of waiver is allowed by section 1915(b) of the Social Security Act. These waivers allow states to carry out competitive programs by waiving specific program requirements, such as a beneficiary\u2019s choice of provider. Currently, 37 states and the District of Columbia have 1915(b) waivers and 4 other states have pending waivers.", "The loss of cost-based reimbursement is a major concern for health centers entering into prepaid capitated agreements. These health centers are concerned that (1) the per capita monthly rate may not adequately cover the costs of providing services to the most vulnerable populations and (2) the lack of reimbursement by health plans for some medical, enabling, or other health services may hinder their ability to continue to provide them."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Health Centers Participating in Managed Care Continue to Provide Medical and Enabling Services to Their Communities", "paragraphs": ["Changes in the health care delivery environment are impacting community health centers as more and more health centers participate in prepaid managed care arrangements. In our review of 10 health centers, we found that prepaid reimbursement for services provided to Medicaid patients did not diminish the centers\u2019 ability to provide access to care for their patients. In fact, health centers have improved their overall financial positions to some degree while maintaining or expanding medical and enabling services. This is due to revenue increases from a variety of sources, such as federal funding other than health center grants. Earnings from prepaid managed care were modest and did not contribute significantly to the support of enabling services and subsidized care. Some center officials, however, credited the predictability of monthly capitation payments as assisting them in financial planning. Using another measure to determine financial vulnerability\u2014cash balances\u2014all 10 centers had limited cash balances. For centers with more than 15 percent of their total revenue from prepaid managed care, low cash balances could be a problem if they encounter significant unexpected expenses resulting from inadequate capitation rates or assumption of risk for nonprimary care services."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Increasing Participation in Prepaid Managed Care", "paragraphs": ["In response to the changing health care environment, the number of health centers accepting capitated payments for their Medicaid patients grew from 92 health centers, with 280,000 prepaid patients in 1991, to 115 centers with nearly 435,000 prepaid patients in 1993. Health centers often feel pressure to enter into managed care arrangements when states implement such programs on a mandatory or voluntary basis statewide. Five of the 10 health centers we visited operate in areas where Medicaid beneficiaries are mandated to participate in prepaid managed care plans under Medicaid waivers. Increasingly, health centers also choose to participate in areas with voluntary programs. Whether mandatory or not, health center participation is driven by the growing importance of the Medicaid program to health center revenues. In 1993, Medicaid revenues accounted for 17 percent to over 50 percent of health center revenues at the centers we visited. In addition, between 1989 and 1993, 6 of the 10 health centers experienced an increase in the ratio of Medicaid revenues to total revenues. At the same time, 9 health centers experienced a decrease in the amount that federal community health center project grants represented of total revenues. ,8 (See fig. 1.)", "Except for Sunshine Health Center and Lynn Community Health Center, which received, respectively, 22 and 17 percent of their revenues in 1993 from other federal grants, contracts, or both, the remaining health centers received less than 7 percent of their revenues directly from other federal grants.", "Some of these health centers have also increased the percentage of their revenues from other income sources, such as state and local grants or other federal grants.", "Except for Sunshine Health Center and Lynn Community Health Center, which received, respectively, 22 and 17 percent of their revenues in 1993 from other federal grants, contracts, or both, the remaining health centers received less than 7 percent of their revenues directly from other federal grants.", "Some of these health centers have also increased the percentage of their revenues from other income sources, such as state and local grants or other federal grants.", "Except for Sunshine Health Center and Lynn Community Health Center, which received, respectively, 22 and 17 percent of their revenues in 1993 from other federal grants, contracts, or both, the remaining health centers received less than 7 percent of their revenues directly from other federal grants.", "The degree to which health centers were involved in prepaid managed care varied considerably among the 10 health centers. In 1993, prepaid managed care accounted for as little as 3 percent and as much as 52 percent of the total health center revenues (see fig. 2). Differences also existed in the percentage that prepaid managed care revenues represented of total Medicaid revenues, ranging from about 12 to 100 percent of total Medicaid revenues among the 10 centers.", "Typically, health centers participate in prepaid managed care through health plans serving Medicaid beneficiaries. The health centers contract with one or more health plans to provide a subset of health plan services. Reimbursement for primary care services at the 10 health centers we reviewed was paid as a monthly capitated rate. The capitation rates for primary care services ranged from $12 per member per month at one health center to $38 per member per month at another. Rates varied in large part because of the different services covered under health plan contracts. For example, a center receiving a higher rate may provide additional services, such as X rays and immunizations. If a center with a lower rate provides these services to plan enrollees, it could receive additional reimbursement on a fee-for-service basis. Some centers also told us that they had received a higher rate because they had negotiated for one with the health plan.", "In addition to agreeing to provide primary care services, four health centers have assumed financial responsibility for referrals, hospitalization, or both in return for a higher capitation rate. In such arrangements, the managed care plan withholds a portion of the health center\u2019s primary care capitation payment to cover referral or hospitalization costs that are higher than expected. In some cases, if the funds withheld are insufficient to cover the losses, the amount withheld in the future from health center capitation payments can be increased."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Health Centers Are Currently Able to Provide Services to the Underserved", "paragraphs": ["Despite the concern that capitation would make it difficult for health centers to maintain their service levels, we found that the 10 centers continue to offer many services targeted to the needs of their communities and that they have maintained the intensity and frequency of the services provided. In addition to medical care, many of the health centers offer transportation and translation services as well as health education, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) case management, and early intervention services for children of substance abusers. These enabling services are very important in reducing the barriers to health care as well as helping to address problems that can lead to the need for further medical care. In addition, these services are available to all health center patients including those whose benefit package may not cover the cost of these services.

We found that all 10 of the health centers had increased spending on these services between 1989 and 1993 (see fig. 6). Further, health center officials told us that enabling services were expanded or enhanced in response to growing community needs. In addition, officials at all 10 centers reported that the intensity or frequency of services typically provided at the center had not been reduced with prepaid managed care.", "While the amount of spending on enabling services and subsidized low-income care generally increased among all health centers, these amounts varied considerably from center to center as did the distribution of spending between enabling services and subsidized care of low-income patients. In most cases the sum of spending on enabling services and subsidized care exceeded revenues received from the Community and Migrant Health Center program grant (see fig. 7).", "With more spending on enabling services, 9 of the 10 health centers increased the number of full-time-equivalent staff involved in providing services other than medical or dental. These included health education, social services, and case management. Staff providing these services included drivers for transportation services, outreach workers, dietary technicians, and home health aides (see fig. 8).", "Center officials told us that community needs largely influenced patterns of spending on enabling services and to subsidize low-income care. For example, the health centers that we visited in densely populated areas spent more money on enabling services, which include social case workers, than the other centers. The health centers in less populated areas tended to subsidize low-income care to a greater extent.

One center reported no excess revenues from prepaid managed care.", "Officials at nine of the health centers told us that returns from managed care had not contributed significantly to center support of enabling services and subsidized care.

Three centers only had available cash to cover fewer than 10 days of operating expenses.", "Cash reserves are important because they represent liquid assets that can be used to pay for contractual obligations and unexpected expenses. Funds for unexpected expenses are especially critical for health centers with more than 15 percent of total revenues from prepaid managed care arrangements and those that have accepted financial responsibility for services other than primary care. For example, when centers take on risk for medical care and hospitalization but more patients than expected require costly treatment or extended hospitalization, losses could be substantial. We found that seven centers received more than 15 percent of their total revenue from prepaid managed care. The four centers that have assumed financial responsibility for specialty referrals, hospitalization, or both all had cash reserves of 31 or fewer days of operating expenses, thereby making them vulnerable to financial difficulties.", "Centers can also be financially vulnerable when capitation rates do not fully cover the cost of the care they provide.

Because Medicaid revenue is a large and growing part of most health centers\u2019 funding, losing this funding could be catastrophic.", "In 1994, a health center in Washington state experienced severe financial difficulties when its relationship with the only local Medicaid health plan was discontinued. The structure of the health plan, which limits membership to individual physicians, made it impossible for the health center to contract directly with the plan. Rather, one physician employed by the center contracted with the plan. When this physician resigned from the center, its relationship with the plan ended. The center\u2019s other physicians were not acceptable to the health plan because of concerns about the physicians\u2019 admitting privileges at the local hospital and their ability to guarantee 24-hour coverage or because the physicians were not willing to contract with the plan. Because all Medicaid beneficiaries in the health center\u2019s service area were enrolled in this health plan, the center lost 1,000 Medicaid patients when they were assigned to other health plan providers. As a result, the center abruptly lost one-third of its patients and 17 percent of its revenue over a 7-month period. The center\u2019s director told us that without this revenue the center was not viable and eventually would have to close. The center reestablished its relations with this health plan when the physician returned and Medicaid patients are being reassigned.", "Also in 1994, health centers in another state, Tennessee, faced the loss of Medicaid revenues if they did not participate in the TennCare program. As a result, all the health centers in Tennessee participate in the TennCare program despite their loss of cost-based reimbursement. Health centers had no choice but to contract with the TennCare health plans, according to the director of the Tennessee Primary Care Association, an association of community health centers in Tennessee. Health centers felt compelled to participate because the Medicaid population is an important part of the health centers\u2019 target population.

Because the capitation rate did not fully cover the centers\u2019 operating costs, the centers were forced to deplete their cash balances to continue providing services. Both centers reported that they could not negotiate higher rates or avoid accepting too much financial risk in part because the Medicaid beneficiaries were all assigned to one health maintenance organization. This left the health centers in a poor position to negotiate a higher capitation rate or different risk arrangements. Since that time, competing health plans have been added to the Medicaid managed care program. In addition, the health centers are more knowledgeable about managed care arrangements. They no longer accept risk for services that they do not provide and have negotiated more acceptable rates.
