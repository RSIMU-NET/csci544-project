TRICARE represents a significant effort to reform DOD\u2019s $15 billion per year health system. DOD\u2019s approach to this reform involves a unique partnership between military and civilian health care entities that will include seven multistate managed care support contracts together estimated to cost about $17 billion over 5 years. In that partnership arrangement, resource sharing is an important cost-saving feature. To share resources, the contractor supplements the capacity of a military hospital or clinic by providing civilian personnel, equipment, or supplies. DOD has estimated that resource sharing could save about $700 million over 5 years for the contracts under way during our review.", "Because of your Subcommittee\u2019s continuing interest in DOD\u2019s use of support contracts to help deliver health care and, specifically, to control costs, we reviewed the cost-saving feature of resource sharing. In particular, we focused on (1) whether resource sharing savings are meeting DOD\u2019s projections and thus helping control TRICARE costs, (2) what problems DOD might be encountering in pursuing resource sharing, and (3) actions and alternatives pursued by DOD to overcome those problems. Also, we considered the implications of resource sharing within the broader context of TRICARE\u2019s overall cost-effectiveness.", "In doing our work, we held discussions and examined records at DOD headquarters in Washington, D.C.; TRICARE regional offices; military hospitals and clinics; and contractor offices. We focused on resource sharing experiences under the first four contracts, involving seven TRICARE regions that had been active long enough for us to draw conclusions about the progress of resource sharing. We also examined TRICARE policies and plans DOD has devised or is considering that will affect resource sharing\u2019s future. Finally, we reviewed data, which DOD provided in response to our findings, suggesting that TRICARE savings other than from resource sharing were occurring. Appendix I further describes our work\u2019s scope and methodology. Appendix III shows the contract start dates and related TRICARE regions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s primary medical mission is to maintain the health of 1.6 million active duty service personnel and provide health care during military operations. Also, as an employer, DOD offers health care to 6.6 million other military-related beneficiaries, including dependents of active duty personnel and military retirees and their dependents. Most care is provided in about 115 hospitals and 470 clinics\u2014referred to as military treatment facilities, or MTFs\u2014worldwide, operated by the Army, Navy, and Air Force. DOD\u2019s direct care system is supplemented by care paid for by DOD but provided in civilian facilities. In fiscal year 1997, DOD expects to spend about $12 billion providing care directly and about $3.5 billion for care in civilian facilities.", "In response to increasing health care costs and uneven access to care, in the late 1980s, DOD initiated, under congressional authority, a series of demonstration programs to evaluate alternative health care delivery approaches. On the basis of this experience, DOD designed TRICARE as its managed health care program.", "The TRICARE program uses regional managed care support contracts to augment its MTFs\u2019 capacities by having contractors perform some managed care functions, including arranging civilian sector care. Altogether, seven managed care support contracts will be awarded covering 11 TRICARE regions (see app. II). To coordinate MTF and contractor services and monitor care delivery, each region is headed by a joint-service administrative organization called a \u201clead agent.\u201d", "Thus far, DOD has awarded five contracts to three health care companies covering eight TRICARE regions. The contracts are competitively awarded and fixed price, although the price is subject to specified adjustments for changes in beneficiary population, MTF workload, and other factors beyond the contractor\u2019s control.", "DOD officials believe that care provided to its patients at military facilities is less expensive than such patients\u2019 care at civilian facilities. Resource sharing arrangements are designed to permit DOD and the contractor to share contractor-provided personnel, equipment, supplies, and other items in an effort to maximize savings. To identify resource sharing opportunities, contractors analyze such data as historical health care costs, workload, and care use, and visit military facilities. They then project the expected savings from providing care in military facilities rather than in potentially more expensive civilian settings. The contract is designed so that the contractor\u2019s expected savings over the contract\u2019s life from the resource sharing are deducted from the contractor\u2019s final offer when bidding on a contract. The contract price thus reflects such anticipated savings through shared resources.", "The contract also is subject to a risk-sharing arrangement under which the government and the contractor share responsibility for health costs that overrun the contract price. Contractors are at risk for their bid amount of health care profit plus up to 1 percent of the bid health care price. Beyond that, the contractor and the government share in losses until an amount prepledged by the contractor, called \u201ccontractor equity,\u201d is depleted. At that time the government becomes fully responsible for any further losses.", "Thus, DOD\u2019s initially realized savings in the form of a lower contract price could be reduced or lost if actual health care expenses are higher than anticipated. Accordingly, DOD encourages MTFs to help the contractor achieve projected resource sharing volume and savings.", "Resource sharing savings, along with expected savings from other sources, such as negotiated provider discounts; better health care utilization management; and better claims management, including collections from other health insurance plans, contribute to government and contractors\u2019 overall financial gains. The combined expected savings from resource sharing and other sources are important as offsets to the increased costs of managing care under TRICARE. Also, statutorily, TRICARE costs cannot be greater than the health costs DOD otherwise would have incurred under CHAMPUS and the direct care system in the program\u2019s absence (National Defense Authorization Acts for Fiscal Years 1994 and 1996, P.L. 103-160 and P.L. 104-106, 10 U.S.C. 1073 note).", "We reported last year that lack of resource sharing progress was one area that could impair efforts to contain related TRICARE costs and achieve savings. We reported that resource sharing was a complex and difficult process and that the process\u2019 details were not well developed or understood, including uncertainty about how resource sharing agreements may affect contract price adjustments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Resource Sharing Savings Falling Short of Projections", "paragraphs": ["DOD and the contractors are not attaining major new savings through resource sharing agreements, and the potential for new agreements and further savings appears limited. On the basis of progress to date and discussions with DOD and contractor officials, achieving overall projected resource sharing savings appears highly unlikely.", "For the contracts under way, DOD projected saving about $700 million, including $116 million through the current operating years. The contractors\u2019 projections were similar. But by March 1997, after 9- to 24-month contract operating periods, new resource sharing agreements represented only about 5 percent of the savings needed to achieve DOD\u2019s projected savings. In addition to the new agreements, contractors have also converted into resource sharing agreements previously existing agreements that MTFs had with civilian providers before TRICARE became operational. At one MTF, for example, on the day the support contract became operational, seven existing agreements were converted to resource sharing agreements. But savings associated with those converted agreements do not represent new TRICARE savings and thus were not part of DOD\u2019s new projected savings.", "Support contractors and DOD are aware of the lack of progress in resource sharing. One contractor\u2019s representative told us that achievements so far are just previous agreement conversions and that a more aggressive approach toward new agreements is needed. Another said lack of progress in negotiating new agreements remains their greatest TRICARE contract concern. DOD officials expressed mixed views ranging from optimism that resource sharing momentum will build to the belief that the approach simply will not work as envisioned.", "At this time, the potential for further resource sharing savings appears limited. In March 1997, the contractors had about 170 new resource sharing possibilities in some stage of cost and workload data gathering or analysis, or in some way being considered as potential agreements. For example, one region had 39 resource sharing possibilities under development, covering an array of services such as cardiology, radiology, and internal medicine. Officials told us, however, that considerable analysis was needed before potential savings could be reliably estimated and that some of the proposals likely would not prove cost-effective. Meanwhile, additional proposals are being added and existing ones deleted as the proposal and evaluation processes continue. But, as previously indicated, savings to date show that not enough is being done to reach DOD\u2019s projected resource sharing savings levels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Problems Encountered in Establishing Agreements", "paragraphs": ["In addition to agreements already implemented or under consideration, by March 1997, over 260 other resource sharing proposals had been either rejected or otherwise not further pursued. Our analysis indicated that various impediments exist to resource sharing, including lack of clear policies, program complexity, lack of MTF incentives, and military downsizing.", "Issued in December 1994, DOD resource sharing guidance stated that MTFs had an obligation to help contractors reach the bid amount of resource sharing savings. But the guidance also instructed MTFs to look for other, possibly more cost-effective ways to increase MTF resource use, such as by reallocating existing resources, referring patients to other MTFs, or directly contracting with civilian care providers other than the support contractor.", "When some MTFs pursued such alternatives, one contractor objected, stating its belief that resource sharing was the first alternative for increasing MTF use. In November 1996, DOD issued new guidance stating that resource sharing was the first alternative and that MTF commanders should make good faith efforts to work with contractors to execute such agreements.", "MTF and contractor officials cited the resource sharing approach\u2019s complexity as another factor limiting progress. The agreements require considerable financial analysis to assess their cost-effectiveness potential (see app. IV). Also, the agreements involve intricate issues of how much credit contractors should receive for adding to the MTFs\u2019 workload and how that credited workload will affect the contract price. MTF officials told us they did not understand all of the agreements\u2019 financial implications, largely because they did not control or understand all the data and analyses used. They were concerned that workload shifts between MTFs and contractors, and ensuing bid price adjustments, would enable contractors to gain at MTFs\u2019 workload and budgetary expense. At two MTFs, for example, proposed gastroenterology assistance agreements, projected to save over $400,000, were rejected because of unresolvable MTF concerns about possible effects on the overall contract price.", "Both contractor and MTF officials expressed concerns\u2014and resulting hesitance to enter into agreements\u2014about the reliability of data used to analyze agreements\u2019 potential cost-effectiveness. According to contractors, for example, several MTFs supplied inappropriate data, such as personnel salaries and hospital maintenance, that hampered their analyses of the proposals\u2019 likely costs and other effects. At one of the MTFs, eight proposed agreements were rejected because of data problems.", "Tied to the complexity and data problems, a lack of incentive to enter into agreements because MTFs do not share in resulting savings was also cited by MTF officials. DOD and the Services have not established a savings return policy for MTFs that have resource sharing agreements. Instead, after consideration, the Services decided that any such savings are to be retained at the Service level for reallocation as needed within the system.", "Still another MTF resource sharing disincentive is that the agreements can actually increase facility costs. For example, an agreement to provide an anesthesiologist, so the MTF can do more surgeries, will in turn result in related radiology, laboratory, and pharmacy costs. Unless contractors compensate MTFs for such costs, MTFs\u2019 overall costs may increase. While the contracts provide for such contractor compensatory payments, a July 1996 DOD policy clarification was issued to help facilitate such payments. A remaining challenge has been MTF and contractor negotiations on what costs to apply to individual agreements.", "Both DOD and the contractors cited military downsizing, including at the MTFs, as another limiting factor. Resource sharing opportunities identified during the contract bidding process may no longer exist as military forces are reduced or relocated and as MTFs are closed, downsized, or converted to clinics. For example, one MTF rejected five proposals because it had subsequently reduced its operating rooms from eight to four, thus obviating the need for agreements.", "Resource sharing problems have prompted one contractor to request a contract price adjustment. In June 1996, near the start date of health care delivery, the contractor reported that while the other care delivery preparations had progressed well, the lack of resource sharing progress was a major problem. Projecting millions of dollars in financial losses, the contractor requested a price renegotiation. In a letter to DOD, the contractor complained about changing DOD rules on how the approach was to work, inadequate data, improper MTF incentives, insufficient MTF training in developing agreements, and postaward MTF workload and capacity changes that reduced resource sharing opportunities. DOD generally agreed that problems existed, committed to work collaboratively to resolve them, and scheduled meetings with the contractor to pursue the issues in more detail. DOD said, however, that a price renegotiation was premature at the time. As of May 1997, the contractor was still pursuing a price adjustment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Actions to Address Resource Sharing Problems", "paragraphs": ["DOD has acted to increase resource sharing under current contracts.

Since issuing resource sharing guidance in December 1994, DOD headquarters officials visited the regions to provide briefings, used a focus group to help make resource sharing easier to use, developed standardized training, and attempted to promote better DOD and contractor cooperation. Also, the contractors have continued to work with the MTFs to identify and pursue resource sharing opportunities.", "In November 1996, DOD issued clarifying policy stating that resource sharing is to be the first alternative for recapturing private sector workload into the MTF. Lead agents and MTFs are to ensure that any other MTF actions to add or retain workload do not prevent the TRICARE support contractor from entering into cost-effective agreements and reaching their resource sharing bid amounts.", "In July 1996, DOD clarified its policy regarding cash payments by support contractors to MTFs for marginal costs stemming from agreements. In a related move, DOD recently made available $25 million to the Services to help pay such marginal costs, or for the MTFs to otherwise invest in agreements, and asked the Services to submit potential projects for the funds\u2019 use. In April 1997, DOD told us that some funds had been approved for only two or three requests.", "To help reduce resource sharing complexities, DOD provided a financial analysis worksheet for determining whether an agreement might be cost-effective and whether the amount of recaptured workload credited to the contractor is appropriate (see app. IV). DOD later revised the worksheet to, among other things, account for different agreement types. DOD also provided an analytical model further showing the MTFs\u2019 resource sharing\u2019s potential financial effects. The model was introduced to the MTFs in July 1996.", "DOD created a resource sharing focus group after a lead agent reported in January 1996 that resource sharing was complicated and presented MTFs with disincentives. The group worked for about 6 months and recommended improvements in such areas as training, the financial analysis worksheet, and the data used to make agreements.", "In early 1996, DOD began developing a TRICARE Financial Management Education Program curriculum that included resource sharing and the bid price adjustment process. Program testing was completed in December and presentations have begun.", "In November 1996, DOD initiated a new \u201cpartnering\u201d effort with the contractors. DOD saw a need to help MTFs and contractors work through data problems, contract ambiguities, resource constraints, and other TRICARE difficulties. The partnering approach calls for a more cooperative, trusting, teamwork relationship between MTFs and support contractors, including ways to avoid disputes and to informally resolve, rather than possibly litigate, those that occur. Early actions included DOD meetings with contractors at headquarters and regional levels, contractor participation in a national TRICARE conference, and consideration of assigning representatives of lead agents and the contractors to work together at each other\u2019s locations.", "The bottom-line measure of DOD\u2019s and the contractors\u2019 efforts is in the progress made entering new resource sharing agreements. But progress remains slow, and the prospects for additional agreements are questionable. These outcomes, along with one contractor\u2019s request for financial relief and DOD\u2019s recognized need to improve teamwork, indicate a need for more concerted efforts under the current contracts to reach the agreements that are pending while seeking acceptable alternatives to resource sharing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Revisions Under the Latest Contracts Reduce Reliance on Resource Sharing but Add Complications", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s revised financing approach, conceived before the first support contract began operating but applied only in the latest two, is intended to strengthen MTF health care management. Under this approach, MTFs\u2019 direct funding and financial responsibilities will be increased. The funding increase will be determined by the amount of previous CHAMPUS expenditures for MTF-based TRICARE Prime enrollees, which DOD expects will include most MTF service areas\u2019 beneficiaries. Thus, rather than sharing responsibility for Prime enrollees with the support contractor, the MTFs will have full funding and full responsibility for their Prime enrollees and will pay the contractor for care required from the contractor\u2019s network. One result of this approach will be to reduce reliance on resource sharing to lower support contract costs; but it also adds new challenges and does not eliminate, and may even exacerbate, resource sharing problems.", "Giving the MTFs direct financial control for TRICARE Prime enrollees is aimed at providing them with clearer incentives to efficiently manage care use and to behave more like private sector HMOs. DOD saw the need for this while still arranging the earlier contracts and later viewed it as a way to relieve emerging resource sharing problems. But, under revised financing\u2019s current approach, DOD will continue sharing care costs with the contractor for beneficiaries not enrolled with the MTFs. Also, the MTFs will continue working with the new contractor toward signing resource sharing agreements. Thus, to the extent contractor reliance on resource sharing continues, the difficulties already experienced are also likely to continue.", "DOD believes revised financing gives MTFs added cost-saving incentives to engage in resource sharing by reducing the need for referral of their enrollees to the TRICARE support contractor. However, revised financing may add further complexity to resource sharing\u2019s use. Because the new approach\u2019s potential effects on resource sharing are not now known, TRICARE contract offerors must make their own assumptions and projections about such effects. Much will depend, for example, on how MTFs\u2019 funding levels may change and the consequent alterations in their beneficiary service priorities. And the added extent of funding going to MTFs rather than to contractors will in turn depend on the MTFs\u2019 capacities and ability to enroll beneficiaries and serve as their primary care manager\u2014all of which have yet to be determined.", "Revised financing\u2019s effects on resource sharing are uncertain and were at issue during the two affected contracts\u2019 bidding processes. One bidder, a current TRICARE contractor, wrote to DOD to clarify what portion of the funds the MTFs and contractor respectively would control and how revised financing would affect resource sharing. In earlier discussions, the bidder told DOD the company could be creative and assume resource sharing opportunities would still exist or assume none would exist. DOD replied that the new approach\u2019s effects on resource sharing were uncertain but that the successful bidder should work creatively with the MTFs to achieve resource sharing. DOD also amended the request for a bid proposal to provide more description and examples of how revised financing and resource sharing might be integrated. But, as with resource sharing under the current contracts, the new approach\u2019s actual effects will not be known until it is implemented.", "While DOD officials in regions with contracts generally favored revised financing, they expressed concerns about poor accounting systems and lack of data on patient care costs and outcomes that MTFs will need to become effective, cost-competitive providers. Some had concerns about the general lack of MTF health care management experience and control over their staffing. MTF officials in regions about to apply revised financing have stated that they recognize their increased need for accountability, adequate staffing to support their enrollees, and better information systems to support resource sharing decisions.", "While theoretically possible, revised financing\u2019s potential has yet to be demonstrated.

Adding to such TRICARE initiatives\u2019 challenges are changes in DOD\u2019s top leadership in Health Affairs.", "DOD is now considering alternative structures for future contracts, on the basis of our recommendations and those from lead agents, contractors, and others in the health care industry. The alternatives include smaller, shorter, and less prescriptive contracts, allowing contractors to rely more on their own \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d commercial practices. DOD has held several forums to discuss ideas and the alternative approaches\u2019 potential advantages and disadvantages. The issues involved include effects on beneficiary choice of providers, assurance of contractor qualifications, quality of care, DOD and contractors\u2019 risk sharing, administrative complexity, adequacy of bid competition, and DOD costs. No final decisions have been made yet.", "The new contract structures likely will include an approach similar to revised financing. Basically, each MTF would be funded to cover all its enrollees in TRICARE Prime, and the contractor would be funded for all other beneficiaries. Thus, each MTF and contractor would be responsible for its share of the beneficiary population\u2019s care costs, and would reimburse each other when one provides services to the other\u2019s beneficiaries. For example, the contractor would reimburse an MTF for caring for a nonenrollee, and one MTF would reimburse another upon referring its own enrollee for care there. One aim of the funding approach would be to eliminate reliance on resource sharing as a major source for TRICARE savings.", "In April 1997, DOD accelerated the planned change in MTF budgeting and contract financing and announced it would be effective at the start of fiscal year 1998. This means that not only will the changes apply to future contracts but also current contracts will have to be amended. DOD expects that changing the current contracts may have cost implications of unknown extent at this time for both the government and the contractors.", "Commenting on a February 1997 DOD policy draft, one contractor said that any change that would avoid reliance on resource sharing, bid price adjustments, and resulting MTF disincentives would be positive. The contractor added, however, that DOD needs to involve the contractors in weighing the new budgeting and financing approach\u2019s assumptions and risks to ensure it will work; otherwise contract prices may increase to cover the unknown risks. Another contractor said that many of the details had yet to be worked out and that two remaining questions are how funding will be split between MTFs and contractors and how resource sharing will be affected.", "Such budgeting and contracting changes reach far beyond an expectation that they will reduce the need for resource sharing. This notwithstanding, DOD lacks a simple, stable, long-term approach to TRICARE budgeting and contracting that provides clear managed care incentives and accountability and avoids the complexities and disincentives of resource sharing. As the contractors indicated, whether the contemplated system changes succeed will depend upon how these details are worked out and how well DOD and the contractors manage the system and support each other.", "In addition, both the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) and the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, who have actively and forcefully led TRICARE since its beginning, have left their positions. The former Principal Deputy has taken the Assistant Secretary position in an acting capacity.

As an example, one region\u2019s estimated CHAMPUS costs without the contract would have been about $2.1 billion, compared with the contract award amount of $1.8 billion; so, according to DOD, the savings would be $0.3 billion. These officials also said that overall health care data show downward MTF cost trends, further supporting managed care\u2019s cost-saving effects\u2014despite resource sharing\u2019s limited showing. For example, they provided a graph showing that both direct care and CHAMPUS total costs declined steadily\u2014by 10 percent overall\u2014from fiscal years 1991 through 1996.", "While assessing TRICARE\u2019s overall cost-effectiveness was beyond our review\u2019s scope, there are reasons at this time to question the currency and analytical completeness of DOD\u2019s savings claims. First, DOD\u2019s preaward estimates of CHAMPUS costs, a key component of its savings claim, may now be outdated. The first estimate\u2014for the Northwest Region contract\u2014was based on cost data prior to August 1993. Over the 4 years since then, changes in such areas as benefits and allowed payments to providers would affect the results of that estimate. Second, in a separate review, we found that as of May 1997, the existing five contracts had been modified as many as 350 times, with the resulting potential for substantial contract cost increases attributable to TRICARE. These potential cost increases, just like the potential losses from lack of resource sharing, also would offset DOD\u2019s projected savings.", "Furthermore, we recently questioned DOD\u2019s cumulative 5- to 7-percent utilization management savings estimate in its near $15 billion to $18 billion health care budget totals for fiscal years 1998 to 2003. We reported that DOD lacked a formal methodology for developing the estimates, and we concluded overall that future health care costs likely would be greater. Lastly, DOD\u2019s available health care cost data do not indicate whether apparent downward shifts might be due to managed care effectiveness or to such other factors as reductions in allowed provider payments that would have occurred in TRICARE\u2019s absence. Thus, we support DOD\u2019s plans to undertake a more current and complete cost analysis of MTF direct and contractor-provided care, based on recent program data, to bottom-line TRICARE\u2019s current and future-year cost-effectiveness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["At their present results levels, for the existing contracts, DOD and the support contractor will achieve only about 5 percent of the expected $700 million in new savings, potentially causing shared financial losses and higher TRICARE costs.

While DOD now seems to be moving toward a view that the approach will not work as designed, the contractors and DOD are still pursuing about 170 resource sharing possibilities in an effort to discover additional savings with which to reduce their costs.", "Many problems have contributed to resource sharing\u2019s lack of success. DOD\u2019s policies, processes, and tools for use at the local level as well as the degree of DOD and contractor collaboration have not yet been sufficient to effectively resolve the approach\u2019s obstacles.", "While revised financing is feasible though unproven, its potential effects on resource sharing and on other expected savings under the latest two contracts remain to be seen. Under the new approach, resource sharing may be reduced, but its problems will remain and may become more complex as new MTF and contractor management responsibilities are introduced.", "DOD\u2019s more broadly proposed MTF budgeting and support contracting changes would greatly affect future and current contracts, including further reducing resource sharing. Clearly, a simple, accountable, incentive-based approach is lacking, yet the potential effectiveness of DOD\u2019s considered changes will largely depend on how well they are designed and implemented. As such changes further reduce resource sharing as a potential savings mechanism and as DOD looks to alternative savings sources, lessons learned from resource sharing will need to be carefully heeded and skillfully incorporated.

Thus, DOD said the reader is led to assume that problems occurred in other regions because resource sharing was implemented on a broad scale without the requisite examination. We did not evaluate CRI resource sharing because our focus was whether resource sharing under TRICARE was producing new savings to help offset added TRICARE costs. Also, as the report notes, DOD\u2019s reference to continued success in region 9 is basically a conversion of CRI resource sharing agreements, which do not reflect new savings under TRICARE.", "Furthermore, DOD said the resource sharing program as currently structured was based on the best available information at the time and that the report should note that the TRICARE support contractors came to the same conclusion as DOD regarding resource sharing\u2019s potential cost-effectiveness, even with their years of experience with managed care. But our report does not question whether DOD\u2019s structure for TRICARE resource sharing was based on the best information available at the time. Instead, the report discusses the complex issues that arose during the implementation of resource sharing. Also, the report notes that the contractors as well initially concluded that resource sharing would be cost-effective.", "Also, DOD said the report treats resource sharing in isolation, as opposed to one component of a comprehensive system that has proven to be cost-effective. While we focused on resource sharing because it was expected to be a major cost-saving mechanism, we also noted that it was one of several ways in which DOD expected to achieve savings to offset TRICARE\u2019s costs. DOD went on to state that efficiencies not achieved through resource sharing were otherwise achieved by increased MTF capability and efficiency brought about by TRICARE. As the report points out, during our review DOD presented information showing downward MTF cost trends, but these data do not show whether the trends were due to TRICARE managed care efforts or whether the costs would have declined anyway in TRICARE\u2019s absence.", "DOD said managed care support (MCS) contracts have resulted in savings of $2.3 billion when compared with projected costs without the contracts. It said that we acknowledged this savings estimate but that our placement of it in the report diluted its significance.

DOD said revised financing, in conjunction with its planned change to enrollment-based capitated budgeting for MTFs, increases incentives for MTFs to engage in resource sharing by expanding MTF funding while reducing support contractor costs. We agree that revised financing, in conjunction with enrollment-based capitation, has the potential to create more incentive for the MTFs to engage in resource sharing and may similarly provide incentive to the support contractors. Still, those approaches add their own complexities and do not automatically eliminate the difficulties experienced with resource sharing.
