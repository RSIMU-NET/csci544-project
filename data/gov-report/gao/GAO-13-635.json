Though program rules allow limited work activity, some work activity indicates beneficiaries are not disabled and therefore not entitled to DI benefits. Consequently, SSA might overpay beneficiaries if the agency does not detect disqualifying work activity and suspend benefits appropriately.", "GAO was asked to study potential DI overpayments. GAO examined the extent to which (1) the NDNH indicates that individuals received potential DI overpayments; and (2) SSA's enforcement operation detects potentially disqualifying work activity during the waiting period. GAO drew random, generalizable samples of individuals from those whose earnings on the NDNH were beyond program limits and compared wages from their employers to DI program data to identify potential overpayments. To illustrate the circumstances in which SSA made potential DI overpayments, GAO reviewed case files for a nongeneralizable selection of six individuals--three who worked during their waiting period, and three who received potential overpayments for at least 3 years."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["On the basis of analyzing Social Security Administration (SSA) data on individuals who were Disability Insurance (DI) beneficiaries as of December 2010 and earnings data from the National Directory of New Hires (NDNH), GAO estimates that SSA made $1.29 billion in potential cash benefit overpayments to about 36,000 individuals as of January 2013. The exact number of individuals who received improper disability payments and the exact amount of improper payments made to those individuals cannot be determined without detailed case investigations by SSA. These DI beneficiaries represent an estimated 0.4 percent of all primary DI beneficiaries as of December 2010. Using a different methodology that includes additional causes of overpayments not considered in GAO's analysis, SSA estimated its DI overpayments in fiscal year 2011 were $1.62 billion, or 1.27 percent of all DI benefits in that fiscal year. GAO estimated DI program overpayments on the basis of work activity performed by two populations of individuals. The first population received potential overpayments due to work activity during the DI program's mandatory 5-month waiting period--a statutory program requirement to help ensure that SSA does not pay benefits to individuals who do not have long-term disabilities. Prior to receiving benefits, individuals must complete a 5-month waiting period, in which the individual cannot exceed a certain level of earnings, known as substantial gainful activity, during any month in order to be eligible for DI benefits. Earnings that exceed program limits during the waiting period indicate that individuals might not have long-term disabilities. The second population received potential overpayments due to work activity beyond the program's trial work period--the trial work period consists of up to 9 months in which a DI beneficiary may return to work without affecting her or his benefits. However, beneficiaries whose earnings consistently exceed program limits after completing a trial work period are generally no longer entitled to benefits.", "SSA uses its enforcement operation to generate alerts for potentially disqualifying earnings, but the agency's enforcement operation does not generate alerts for earnings that occur in all months of the waiting period, which allows potentially disqualifying work activity to remain undetected. Specifically, GAO found that SSA's enforcement operation will not generate an alert for earnings during the waiting period if the earnings occur in a year when the beneficiary does not receive a benefit payment. For example, in two of the nongeneralizable case studies GAO reviewed, SSA's enforcement operation did not generate an alert for potentially disqualifying work activity during the waiting period because these individuals' waiting periods occurred in the year prior to their first benefit payment. GAO obtained earnings records from these individuals' employers that show they worked continually both during and after their waiting periods at a level of work that would normally result in a denial of benefits. GAO also reviewed information for individuals who worked beyond their trial work period and found that SSA had identified and established overpayments for these individuals. SSA officials stated that modifying its enforcement operation could be costly, but the agency has not assessed the costs of doing so. To the extent that it is cost-effective and feasible, establishing a mechanism to detect earnings during all months of the waiting period would strengthen SSA's enforcement operation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that SSA assess the costs and feasibility of establishing a mechanism to detect potentially disqualifying earnings during all months of the waiting period and implement the mechanism as appropriate.

Our first report addressed overlapping disability and  unemployment benefits. This report: (1) estimates the extent to which  individuals received DI benefit payments that were potentially improper  due to work activity performed during the 5-month waiting period or  beyond the 9-month trial work period; and (2) assesses the extent to  which SSA\u2019s enforcement operation detects potentially disqualifying work  activity during the waiting period.

Because of timing differences in the NDNH and MBR data,  we were not able to capture all earnings that may have resulted in  improper payments to these individuals. As such, our analysis of DI  beneficiaries whose work activity resulted in payments that were  potentially improper is likely understated. The timing of the NDNH and  MBR data we received is described in detail in appendix II. To identify  potential overpayments and to develop data for estimates of potential  overpayments in each population, we drew a random, generalizable  sample of individuals from each of the populations described above and  compared wage information from their employers to DI program  information from SSA. We drew samples of 133 and 130 individuals, and  received completed requests from employers for 98 individuals for each  sample. Because our analysis of overpayments is limited to earnings  data from the NDNH and DI payments from SSA, overpayments for each  sample are estimated.", "We also developed detailed case-file information for a nongeneralizable  selection of six individuals from our two statistical samples to illustrate the  circumstances under which SSA made DI payments that were potentially  improper. From the sample of individuals who received payments that  were potentially improper due to work activity during the 5-month waiting  period, we randomly selected three beneficiaries from those who had  substantial earnings during the waiting period and continued to have  substantial earnings after their waiting period. From the sample of  individuals who received payments that were potentially improper due to  work activity beyond the trial work period, we randomly selected three  beneficiaries from those who received potential overpayments for at least  36 months (3 years).

Specifically,  substantial earnings from work during the 5-month waiting period may  indicate that individuals are not considered disabled and therefore are not  entitled to DI benefits. Thus, if SSA discovers substantial earnings from  work during the waiting period prior to adjudicating the disability claim,  SSA will deny the disability claim. SSA may also reopen previously  awarded disability claims by revising the decision to a denial of benefits  after providing due process rights. Additionally, SSA\u2019s policies allow it the  option of considering a later disability-onset date rather than denying the  disability claim if it discovers the SGA-level work activity after the SGA  subsequently stops.

In contrast, the wages we confirmed  with the beneficiary\u2019s employer indicate that the beneficiary had earnings continuously  above the SGA level for every month of the year that he applied for and was approved  for benefits, including all 5 months of the waiting period. Further, because these earnings  were continuously above the SGA level for more than 6 months, SSA policy indicates  that his work activity cannot be considered an unsuccessful work attempt.

According to SSA officials, the enforcement operation will only generate  an earnings alert for a year in which a beneficiary receives a payment. In this example,  because DI benefit payments began in 2010, and the waiting period was during the year  prior to the first payment, no earnings alert was generated.", "In 2011, SSA initiated a work-related continuing disability review (CDR) as a result of an  earnings alert for work activity after the waiting period. As mentioned, SSA conducts  CDRs to determine if beneficiaries are working above the SGA level. However, during  the CDR, SSA program staff did not request and verify wages from the beneficiary\u2019s  employer, nor did staff apply program rules regarding work activity during the waiting  period. Instead, the CDR considered the work activity under the trial work period rules  and determined that benefits should continue. Because the beneficiary\u2019s impairment did  not prevent him from earning SGA-level wages during the waiting period and his SGA  continued after the waiting period, SSA policies indicate that SSA should have denied  the individual benefits when his case was adjudicated, or reopened the determination  after adjudication and revised the claim to a denial of benefits, which would have  resulted in an overpayment of all benefits previously paid. As such, we estimate that  SSA made $90,000 in cash benefit payments that were potentially improper to this  individual over a period more than 3 years.

SSA approved the beneficiary for DI benefits starting in December 2009 for a  malignant tumor. The beneficiary had substantial earnings from work during her waiting  period as well as SGA-level earnings in 9 months of the first 12 months that SSA  determined her impairment prevented her from having substantial earnings from work.  When the beneficiary eventually self-reported earnings in 2011, SSA initiated a CDR that  discovered substantial earnings from work during the waiting period. However, SSA staff  did not consider this work in accordance with its own policies, and the CDR resulted in a  determination that DI benefits should continue. Specifically, according to SSA, the  discovery of SGA-level wages during the waiting period should have prompted SSA staff  to initiate processes for determining whether benefits should have originally been denied  or if the onset date should be changed to the date the SGA-level work stopped, but the  SSA staff did not do so. On the basis of this individual\u2019s substantial earnings from work  during the waiting period, the revised disability determination may have resulted in a  revised disability denial or revised date of disability onset. SSA ceased providing DI  benefits to the beneficiary in April 2013 when the beneficiary died. Although SSA never  assessed overpayments for the beneficiary, we identified about $25,000 in cash benefit  payments that were potentially improper through our analysis of the beneficiary\u2019s wage  records.

During this review, SSA officials told us that limited resources  and competing workloads may have constrained the agency\u2019s ability to  act promptly when it received earnings alerts or self-reported earnings for  beneficiaries from our nongeneralizable examples described above. We  also reported in April 2013 that budget decisions and the way SSA  prioritizes competing demands, such as processing initial claims,  contribute to challenges SSA faces in maintaining the integrity of the  disability program.", "In 2004, we reported that SSA\u2019s lack of timely earnings data on  beneficiaries\u2019 earnings and work activity impeded its ability to prevent and  detect earnings-related overpayments. To enhance SSA\u2019s ability to detect  and prevent overpayments in the DI program, we recommended that SSA  use more-timely earnings information in the NDNH in conducting  program-integrity operations. Although SSA uses the NDNH to perform  oversight of the SSI program, it does not use the NDNH to conduct  oversight of the DI program. In 2009, SSA conducted a cost-effectiveness  study on use of the NDNH, which estimated its return on investment  would be about $1.40 for every $1 spent, or a 40 percent rate of return;  however, SSA concluded in its 2009 study that this expected return on  investment was low, and noted that a match with the NDNH would  generate a large number of CDR alerts needing development that were  not of high quality. In July 2011, we reported that due to overly  pessimistic assumptions in SSA\u2019s cost-effectiveness study, it is likely that  the actual savings that result from SSA\u2019s use of the NDNH could be much  higher. Further, it is not clear whether this cost-benefit analysis  accounted for improper payments that would be prevented by identifying  work activity during the 5-month waiting period. Thus, the real return on  investment could be understated. SSA agreed with our assessment and  in January 2013 said that it is currently reevaluating the cost- effectiveness of using the NDNH for DI program-integrity initiatives and  expects the cost-benefit analysis to be completed in the fourth quarter of  fiscal year 2013.", "SSA officials also stated that the agency has made improvements to its  CDR process, but we were unable to determine how they might reduce  improper payments due to beneficiaries\u2019 work activity because these  initiatives were still being tested at the time of our review. For example, in  2010 SSA began a pilot to use what the agency refers to as a predictive  model to prioritize enforcement operation earnings alerts, working cases  likely to incur large work-related overpayments first. SSA officials told us  the agency is planning to implement the model nationally in June 2013.  Additionally, in response to a recommendation we made in a prior report,  in 2012 SSA began testing a new process to use its model to identify and  delay benefit increases for beneficiaries with pending work CDRs.Because these initiatives were still being tested at the time of our review,  we were unable to determine how they might reduce improper payments  due to beneficiaries\u2019 work activity. As such, it is too early to assess what  effect these initiatives may have on the prevalence and size of DI  overpayments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SSA Can Improve Its Ability to Detect Potentially Disqualifying Work Activity", "paragraphs": ["We found that a limitation of SSA\u2019s enforcement operation allows  individuals with substantial earnings from work during the waiting period  to be approved for DI benefits and allows resulting DI benefit payments  that were potentially improper to remain undetected by SSA.  Specifically, we found that SSA\u2019s enforcement operation will not generate  an alert for earnings during the waiting period if the earnings occur in a  year when the beneficiary does not receive a benefit payment. For  example, if a beneficiary receives her or his first benefit payment in  January 2013, the enforcement operation will not generate an earnings  alert for wages earned during the waiting-period months occurring in the  prior year, which would be from August to December 2012. As a result,  for any beneficiary whose first month of entitlement is January to May, the  enforcement operation does not generate an earnings alert for at least 1  month of the waiting period. In two of the three examples we randomly  selected from our sample of beneficiaries with work activity during the  waiting period, SSA\u2019s enforcement operation did not generate alerts for  SGA-level earnings during the waiting period because their waiting  periods occurred in the year prior to their first benefit payment. These  individuals were approved for benefits despite disqualifying work activity,  and SSA had not detected any overpayments for these individuals at the  time of our audit. For the third beneficiary we reviewed, SSA\u2019s  enforcement operation generated an alert for earnings during the waiting  period because the individual also received benefit payments in that year.  However, this alert was generated more than 1 year after the work activity  during the waiting period occurred, and in the resulting work CDR, SSA  did not apply its own waiting period program rules to the work activity.  Specifically, SSA approved the individual for benefits despite disqualifying  work activity and did not detect and establish overpayments for this work  activity when it later became aware of the work activity.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  internal controls should generally be designed to assure that ongoing  monitoring occurs in the course of normal operations. SSA officials  acknowledged that the systemic limitation to their enforcement operation  allows potentially disqualifying work activity to remain undetected, but  SSA expressed concern that modifying its existing enforcement operation  may be costly. However, SSA has not assessed either the costs of such a  modification or the additional program savings it might realize should  such a change be implemented. Such an analysis would assist SSA in  making an informed decision regarding the costs and benefits of  modifying its existing enforcement operation. To the extent that such an  analysis determines modifying its existing enforcement operation is cost  effective and feasible, establishing a mechanism to identify work activity  performed during all months of the waiting period, including those that  occur in a year when beneficiaries were not paid, may help provide SSA  greater assurance that DI beneficiaries are eligible to receive benefits."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The DI program provides an important safety net for disabled  beneficiaries. However, during a time of growing concerns about the  solvency of the DI trust fund, it is important that SSA take every  opportunity to ensure that only eligible beneficiaries receive payments  under this program and that additional actions are taken to improve the  financial status of the program. Without reliable and timely earnings  information on the work activity of individuals applying for DI benefits,  SSA risks making overpayments to individuals whose work activity  indicates they are not disabled and therefore ineligible for disability  benefits. While we cannot generalize the examples we found, SSA\u2019s  inability to identify work activity during the waiting period may result in  overpayments to beneficiaries who are ineligible for benefits. Assessing  the costs and savings associated with establishing a mechanism to  identify work activity during all months of the waiting period would help  SSA to determine whether establishing such a mechanism would be cost- effective and feasible.

The agency also provided general and technical  comments, which have been incorporated into the report, as appropriate.  SSA\u2019s comments are reproduced in full in appendix IV.", "In commenting on our recommendation to assess the costs and feasibility  of establishing a mechanism to detect potentially disqualifying earnings  during all months of the waiting period and to implement the mechanism,  to the extent that it is cost-effective and feasible, SSA requested the data  we gathered as part of this study to help the agency assess the costs and  feasibility of establishing such a mechanism. At SSA\u2019s request, we will  provide SSA the population of individuals with earnings during the 5- month waiting period that we identified from our match of 2010 NDNH  earnings data and SSA\u2019s 2010 DI program data. During the course of this  audit, we also provided SSA with the SSNs of the individuals in our two  random samples. These data would allow SSA to perform the  recommended analysis using the NDNH wage data, which we obtained  from SSA. We note that SSA\u2019s assessment would benefit from using the  most-recently available wage data, such as 2013 data that are directly  available to SSA from the NDNH.", "In addition to this data request, SSA raised several concerns about our  methodology and asserted that our inability to replicate the process it  uses to make SGA determinations may lead to substantial overstatement  of our estimate of potentially improper payments. First, SSA noted that  our review does not consider program features, such as unsuccessful  work attempts and Impairment Related Work Expenses (IRWE), or  whether the work involved subsidies or special conditions. As mentioned  in the report, SSA\u2019s process for determining SGA and its policies for  determining whether individuals remain entitled to benefits despite  potentially disqualifying work activity involve a consideration of all the  facts and circumstances surrounding a case, including medical data that  doctors and hospitals are not required to share with GAO for purposes of  this audit. As such, our objective was to estimate the extent to which  individuals received DI benefit payments that were potentially improper  due to their work activity. To do this, we used wage data to identify two  populations of individuals with earnings beyond program limits; we then  drew a random, generalizable sample of individuals from each population  and compared wage information from their employers to DI program  information from SSA to develop estimates of potential overpayments in  each population. Because our analysis of potential overpayments is  limited to earnings data from the NDNH and DI payments from SSA,  potential overpayments for each sample are estimated. Thus, we  continue to believe that the methodology we applied using the data we  were able to access led us to valid estimates of potentially improper  payments due to beneficiaries\u2019 work activity.", "Second, SSA noted that we assume that every payment made after the 5- month waiting period is likely to be an improper payment instead of  reestablishing the disability onset date, as its policy allows in some  instances. However, our method of calculating potential overpayments is  consistent with current DI program policies and interviews with SSA  officials who stated that individuals who perform substantial gainful  activity during the waiting period are not disabled and therefore not  entitled to benefits; thus, all DI payments made to those individuals are  potentially improper payments. Further, determining which individuals in  our samples, if any, should have their onset date reestablished despite  disqualifying work activity in the waiting period was not reasonably  possible because making such a determination would involve a  consideration of medical data that doctors and hospitals were not  required to share with GAO for purposes of this audit.", "Third, SSA stated that payment for medical leave may have been  included in some of the payroll data we used for our analysis and  suggested that this may have led to a substantial overstatement of  estimated improper payments. However, our calculation of earned income  excludes material payments for medical leave, as described in detail in  appendix II. Thus, we do not expect that these payments or the other  concerns SSA raises in its letter led to a substantial overstatement of  potential overpayments, as SSA suggested.", "Finally, SSA noted that improving payment accuracy is critical to  preserving the public's trust in the DI program and that available  resources may affect SSA\u2019s ability to increase its payment accuracy. We  recognize SSA\u2019s ongoing efforts to improve the program and that federal  resources are currently constrained. However, without making changes to  its existing processes for identifying beneficiaries\u2019 work activity, to the  extent that the benefits exceed the costs, SSA may remain unable to  detect work activity in a timely manner, and SSA may continue to make  improper payments to individuals whose work activity indicates they are  not entitled to benefits.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

First, the quarterly wage amounts on the NDNH  represent 3 months of earnings; however, the statute for evaluating SGA- level earnings requires SSA to use monthly earnings amounts. To  facilitate our analysis, we calculated monthly earnings for each month in a  quarter by dividing the quarterly wage amount in the NDNH by 3. For  example, if the NDNH reported quarterly earnings of $3,000 in the first  quarter of 2010, we calculated the monthly earnings to be $1,000 for  January, February, and March of 2010. This monthly computed earnings  amount could differ from the actual monthly earnings. For instance, using  the previous example, the actual monthly earnings in January 2010 could  be $3,000, and actual earnings in February or March could be $0.  Second, when SSA evaluates earnings to determine SGA for DI  beneficiaries, SSA counts earnings when they are earned, not paid;  however, amounts of earnings on the NDNH for a particular quarter could  be paid in that quarter, but earned in prior quarters. In addition to these  timing limitations, the NDNH quarterly earnings data may contain  payments not related to work activity, such as paid time off, long-term  disability payments, or posttermination compensation; however, SSA\u2019s  assessment of SGA generally involves doing significant physical or  mental activities, rather than receiving payments not related to work.", "To account for these limitations, we drew a simple random sample from  each of the potential overpayment populations and contacted the  employers that reported the earnings to determine the exact timing,  amount, and nature of the earnings for the beneficiaries in our sample.

Table 1 shows the amount of monthly  earnings that trigger a trial work period month for calendar years 2001\u2013 2012.", "The amount of monthly earnings considered as SGA depends on whether  a person\u2019s disability is for blindness or some other condition. The Social  Security Act specifies a higher SGA amount for statutorily blind  individuals and a lower SGA amount for nonblind individuals. Both SGA  amounts generally change with changes in the national average wage  index. Table 2 shows the amount of monthly earnings that ordinarily  demonstrate SGA for calendar years 2001\u20132012."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Social Security Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
