DHS component officials GAO met with identified examples of key initiatives that they have completed or have under way to enhance small vessel security, including an initiative to help CBP better track small vessels arriving from foreign locations and another to assist the Coast Guard in assessing and monitoring small vessel launch sites. Although the SVSS Implementation Plan states that DHS is to assess and update the plan, DHS has not determined the progress its components and other relevant stakeholders--such as the Department of Defense--are making in completing the action items and has no current plans to do so. DHS officials stated that this is due, in part, to budget constraints that make this a low priority. DHS officials stated that updating the SVSS Implementation Plan would be valuable, and doing so is particularly important since more than one component could be responsible for action items in the plan. Accordingly, by systematically gathering information from its components and other relevant stakeholders to regularly update the progress they are making in addressing the action items in the plan, DHS could help prioritize initiatives given constrained budgets and better identify successes and lessons learned, among other things."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS regularly update the progress its components and other relevant stakeholders are making in addressing action items in the SVSS Implementation Plan .

Consequently, law enforcement agencies face the  challenge of distinguishing between the vast number of legitimate small  vessel operators and the comparatively few individuals that are estimated  to be engaged in illicit activities. On any given day, small vessels share  waterways with commercial and military vessels, operating at hundreds of  U.S. ports and waterways. According to the Coast Guard\u2019s Strategy for  Maritime Safety, Security, and Stewardship, a small vessel represents  one of the greatest risks from terrorism in the maritime domain. Further,  small vessels have the potential to be used to smuggle terrorists or  weapons of mass destruction into the United States. According to the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the consequences of a weapon  of mass destruction attack in the United States could be catastrophic, and  potentially include the loss of life, direct and indirect economic costs, and  adverse environmental effects, including the contamination of the impact  area with subsequent loss of its use for decades.", "Recognizing the risks posed by terrorists using small vessels to attack  targets or as a conveyance for terrorists and their contraband to enter the  United States, DHS issued its Small Vessel Security Strategy (SVSS) in  April 2008 and its follow-on SVSS Implementation Plan in January 2011  to help guide its efforts to mitigate the security risks arising from small  vessels. components that have a key role in addressing small vessel security,  including the U.S. Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection (CBP),  DHS\u2019s Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate, and DHS\u2019s Domestic  Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO), as well as other federal stakeholders.For more information on the roles and responsibilities of these DHS  components, see appendix I.

In these meetings, we also  discussed key initiatives that each of the four DHS components\u2019 have in  place to address small vessel security and reviewed related documents  on these initiatives. Although these initiatives relate to the overarching  goals of the SVSS, each initiative is not directly aligned with a specific  action item in the SVSS Implementation Plan.

In addition, we conducted visits to  two ports\u2014San Diego, California and Miami, Florida\u2014to interview port  security stakeholders and observe small vessel security activities. We  selected these ports on the basis of various factors, including the (1)  relatively high volume of small vessel traffic and (2) initiatives initiated at  these ports by DHS components to address small vessel security risks. At  these ports, we interviewed officials from local Coast Guard units, as well  as from CBP\u2019s Office of Field Operations and Office of Air and Marine.

Although there have not been any small vessel attacks in  the United States, terrorists have used small vessels to facilitate their  attacks, such as those on the USS Cole in 2000 (see fig. 1), the French  oil tanker Limburg in Yemen in 2002, and the Japanese tanker M Star in  2010.

Small vessels have also been successfully employed by pirates  to hijack international cargo vessels, and at least three cruise ships have  been attacked by pirates aboard small vessels who were armed with  automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades.", "In addition, DHS reported that small vessels have the potential to be used  to smuggle weapons of mass destruction into the United States.  According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, from 1993 through  2012, there were 2,331 confirmed incidents of illicit trafficking of nuclear  and other radioactive material. Although these incidents do not all  involve the use of small vessels, the former commandant of the Coast  Guard testified that small vessels pose a greater threat than cargo  containers for smuggling nuclear materials. In addition, DHS reported  that there is limited ability to screen small vessels for weapons of mass  destruction, and as a result, small vessels could be used by terrorists to  transport such weapons. In January 2009, we reported that DNDO had  developed and tested equipment for detecting nuclear material on small  vessels, but that efforts to use this equipment in a port area had been   We further reported that DNDO had not  limited to pilot programs.established a detailed plan to address gaps and vulnerabilities and  recommended that DHS develop a plan to help ensure the future success  of initiatives aimed at closing gaps and vulnerabilities and that this plan  should focus on, among other things, small vessels. To address this  recommendation, DHS issued a strategic plan in December 2010 and an  implementation plan in April 2012."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Small Vessels Are Generally Unregulated", "paragraphs": ["Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, maritime enforcement  efforts have been primarily focused on large commercial vessels (over  300 gross tons), while federal efforts to address small vessels are more  limited. In particular, large commercial vessel security is governed by  Coast Guard regulations issued pursuant to the Maritime Transportation  Security Act of 2002 and other relevant legislation. For example, certain  larger vessels are required to submit information\u2014in advance of U.S.  arrival or departure\u2014on crew members, passengers, cargo, and vessel  operations.to conduct risk-based analyses and gain a greater awareness of large   This advance information allows the Coast Guard and CBP  commercial vessel operations, their passengers, and their crews. In  addition, certain large commercial vessels are also required to carry and  operate transponders\u2014such as an automatic identification system\u2014 which broadcast information on the vessels and their locations, allowing  authorities to track their movements. In contrast, small vessels are  generally exempt from these requirements. As a result, the federal  government has limited knowledge regarding the owners and locations of  small vessels.", "Although small vessels are generally unregulated, the federal government  has put in place some requirements for these vessels. For example, small  vessel operators traveling to foreign ports or places are required to report  to CBP upon their return to the United States.  However, CBP estimates  that a small percentage of the international small vessel traffic returning to  the United States actually report this information. According to CBP, this  low level of compliance is due, in part, to a lack of (1) public awareness of  the reporting requirements, and (2) inspections to emphasize and ensure  compliance. CBP has taken actions to help address this issue as part of  its Small Vessel Reporting System initiative, which is discussed later in  this report. At the international level, the International Maritime  Organization issued guidelines in 2008 regarding the security of small  vessels that are not subject to the International Ship and Port Facility  Security Code, but these guidelines are voluntary.", "In March 2009, we reported on the challenges of tracking small vessels  using available technologies. For example, we reported that although  the Coast Guard and other agencies may have technology systems that  can track small vessels within some ports, these did not always work in  bad weather or at night. Further, we reported that even with systems in  place to track small vessels, there is agreement among maritime  stakeholders that it is difficult to detect threatening activity by small  vessels without prior knowledge of a planned attack. Ultimately, DHS  documents report that the U.S. government has only limited knowledge  about international recreational boaters and their travel patterns.", "According to the SVSS, in the United States, there is a tradition and  expectation among small vessel operators to generally have unrestricted  access to U.S. waterways. In addition, small vessel operators have  expressed concerns about the cost of requirements that would allow the  government to track their movements. For example, DHS conducted  outreach efforts with the small vessel community while developing the  SVSS, and DHS reported that small vessel operators and national  recreational vessel associations expressed concern that the cost of  transponders would present an objectionable burden for recreational  boaters. Accordingly, DHS faces a challenge in balancing the collection of  information necessary for the proper assessment of risks posed by small  vessels with the freedom of the seas expected by small vessel operators."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Development of the SVSS and SVSS Implementation Plan", "paragraphs": ["In June 2007, DHS held an initial small vessel security summit to engage  private, commercial, and government stakeholders in discussions on a  range of issues involving the security risks posed by small vessels in the  U.S. maritime environment. During this summit, the stakeholders that  attended provided numerous recommendations to DHS, including a  recommendation that DHS develop a national strategy regarding small  vessel security. In response to this recommendation, DHS convened the  Small Vessel Security Working Group in August 2007, which consisted of  representatives from DHS components, such as the Coast Guard, CBP,  and the Transportation Security Administration, as well as participation by  representatives from the Departments of Justice and Defense. The  working group developed the SVSS in April 2008 to address the potential  for small vessels to be used (1) to smuggle terrorists or weapons,  including weapons of mass destruction, into the United States; (2) as a  standoff weapon platform; or (3) as a direct attack method to deliver a  waterborne improvised explosive device. The four overarching goals\u2014 which include more specific objectives\u2014of the SVSS are to develop and leverage a strong partnership with the small vessel  community and public and private sectors in order to enhance  maritime domain awareness; enhance maritime security and safety based on a coherent plan with a  layered, innovative approach; leverage technology to enhance the ability to detect; determine intent;  and, when necessary, interdict small vessels; and enhance coordination, cooperation, and communications between  federal, state, local and tribal partners and the private sector, as well  as international partners.", "DHS subsequently issued the SVSS Implementation Plan in January  2011.subject matter experts at DHS components to provide input on what  action items should be included.

In May 2010, CBP developed this  voluntary, online program to enable small vessel operators to expedite  the reporting of their foreign voyages to and planned arrivals in the  United States. This program is intended to allow CBP to assess the  risks for known small vessels and associated passengers in advance  of arrival in the United States and, as a result, make it easier to  identify suspicious or unknown small vessels.", "West Coast Maritime Pilot.

For example, federal and local port security  stakeholders at one of the ports we visited stated that their joint  operations center has helped them coordinate security operations, such  as the security boarding of small vessels. According to Coast Guard  officials, the Coast Guard performed 11,399 small vessel security  boardings in 2012, and with the assistance of other port security  stakeholders, an additional 789 small vessels security boardings were  conducted that year. In addition, in one of the ports we visited, the  Coast Guard and local law enforcement officials developed a  memorandum of understanding to conduct joint boardings of small  vessels.

The SVSS Implementation Plan states that  DHS is to assess and update the plan annually and focus on realigning  the plan with the activities under way by its components and other federal  agencies. The SVSS Implementation Plan directs that this review is also  to (1) eliminate short-term action items that have been completed over  the previous year; (2) transition action items from long-term to short-term  status, as appropriate; and (3) augment the plan with new action items.  Since the SVSS Implementation Plan was issued in 2011, however,  neither DHS nor its components are tracking progress on the action items  in the plan.", "Officials we spoke with from four of the key DHS components that have  responsibility for leading the majority of the action items in the SVSS  Implementation Plan (the Coast Guard, CBP, DNDO, and DHS S&T)  stated that while they are tracking efforts and initiatives of their  component-specific missions that may address risks posed by small  vessels, they are not systematically tracking these efforts as they relate to  the specific action items listed in the plan. After the SVSS Implementation  Plan was issued, the Coast Guard conducted a one-time review in  November 2011 of the action items in the plan where it was identified as a  lead or colead. This review included information on the status of  preexisting or planned Coast Guard initiatives that were related to each  action item and which action items were determined to not be  implementable.", "DHS officials we spoke with stated that there is no plan to update the  SVSS Implementation Plan because it is not a priority, given budget  constraints, and it is too early to measure the effectiveness of action  items in the plan. According to a senior DHS Policy official, although the  SVSS Implementation Plan states that DHS should assess and update  the plan annually, given these constraints, an annual review is too  frequent. The senior DHS official added that per the Secretary of  Homeland Security\u2019s direction, DHS components are focusing on  maintaining their ongoing operations under constrained budgets, and so  efforts to update the SVSS Implementation Plan are not currently a  priority. For example, Coast Guard officials we met with stated that, in  many instances, the ability to expand certain efforts in scope or scale so  as to more effectively address small vessel security risks may be  dependent on the funding of particular port programs or the availability of  related grant funding, which can be affected by budget constraints. Coast  Guard officials added that America\u2019s Waterway Watch\u2014a program  highlighted in the SVSS Implementation Plan that provides outreach to  the public, including the small vessel community, on awareness of threats  and how to report suspicious activity\u2014may not receive funding in DHS\u2019s  fiscal year 2014 appropriation.", "DHS officials also stated that because the SVSS Implementation Plan  was issued in early 2011, it is too early to expect a majority of the action  items to be completed or, especially for the long-term action items, to  have been implemented. These officials stated that accomplishing the  SVSS\u2019s goals and objectives through implementation of the many action  items in the SVSS Implementation Plan will require a significant  investment of time and resources, along with buy-in from state and local  maritime security stakeholders. Accordingly, it could take years to fully  implement some of the action items and determine whether they are  effective. Further, according to DHS officials, not all action items listed in  the SVSS Implementation Plan may be feasible or implemented at all port  locations nationally. For example, Coast Guard officials we met with  stated that while the placement of floating security barriers is an effective  security strategy used by the U.S. Navy to protect certain high-value  assets (see fig. 3), it would not be economically feasible to install such  barriers at all ports because they would have to be designed for the  specific characteristics and needs of each port location.", "DHS officials involved with the SVSS Working Group, as well as officials  from four of the DHS components we spoke with, stated that receiving  updates on progress or lessons learned from efforts to implement the  action items in the SVSS Implementation Plan would be valuable  information. For example, officials we met with from DHS Policy and the  Coast Guard stated that they recognize the value in updating the  progress of the SVSS Implementation Plan to incorporate new  information about threats, changes in technologies, requirements, and  lessons learned as programs are assessed, prioritized, and implemented.  In addition, a Coast Guard port security specialist we met with at one of  the ports added that updating the progress of the plan could help DHS  better determine where to focus its research and development efforts and  prioritize the related funding and resources needs. Further, DNDO  officials we met with stated that there is value in understanding what  individual DHS components are implementing regarding the SVSS  Implementation Plan, as well as the methods and techniques that are  being used. The DNDO officials added that obtaining a common  understanding of ongoing efforts to implement related initiatives could  prevent duplication of effort, provide a means of sharing lessons learned  among components, and potentially save time and resources. DHS S&T  officials we met with similarly stated that there is value in learning about  the overall progress of the SVSS Implementation Plan and that, to do this  effectively, this information needs to be collected in a more systematic  way and then be made widely available to all the agencies involved.", "Although it may be too early to measure the effectiveness of some action  items in the SVSS Implementation Plan, updating the progress made in  addressing the action items could help DHS and its components prioritize  their efforts given constrained budgets; better identify successes and  lessons learned; and enhance collaboration with federal, state, and local  stakeholders regarding small vessel security issues. The SVSS  Implementation Plan states that, because of risk, the unpredictability of  budgets, policy changes, and administrative priorities, the plan must be  reviewed regularly to ensure that it remains current and accurate. By  engaging in this review process, the plan states that it is intended to be a  living document that provides a strategic overview of participating  agencies\u2019 implementation of the SVSS. Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government calls for federal agencies to design and  implement control activities to enforce management\u2019s directives.  Further, the SVSS Implementation Plan calls for DHS to assess and  update the plan to determine the progress that has been made to address  the action items in the plan. This provision is a control activity to help  ensure the achievement of the goals and objectives of the SVSS. The  SVSS Implementation Plan calls for this review to be conducted annually,  but given resource constraints and the time it will take to complete some  of the action items, less frequent but regular assessments may be  warranted. By systematically gathering information from its components  and other relevant stakeholders to update the action items in the SVSS  Implementation Plan on a regular basis, DHS would be better able to  monitor progress against the plan and the goals and objectives of the  SVSS. This is particularly important given that more than one agency or  component may be responsible for addressing action items in the plan  and because, according to DHS officials, accomplishing the SVSS\u2019s goals  and objectives will require a significant investment of time and resources.  According to key management practices, for agency efforts that require a  substantial commitment and that could take years to complete, it is  essential to track implementation goals to pinpoint performance shortfalls  and gaps and suggest any needed corrections.

As a continuing Coast Guard initiative, Focused Lens is  intended to increase awareness of suspicious activity in and around U.S.  ports. In particular, Focused Lens is intended to assist Coast Guard units  in preventing small vessel attacks in their areas of operation by directing  additional resources and efforts toward the most likely points of origin for  a small vessel attack, such as marinas and vessel ramps. Focused Lens  relates to the SVSS goals, particularly the goal to develop and leverage a  strong partnership with the small vessel community and public and private  sectors.", "Phase 1 activities can be conducted by the Coast Guard, the Coast Guard Auxiliary (a  voluntary organization), or local law enforcement officials. Under the pilot initiative, District  Eleven identified any location that could be used as a launch site. The expansion of  Focused Lens is limited to identifying and assessing privately owned or public access  marinas and boat launch ramps, per the guidance of local Coast Guard officials.", "Risk Analysis Model (MSRAM). A MSRAM analyst is to evaluate the  data to determine the potential of the launch sites to be used by terrorists  based on the various attributes, and prioritize the launch sites  accordingly. In phase 3, the Coast Guard is to decide on where to  conduct security activities (i.e., boarding small vessels, conducting  surveillance patrols, or promoting citizen awareness programs) based on  the prioritization of the launch sites. These security activities are to be  conducted at the discretion of Coast Guard officials in their specific areas  of operation to prevent and deter terrorist activity.", "The Coast Guard does not have a requirement to conduct operations in support of  Focused Lens. Such operations are left to the Coast Guard officials responsible for  determining which activities to undertake given the MSRAM analysis of launch sites."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Small Vessel Reporting System", "paragraphs": ["CBP developed the Small Vessel Reporting System (SVRS)\u2014a  voluntary, online program for small vessel operators and passengers  (participants) to report their foreign travels\u2014to better track small vessels  and make it easier to identify suspicious or unknown vessels. To enroll in  the SVRS program, participants are to first complete an online application  and then make an appointment for a face-to-face interview with a CBP  officer who verifies the information provided and, if needed, obtains their  digital fingerprints and photograph. Once enrolled, participants are able  to submit float plans for their intended international travel online. By  doing so, participants can expedite the process for reporting their  intended arrivals from foreign locations and may not have to appear in  person for inspection by CBP officers each time they enter the United  States.", "Since the SVRS enables CBP to capture certain biographical and vessel  data much earlier than upon a vessel\u2019s arrival at the United States from a  foreign location, CBP can review this information to identify potential high- risk small vessels and determine, in advance of the vessels\u2019 arrival, if a  face-to-face inspection may need to be conducted. A CBP official we met  with who is familiar with the SVRS stated that if the SVRS is used by a  participant, CBP inspection officers will be better able to determine if a  face-to-face inspection is needed and, if so, what level of resources is  needed to conduct an inspection upon the participant entering the United  States. Further, CBP officials we spoke with at one of the ports we visited  stated that the SVRS enables them to increase the amount of time CBP  officers are spending in the field to conduct enforcement activities by  limiting the amount of time officers spend collecting and entering data  from boaters reporting their arrival by phone. The SVRS relates to the  goals of the SVSS, particularly the goal of enhancing maritime security  and safety through the implementation of advanced data submission  procedures and efforts to increase reporting compliance.", "The SVRS was initially piloted in Miami, Florida, in May 2010. Miami was  selected as the pilot location because of the large population of small  vessels operating in that area. The pilot was made available to  participants already enrolled in a local CBP registered traveler program.  Later in 2010, the SVRS pilot was expanded to additional CBP field  offices covering southern Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin  Islands. In May 2011, CBP further expanded the pilot to include five  additional field offices\u2014Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, Detroit, and Seattle\u2014 and eligibility was also expanded to include all U.S. and Canadian  citizens, among others. As of October 2011, the SVRS pilot was  deployed to all CBP field offices nationwide with the exception of two\u2014El  Paso and Tucson\u2014that do not have a nexus to water. According to CBP,  as of May 28, 2013, the number of participants enrolled in the SVRS had  grown to 30,190, along with a total of 5,862 float plans submitted, and  11,189 vessels registered, as shown in table 2.", "As of May 2013, three CBP field office locations\u2014Miami and Tampa,  Florida, and San Juan, Puerto Rico\u2014accounted for 79 percent of the  SVRS registrants. CBP officials attributed this to the fact that the SVRS  pilot originated in these locations and the number of small vessels  operating in these locations is very high relative to the number in other  locations. CBP officials added that the number of SVRS registrations is  not very high in some locations and noted that CBP is attempting to  address challenges to implementing the SVRS in other locations. For  example, CBP officials we met with at one of the ports we visited stated  that, as of April 2013, a total of 14 people had enrolled in the SVRS at  their location and a few float plans had been submitted. The CBP officials  stated that they believed these numbers were low, in part, because of the  lack of publicity regarding the SVRS program. CBP officials added that  CBP is in the process of increasing its efforts to promote the SVRS  through various community outreach efforts at a number of locations in an  attempt to expand public awareness and increase use of the SVRS  among small vessel operators and passengers. Finally, CBP officials told  us that because of the proximity of many locations along the U.S. border  to Canada, a trip between the two countries may require only a few  minutes to complete. As a result, a program to expedite the reporting  process is already being utilized in this region, thereby negating the need  to register in the SVRS.determining whether modifications can be made to the SVRS in an effort  to increase its use in this region."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "West Coast Maritime Pilot", "paragraphs": ["DNDO conducted the West Coast Maritime Pilot (WCMP) program from  September 2007 to December 2010.

The  final report for one of the pilot locations stated that more than 250  additional radiation detectors were deployed, new training materials were  developed, and training was provided to over 400 emergency responders.  Further, the final report for the other pilot location stated that the number  of agency boats conducting PRND screenings of small vessels has more  than doubled and the number of screenings has increased significantly  because of leveraging the resources and expertise of state, local, and  tribal agencies. These reports also stated that the participating agencies  successfully detected the presence of radiological or nuclear materials  transported on small vessels during exercises. Additionally, according to  DNDO officials, the WCMP program demonstrated that it is possible for  maritime PRND operations to be integrated into the operations of law  enforcement and emergency responders with limited impact on their  duties.", "The final WCMP program reports also highlighted some challenges  related to the development of maritime PRND capability focused on small  vessels. For example, although these reports stated that the WCMP  program exercises proved successful, DNDO officials stated that reducing  the risk posed by small vessels containing illicit radiological or nuclear  materials in the real world is a challenge, in part because, at any given  time, there could be a large number of small vessels that would need to  be screened. DNDO reported that further analysis is needed at the port  level to determine the numbers and placement of PRND equipment and  operational tactics that would be most effective.", "Since completion of the pilots, DNDO has integrated the lessons learned  from the WCMP program to expand its maritime PRND program  assistance efforts in other regions around the country. For example,  according to DNDO officials, lessons learned from the WCMP program  were used to develop a regional maritime PRND program in Boston,  Massachusetts, and similar efforts are under way in Charleston, South  Carolina; Rochester, New York; and San Francisco, California. DNDO  also developed generic standard operating procedures for a regional  maritime PRND program and provided these to the Coast Guard for  potential distribution to all of the Area Maritime Security Committees  around the nation. Further, both WCMP programs in Puget Sound and  San Diego have been sustained with continued use of the equipment  from the pilot, and, according to DNDO officials, the maritime PRND  program in Puget Sound continues to grow with additional agencies  joining the effort and the number of boat-mounted detection systems in  the region increasing as well."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coastal Surveillance System", "paragraphs": ["DHS S&T is developing and piloting the Coastal Surveillance System   which is intended to improve (1) maritime domain awareness by  (CSS),tracking vessels in real time and (2) the interdiction of vessels involved in  illegal or illicit activities by identifying anomalies or suspicious behavior.
