Some policymakers have questioned the reasonableness of these timelines for children of incarcerated parents and expressed interest in how states work with these families.

GAO analyzed national data, reviewed federal policies, interviewed state child welfare and corrections officials in 10 selected states that contain almost half of the nation's prison and foster care populations, and visited local child welfare agencies and prisons."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Foster care children with an incarcerated parent are not a well-identified population, although they are likely to number in the tens of thousands. HHS data collected from states show that, in 2009 alone, more than 14,000 children entered foster care due at least partly to the incarceration of a parent. This may be an undercount, however, due to some underreporting from states and other factors. For instance, the data do not identify when a parent is incarcerated after the child entered foster care--a more common occurrence, according to case workers GAO interviewed. HHS is currently developing a proposal for new state reporting requirements on all foster care children; however, officials had not determined whether these new requirements would include more information collected from states on children with incarcerated parents. In 10 selected states, GAO found a range of strategies that support family ties. Some state child welfare agencies have provided guidance and training to caseworkers for managing such cases; and local agencies have worked with dependency courts to help inmates participate in child welfare hearings by phone or other means. For their part, some corrections agencies ease children's visits to prisons with special visitation hours and programs. In several cases, corrections agencies and child welfare agencies have collaborated, which has resulted in some interagency training for personnel, the creation of liaison staff positions, and video visitation facilitated by non-profit providers. HHS and DOJ each provide information and assistance to child welfare and corrections agencies on behalf of these children and families. For example, both federal agencies post information on their websites for practitioners working with children or their incarcerated parents, with some specific to foster care. The HHS information, however, was not always up to date or centrally organized, and officials from most of the state child welfare and corrections agencies GAO interviewed said they would benefit from information on how to serve these children. Further, DOJ has not developed protocols for federal prisons under its own jurisdiction for working with child welfare agencies and their staff, although GAO heard from some state and local child welfare officials that collaboration between child welfare and corrections agencies would facilitate their work with foster care children and their parents. This would also be in keeping with a DOJ agency goal to build partnerships with other entities to improve services and promote reintegration of offenders into communities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that HHS improve its data on the foster care children of incarcerated parents and that it more systematically disseminate information to child welfare agencies.

HHS and DOJ agreed with GAO's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Some of our nation\u2019s most vulnerable children are those who have been  removed from their homes and placed in foster care, often due to neglect  or abuse. At the end of fiscal year 2009, 423,773 children were in foster  care, according to the most recent available data from the Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS). Some researchers and advocates  maintain that there has been a growth in the number of foster care  children with an incarcerated parent, due in part to an increase in the  number of incarcerated mothers over the years. While incarcerated  fathers made up more than 90 percent of the 809,800 parents in prison in  2007, according to the most recent estimates from the Department of  Justice (DOJ), the number of mothers in prison more than doubled from  1991 to 2007 (29,500 to 65,600, respectively). Some researchers and  advocacy groups have also questioned whether child welfare and  corrections systems have overlooked the rehabilitation of these parents  and the assessment of opportunities to preserve family ties, when  appropriate. They have further raised concerns about whether federal  foster care timelines for filing to terminate parental rights\u2014intended to  place children more quickly into permanent adoptive homes\u2014have  inappropriately affected these families, given the length of time some  parents are incarcerated. Meanwhile, although states and local agencies  have primary responsibility for administering child welfare services, the  federal government provides about $8 billion annually to states for child  welfare programs, including for foster care programs. In addition,  corrections agencies at the local, state, and federal level may play a role  in efforts to establish bonds between incarcerated parents and their  children through their policies and programs.", "In this context, you asked us to address the following questions: (1) How  many children in foster care have an incarcerated parent? (2) What  strategies have child welfare and corrections agencies in selected states  used that could support contact or reunification, when appropriate,  between these children and their incarcerated parents? (3) In what ways  do HHS and DOJ help child welfare and corrections agencies in working  with these children and their incarcerated parents?", "To address these questions, we used several methodologies. First, we  reviewed relevant national data on foster care children maintained by  HHS and on incarcerated parents from surveys, administered by DOJ\u2019s  Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), of inmates in state and federal prisons  and local jails. We reviewed the methods and survey design used to  produce the data from both of these sources, as applicable, and, through  interviews with knowledgeable agency officials and our own analyses, we  determined that the data we used were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. Second, we conducted structured telephone interviews with  state administrators of child welfare and corrections agencies in 10  selected states to gather relevant information on the extent to which  states collect data on our target population, state policies and programs,  and officials\u2019 perspectives on challenges and areas in which additional  federal assistance would be useful. States were selected to represent  nearly half of the prison inmates and foster care children in the United  States and for geographic variation. Some states were also selected  because they had been identified by researchers and professionals  knowledgeable on these topics as having strategies (policies, programs,  or practices) aimed at supporting parent-child ties either statewide or in  localities within the state. For these 10 states, we also reviewed selected  child welfare statutes and other policies. Third, to gather more in-depth  information at the local level, we conducted site visits in 4 of the 10 states  and interviewed local child welfare officials and caseworkers; dependency  court judges; corrections staff primarily from prison facilities as well as a  few jails; community service providers; and, in a few cases, incarcerated  parents and former foster care youth. The information we gathered from  our phone interviews and site visits is not generalizable to all states and  localities. In addition, while we collected information about relevant  strategies used in our selected states, we did not review how widespread  these were practiced in each state. Fourth, we interviewed HHS and DOJ  officials knowledgeable about pertinent agency activities and reviewed  relevant federal laws, regulations, policies and other agency  documentation. Last, we interviewed researchers and professionals from  a range of national organizations, including family resource centers,  corrections associations, and child welfare organizations, and reviewed  available literature from these groups.

Children in foster care may be temporarily placed in various types of out- of-home care arrangements, including in a foster home with relatives, in a  foster home with nonrelatives, or in a group residential setting. Federal  law requires that state child welfare agencies consider giving preference  to placing children with qualified relatives, if consistent with the best  interest of the child. Approximately one-quarter of children in foster care  in fiscal year 2009 lived with relatives, according to HHS data.", "Federal law also requires child welfare agencies to make \u201creasonable  efforts\u201d to preserve and reunify families in most cases, but leaves it to  states to define what these efforts entail, on a case by case basis.  However, at a minimum, child welfare agencies must make a diligent  effort to identify and notify all adult relatives shortly after the child\u2019s  removal from the custody of the parent. They must also develop a case  plan for each foster care child which, among other requirements, must  describe the services that will be provided to the parents, child, and foster  parents to facilitate the child\u2019s return to his or her own home or permanent  placement, and address the child\u2019s needs while in foster care. The plan  may also specify goals for placing the child in a permanent home and the  steps that a parent (or the principal caretaker) must take before a child  can be returned home, if reunification is the goal.", "In general, returning children to their home is the preferred goal of state  child welfare agencies, but this goal is still dependent on various factors,  such as the extent that a parent has completed rehabilitative treatment or  maintained a meaningful role in the child\u2019s life through visits or other  forms of contact. In fiscal year 2009, about half of the nation\u2019s children  who exited foster care were reunified with their parent or primary  caretaker (see table 1).", "The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (ASFA) was passed, in part,  in response to concerns about the length of time children were spending  in foster care and included provisions to facilitate child welfare agencies\u2019  ability to place children more quickly into safe and permanent homes.  For example, the law requires child welfare agencies to hold permanency  hearings within 12 months of the child\u2019s entering foster care to determine  the permanent placement for the child and requires child welfare  agencies to file a petition to terminate parental rights when a child has  been in foster care for 15 of the most recent 22 months (see fig. 1).  However, states are not required to file for termination of parental rights if  a child is in the care of relatives, the state has not provided necessary  services to the family consistent with the case plan, or the state agency  documents a compelling reason why filing for termination is not in the  best interests of the child. These timelines and possible exceptions are  relevant for incarcerated parents who have children in foster care, as 44  percent of inmates released from state prisons in 2008 served sentences  longer than a year. Since the enactment of ASFA, the number of  children in foster care nationwide has declined by more than 100,000,  based on HHS data collected on children in care at the end of each fiscal  year.", "HHS administers federal grant programs and provides information,  training, and technical assistance to state child welfare systems. It uses  its Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS)  to capture, report, and analyze information collected by the states. On a  semiannual basis, all states submit data to HHS concerning all foster care  children for whom state child welfare agencies have responsibility for  placement, care, or supervision. HHS also uses its Child and Family  Services Reviews (CFSR) to regularly evaluate state child welfare  systems\u2019 conformity with federal requirements and help states improve  their provision of child welfare services. These reviews examine a range  of outcomes and actions to assess states\u2019 performance and enhance their  capacity to ensure children\u2019s safety, permanency, and well-being. For  example, among many other factors, HHS examines states\u2019 attempts to  preserve parent-child relationships and involve parents in discussions  about the child\u2019s case plan. To help states provide child welfare services,  HHS offers states training and technical assistance through its Children\u2019s  Bureau, as well as through its regional offices and various National  Resource Centers.

As of 2007, an estimated 1.7 million children under the age of  18 had a parent in prison\u2014an increase of almost 80 percent since 1991  (see fig. 2). Fathers comprise more than 90 percent of the parents in  prison and their numbers increased about 75 percent between 1991 and  2007. Meanwhile, the number of incarcerated mothers, who were more  likely to be primary caretakers before incarceration, more than doubled  during this time. Children who are minorities are disproportionately more  likely to have an incarcerated parent than white children.

For instance, in 2004,  about two-thirds of parents in state prisons met clinical criteria for having  substance dependence or abuse based on BJS\u2019s most recent available  estimates. The federal government supports a number of residential  treatment programs that focus specifically on the treatment of parents  with substance abuse problems. Although these programs may require  parents with substance abuse problems to live away from home, they  generally serve nonincarcerated parents. (See app. II for more  information.)

Incarcerated mothers were also much more likely than fathers to report  past physical or sexual abuse (64 percent for mothers in state prison  versus 16 percent for fathers).", "The Second Chance Act of 2007 was enacted to, among other goals,  reduce recidivism and provide for services to assist people transitioning  back into the community from prisons and jails.

Through its national data system,  AFCARS, HHS collects information about the characteristics and  experiences of children in the foster care system, such as their age, race,  and the factors associated with their removal from the home and  placement into foster care. One potential reason for a child\u2019s removal,  among many others listed in AFCARS, is the incarceration of a parent.  From this information, it is possible to identify some foster care children  with an incarcerated parent\u2014those who have entered foster care solely  or in part for the reason of parental incarceration\u2014but it is not possible to  identify these children in other circumstances (see figure 3). Our analysis  of AFCARS information identified approximately 14,000 children who  entered foster care at least partly because of parental incarceration in  2009 alone (about 8 percent of all children entering foster care in 2009);  however, this is an undercount of foster care children with an incarcerated  parent for several reasons. First, this number does not include children  who enter foster care in other circumstances, such as:  \uf0b7  When a parent is incarcerated sometime before the child enters foster  care. For example, a child welfare official and a researcher told us  that some children are placed with a relative when a parent is  incarcerated, and then enter foster care when this relative-care  situation places the child at risk of abuse or neglect. \uf0b7  When a parent is incarcerated sometime after the child enters foster  care. \uf0b7  When an incarcerated parent, such as a noncustodial father, was not  the child\u2019s caretaker at the time of removal.", "Researchers and local officials we interviewed noted that these  circumstances were more common than placement in foster care  specifically due to parental incarceration. While such additional  information about a parent\u2019s incarceration may be in the child\u2019s individual  child welfare case file, it is not reported in the data conveyed to HHS and  incorporated into AFCARS.", "Second, state reporting on these children for AFCARS is not necessarily  as complete as HHS requires. For example:  \uf0b7  HHS\u2019s AFCARS regulations require state child welfare caseworkers to  report all applicable actions or conditions associated with a child\u2019s  removal from the home, but staff sometimes enter only one reason.  One state official and one local official told us that, even if   incarceration were involved, a case worker may opt for a more  general reason, such as neglect.  \uf0b7  New York, which has the second largest foster care population in the  United States, has historically not reported data on any reasons for  removal due to some localities\u2019 older data systems, according to HHS  officials. \uf0b7  Similarly, a few states can report information on only one reason for  removal due to older data systems and, therefore, have not regularly  reported instances in which a second reason might apply.", "HHS officials noted that the department assists state efforts to comply  with AFCARS reporting requirements in several ways. For example, HHS  has assessed most states\u2019 AFCARS information systems to determine  states\u2019 abilities to collect, extract, and transmit AFCARS data accurately,  as well as to review the timeliness and accuracy of data entry by  caseworkers. When an HHS review team determines that a state does  not fully satisfy the AFCARS standards, the state must make corrections  identified by that team. HHS regional offices also work with states to  improve their reporting by implementing training, supervisory oversight,  and quality assurance, according to HHS officials.", "The fact that foster care children of incarcerated parents are not a well-  identified population nationally precludes analyzing those children\u2019s  characteristics and experiences, or determining whether they differ from  other foster care children in terms of their backgrounds, case  management, or outcomes.", "Acknowledging that much of AFCARS information on the family\u2019s  circumstances is gathered only at the time a child enters foster care\u2014 when child welfare workers know the least about the family\u2019s situation\u2014 HHS, in January 2008, proposed changing its state reporting  requirements to require both additional and more current information.  Specifically, the department proposed collecting additional data on  circumstances that affect the child and family, such as a caretaker\u2019s  incarceration, at multiple times throughout a foster care case. However,  due to significant statutory amendments made in October 2008 to the  federal foster care and adoption assistance programs, in 2010, HHS  announced plans to publish a new proposal to revise AFCARS and  solicited suggestions about what case-level data would be important for  agencies to collect and report to HHS. HHS officials told us that they are  currently developing the new proposal for reporting requirements and  estimated that it would be issued for public comment in February 2012.  Officials had not yet determined whether the new proposed rule would  include the same requirements on gathering additional information on a  caretaker\u2019s incarceration at multiple times throughout the foster care case  as had been included in the 2008 proposal.

Specifically, based on the 2004 survey of  federal and state prison inmates, we estimate that about 19,300 inmates  (about 13,700 men and 5,600 women) had at least one child in foster or  agency care in 2004 and that the total number of these children likely  exceeded 22,800. Similarly, a 2002 survey of inmates in local jails  estimated that approximately 12,000 of these parents in jail had at least  one child in foster care or cared for through an agency in 2002. These  surveys asked a nationally representative sample of inmates about their  children, the care arrangements for those children, and other questions  regarding their families\u2019 circumstances and experiences. The surveys  also found that a higher percentage of mothers have at least one child in  foster care; some state officials said that this is because fewer  incarcerated mothers, compared to incarcerated fathers, have the option  of having the other parent take care of the child (see figure 4).

For example, Michigan officials reported holding a  statewide webinar and providing information to local agencies after the  Michigan Supreme Court reversed the termination of parental rights for an  incarcerated parent because, among other reasons, the child welfare  agency failed to provide sufficient reunification services.", "State and local officials we interviewed reported a number of local  initiatives that have been undertaken by child welfare agencies,  dependency courts, and correctional facilities to address the logistical  barriers, expense, and disincentives involved when including an inmate in  a child\u2019s foster care case. For example, when the prison facility is located  far from a county dependency court, transportation can be costly and  require an extended absence from the facility. In the latter case, the  parent can lose certain privileges or programming opportunities,  according to child welfare and corrections officials. To address these  barriers, dependency courts and several state prisons in Los Angeles,  California, initiated, under a recently enacted state law, a pilot program  that allows an inmate to participate in certain child welfare hearings via  videoconference. Additionally, a few counties in Florida and  Pennsylvania, while not guided by legislation, have begun to hold child  welfare hearings via video or telephone for incarcerated parents,  according to state officials. State officials we interviewed in Nebraska,  Florida, and Michigan and local officials in California also described  holding a child\u2019s case planning meetings at the jail or including the parent  by phone in some situations. Further, to address some of the logistical  barriers to contact between these parents and their children, several local  child welfare agencies in New York and California said they used  assistants to help drive children to prisons or to supervise parent-child  visits. State child welfare officials in a few other states also said that they  had policies to provide prepaid phone cards to incarcerated parents or  policies to accept collect calls from the parents to discuss their child\u2019s  case."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Corrections Agencies Provided Programs and Facilitated Parent-Child Visits and Communication", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Parenting and Rehabilitation Programs", "paragraphs": ["Officials with correctional departments we interviewed offered a range of  services to their general inmate populations relevant to parent  rehabilitation, such as parenting programs and substance abuse  treatment.

Officials at all 10 state departments of correction we interviewed  reported having parenting classes in at least at a few facilities, although  most said such classes sometimes had wait lists and some were only at  women\u2019s facilities. These parenting classes have been aimed at the  general inmate population, although officials from a few facilities we  visited told us that their parenting classes have covered the topic of  parental rights, which may be more applicable to parents with children in  foster care. Further, state corrections officials from Nebraska and Oregon  told us that their agencies had taken steps to align their parenting  curricula to meet child welfare standards and prevent parents from having  to retake these classes to satisfy child welfare requirements upon  release.", "Some corrections agencies we interviewed also administered treatment  programs that allow incarcerated mothers to live with their young children  who were not in foster care. For instance, some BOP facilities allow  incarcerated women who are pregnant and meet certain criteria to go to a  community program outside the facility for 3 months after the child is born  in order to promote bonding and parenting skills. Likewise, officials in five  states reported having in-prison nurseries or similar programs in at least  one of their correctional facilities. In these programs, mothers live with  their infants at the facility for a period of time after birth, up to 18 months,  often receiving treatment and services, such as pre- and post-natal care,  parenting classes, and counseling. Eligibility criteria for mothers may  include being classified as a low security risk or having a limited amount  of remaining time on their sentence. A state prison official commented  that their facility\u2019s 18-month nursery program affords mothers time to  make amends with family members who may be more willing to care for  the children while the mother completes her sentence. According to this  official, most of these mothers give their infants to family caregivers  without involving the child welfare system. In addition, state corrections  agencies in California and Nebraska have allowed young children to live  with their parents in residential drug treatment programs as an alternative  to incarceration. For example, since 1999, California\u2019s corrections  department has administered the Family Foundations Program which  provides substance abuse treatment and other services to mothers with  nonviolent convictions and sentences of 36 months or less.", "Some corrections agencies had general policies or programs to mitigate  the distance between prisoners and their families. Experts, advocates,  and officials from both child welfare and correctional agencies we  interviewed noted that the distance between incarcerated parents and  their families was a major challenge for preserving family ties, particularly  as prisons tend to be located far from urban areas. State corrections  agencies in California, Pennsylvania, and Florida have formal policies to  consider the location of an inmate\u2019s family when assigning the inmate to a  facility. Circumstances such as mental health or security needs take  precedent over proximity to family, according to officials, and such  policies were generally not realizable for women due to the limited  number of female prison facilities. In addition, some corrections agencies  provided free bus transportation for families to visit inmates. For example,  New York and Pennsylvania\u2019s departments of correction provide free or  subsidized bus transportation between large cities and prison facilities  hours away for children and adults visiting inmates.", "The Osborne Association (Osborne), a  nonprofit community provider, working with  the New York Department of Corrections  recently set up video conferencing for  children to \u2018visit\u2019 with their incarcerated  parents. Osborne currently has an  agreement to conduct tele-visits with one  state women\u2019s prison.  Fifteen to 20 children  from 2\u201317 years of age currently participate  to varying levels in tele-visits lasting 45  minutes to an hour, according to Osborne  staff. During visits, parents and children  usually participate in activities or crafts  together similar to an in-person visit.", "Further, because on-site visits were not always possible, a few  correctional facilities in California, New York, and Pennsylvania were  starting to use technology so that incarcerated parents could visit virtually  with their children. Children participate through video equipment located  at community service organizations or other sites such as local parole  offices.", "Also, most corrections agencies had strategies to make visiting prisons  more comfortable for children, sometimes specifically for foster care  children. Officials representing seven different state departments of  correction, as well as federal BOP officials, said that some of their  facilities (often at least half) had special child-friendly visiting areas\u2014 particularly for women\u2019s facilities. Several corrections agencies also had  special procedures and trained staff to meet visiting children at the  correctional facility entrance and guide them through a separate  screening process. Also, corrections agencies in New York, California,  Nebraska, and Colorado had specific policies for caseworkers and foster  care children, such as visiting hours on weekdays in addition to usual  weekend visitation so that caseworkers can transport the children.", "Extended visitation programs that allow parents and children to visit within  the prison for longer periods of time, such as a full day or week, were  offered in at least a few facilities within 8 of our 10 states. Some of the  programs have bonding activities where parents work on reunification and  parenting strategies with their children. For example, corrections officials  from 3 of our 10 states told us that the Girls Scouts Beyond Bars program  occurred in one or more of their women\u2019s prisons. This program,  originally developed by DOJ, typically provides regular visits and  interaction between incarcerated mothers and their daughters."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Some Corrections and Child Welfare Agencies Have Collaborated to Align Their Program Requirements and Assign Liaisons", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "State Level Collaboration", "paragraphs": ["Child welfare and corrections officials in 6 of our 10 states collaborated at  the state level to clarify policies, develop procedures, and provide  information to staff. For example, in response to a recent state supreme  court case reversing the termination of parental rights for an incarcerated  parent, Michigan\u2019s child welfare agency worked with state corrections  officials to draft a memorandum to prison supervisors on ways to support  child welfare staff who are working with incarcerated parents. Specifically,  the memorandum required that corrections staff allow inmates to  participate via phone in court hearings and planning meetings with child  welfare officials, when requested, and any programs that will help  improve their parenting skills. In New York, according to state officials, the  recent legislation on filing for termination of parental rights for  incarcerated parents was, in part, the impetus for the joint development of  protocols for ways state corrections and child welfare agencies should  coordinate. Per these protocols, child welfare staff must contact  corrections staff to schedule meetings with parents and arrange children\u2019s  visits while corrections staff should return such calls within one week. The  agencies also collaborated to develop training on the protocols for their  respective staffs. New York\u2019s state child welfare office also developed  materials on the legal rights and responsibilities of parents that child  welfare staff can use with incarcerated parents (see fig. 6).", "In some instances, state legislation directed government agencies to  collaborate to meet the needs of children with incarcerated parents. In  Oregon, according to officials, legislation passed in 2001 led corrections  and child welfare agencies to collaborate to gather and share data,  conduct joint training and outreach sessions, and better coordinate  services for released inmates.  More recently, officials from  Pennsylvania told us about a 2009 legislative resolution that directed the  creation of an advisory committee to study children of incarcerated  parents and recommend ways to assess their needs, the services  available to them, and the barriers to accessing those services.", "Many of the child welfare caseworkers we interviewed cited difficulty  reaching staff at correctional facilities and navigating prison or jail policies  as a challenge. However, we were told in interviews about examples of  liaisons, in 5 of our 10 states, who facilitate communication between the  agencies. These liaisons understand the procedures and operations of  both agencies and work with officials to navigate each system and serve  as a single point of contact. For example, in California, Texas, and  Alabama, one or more state women\u2019s prisons have employed a social  worker who helps child welfare caseworkers locate offenders or helps  inmates enroll in classes or services that the child\u2019s case plan requires.  More commonly, we heard of examples of cooperation between county  jails and local welfare agencies due to their shared county jurisdiction and  being geographically close. For example, in San Francisco, California, a  liaison based at a county jail was responsible for notifying parents about  their case; facilitating parent-child visits; and providing updates to  parents, child welfare caseworkers, and jail staff about the visits. On a  larger scale, staff of New York City\u2019s Children of Incarcerated Parents  Program, supported by the city\u2019s child welfare agency, facilitate visits to  24 correctional facilities within New York. Such staff also prepare child  welfare staff and foster parents for visits with incarcerated parents.

However, it has  not set such protocols for how its facilities should deal with child welfare  agencies trying to meet the needs of inmates with children in foster care,  according to officials from BOP\u2019s Central Office. Although we found a few  state and local corrections agencies that had taken initiative to facilitate  communication with child welfare agencies, such as by having a  designated point of contact, we did not find these efforts in the two federal  prisons we visited.

Several judges we interviewed said that it could be difficult to have federal  inmates participate in child welfare dependency hearings, for example,  because prison officials were unresponsive. Several local child welfare  officials said that it was challenging to reach staff at a federal prison to get  information on an incarcerated parent. Neither of the two federal facilities  we visited had a designated staff position or a process for handling child  welfare inquiries. Officials from one facility said that, at any one time, a  different official might field questions from child welfare workers or  inmates with children who are involved in child welfare.

As evidenced by the Second Chance  Act, there is growing attention in the field of corrections on keeping  offenders connected with their families to facilitate reentry and, ultimately,  lower recidivism. Many parties may be interested in learning about new  ways to serve the often invisible children in child welfare with incarcerated  parents and to help address some of the serious challenges that these  children face. Given fiscal constraints and competing demands placed on  agencies at every level, however, initiatives made on behalf of these  families are likely to be hindered without information about existing  practices and available resources that they could leverage. Moreover,  while this group of children and their parents are likely a relatively small  part of the larger systems of child welfare and corrections, they are  greatly affected by these systems and their practices.

To better understand the magnitude of the population and inform  federal or state initiatives that affect children in foster care with  incarcerated parents, the Secretary of HHS should identify ways to  strengthen the completeness of state-reported data on those children.  For example, in implementing new reporting requirements for the  AFCARS system, the agency could take into consideration its 2008  proposed changes in which states would be required to provide  additional information on each foster care child and his or her family  circumstances, including a caretaker\u2019s incarceration, at several times  during the child\u2019s stay in foster care and not only when a child first  enters care. 2.  To improve outcomes for these children, the Secretary of HHS should  take steps to more systematically increase awareness among state  and local child welfare agencies about available resources for children  in child welfare with incarcerated parents. For example, HHS could take steps to update and more centrally organize relevant  information posted on the Child Welfare Information Gateway,  which is meant to serve as a comprehensive information resource  for the child welfare field, such as by regularly updating the  information listed under the Gateway\u2019s relevant topic areas (e.g.,  \u201cChildren in Out-of-Home-Care With Incarcerated Parents\u201d) with  links to more recent material posted on other HHS-supported  websites; identify or provide additional information on promising  approaches, such as those listed by the Office of Assistant  Secretary for Planning and Evaluation; \uf0b7  use relevant findings from the CFSR process as an opportunity to  remind states about available resources and post information on  promising approaches identified in the reviews; or facilitate awareness among all child welfare agencies about HHS\u2019s  available resources through an e-mail or a teleconference/webinar  that would allow state and local agencies to share information on  practices or strategies.", "We are also making two recommendations to the U.S. Attorney General:  1.

For example, using some of the  informational resources it already makes available to state and local  corrections agencies, DOJ could compile and publicize examples of  successful collaboration between corrections and child welfare  agencies.  2.  To improve collaboration between federal correctional facilities and  state and local child welfare agencies and help federal inmates  maintain important family relationships, the U.S. Attorney General  should direct BOP to consider developing protocols for facilities  regarding offenders who have children in the child welfare system.  These protocols could include:  responses/actions when child welfare agency workers contact  BOP facilities to confirm an inmate\u2019s location, request to  communicate directly with inmates, or inquire about inmates\u2019  current or future participation in programs or services that may be  part of a child welfare case plan; \uf0b7  processes for responding to requests for inmates\u2019 participation in  child welfare hearings or ways to facilitate participation when  desired by the inmate, such as setting up teleconferencing  abilities; or \uf0b7  whether facilities could designate a specific staff position to  address all such inquiries or questions, including those from child  welfare agencies, dependency courts, or offenders.", "If developed, these protocols could be shared with states and local  corrections agencies as examples."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS and DOJ for review and  comment.

Taken together, we  excluded about 11 percent of all cases from our analyses. To confirm the  reliability of these data, social science methodologists at GAO reviewed  documentation about the collection and reporting of AFCARS data and  conducted electronic testing of AFCARS data. We also interviewed  relevant HHS officials to clarify data elements, procedures, and reasons  for missing information. The AFCARS data were found to be sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this engagement.", "In addition to our review of the AFCARS data, we also reviewed relevant  national data on incarcerated parents and their children from surveys of  inmates in state and federal prisons and local jails, administered by the  Department of Justice (DOJ) through its Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS).  We used these surveys to estimate inmate characteristics, such as the  percentage of inmates with minor children reported to be in foster care or in  other placement settings. Specifically, we estimated numbers and  characteristics of inmate populations using the 2004 Survey of Inmates in  Federal Correctional Facilities, the 2004 Survey of Inmates in State  Correctional Facilities, and the 2002 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails.", "We also used these surveys to estimate a conservative lower bound on  the number of children of inmates who are in foster care. Based on our  analysis of the 2004 surveys, we are 95 percent confident that the  number of state and federal inmates\u2019 children in foster care in 2004  exceeded about 22,800. Further, based on the 2002 survey of jail  inmates, we are 95 percent confident that between 4,634 and 19,060  inmates had at least one child in a foster care setting in 2002. While the  jail inmate survey covers a different time period than the federal and state  inmate survey, it does provide an indication that additional children of  inmates (beyond what was found in the state and federal inmate surveys)  may be in foster care settings.", "In addition, for background purposes, we present BJS published  estimates of the number of inmates and children of inmates for 1991,  1997, 2004, and 2007. Although the BJS report describes its estimation  methodology and several adjustments that were made to produce  estimates that would be comparable over several years, it does not  include estimates of sampling error for those estimates. However, we  were able to calculate and report the confidence intervals for other  estimates produced from the 2004 surveys elsewhere in this report. Since  the 1991\u20132007 estimates are based on similar surveys and on  information developed from the 2004 survey, we report these BJS  estimates for background purposes only and without accompanying  confidence intervals.", "BJS data are limited because they do not distinguish between children\u2019s  temporary or permanent living arrangements, including various types of  relative care, such as relatives who provide foster homes overseen by the  child welfare system, relatives who are informally caring for children with  no involvement of the child welfare system, and relatives who serve as  permanent legal guardians. BJS data also do not fully distinguish  children\u2019s current living arrangements when inmates are reporting on  multiple children. Additionally, as noted in this report, some prisoners may  be inclined to under report how many minor children they have for various  reasons, such as avoiding having to pay child support, according to  several state and DOJ officials we interviewed. Finally, BJS surveys are  conducted intermittently, limiting our ability to compare results across  years. A GAO social science analyst with expertise in survey methods  and a statistician reviewed the methods and survey design used in these  studies and, through interviews with knowledgeable DOJ and BJS  officials and our own analyses, we determined that the data we used  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this engagement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Phone Interviews", "paragraphs": ["We administered structured telephone interviews to both the state child  welfare and corrections agencies in 10 selected states.

We  selected the six states with the largest child welfare population, which are  also among the highest in terms of state prison populations. Other states  with smaller populations of foster care children and prisoners were  selected for variation. Additionally, selected states differed in their  geographic location and whether child welfare services in the state were  administered at the state or local level. Finally, some states were selected  because they were identified in our interviews with researchers and  professionals knowledgeable on these topics as having policies,  programs, or practices aimed at supporting parent-child ties at the state  level or in localities within the state.

Using these protocols,  we asked officials about the extent their agencies track whether foster  care children have an incarcerated parent or whether inmates have  children and if their children are in foster care. Additionally, we asked  about relevant statewide policies, challenges to supporting family contact  or reunification, and strategies employed in their state that may help  address challenges. Last, we inquired about relevant types of federal  assistance received and areas in which additional assistance might be  useful. We developed our protocols by interviewing researchers,  professionals, and associations, as well as reviewing their documents and  other literature. In addition, we asked several researchers and  professionals we interviewed to review our protocols and pretested these  protocols with child welfare and corrections officials in one state. We  asked these parties for input on the clarity and objectivity of the questions  and whether respondents could provide the information we sought and  revised the protocols, accordingly.", "In addition to our interviews with state officials, we reviewed selected  child welfare statutes and policies of our 10 selected states.

In selecting  these four family-centered residential drug treatment programs, we  considered criteria including expert recommendations, receipt of federal  grants, and geographic location. We obtained expert recommendations  on specific programs to interview from a number of federal and nonprofit  organizations. Those organizations include several offices within HHS\u2014 such as the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  (SAMHSA), the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), the  Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE)\u2014and nonprofit  organizations, such as the Rebecca Project for Human Rights.

We chose to focus on  these programs because they target family-based treatment for parents  and their children, as opposed to other grant programs that provide funds  for different treatment types and populations. To describe the outcomes  that these programs track and assess, we reviewed grant documentation,  including the notices of funding availability, grant evaluations, and the  Regional Partnership Grant program\u2019s First Annual Report to Congress.

In  addition, a study of 2,639 clients from 44 drug treatment programs in  California reported that 29 percent of these parents had one or more  children removed from their custody by child welfare services. Children  whose parents have substance use disorders may experience parental  neglect and be at risk of social, emotional, and behavioral disorders.  Parents with substance use disorders, including those who come to the  attention of the child welfare system\u2014predominately mothers\u2014may face  additional challenges such as co-occurring mental disorders and  involvement with the criminal justice system. Successfully addressing the  multiple needs of these parents and their children takes time, which, as  with children with incarcerated parents, can conflict with the timelines set  by the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 to make decisions about a  child\u2019s permanent placement and to file for termination of parental rights.", "Historically, women with children have faced barriers to entering  substance abuse treatment programs. In our past work, we noted that  state child welfare directors were dissatisfied with the low level of  services, including substance abuse treatment services, provided to at- risk families in the child welfare system. In addition, we noted that,  according to state child welfare directors, families living in impoverished  neighborhoods often do not have access to substance abuse treatment  services, which can in turn influence their children\u2019s entry into the child  welfare system. HHS has funded programs that allow eligible parents  with substance use disorders to bring their children into treatment with  them, such as SAMHSA\u2019s Services Grant Program for Residential  Treatment for Pregnant and Postpartum Women (PPW). According to  SAMHSA officials, this program is designed to expand the availability of  sustainable, comprehensive quality treatment, recovery support, and  family services for pregnant and postpartum women and their children  age 17 and under. This program, which SAMHSA funds and oversees, is  implemented by private nonprofit and public drug treatment providers and  targets low-income women.", "In contrast to corrections facilities, some residential drug treatment  programs allow mothers to bring at least some of their children to live with  them during treatment. Some of these programs employ a family- centered treatment approach, more formally known as the  Comprehensive Substance Abuse Treatment Model for Women and their  Children, which SAMHSA describes as:  \uf0b7  often long-term and residential;  focusing on an individualized treatment plan for each woman; \uf0b7  addressing the full range of each woman\u2019s needs, in addition to  focusing on the relationships in the woman\u2019s life, including her role as  mother; including a wide variety of integrated services, some of which may be  available to children and other family members; and sensitive to culture and gender.", "Family-centered residential drug treatment programs use a variety of  approaches to strengthen and reunite families. Officials from four family- centered residential drug treatment programs we interviewed told us that  these programs help strengthen and reunite families by, among other  things:  \uf0b7  Allowing children to reside with their mothers. According to drug  treatment program officials, the possibility that women can bring at  least some of their children with them removes a significant barrier to  treatment: reluctance to enter treatment if their children do not have a  safe place to stay. In addition, some women are reluctant to enter  treatment because they fear that as a result of doing so, they will lose  custody of their children. Having them close by, such as at an on-site  childcare center, decreases these fears and makes it more likely that  a woman will stay in treatment and overcome her substance abuse,  according to program officials. \uf0b7  Focusing on long-term recovery. In contrast to short-term drug  treatment programs, which may consist of a brief, hospital-based  inpatient phase and some outpatient follow-up, family-centered  residential drug treatment programs can last up to 24 months. During  this extended time, the programs attempt to address long-term,  underlying issues in an effort to foster lasting recovery and thus  heighten the chances of family reunification. In this effort, these  programs aim to help women build new coping strategies and social  networks, as well as strengthen their relationship with their children by  teaching them parenting skills. By recognizing that addiction is cyclical  and chronic, these programs help women learn how to overcome  relapses and move toward long-term recovery. In addition, once the  women graduate, some programs continue to provide extended  assistance to help them transition out of the program, such as  temporary housing or access to ongoing support networks and  therapy. \uf0b7  Addressing mental health needs, including trauma. Extensive mental  health services offered by the family-centered treatment programs we  examined better position women for the work needed to help them  recover and rebuild their families, according to program officials. For  example, such programs help women identify, acknowledge, and  appropriately respond to traumatic events in their lives. According to  treatment program staff and federal officials, many women in long- term residential drug treatment have experienced some form of  trauma or suffer from other mental health problems, which in turn can  influence their substance use. Programs may also help children, who  may also be traumatized from living in an environment where there is  substance abuse or from having been removed from their homes by  child welfare officials. \uf0b7  Offering a variety of supportive services to children and other family  members. According to federal and drug treatment program officials,  offering a variety of services to family members can help promote a  more stable recovery since a woman\u2019s recovery is often dependent on  the health of her family, broadly defined. Some programs offer  services specifically aimed at children, such as early intervention  programs for preschool children and parenting programs that enable  both mothers and fathers to hone their parenting skills. Other  services, such as education and employment programs, aim to help  families by making family members stronger and more self-sufficient. \uf0b7  Collaborating extensively with other state and local agencies.  Because family-centered residential drug treatment programs  collaborate extensively with other agencies and organizations with  which women come into contact (see fig. 9), they are able to better  address complex family needs, according to program and federal  officials.", "According to an official from one treatment program, the program\u2019s  collaboration\u2014joint monitoring and assessment of women\u2019s progress\u2014 with a local family dependency court helps heighten the prospects for  family reunification. Drug treatment program staff and state officials also  told us that drug treatment programs and child welfare agencies  frequently collaborate, and that child welfare and court officials tend to  view a woman\u2019s participation in the family-centered treatment programs  positively for the woman. In addition to collaborating around the needs of  the women and their children, treatment programs may work closely with  child welfare agencies to educate them about the nature of substance  abuse and to provide insight into the extent to which a woman\u2019s relapse  may endanger her children. Finally, program officials told us that their  collaboration with other service providers, such as the public school  system and agencies specializing in children\u2019s developmental disabilities,  also helps them better leverage their own skills and resources to support  the whole family."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Outcomes for Women in Residential Drug Treatment Programs", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has funded a number of grants that support and  assess family-centered residential drug treatment programs.

In the  PPW program, grantees are required to track information about, among  other things, the woman\u2019s substance use, involvement with the criminal  justice system, mental health, and living arrangements. Grantees also  collect limited information on the women\u2019s children, including the total  number of children per woman, the number of children living with  someone besides the woman due to a child protection order, and the  number of children for whom the woman\u2019s parental rights have been  terminated.", "SAMHSA funded a cross-site analysis of the PPW program and an earlier  grant program, the demonstration grant program for Residential  Treatment for Women and Their Children (RWC), that examined data  collected from 1996 to 2001 from more than 1,000 women at 50 RWC  and PPW programs. To assess the treatment outcomes, the study  compared women\u2019s responses at admission interviews to their responses  at follow-up interviews, which were administered 6 months after their  treatment ended. The study found that 6 months after treatment ended  women reported fewer instances of substance use, fewer arrests, fewer  mental health problems, and higher rates of employment. Regarding child  outcomes, the study found fewer children living in foster care and that  most of the children who accompanied their mothers to the RWC or PPW  programs were still living with their mothers 6 months after treatment.  Although these findings suggest that RWC- and PPW-funded drug  treatment programs may lead to some positive outcomes for women and  their children, according to study\u2019s authors, the cross-site study was not  designed to demonstrate that the treatment actually caused those effects.", "In 2006, ACF began implementing the Regional Partnership Grant (RPG)  program, which provides 3- or 5-year grants to support partnerships  among child welfare and other organizations, including drug treatment  agencies, to increase well-being, enhance safety, and improve  permanency outcomes for children placed in or at risk of being placed in  out-of-home care because of a parent\u2019s substance abuse. Among the 53  partnerships that received RPG funding in 2007, 21 include programs that  provide family-centered residential drug treatment services. The drug  treatment programs that received RPG funding must also collect  information related to a subset of 23 performance indicators pertaining to  the women, children, and families in their programs (see table 5). HHS  uses those performance indicators to gauge grantees\u2019 progress on  meeting their programs\u2019 intended goals.", "HHS requires RPG grantees to conduct evaluations to determine program  outcomes, and most grantees designed evaluations that use treatment  and comparison groups, allowing them to compare outcomes of families  in family-centered residential treatment to outcomes of families in other  forms of substance abuse treatment. Of the 21 RPG grantees that  provide family-centered residential drug treatment services, 16 designed  evaluations that use treatment and comparison groups. Since the grant  period for the RPG program began in 2007 and may last up to 5 years,  ACF officials anticipate that all RPG grantees will submit final evaluation  results by December 31, 2012.
