The Department of Defense's (DOD) budget request for fiscal year 2003 includes more than $10 billion for combating terrorism activities, which includes a substantial increase in funding for antiterrorism measures to safeguard personnel and strategic issues. The service headquarters GAO reviewed did not use a comprehensive results-oriented management framework to guide their antiterrorism efforts. According to service officials, a comprehensive results-oriented management framework for antiterrorism efforts is not consistently used across all services and commands because DOD does not require it, and service officials indicated that they were reluctant to develop such an approach before the forthcoming DOD-wide antiterrorism strategy was issued. Although the Department has recently restarted its efforts toward developing this strategy, it has not set a specific time frame for its completion. The services and commands are following prescribed guidance and regulations to conduct risk management analyses to support their antiterrorism requirements, but significant weaknesses exist with the current approach. The commands do not always require documentation of the assessments, and they do not periodically evaluate the assessment methodology used at each installation to determine the thoroughness of the analyses or the consistency with required assessment methodology. DOD has reported that $32.1 billion has been allocated or requested for combating terrorism activities from fiscal year 1999 through fiscal year 2003; however, these reported amounts may not present a clear picture of total combating terrorism costs.

We reported that at the departmental level, the antiterrorism efforts lacked critical management elements, such as a strategic plan containing long-term goals and a performance plan to measure results, assess progress, and identify corrective actions. To strengthen the management of the antiterrorism program, we recommended that DOD establish a management framework containing these elements, which could then provide a vehicle to guide resource allocations and measure the results of DOD\u2019s improvement efforts. DOD agreed with this recommendation and initiated steps to develop the framework but temporarily suspended these efforts after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. The Department has recently restarted these efforts.", "If consistent with our previous recommendation, this forthcoming Department-wide framework should represent a significant and important shift in management focus\u2014from measuring program activities and processes to measuring program results. To supplement and support this results-oriented approach, a comprehensive risk management process can be an effective foundation for allocating antiterrorism resources. Risk management is a systematic, analytical process to determine the likelihood that a threat will harm individuals or physical assets and to identify actions to reduce risk and mitigate the consequences of a terrorist attack. (More detailed information on risk management appears in the background section of this report.)", "Because of the increased emphasis on and funding for DOD\u2019s antiterrorism efforts, you asked us to examine the management framework each military Department has established to implement antiterrorism initiatives. Accordingly, this report specifically focuses on the extent to which the military services and selected commands (1) use a results-oriented management framework to guide their antiterrorism efforts at domestic installations and (2) have established an effective risk management approach to develop specific antiterrorism requirements. Because you also asked us to examine how DOD reports combating terrorism funding, we also reviewed funding trends and determined whether DOD\u2019s annual budget reports to Congress completely and accurately portray funding for combating terrorism.", "To accomplish this work, we obtained and reviewed documents, examined the operations of the four services\u2019 headquarters, examined the operations of eight major service commands and reserve components, and interviewed cognizant officials. Collectively, these eight commands have antiterrorism responsibilities for approximately 444 installations.Although the information we obtained at these commands cannot be generalized to describe the Department\u2019s overall antiterrorism efforts, it provides insights into the antiterrorism programs within these commands.

In this capacity, the Assistant Secretary of Defense issued an instruction that established 31 antiterrorism standards that DOD organizations, including the services, are required to implement.8,  These standards address antiterrorism planning, training requirements, physical security measures, and related issues. The office also issued a handbook containing additional detailed guidance on antiterrorism policies and practices, including guidance on assessment methodology. The Joint Staff has also issued an installation- planning template to help installations prepare their antiterrorism plans.Additionally, each of the services has issued regulations, orders and instructions to implement the DOD guidance and establish its own specific policies and standards.

This assessment represents a systematic approach to identify potential threats before they materialize. However, this assessment might not adequately capture some emerging threats, even in cases where the assessment is frequently updated. The risk management approach therefore uses vulnerability and asset criticality assessments as additional inputs to the risk management decision-making process.", "A vulnerability assessment identifies weaknesses that may be exploited by identified threats and suggests options that address those weaknesses. For example, a vulnerability assessment might reveal weaknesses in an installation\u2019s access control system, its antiterrorism awareness training, or how mission-critical assets such as fuel storage sites and communications centers are protected. Teams of multidisciplinary experts skilled in such areas as structural engineering, physical security, and installation preparedness conduct these assessments.", "A criticality assessment evaluates and prioritizes assets and functions to identify which assets and missions are relatively more important to protect from attack. For example, important communications facilities, utilities, or major weapons systems might be identified as critical to the execution of U.S. military war plans, and therefore receive additional protection.", "Criticality assessments provide information in order to prioritize resources while at the same time, reducing the potential application of resources on lower-priority assets."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Services\u2019 Antiterrorism Efforts Lack a Results- Oriented Management Framework", "paragraphs": ["The critical elements of a results-oriented management framework are not being used by the services to guide their antiterrorism efforts. In results-based management, program effectiveness is measured in terms of outcomes or impact rather than outputs (i.e., activities and processes). Results-oriented principles and elements, which we have derived from the Government Performance and Results Act, are presented in table 1. Benefits from a results-based management approach depend upon the combined use of all eight of the critical elements that appear in the table. These elements, when combined with effective leadership can provide a management framework to guide major programs and activities.", "The critical elements of a results-oriented management framework were largely absent in the antiterrorism efforts of three services\u2019 headquarters and at six of the eight commands we examined. Specifically, the services have not published and disseminated unambiguous results-based, strategic and performance goals for their antiterrorism efforts. Some service antiterrorism officials did articulate broadly stated goals\u2014such as protecting personnel and material assets against terrorist attack, and defeating terrorism\u2014but these goals have not been endorsed and disseminated by service headquarters as servicewide goals nor have the services described how these goals will be achieved or how they intend to evaluate results in terms of the goals. The Air Force, however, has taken some steps toward a results-based management framework. For example, it has published long-term goals and established service-level working groups to evaluate the effectiveness of its antiterrorism program and identify the actions needed to address or revise any unmet goals. Although the Air Force has taken these positive steps, Air Force officials acknowledge that the elements may not have been effectively articulated servicewide so that installations can understand the \u201cbig picture\u201d and how all elements fit together. In fact, officials we contacted from Air Combat Command and Air National Guard were not aware of the service-level goals or performance-planning elements.", "At the command level, a results-oriented management framework was largely absent in the antiterrorism efforts of six of the eight major commands we reviewed. For example, the Air Combat Command did not have overarching antiterrorism goals for its 15 bases, although command officials said that they planned to develop them. Also, the Army National Guard has not issued antiterrorism goals for its 3,900 armories and 211 installations and has no plan to do so.", "Two of the commands\u2014the Army\u2019s Forces Command and the Navy\u2019s Atlantic Fleet\u2014adopted aspects of a results-oriented framework, and officials said that they did so on their own initiative and without direction from their parent service. The Army Forces Command management framework contained most of the critical management elements, such as quarterly reviews, long-term and annual goals, clear performance measures, and identification of resource requirements. Army Forces Command officials said that the results-based management approach enables its senior officers to monitor the command\u2019s progress toward its short- and long-term goals and make necessary adjustments to the strategy and resource allocation to accomplish these goals. Forces Command officials attributed their management approach\u2019s success, in large part, to the involvement of senior command officials and their endorsement of this management approach. According to Army headquarters antiterrorism officials, the Forces Command management framework has been an effective approach and may be useful as a model for other major commands.", "The Navy\u2019s Atlantic Fleet Command also articulated long-term goals and strategies to accomplish its antiterrorism goals. For example, the fleet developed a plan of action to address security deficiencies that were identified through assessments by establishing a database to track deficiencies and identify trends. The fleet also linked resource requirements to accomplish these steps and developed metrics to measure results. According to the Atlantic Fleet officials we spoke with, however, these strategies are not currently being used by the fleet to shape its antiterrorism efforts because they are waiting for the Navy to issue servicewide antiterrorism goals. Atlantic Fleet officials stated they wanted to avoid having separate and different strategic plans for each command.", "The services and their major commands cite two primary reasons for not employing a results-based management framework to guide and implement their antiterrorism efforts. First, the services do not want to adopt goals and strategies that might prove inconsistent with DOD\u2019s forthcoming, Department-wide antiterrorism strategy. As discussed earlier, the Department was in the process of developing an antiterrorism strategy, but suspended its efforts after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon because of the pressing needs of the war on terrorism. DOD officials have indicated that they have reinitiated their efforts to develop a strategy but have not set a target date for their completion. The second reason cited by service officials for not employing a results-oriented management framework was that strategic planning and performance planning called for by the Results Act applies to agencies and not to specific efforts such as antiterrorism. We agree that the services and major commands are not required by the Results Act to prepare strategic plans and performance plans specific to their antiterrorism efforts. Nonetheless, the Results Act offers a model for developing an effective management framework to improve the likelihood of successfully implementing initiatives and assessing results.", "Without a results-based management approach to prioritize, integrate, and evaluate their efforts, it will be difficult for the services and their major commands to systematically plan and implement antiterrorism programs or assess their progress in reducing the likelihood and impact of terrorist attacks. It is crucial that the services identify and support those efforts that are most likely to achieve long-term antiterrorism goals because funding is not sufficient to eliminate or mitigate all identified vulnerabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Services Are Implementing Risk Management but Provide Inadequate Oversight", "paragraphs": ["The services and commands we reviewed are generally following prescribed guidance and regulations to use the DOD risk management approach in developing their installation antiterrorism requirements, but a significant weakness exists with the oversight of this process. Specifically, the services are not required to evaluate the thoroughness of all installations\u2019 annual risk management assessments or whether installations used required methodologies to perform these assessments. As previously discussed, under DOD\u2019s antiterrorism approach, three assessments (threat, vulnerability, and criticality) provide the installation commanders with the information necessary to manage the risk of a terrorist attack, and develop an antiterrorism program for the installation. It also provides guidance for completing these assessments;and it requires the military Departments, through the services, to oversee the antiterrorism efforts at their installations. In their oversight role, the military Departments, through the services, are required to ensure that installation antiterrorism efforts adhere to the antiterrorism standards established by DOD.", "To implement DOD\u2019s required risk management approach, the services have issued supplements to DOD\u2019s guidance requiring installations to conduct the three risk management assessments and indicating how these assessments should be performed. The supplemental guidance of three of the services\u2014the Army, Air Force, and the Marine Corps\u2014requires service-specific methodologies to be used for the assessments. The commands, to which the services have delegated some oversight responsibility for installations\u2019 antiterrorism efforts, generally verified that installations completed annual threat, vulnerability, and asset criticality assessments. Command officials indicated that they verify whether installations\u2019 annual risk assessments have been completed in one of two ways: (1) through the request for and receipt of copies of the written assessments or (2) through verbal verification from the installation commanders. The Navy, however, does not require that annual vulnerability assessments be documented and does not verify that these assessments are completed.", "To provide oversight of the risk management process, DOD\u2019s antiterrorism standards require a higher headquarters review of subordinate installations\u2019 antiterrorism programs once every 3 years for installations that meet specific criteria. These reviews are conducted by teams of specialists skilled in various disciplines (such as engineering, intelligence, and security) from the Joint Staff, service headquarters, or major command. The reviews assess, among other things, an installation\u2019s antiterrorism plans, physical security, vulnerabilities and solutions for enhanced protection, and incident response measures. These reviews, however, do not routinely evaluate the methodology used to develop the annual installation assessments. Moreover, there is no requirement to review the antiterrorism programs of installations that do not meet DOD\u2019s criteria for higher headquarters assessments.", "Because the results of assessments form the foundation of installation antiterrorism plans, which drive servicewide requirements, it is critical that assessments be performed consistently across each service to ensure that assessment results are comparable. According to DOD officials, installations\u2019 risk assessments were not evaluated for two reasons. First, DOD does not specifically require the services and their commands to evaluate installation assessments. Second, several command officials indicated that evaluating assessment methodologies would provide little or no added value to the process.", "The Air Force and the Navy have initiatives under way that will place a greater emphasis and importance on the results of the installations\u2019 risk management efforts. Both services are using to varying degrees an automated risk management program that should improve visibility over installation assessments and the resulting antiterrorism requirements. This program\u2014the Vulnerability Assessment Management Program\u2014will enable service and command officials to track assessment results and prioritize corrective actions servicewide. The program will contain information about installations\u2019 antiterrorism requirements and the threat, vulnerability, and asset criticality assessments that support these requirements. It is also designed to allow service officials to conduct trend analyses, identify common vulnerabilities, and track corrective actions. Service officials stated that this program will also enable them to evaluate the risk assessment methodologies used at each installation, but it is unclear how this will be accomplished.", "If installations\u2019 risk assessments are not periodically evaluated to ensure that assessments are complete and that a consistent or compatible methodology has been applied, then commands have no assurance that their installations\u2019 antiterrorism requirements are comparable or based on the application of risk management principles. Consequently, when the services and commands consolidate their antiterrorism requirements (through the process of merging and reprioritizing the requirements of their multiple installations), the result may not accurately reflect the services\u2019 most pressing needs. For example, if a standard methodology is not consistently applied, then vulnerabilities may not be identified and critical facilities may be overlooked.
