For example, the selected legacy system at the Department of Education runs on Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL)\u2014a programming language that has a dwindling number of people available with the skills needed to support it. In addition, the Department of the Interior's system contains obsolete hardware that is not supported by the manufacturers. Regarding cybersecurity, the Department of Homeland Security's system had a large number of reported vulnerabilities, of which 168 were considered high or critical risk to the network as of September 2018.", "Of the 10 agencies responsible for these legacy systems, seven agencies (the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, the Interior, the Treasury; as well as the Office of Personnel Management; Small Business Administration; and Social Security Administration) had documented plans for modernizing the systems (see table 2). The Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, and Transportation did not have documented modernization plans. Of the seven agencies with plans, only the Departments of the Interior and Defense's modernization plans included the key elements identified in best practices (milestones, a description of the work necessary to complete the modernization, and a plan for the disposition of the legacy system).

Of this amount, the government plans to spend about 80 percent on the  operations and maintenance of existing IT investments, including aging  (also called legacy) systems.", "However, federal legacy systems are becoming increasingly obsolete. In  May 2016, we reported that many of the government\u2019s IT investments  used outdated software languages and hardware parts that were  unsupported. We also reported instances where agencies were using  systems that had components that were at least 50 years old or the  vendors were no longer providing support for hardware or software. As  they age, legacy systems can become more expensive to maintain, more  exposed to cybersecurity risks, and less effective in accomplishing their  intended purpose.", "Accordingly, you asked us to review federal agencies\u2019 legacy systems.  Our specific objectives were to (1) identify the most critical federal legacy  systems in need of modernization and evaluate plans for modernizing  them, and (2) identify examples of legacy system modernization initiatives  in the last 5 years that agencies considered successful.", "This report presents a public version of a \u201climited official use only\u201d  (LOUO) report that we are also issuing today. The Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of the Interior (Interior) determined that certain information in our original report should be  protected from public disclosure. Therefore, we will not release the LOUO  report to the general public because of the sensitive information it  contains.", "The LOUO report includes eight recommendations that we made to eight  agencies to identify and document modernization plans for particular  legacy systems, including milestones, a description of the work  necessary, and details on the disposition of the legacy system. In this  public version of the report, we have omitted sensitive information  regarding particular legacy systems, including the systems\u2019 names and  other information that would identify the systems.", "Although the information provided in this report is more limited, this report  addresses the same objectives as the LOUO report and is based on the  same audit methodology. We provided a draft of this report to agency  officials to obtain their review and comments on the sensitivity of the  information contained herein. We confirmed with the agency officials that  this report can be made available to the public without jeopardizing the  security of federal agencies\u2019 legacy systems.", "To identify the most critical legacy systems in need of modernization, we  followed up with each of the 24 federal agencies\u2019 covered by the Chief  Financial Officers Act of 1990 regarding their legacy systems that they  had identified in 2017 as most in need of modernization. All 24 agencies  either confirmed or updated their lists of these systems most in need of  modernization. This resulted in a collective list of 65 systems.", "We then reviewed available technical literature and consulted with  system development experts within GAO to develop a set of attributes for  determining system obsolescence and their need for modernization.  These attributes included a system\u2019s age, hardware age, operating and  labor costs, vendor warranty and support status, and security risk. We  assigned point values to each system based on the systems\u2019 agency- reported attributes. We totaled each system\u2019s assigned point values and  used the results to rank the 65 legacy systems. We then designated the  10 systems with the highest scores as those legacy systems most in need  of modernization. However, due to sensitivity concerns, in this report we  substituted a numeric identifier for the system names and are not  providing detailed descriptions.", "To evaluate agencies\u2019 plans for modernizing the 10 federal legacy  systems most in need of modernization, we requested that the relevant  agencies provide us with their documented plans for modernizing the  selected systems. We reviewed government and industry best practices  related to the modernization of legacy systems. Based on our reviews of  these documents, we determined that agencies\u2019 documented plans for  system modernization should include, at a minimum, (1) milestones to  complete the modernization, (2) a description of the work necessary to  modernize the system, and (3) details regarding the disposition of the  legacy system. We then analyzed agencies\u2019 documented modernization  plans for the selected legacy systems to determine whether the plans  included these elements. We supplemented our work with interviews of  officials in the agencies\u2019 offices of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and  program offices for the selected legacy systems.", "To identify legacy system modernization initiatives that agencies indicated  were successful, we asked each of the 24 agencies to provide us with  examples of those modernization initiatives that they completed between  2014 and 2018 and deemed to be successful. In addition, we identified  other examples of modernization successes at these agencies. We also  coordinated with the selected agencies\u2019 Offices of Inspector General  (OIG) to determine whether those offices had any past or current audit  work that would contradict the agencies\u2019 determination that the initiatives  were successful. We then selected initiatives that reflected a mix of  different agencies, types of system modernizations undertaken, and types  of benefits realized from the initiatives. A full description of our objectives,  scope, and methodology can be found in appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2018 to June 2019 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Historically, the federal government has had difficulties acquiring,  developing, and managing IT investments. Further, federal agencies  have struggled with appropriately planning and budgeting for modernizing  legacy systems; upgrading underlying infrastructure; and investing in high  quality, lower cost service delivery technology. The consequences of not  updating legacy systems has contributed to, among other things, security  risks, unmet mission needs, staffing issues, and increased costs.", "Security risks. Legacy systems may operate with known security  vulnerabilities that are either technically difficult or prohibitively  expensive to address. In some cases, vendors no longer provide  support for hardware or software, creating security vulnerabilities and  additional costs. For example, in November 2017, the Department of  Education\u2019s (Education) Inspector General identified security  weaknesses that included the department\u2019s use of unsupported  operating systems, databases, and applications. By using  unsupported software, the department put its sensitive information at  risk, including the personal records and financial information of  millions of federal student aid applicants.", "Unmet mission needs. Legacy systems may not be able to reliably  meet mission needs because they are outdated or obsolete. For  instance, in 2016, the Department of State\u2019s (State) Inspector General  reported on the unreliability of the Bureau of Consular Affairs\u2019 legacy  systems. Specifically, during the summers of 2014 and 2015,  outages in the legacy systems slowed and, at times, stopped the  processing of routine consular services such as visa processing. For  example, in June 2015, system outages caused by a hardware failure  halted visa processing for 13 days, creating a backlog of 650,000  visas.", "Staffing issues. In order to operate and maintain legacy systems,  staff may need experience with older technology and programming  languages, such as the Common Business Oriented Language  (COBOL). Agencies have had difficulty finding employees with such  knowledge and may have to pay a premium to hire specialized staff or  contractors. For example, we reported in May 2016 that the Social  Security Administration (SSA) had to rehire retired employees to  maintain its COBOL systems. Further, having a shortage of expert  personnel available to maintain a critical system creates significant  risk to an agency\u2019s mission. For instance, we reported in June 2018  that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was experiencing shortages  of staff with the skills to support key tax processing systems that used  legacy programming languages. These staff shortages not only  posed risks to the operation of the key tax processing systems, but  they also hindered the agency\u2019s efforts to modernize its core tax  processing system.", "Increased costs. The cost of operating and maintaining legacy  systems increases over time. The issue of cost is linked to the three  previously described consequences\u2014either because the other issues  directly raise costs or, as in the case of not meeting mission needs,  the agency is not receiving a favorable return on investment. Further,  in an era of constrained budgets, the high costs of maintaining legacy  systems could limit agencies\u2019 ability to modernize and develop new or  replacement systems.", "During the course of our review, agencies reported that they consider  several factors prior to deciding whether to modernize a legacy system. In  particular, agencies evaluate factors, such as the inherent risks, the  criticality of the system, the associated costs, and the system\u2019s  operational performance.", "Risks. Agencies consider the risks associated with maintaining the  legacy system as well as modernizing the legacy system. For  instance, agencies may prioritize the modernization of legacy systems  that have security vulnerabilities or software that is unsupported by  the vendor. However, limited system accessibility may also reduce  the need to modernize a legacy system. For example, air-gapped  systems, which are systems that are isolated from the internet, may  mitigate a legacy system\u2019s cybersecurity risk by preventing remote  hackers from having system access.", "Conversely, we have also reported that air-gapped systems are not  necessarily secure: they could potentially be accessed by other  means than the internet, such as through Universal Serial Bus  devices. Even so, removing the threat of remote access is a  mitigation technique used by agencies such as the Nuclear  Regulatory Commission (NRC). According to NRC, the agency  reduced the riskiness of using computers with unsupported operating  systems by putting these computers on isolated networks or by  disconnecting them from networks entirely.", "Criticality. Agencies consider how critical the system is to the  agency\u2019s mission. Several agencies stated that they would consider  how essential a legacy system is to their agencies\u2019 missions before  deciding to modernize it. For example, the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS) stated that, when deciding to modernize a  legacy system, it considers the degree to which core mission  functions of the agency or other agencies are dependent on the  system. Similarly, Department of Energy (Energy) officials noted that  the department is required to maintain several legacy systems  associated with the storage of its nuclear waste.", "Costs. Agencies consider the costs of maintaining a legacy system  and modernizing the system. For example, according to the  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), there are systems for which a  life-cycle cost analysis of the legacy system may show that the cost to  modernize exceeds the projected costs to maintain the system.  Similarly, the Department of Defense (DOD) noted that, before  deciding on a modernization solution, it is important to assess the  costs of the transition to a new or replacement solution.", "An agency also may decide to modernize a system when there is  potential for cost savings to be realized with a modernization effort.  For example, HHS stated that it may pursue the modernization of a  legacy system if the department anticipates reductions in operations  and maintenance costs due to efficiencies gained through the  modernization.", "Performance. Before making the decision to modernize, agencies  consider the legacy system\u2019s operational performance. Specifically, if  the legacy system is performing poorly, the agency may decide to  modernize it. For example, the Department of Transportation  (Transportation) stated that, if a legacy system is no longer  functioning properly, it should be modernized. In addition, HHS noted  that the ability to improve the functionality of the legacy system could  be a reason to modernize it."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Has Reported on the Need to Improve Oversight of Legacy IT", "paragraphs": ["As previously mentioned, in May 2016, we reported that federal legacy IT  investments were becoming increasingly obsolete. In this regard,  agencies had reported operating systems that used outdated languages  and old parts, which were difficult to replace. Further, we noted that each  of the 12 selected agencies had reported using unsupported operating  systems and components, which could create security vulnerabilities and  additional costs. At the time, five of the selected agencies reported  using 1980s and 1990s Microsoft operating systems that stopped being  supported by the vendor more than a decade ago. We concluded that  agencies were, in part, maintaining obsolete investments because they  were not required to identify, evaluate, and prioritize investments to  determine whether the investments should be kept as-is, modernized,  replaced, or retired. We pointed out that the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) had created draft guidance that would require agencies to  do so, but OMB had not committed to a firm time frame for when the  guidance would be issued.", "As such, we made 16 recommendations to OMB and the selected federal  agencies to better manage legacy systems and investments. Most  agencies agreed with the recommendations or had no comment.  However, as of May 2019, 13 recommendations had not been  implemented. In particular, OMB has not finalized and issued its draft  guidance on legacy systems. Until this guidance is finalized and issued, the federal government will continue to run the risk of maintaining  investments that have outlived their effectiveness and are increasingly  difficult to protect from cybersecurity vulnerabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congress and the Executive Branch Have Made Efforts to Modernize Federal IT", "paragraphs": ["Congress and the executive branch have initiated several efforts to  modernize federal IT, including:  Identification of High Value Assets. In a December 2016  memorandum, OMB observed that continued increases in computing  power combined with declining computing and storage costs and  increased network connectivity had expanded the government\u2019s  capacity to store and process data. However, OMB noted that this  rise in technology and interconnectivity also meant that the federal  government\u2019s critical networks, systems, and data were more  exposed to cyber risks. As a result, OMB issued guidance to assist  federal agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers Act in  managing the risks to these assets, which it designated as High Value  Assets.", "Subsequently, in December 2018, OMB issued a memorandum that  provided further guidance regarding the establishment and  enhancement of the High Value Asset program. It stated that the  program is to be operated by DHS in coordination with OMB. Further,  the new guidance expanded the program to apply to all agencies (i.e.,  agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers Act, as well as those  not covered by the act) and expanded the definition of High Value  Assets. The guidance required agencies to identify and report these  assets (which may include legacy systems), assess them for security  risks, and remediate any weaknesses identified, including those  associated with obsolete or unsupported technology.", "Assessment of federal IT modernization. On May 11, 2017, the  President signed Executive Order 13800, Strengthening the  Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure. This  executive order outlined actions to enhance cybersecurity across  federal agencies and critical infrastructure to improve the nation\u2019s  cyber posture and capabilities against cybersecurity threats. Among  other things, the order tasked the Director of the American  Technology Council to coordinate a report to the President from the  Secretary of DHS, the Director of OMB, and the Administrator of the  General Services Administration (GSA), in consultation with the  Secretary of Commerce, regarding modernizing federal IT.", "As a result, the Report to the President on Federal IT Modernization  was issued on December 13, 2017, and outlined the current and  envisioned state of federal IT. The report focused on modernization  efforts to improve the security posture of federal IT and recognized  that agencies have attempted to modernize systems but have been  stymied by a variety of factors, including resource prioritization, ability  to procure services quickly, and technical issues. The report provided  multiple recommendations intended to address these issues through  the modernization and consolidation of networks and the use of  shared services. In particular, the report recommended that the  federal government prioritize the modernization of legacy IT by  focusing on enhancing security and privacy controls for those assets  that are essential for agencies to serve the American people and  whose security posture is most vulnerable (i.e., High Value Assets).", "Enactment of the Modernizing Government Technology (MGT)  Act. To help further agencies\u2019 efforts to modernize IT, in December  2017, Congress and the President enacted a law to authorize the  availability of funding mechanisms to improve, retire, or replace  existing IT systems to enhance cybersecurity and to improve  efficiency and effectiveness. The law, known as the MGT Act,  authorizes agencies to establish working capital funds for use in  transitioning from legacy systems, as well as for addressing evolving  threats to information security. The law also created the Technology  Modernization Fund, within the Department of the Treasury  (Treasury), from which agencies can \u201cborrow\u201d money to retire and  replace legacy systems, as well as acquire or develop systems.", "Subsequently, in February 2018, OMB issued guidance for agencies  to implement the MGT Act. The guidance was intended to provide  agencies additional information regarding the Technology  Modernization Fund, and the administration and funding of the related  IT working capital funds. Specifically, the guidance allowed agencies  to begin submitting initial project proposals for modernization on  February 27, 2018.", "In addition, in accordance with the MGT Act, the guidance provides  details regarding a Technology Modernization Board, which is to  consist of (1) the Federal CIO; (2) a senior official with IT technical  expertise from GSA; (3) a member of DHS\u2019s National Protection and  Program Directorate; and (4) four federal employees with technical  expertise in IT development, financial management, cybersecurity and  privacy, and acquisition, appointed by the Director of OMB.", "As of February 2019, the Technology Management Fund Board had  approved funds for seven IT modernization projects across five  agencies: the Department of Agriculture, Energy, the Department of  Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Department of Labor,  and GSA. For example, the board approved $20 million for HUD to  modernize a mainframe and five COBOL-based applications that are  expensive to maintain. According to the board\u2019s website, without  these funds, HUD would not have been able to pursue this project for  several years.", "Issuance of the President\u2019s Management Agenda. In March 2018,  the Administration issued the President\u2019s Management Agenda, which  lays out a long-term vision for modernizing the federal government.  The agenda identifies three related drivers of transformation\u2014IT  modernization; data, accountability, and transparency; and the  workforce of the future\u2014that are intended to push change across the  federal government.", "The President\u2019s Management Agenda identifies 14 related Cross- Agency Priority goals, many of which have elements that involve IT.  In particular, the Cross-Agency Priority goal on IT modernization  states that modern technology must function as the backbone of how  government serves the public in the digital age. Further, the goal on IT  modernization provides three priorities that are to guide the  Administration\u2019s efforts to modernize federal IT: (1) enhancing mission  effectiveness by improving the quality and efficiency of critical  services, including the increased utilization of cloud-based solutions;  (2) reducing cybersecurity risks to the federal mission by leveraging  current commercial capabilities and implementing cutting edge  cybersecurity capabilities; and (3) building a modern IT workforce by  recruiting, reskilling, and retaining professionals able to help drive  modernization with up-to-date technology."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Identified 10 Critical Federal Legacy Systems; Agencies Often Lack Complete Plans for Their Modernization", "paragraphs": ["As determined by our review of 65 critical federal legacy systems (see  appendix II), the 10 most critical legacy systems in need of modernization  are maintained by 10 different federal agencies whose missions are  essential to government operations, such as emergency management,  health care, and wartime readiness. These legacy systems provide vital  support to the agencies\u2019 missions.", "According to the agencies, these legacy systems range from about 8 to  51 years old and, collectively, cost approximately $337 million annually to  operate and maintain. Several of the systems use older languages,  such as COBOL and assembly language code. However, as we  reported in June 2018, reliance on assembly language code and COBOL  has risks, such as a rise in procurement and operating costs, and a  decrease in the availability of individuals with the proper skill sets.", "Further, several of these legacy systems are also operating with known  security vulnerabilities and unsupported hardware and software. For  example, DHS\u2019s Federal Emergency Management Agency performed a  security assessment on its selected legacy system in September 2018.

Documenting modernization plans in  sufficient detail increases the likelihood that modernization initiatives will  succeed. According to our review of government and industry best  practices for the modernization of federal IT, agencies should have  documented modernization plans for legacy systems that, at a minimum,  include three key elements: (1) milestones to complete the modernization,  (2) a description of the work necessary to modernize the legacy system,  and (3) details regarding the disposition of the legacy system.", "Of the 10 identified agencies with critical systems most in need of  modernization, seven (DOD, DHS, Interior, Treasury, the Office of  Personnel Management (OPM), the Small Business Administration  (SBA), and SSA) had documented modernization plans for their  respective critical legacy systems and three did not have documented  plans.

Most recently, in June 2018, the OIG  reported that OPM was generally continuing in the right direction toward  modernizing its IT environment, but the OIG had concerns with the  agency\u2019s plan for modernization and its overall approach to IT  modernization. For example, the OIG was concerned that OPM\u2019s  planning documents did not identify the full scope of the modernization  effort or contain cost estimates for the individual initiatives or the effort as  a whole. The OIG planned to monitor and continue to report on the  agency\u2019s progress in modernizing its infrastructure.", "OPM anticipates realizing both financial and nonfinancial benefits with the  modernization of its infrastructure. For example, as a part of its overall  infrastructure modernization, the agency avoided approximately $16  million in costs as part of its data center consolidation efforts for fiscal  year 2018. The agency also expects that cybersecurity and operational  risks associated with end of life hardware will be reduced. To that end,  the agency stated that remediating end of life hardware also should allow  OPM the ability to address identified security vulnerabilities and avoid  operational downtime, as support is more readily available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "System 9", "paragraphs": ["The Small Business Administration\u2019s (SBA) System 9 is a system that,  according to the agency, provides identification, authentication, and  authorization services for several of the agency\u2019s applications.", "According to the agency, the system was developed by SBA and  originally implemented in 2002. Agency officials stated that System 9\u2019s  hardware and software are no longer supported by the associated  vendors. Consequently, according to the agency, it is paying for extended  support contracts that have increased operating costs for the system.

SSA\u2019s modernization plan indicates that, since implementation,  these systems had been subjected to constant modifications to  incorporate changes in legislation, regulations, and policy. Through the  years, new technologies and capabilities had been integrated into the  core systems and delivering new capabilities was becoming exorbitantly  expensive.", "Further, most of the agency\u2019s systems, including System 10, are  generally unconnected to each other, creating functional silos servicing  independent lines of business.
