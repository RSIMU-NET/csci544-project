DOE\u2019s goal is to use the laboratories for developing clean energy sources and pollution-prevention technologies, for ensuring enhanced security through reductions in the nuclear threat, and for continuing leadership in the acquisition of scientific knowledge. The Department considers the laboratories a key to a growing economy fueled by technological innovations that increase U.S. industrial competitiveness and create new high-skill jobs for American workers.", "Missions have expanded in the laboratories for many reasons, including changes in the world\u2019s political environment.", "Nine of DOE\u2019s 23 laboratories are multiprogram national laboratories; they account for about 70 percent of the total laboratory budget and about 80 percent of all laboratory personnel. Three of these multiprogram national laboratories (Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, and Sandia) conduct the majority of DOE\u2019s nuclear weapons defense activities. Facing reduced funding for nuclear weapons as a result of the Cold War\u2019s end and the signing of the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, these three laboratories have substantially diversified to maintain their preeminent talent and facilities. The remaining laboratories in DOE\u2019s system are program- and mission-dedicated facilities. (See app. I for a list of all DOE laboratories.) DOE owns the laboratories and contracts with universities and private-sector organizations for the management and operation of 19, while providing federal staff for the remaining 4.", "The Congress is taking a growing interest in how the national laboratories are being managed. Recently introduced legislation would restructure the missions of the laboratories or manage them in new ways. Some previously proposed organizational options include converting the laboratories that are working closely with the private sector into independent entities or transferring the responsibility for one or more laboratories to other federal agencies whose missions are closely aligned with those of particular DOE laboratories. We have reported to the Congress that DOE\u2019s efforts to sharpen the focus and improve the management of its laboratories have been elusive and that the challenges facing the Department raise concerns about how effectively it can manage reform initiatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Advisory Groups Cite Continuing Mission and Management Concerns at the National Laboratories", "paragraphs": ["Over the past several years, many government advisory groups have raised concerns about how DOE manages its national laboratory system.

(See app. II for a list of past reports.) Most of these reports have been prepared since the early 1980s. The reports include the following: In 1982, DOE\u2019s Energy Research Advisory Board reported that the national laboratories duplicate private-sector research and that while DOE could take better advantage of the national laboratories\u2019 capabilities, it needed to address its own management and organizational inefficiencies, which hamper the achievement of a more effective laboratory system.In 1983, a White House Science Council Panel found that while DOE\u2019s laboratories had well-defined missions for part of their work, most activities were fragmented and unrelated to the laboratories\u2019 main responsibilities.In 1992, DOE\u2019s Secretary of Energy Advisory Board found that the laboratories\u2019 broad missions, coupled with rapidly changing world events, had \u201ccaused a loss of coherence and focus at the laboratories, thereby reducing their overall effectiveness in responding to their traditional missions as well as new national initiatives. . . .\u201d", "A 1993 report by an internal DOE task force reported that missions \u201cmust be updated to support DOE\u2019s new directions and to respond to new national imperatives. . . .\u201d", "The most recent extensive review of DOE\u2019s national laboratories was performed by a task force chaired by Robert Galvin, former Chairman of the Motorola Corporation. Consisting of distinguished leaders from government, academia, and industry, the Galvin Task Force was established to examine alternatives for directing the laboratories\u2019 scientific and engineering resources to meet the economic, environmental, defense, scientific, and energy needs of the nation. Its 1995 report identified many of the problems noted in earlier studies and called for a more disciplined focus for the national laboratories, also reporting that the laboratories may be oversized for their role.", "The Galvin Task Force reported that the traditional government ownership and contractor operation of the laboratories has not worked well. According to its report, increasing DOE\u2019s administration and oversight transformed the laboratories from traditional contractor-operated systems into a virtual government-operated system. The report noted that many past studies of DOE\u2019s laboratories had resulted in efforts to fine-tune the system but led to little fundamental improvement. Regarding the management structure of DOE\u2019s non-weapons-oriented laboratories, the task force recommended a major change in the organization and governance of the laboratory system. The task force envisioned a not-for-profit corporation governed by a board of trustees, consisting primarily of distinguished scientists and engineers and experienced senior executives from U.S. industry. Such a change in governance, the task force reported, would improve the standards and quality of work and at the same time generate over 20 percent in cost savings.", "Other findings by the task force and subsequent reports by other advisory groups have focused on the need for DOE to integrate R&D programs across the Department and among the laboratories to increase management efficiencies, reduce administrative burdens, and better define the laboratories\u2019 missions.", "In June 1995, DOE\u2019s Task Force on Strategic Energy Research and Development, chaired by energy analyst Daniel Yergin, issued a report on DOE\u2019s energy R&D programs. The report assessed the rationale for the federal government\u2019s support of energy R&D, reviewed the priorities and management of the overall program, and recommended ways of making it more efficient and effective. The task force recommended that DOE streamline its R&D management, develop a strategic plan for energy R&D, eliminate duplicative laboratory programs and research projects, and reorganize and consolidate dispersed R&D programs at DOE laboratories.", "In August 1995, the National Science and Technology Council examined laboratories in DOE, the Department of Defense (DOD), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The Council reported that DOE\u2019s existing system of laboratory governance needs fundamental repair, stating that DOE\u2019s laboratory system is bigger and more expensive than is needed to meet essential missions in energy, the environment, national security, and fundamental science. The Council recommended that DOE develop ways to eliminate apparent overlap and unnecessary redundancy between its laboratory system and DOD\u2019s and NASA\u2019s.", "DOE\u2019s Laboratory Operations Board was created in 1995 to focus the laboratories\u2019 missions and reduce DOE\u2019s micromanagement. Members serving on the Board from outside DOE have issued four different reports, which have noted the need to focus and define the laboratories\u2019 missions in relation to the Department\u2019s missions, integrate the laboratories\u2019 programmatic work, and streamline operations, including the elimination or reduction of administrative burdens.", "In March 1997, the Office of Science and Technology Policy reported on laboratories managed by DOE, DOD, and NASA. The Office cited efforts by the three agencies to improve their laboratory management but found that DOE was still micro-managing its laboratories and had made little progress toward reducing the administrative burdens it imposes on its laboratories. The Office recommended a variety of improvements in performance measures, incentives, and productivity and urged more streamlined management.", "In March 1997, a report by the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) found that DOE\u2019s processes for managing environment, safety, and health activities were impeding effective management. According to IDA, DOE\u2019s onerous review processes undermined accountability and prevented timely decisions from being made and implemented throughout the entire nuclear weapons complex, including the national laboratories. IDA specifically noted that DOE\u2019s Defense Programs had confusing line and staff relationships, inadequately defined roles and responsibilities, and poorly integrated programs and functions. IDA concluded that DOE needed to strengthen its line accountability and reorganize its structure in several areas."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOE Lacks an Effective Strategy for Addressing Advisory Groups\u2019 Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["At our request, DOE provided us with a listing of the actions it took in response to repeated calls for more focused laboratory missions and improved management. But while DOE has made progress\u2014principally by reducing paperwork burdens on its laboratories\u2014most of its actions are still in process or have unclear expectations and deadlines. Furthermore, the Department cannot demonstrate how its actions have resulted, or may result, in fundamental change.", "To analyze progress in laboratory management reform, we talked to DOE and laboratory officials and asked DOE to document the actions it has taken, is taking, or has planned to address the recommendations from several advisory groups. We used DOE\u2019s responses, which are reprinted in appendix III, as a basis for discussions with laboratory and DOE officials and with 18 experts familiar with national laboratory issues. We asked these experts to examine DOE\u2019s responses. Several of these experts had served on the Galvin Task Force and are currently serving on DOE\u2019s Laboratory Operations Board (app. IV lists the experts we interviewed). The actions DOE said it is taking include creating various internal working groups; strengthening the Energy R&D Council to facilitate more effective planning, budgeting, management, and evaluation of the Department\u2019s R&D programs and to improve the linkage between research and technology development; increasing the use of private-sector management practices; adopting performance-based contracting and continuous improvement concepts; improving the oversight of efforts to enhance productivity and reduce overhead costs at the laboratories; expanding the laboratories\u2019 work for other federal agencies; evaluating the proper balance between laboratories and universities for basic research; improving science and technology partnerships with industry; reducing unnecessary oversight burdens on laboratories; developing the Strategic Laboratory Missions Plan in July 1996 that identified laboratory activities in mission areas; creating the Laboratory Operations Board, which includes DOE officials and experts from industry and academia, to provide guidance and direction to the laboratories; and developing \u201ctechnology roadmaps,\u201d a strategic planning technique to focus the laboratories\u2019 roles."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOE\u2019s Actions Offer Uncertain Progress", "paragraphs": ["Most of the actions DOE reported to us are process oriented, incomplete, or only marginally related to past recommendations for change. For example, creating new task forces and strengthening old ones may be good for defining problems, but these measures cannot force decisions or effect change.", "DOE\u2019s major effort to give more focus to laboratory missions was a Strategic Laboratory Missions Plan, published in July 1996. The plan describes the laboratories\u2019 capabilities in the context of DOE\u2019s missions and, according to the plan, will form the basis for defining the laboratories\u2019 missions in the future. However, the plan is essentially a descriptive document that does not direct change. Nor does the plan tie DOE\u2019s or the laboratories\u2019 missions to the annual budget process. When we asked laboratory officials about strategic planning, most discussed their own planning capabilities, and some laboratories provided us with their own self-generated strategic planning documents. None of the officials at the six laboratories we visited mentioned DOE\u2019s Strategic Laboratory Missions Plan as an essential document for their strategic planning.", "A second action that DOE officials reported as a major step toward focusing the laboratories\u2019 missions is the introduction of its \u201ctechnology roadmaps.\u201d These are described by DOE as planning tools that define the missions, goals, and requirements of research on a program-by-program basis. Officials told us that the roadmaps are used to connect larger departmental goals and are a way to institutionalize strategic planning within the Department. Roadmaps, according to DOE, will be an important instrument for melding the laboratories into a stronger and more integrated national system. DOE reports that roadmaps have already been developed in some areas, including nuclear science, high-energy physics, and the fusion program.", "Experts we interviewed agreed that creating roadmaps can be a way to gain consensus between DOE and the laboratories on a common set of objectives while also developing a process for reaching those objectives. However, some experts also stated that it is too soon to tell if this initiative will succeed. One expert indicated that the Department has not adequately analyzed its energy R&D problems on a national basis before beginning the roadmap effort. Another was uncertain about just how the roadmaps will work. According to a laboratory director who was recently asked to comment on the roadmap process, more emphasis needs to be placed on the results that are expected from the roadmaps, rather than on the process of creating them. Furthermore, roadmapping may be difficult in some areas, especially for activities involving heavy regulatory requirements. When we asked DOE officials about roadmapping, we were told that it is still a work in progress and will not be connected directly to the budget process for months or even years.", "Other DOE actions are also described as works in progress. For example, the use of performance-based contracts is relatively new, and the results from the strengthened R&D Council are still uncertain. The R&D Council includes the principal secretarial officers who oversee DOE\u2019s R&D programs and is chaired by the Under Secretary. According to DOE, the Council has a new charter that will promote the integration and management of the Department\u2019s R&D.", "One area in which DOE reports that it has made significant improvements is reducing the burden of its oversight on the national laboratories. Although some laboratory directors told DOE that their laboratories are still micromanaged, most officials and experts we interviewed credited DOE with reducing oversight as the major positive change since the Galvin Task Force issued its report in 1995."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Laboratory Operations Board Was Created to Provide Laboratory Focus", "paragraphs": ["DOE\u2019s major organizational action in response to recent advisory groups\u2019 recommendations was to create the Laboratory Operations Board in April 1995. The purpose of the Board is to provide dedicated management attention to laboratory issues on a continuing basis. The Board includes 13 senior DOE officials and 9 external members drawn from the private sector, academia, and the public. The external members have staggered, 6-year terms and are required to assess DOE\u2019s and the laboratories\u2019 progress in meeting such goals as management initiatives, productivity improvement, mission focus, and programmatic accomplishments.", "The Board\u2019s external members have issued four reports, the results of which largely mirror past findings by the many previous advisory groups. These reports have also concluded that DOE has made some progress in addressing the problems noted by the Galvin Task Force but that progress has been slow and many of the recommendations need further actions.", "Several experts we interviewed generally viewed the Board positively. Some, however, recognized that the Board\u2019s limited advisory role is not a substitute for strong DOE leadership and organizational accountability. One expert commented that the effectiveness of the Board was diminished by the fact that it meets too infrequently (quarterly) and has had too many changes in membership to function as an effective adviser. Other experts agreed but indicated that the Board still has had a positive influence on reforming the laboratory system. One expert said that the Board\u2019s membership is not properly balanced between internal and external members (although originally specifying 8 of each, the Board\u2019s charter was recently changed to require 13 DOE members and only 9 external members). Another expert indicated that the Board could increase its effectiveness by more carefully setting an agenda for each year and then aggressively monitoring progress to improve its management of the laboratory system.", "Laboratory officials we interviewed also viewed the Board in generally positive terms; some commented that the Board\u2019s presence gives the laboratories a much needed voice in headquarters. Others noted that the Board could eventually play a role in integrating the laboratories\u2019 R&D work across program lines, thereby addressing a major concern about the laboratories\u2019 lack of integration noted by past advisory groups.", "Although the Board can be an effective source of direction and guidance for the laboratories, it has no authority to carry out reform operations.

Few could cite an example of a step taken in direct response to a DOE action. For example, several laboratory officials cited an increased level of cooperation and coordination among the laboratories involved with similar R&D activities. They also mentioned adopting \u201cbest business practices\u201d to increase productivity, reduce overhead costs, and measure progress by improved metrics.

Noting long-standing concerns in DOE about how best to define the relationships between field offices and the headquarters program offices that sponsor work, the Institute concluded that \u201cthe overall picture that emerges is one of considerable confusion over vertical relationships and the roles of line and staff officials.\u201d", "DOE\u2019s complex organization stems from the multiple levels of reporting that exist between the laboratories, field offices (called operations offices), and headquarters program offices. DOE\u2019s laboratories are funded and directed by program offices\u2014the nine largest laboratories are funded by many different DOE program offices. The program office that usually provides the dominant funding serves as the laboratory\u2019s \u201clandlord\u201d. The landlord program office is responsible for sitewide management at the laboratory and coordinates crosscutting issues, such as compliance with environment, safety, and health requirements at the laboratories. DOE\u2019s Energy Research is landlord to several laboratories, including the Brookhaven and Lawrence Berkeley laboratories. Defense Programs is the landlord for the Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore national laboratories. The program offices, in turn, report to either the Deputy Secretary or the Under Secretary.", "Further complicating reporting, DOE assigns each laboratory to a field operations office, whose director serves as the contract manager and also prepares the laboratory\u2019s annual appraisal. The operations office, however, reports to a separate headquarters office under the Deputy Secretary, not to the program office that supplies the funding. Thus, while the Los Alamos National Laboratory is primarily funded by Defense Programs, it reports to a field manager who reports to another part of the agency.", "As a consequence of DOE\u2019s complex structure, IDA reported that unclear chains of command led to the weak integration of programs and functions across the Department, wide variations among field activities and relationships and processes, and confusion over the difference between line and staff roles.", "Weaknesses in DOE\u2019s ability to manage the laboratories as an integrated system of R&D facilities is one the most persistent findings from past advisory groups, as well as from our 1995 management review of laboratory issues. We concluded that DOE had not coordinated the laboratories\u2019 efforts as part of a diversified research system to solve national problems. Instead, DOE was managing the laboratories on a program-by-program basis. We recommended that DOE evaluate alternatives for managing the laboratories that would more fully support the achievement of clear and coordinated missions. To help achieve this goal, we said that DOE should strengthen the Office of Laboratory Management to facilitate the laboratories\u2019 cooperation and resolve management issues across all DOE program areas.
