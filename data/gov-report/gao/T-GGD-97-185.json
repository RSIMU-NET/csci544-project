As you know, we testified in June on S. 314, the Senate companion bill to H.R. 716, and my remarks today closely parallel our statement before the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs.Specifically, I will discuss H.R. 716 as a potential vehicle for competitive contracting, using the results of our recent work on privatization initiatives at the state and local government levels. enhance monitoring and oversight to evaluate compliance with the terms of the privatization agreement and evaluate performance in delivering services to ensure that the government\u2019s interests are fully protected."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "H.R. 716 Provides a Tool but Not a Substitute for a Political Champion", "paragraphs": ["The history of government reform has demonstrated that new policies, whether based in law or in administrative directives, are not self-implementing. In our work on state and local privatization initiatives, we reported that reforms such as privatization are most likely to be sustained when there is a committed political leader to champion the initiative. In the six governments we visited, a political leader (the governor or mayor), or in one case, several leaders working in concert (state legislators and the governor), played a crucial role in fostering privatization. These leaders built internal and external support for privatization, sustained momentum for their privatization initiatives, and adjusted implementation strategies when barriers to privatization arose.", "H.R. 716 does not, and probably cannot, provide for effective political leadership. It has been executive branch policy for more than 30 years to encourage competition between the federal workforce and the private sector for providing commercial goods and services. However, this policy has been embodied only in an administrative directive, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76. While we have consistently endorsed the concept of encouraging such competition, its effectiveness in practice has been questioned both in the executive branch and in dozens of congressional hearings.", "H.R. 716 would give the force of law to general reliance on the private sector for commercial goods and services, and thus would provide a stronger foundation, but not a substitute, for political leadership."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "H.R. 716 Would Establish a Flexible Implementation Structure", "paragraphs": ["To implement their privatization initiatives, the governments we visited reported the need to establish an organizational and analytical structure. A key aspect of this structure is an office to guide and support the privatization initiative and provide the analytical framework to evaluate the costs, benefits, and risks of privatizing a particular activity. Many of the frameworks established by the six governments shared common elements, such as criteria for selecting activities to privatize, methods for cost comparisons, and procedures for monitoring the performance of privatized activities. ensuring compliance by agencies; and providing guidance, information, and assistance to both private and public sectors.", "OMB is given wide latitude as to what regulations it will issue and what they will contain.

These issues could include such questions as", "Whether government corporations, federally funded research and development centers, state governments, or even the U.S. Postal Service should be included within the definition of \u201cprivate sector sources\u201d and thus eligible to compete for the government\u2019s contracts.", "Whether public buildings would need to be sold to the private sector in order to house federal employees.", "How OMB will incorporate congressional views when significant or highly sensitive conversions are proposed.", "Given concerns such as these, Congress will need to oversee OMB\u2019s performance of its responsibilities. The strategic and annual performance plans and annual report that OMB is to produce under the Government Performance and Results Act, provide a mechanism for such accountability. OMB could include in its strategic plan an objective and strategy for implementing the bill\u2019s requirements. The strategy could be developed in consultation with Congress and could describe major priorities as well as specific milestones for implementing the bill\u2019s provisions. In addition, OMB through its annual performance plan could provide a schedule for changing current policies and systems that would be necessary to accomplish the bill\u2019s purposes. Such a schedule would provide greater direction for agencies as they go through the process of identifying potential activities to be included in their annual performance plans. It could also provide a firm basis for Congress to assess OMB and agency activities as they relate to the bill\u2019s requirements. management responsibilities, which have been expanded significantly in recent years.

The bill has significant implications for the ongoing implementation of the Results Act; the Act focuses on what activities the government should or should not be performing from the perspective of overall contributions to missions and goals, while the bill addresses how and by whom those activites should be performed. Under the provisions of the Results Act, agencies are required to set their strategic direction through multiyear strategic plans, develop annual goals, and report on performance against those goals. Agency strategic plans and performance measures are intended to provide Congress with a vehicle for asking fundamental questions about federal functions and their performance. In our recent reports on the implementation of the act, we have found that many agencies are not yet well positioned to specify their plans and strategies in terms of tangible results.", "If enacted, the bill\u2019s implementation will occur as agencies are going through their first cycle of planning, measuring, and reporting on program performance, as called for under the Results Act. The bill would amend the Results Act by requiring, among other things, that agencies include in the annual performance plans and reports that they submit to Congress (1) inventories of functions that are and are not subject to the Freedom From Government Competition Act\u2019s provisions and (2) a schedule for converting to private sector performance those functions capable of, but not currently, being performed by the private sector. Requiring agencies to specify the activities they would perform directly, and those they would convert to private sector performance, is consistent with the Result Act\u2019s strategic planning requirements. key provision of H.R. 716 requires OMB to create a methodology for making determinations on what types of activities should and should not remain in government. This provision, if integrated with the strategic planning and annual performance planning requirements of the Results Act, could avoid the potential situation of agencies inadvertently replacing unneeded federal functions with unneeded private sector contractors\u2014a concern we have expressed regarding Department of Defense depots. By making clear that, as part of their strategic planning and performance measurement activities, agencies should review potential outsourcing candidates in light of their contribution to mission accomplishment, the bill could reduce the possibility of such an outcome."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incentives May Be Needed for Implementing Change", "paragraphs": ["Encouraging the magnitude of change that this bill contemplates will require incentives if it is to be effective. We believe that integrating the bill\u2019s requirements with those of the Results Act is one of the best incentives Congress could use to ensure successful implementation. The Act should, if successfully implemented, expand opportunities for congressional oversight of agency performance, including, for example, closer scrutiny of agency budget requests for specific activities in the context of expectations about program performance. Another incentive could be to allow government agencies to use savings gained from eliminating duplication and unnecessary non-core functions to further improve operations or satisfy other priorities such as modernization.However, such proposals need to be carefully examined as they raise questions of congressional oversight and the allocation of scarce financial resources. the union-management team performed the activity at the desired level of performance for less than it had bid, the team would receive a share of the savings at the end of the year. The city, after tracking performance over a period of years, could place a moratorium on bidding for areas for which city employees had demonstrated performance excellence and in which they had consistently outbid private competitors. In addition, Indianapolis built community support by taking some cost savings achieved through outsourcing and managed competitions and allocated it to hiring additional police, lowering tax rates, and increasing infrastructure projects. According to the Deputy Mayor, this approach built community support and provided further incentives for managed competition and outsourcing.", "In contrast, Georgia\u2019s Governor instituted a budget redirection program that required all agencies to prioritize their current programs and activities and identify those programs that could be eliminated or streamlined. The agencies were required to make at least 5 percent of their total state-funded budgets available for redirection to higher priorities. According to a Georgia Privatization Commission official, agencies were given a 6-month notice that their budgets would be cut by 5 percent. State officials said these budget cuts required managers to rethink how they could perform the same activities for a lower cost.

These actions were taken to encourage greater use of privatization. Georgia, for example, enacted legislation to reform the state\u2019s civil service and to reduce the operating funds of state agencies. Virginia reduced the size of the state\u2019s workforce and enacted legislation to establish an independent state council to foster privatization efforts. These actions, officials told us, reduced obstacles to privatization and sent a signal to managers and employees that political leaders were serious about implementing it. provide any products or services that can be provided by the private sector, and it prohibits agencies from providing any goods or services to any other governmental entity. This could conflict with the \u201cEconomy Act of 1932\u201d (31 U.S. 1535-1536), which authorizes interagency orders for goods and services, as well as with the General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) authority to provide agencies with goods and services.

The Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) has developed standards that are designed to provide information on the costs, management, and effectiveness of federal agencies. These standards require agencies to develop measures of the full costs of carrying out a mission or of producing products and services. Such information, when available, would allow for comparing the costs of various programs and activities with their performance outputs and results. To help agencies meet these standards, the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP) plans to issue guidance to facilitate the acquisition and development of managerial cost accounting systems needed to accumulate and assign cost data consistent with governmentwide data."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "H.R. 716 Recognizes Federal Workforce Transition Needs", "paragraphs": ["We found that governments we visited needed to develop strategies to help their workforces make the transition to a private-sector environment.

Oversight was needed not only to evaluate compliance with the terms of the privatization agreement, but also to evaluate performance in delivering goods and services in order to ensure that the government\u2019s interests were fully protected.

Conversion to contract performance requires considerable contract management capability. An agency must have adequate capacity and expertise to successfully carry out the solicitation process and effectively administer, monitor, and audit contracts once they are awarded. In past reports on governmentwide contract management, we identified major problem areas, such as ineffective contract administration, insufficient oversight of contract auditing, and lack of high-level management attention to and accountability for contract management. Some federal agencies have recognized the problem and have taken actions intended to improve their contract management capacity.

We designated DOE contracting in 1990 as a high-risk area, vulnerable to waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement, because DOE\u2019s missions rely heavily on contractors and DOE has a history of weak contractor oversight; however, it has been working to improve its contract management practices. As we recently reported in our high-risk report on DOE, changing the way DOE does business has not come easily or quickly. DOE has taken various actions in the past to improve its contracting, and a recent contract reform effort that has received high priority and visibility appears promising; however, much remains to be done to ensure effective oversight of contractors.", "NASA\u2019s contracting reforms demonstrate what can be accomplished when an agency places high priority on contractor oversight. NASA spends about 90 percent of its budget on contracts with businesses and other organizations. NASA\u2019s procurement budget is one of the largest among federal civilian agencies, totaling about $13 billion annually in recent years. NASA first identified its contract management as vulnerable to waste and mismanagement in the late 1980s. Since then, it has grappled with a variety of contract management problems. NASA has made considerable progress in developing ways to better influence contractors\u2019 performance and to improve oversight of field centers\u2019 procurement activities. It has, for example, established a process for collecting cost, schedule, and technical information for all major NASA contracts to assist management in the tracking of contractor performance, and it also has restructured its policy on award fees to emphasize contract cost control and the performance of contractors\u2019 end products.", "In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, striking a proper balance between the public- and private-sector provision of goods and services to the American people is among the most enduring issues in American politics and public policy.
