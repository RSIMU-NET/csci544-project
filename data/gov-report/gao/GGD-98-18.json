In a May 1994 delegation memorandum, Treasury expanded FinCEN\u2019s anti-money laundering role to include responsibility for promulgating regulations under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), which has been amended various times since its enactment in 1970. Recent amendments were made by the Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994 (MLSA). The MLSA, in general, directed Treasury to take certain actions regarding the use of money transmitting businesses by criminals involved in money laundering. Because you were concerned whether FinCEN had made progress in addressing this threat and accomplishing other directives of the MLSA, you asked us to assess FinCEN\u2019s efforts to issue regulations pursuant to the BSA, as amended. In so doing, this report addresses the following questions, particularly in reference to the MLSA:", "What process did FinCEN follow for developing and issuing BSA regulations?", "What is the current status of FinCEN\u2019s efforts to develop and issue BSA regulations? More specifically, what regulations has FinCEN developed thus far, and what regulations has the agency been authorized or required to develop but has not done so?", "To identify the regulatory or rulemaking process that FinCEN followed, we interviewed FinCEN officials who are responsible for preparing BSA regulations and reviewed related agency documents. We also interviewed Treasury and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) officials about their procedures for reviewing drafts of FinCEN\u2019s regulations before publication. We examined relevant sections of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)and Executive Order 12866 prescribing procedures that federal agencies are to follow when developing and issuing regulations. However, the scope of our work did not constitute a review of FinCEN\u2019s compliance with applicable statutory and executive order guidance.", "To determine the status of FinCEN\u2019s efforts to develop and issue regulations, as agreed with your offices, we focused on eight regulatory initiatives that are authorized or required by MLSA amendments to the BSA: designate a single recipient for suspicious activity reports (SAR) to help law enforcement agencies make more effective use of these reports (by statute, to be completed by Mar. 23, 1995); extend BSA currency reporting and recordkeeping requirements to certain gaming institutions operated on tribal lands; extend BSA currency reporting and recordkeeping requirements to card specify selected entities as being exempt (mandatory exemptions) from filing currency transaction reports (CTR) to substantially reduce the number of CTRs filed by depository institutions and to enhance the usefulness of CTRs to law enforcement; define certain types of businesses that can be exempted (discretionary exemptions) from filing CTRs to further reduce the number of CTRs filed and enhance the usefulness of these reports to law enforcement (by statute, to be completed by Sept. 23, 1996); extend BSA reporting requirements to certain negotiable instruments drawn by foreign banks to address the potential use of \u201cforeign bank drafts\u201d in money laundering schemes; require certain money transmitting businesses, which FinCEN has proposed to redefine as \u201cmoney services businesses\u201d (MSB), to register with Treasury to address concerns that these entities are particularly vulnerable to money laundering schemes (by statute, to be completed by Mar. 23, 1995); and delegate authority to assess a civil monetary penalty on depository institutions under the BSA to the appropriate federal banking regulatory agencies to increase efficiencies by allowing these agencies to impose civil penalties directly, rather than make referrals to FinCEN.", "In focusing on the eight regulatory initiatives, we reviewed all notices of proposed and final rulemaking issued by FinCEN since 1994, as published in the Federal Register. Furthermore, regarding FinCEN\u2019s efforts to develop and issue regulations, we interviewed FinCEN officials and 6 of the 35 members of the BSA Advisory Group, which includes representatives from the law enforcement, regulatory, and financial services communities. Also, we reviewed relevant literature and our past reports to identify any potential best practices for developing and issuing regulations.", "We performed our work from April to December 1997, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Appendix IV provides further details about our objectives, scope, and methodology.", "We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Director of FinCEN. A reprint of FinCEN\u2019s written comments can be found in appendix VI, and our evaluation of those comments follows our recommendation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. government\u2019s framework for preventing and detecting money laundering efforts is the BSA, which was enacted in 1970, in part, in response to concern over the use of financial institutions by criminals to launder the proceeds of their illicit activity. Despite its name, the BSA, among other things, is a disclosure law. As originally enacted, the BSA required, for example, the maintenance of records by financial institutions and the reporting of certain domestic currency transactions and cross-border transportation of currency. One purpose of such records and reports was to create a paper trail for investigators\u2019 use in tracing illicit funds. The MLSA amendments to the BSA are, among other things, intended to improve upon this paper trail. For example, one benefit intended by the MLSA is to enhance the usefulness of CTRs to law enforcement agencies. Another benefit is to register MSBs, which are entities reportedly vulnerable to money laundering schemes.", "According to FinCEN, its regulatory program priorities and outlines of specific regulatory projects can originate from various sources. These sources include statutory mandates or authorities; deficiencies in the present rules identified by enforcement officials; and suggestions from financial institutions (e.g., withdrawal of the requirement that would have mandated certain financial institutions to file CTRs on magnetic media).", "The APA establishes certain procedures that an agency must follow when promulgating rules. Informal rulemaking under the APA generally requires such actions as notification of proposed rulemaking by publication in the Federal Register, involvement of interested persons through notice and comment, and publication of a final rule at least 30 days before it becomes effective.", "FinCEN is a relatively small agency with a fiscal year 1997 budget of about $23 million and an on-board staffing level of about 160 employees.Created in 1990, FinCEN\u2019s original mission centered on supporting law enforcement agencies\u2019 anti-money laundering efforts. Investigative case support included, for example, accessing numerous databases and using advanced technology to identify and analyze relevant financial transactions. Over the years, FinCEN\u2019s mission has become more multifaceted, including assumption of a leadership role in international efforts to combat money laundering. For instance, besides heading the U.S. delegation to the Financial Action Task Force, FinCEN has assisted other nations to establish financial intelligence units, which are intended to serve as focal points for these countries\u2019 anti-money laundering efforts.", "In May 1994, Treasury expanded FinCEN\u2019s anti-money laundering role to include responsibility for administration of the BSA. In this role, besides promulgating BSA regulations, FinCEN interprets the BSA and assesses civil monetary penalties for BSA violations. FinCEN officials told us that about 10 staff worked on BSA regulations in recent years. FinCEN officials noted, however, that none of these 10 staff had worked on regulations on a full-time or exclusive basis; rather, the staff had also been involved in other mission functions and responsibilities. Notices of proposed rulemaking and final rules are prepared by FinCEN\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, with the participation of staff from FinCEN\u2019s Office of Program Development and Office of Compliance and Regulatory Enforcement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FinCEN\u2019s Regulatory Process Was Designed to Reflect Standardized Procedures", "paragraphs": ["FinCEN\u2019s regulatory process was designed to reflect standardized procedures that have governmentwide applicability under the APA. The APA establishes certain procedures that an agency must follow when promulgating rules. Informal rulemaking under the APA generally requires such actions as notification of proposed rulemaking by publication in the Federal Register, involvement of interested persons through notice and comment, and publication of a final rule at least 30 days before it becomes effective. Concerning the involvement of interested persons, the APA generally requires that agencies give such persons an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process through submission of written data, views, or arguments. The APA also requires that agencies incorporate into each rule a concise general statement of its basis and purpose. Our review showed that FinCEN published notices of proposed rulemaking and final rules in the Federal Register.", "Also, as an additional means of enhancing public visibility, FinCEN presented its fiscal year regulatory priorities in annual plans, pursuant to Executive Order 12866 requirements. Under this executive branch guidance, each fiscal year, federal agencies are to prepare a regulatory plan presenting, among other things, the respective agency\u2019s regulatory priorities and the most significant regulatory actions that the agency reasonably expects to issue in proposed or final form during the year. In its regulatory plan for fiscal year 1996, for example, FinCEN listed three priority regulatory initiatives related to provisions of the MLSA\u2014mandatory CTR exemptions, suspicious activity reporting (to designate a single recipient for these reports), and tribal casinos\u2014and one initiative to modify two final rules related to wire transfers. During fiscal year 1996, FinCEN issued an interim rule and two final rules, respectively, for the three MLSA-related priorities.", "FinCEN\u2019s fiscal year 1997 regulatory plan accorded priority to issuing notices of proposed rulemaking for five topics: (1) registering of MSBs; (2) reporting of the cross-border transportation of certain monetary instruments (i.e., foreign bank drafts); (3) extending to securities brokers and dealers and casinos the requirement to report suspicious transactions; (4) requiring financial institutions to carry out certain anti-money laundering programs; and (5) delegating civil penalty authority to bank regulatory agencies. FinCEN accomplished the first two priorities during fiscal year 1997, but not the last three priorities. Instead, FinCEN found it necessary to issue additional regulations related to MSBs and issue regulations related to mandatory (final rule) and discretionary (notice of proposed rulemaking) CTR exemptions.", "According to FinCEN, the reason a priority was placed on the exemption regulations was to give the banking industry regulatory relief before adding additional requirements. FinCEN officials said that the proposed MSB regulations were given priority because FinCEN concluded that Treasury needed to pay more attention to updating the way the BSA applies to MSBs and to equalize the money laundering controls to which various types of financial institutions are subject. According to FinCEN, the need was identified on the basis of the success of law enforcement efforts in New York, which used special reporting requirements that were similar to the proposed regulations.", "In addition to standardized procedures, a significant aspect of FinCEN\u2019s regulatory process is its partnering strategy. This strategy emphasized frequent interaction and consultation with affected public and private sector representatives in the law enforcement, regulatory, and financial services communities.", "As previously mentioned, one forum that FinCEN used to operationalize its partnership strategy was the BSA Advisory Group. Generally, the members we interviewed were complimentary of FinCEN\u2019s participation in and use of this forum. A majority of the members commented that FinCEN\u2019s process, rather than focusing on timeliness, was properly focused on quality\u2014specifically, on developing and issuing substantively effective regulations. More specifically, one member noted that FinCEN\u2019s regulations are excellent and are worth the time invested. A second member noted that FinCEN has taken some innovative approaches, such as holding public meetings to discuss proposed regulations. A third member noted that, while it would be nice to have a faster process, FinCEN\u2019s partnership approach is good, even though such an approach may increase the time taken to develop regulations.", "FinCEN officials also told us that developing quality regulations takes time. A FinCEN official said that, to promulgate regulations that can be effectively implemented, the agency needed to take the time to develop expertise in particular subject areas and to consult with various stakeholders during the development process. FinCEN officials believe this approach is important to help ensure that issued regulations have credibility with law enforcement agencies, federal regulators, and affected industries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FinCEN\u2019s Prioritization of Work Deferred Issuance of Final Rules for Several MLSA-Related Regulatory Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 1995, FinCEN began taking action to develop regulations addressing MLSA provisions; but, as of December 1997, final rules were pending for five of the eight regulatory initiatives we reviewed. FinCEN officials told us that, given the number of regulatory initiatives requiring action, the number of staff with the expertise to develop regulations, and other reasons, the agency had to prioritize its work. FinCEN\u2019s prioritization of initiatives resulted in final regulatory actions related to several of the 1994 amendments being deferred into fiscal year 1997 and beyond. While we have no basis to criticize FinCEN\u2019s regulation-development process or its resource allocation decisions, we note in this report that FinCEN missed all three statutory deadlines imposed by the MLSA."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FinCEN Prioritized Regulatory Needs", "paragraphs": ["According to FinCEN officials, since being delegated the responsibility for BSA regulations, the agency has worked on only two or three regulatory issues at a time because of the complexities of the issues, the coordination required with the affected parties, competing mission demands, and the number of agency staff with regulatory expertise. As previously mentioned, FinCEN officials told us that its regulatory program priorities are influenced by various sources, including statutory mandates or authorities as well as needs identified by FinCEN or others.", "We requested information from FinCEN on the amount of time that FinCEN staff devoted to developing and issuing regulations. FinCEN officials told us that the agency does not track staff use by specific functions or strategic goals and objectives. According to the officials, 10 staff worked on developing regulations, but none of the 10 staff worked exclusively on regulatory efforts. These 10 staff, based upon our rough estimate, represented about 6 percent of FinCEN\u2019s total staff resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FinCEN Issued Final Rules for Some of the MLSA-Related Provisions, but Actions Are Pending for Others", "paragraphs": ["FinCEN produced its first rulemaking actions related to the MLSA late in fiscal year 1995, when FinCEN issued notices of proposed rulemaking to extend BSA reporting and recordkeeping requirements to tribal casinos (Aug. 1995) and to designate a single recipient for reporting of suspicious activities (Sept. 1995). FinCEN issued final rules for these two regulatory initiatives in fiscal year 1996 (Feb. 1996). Also, during fiscal year 1996, FinCEN issued an interim rule related to exemption of certain transactions from CTR requirements. A final rule that incorporated comments received on the interim rule was issued in fiscal year 1997 (Sept. 1997). During fiscal year 1997, FinCEN issued five notices of proposed rulemaking that related to BSA amendments made by the MLSA. No issuances have been made for one initiative related to the MLSA\u2014delegation of civil penalty authority to federal banking regulatory agencies.", "As of December 1997, FinCEN had not issued final rules for five regulatory initiatives related to the MLSA. However, as shown in table 2, FinCEN has issued notices of proposed rulemaking for four of the five pending regulatory initiatives. For example, FinCEN issued a notice of proposed rulemaking related to foreign bank drafts on January 22, 1997. According to a FinCEN official, comments were received, and, as of October 1997, a final rule was being developed. As presented in the fiscal year 1997 Unified Agenda, FinCEN had estimated that a final rule for this initiative would be issued in August 1997. However, in September 1997, a FinCEN official told us that developing final MSB regulations will be given priority over efforts to develop the final rule related to foreign bank drafts. Also, regarding the latter, the FinCEN official noted that senior Treasury managers will need to be involved. As a result, the FinCEN official said that he was uncertain as to when a final rule for foreign bank drafts would be published.", "Regarding the registration of MSBs and related issues, FinCEN published a set of three notices of proposed rulemaking on May 21, 1997. Treasury\u2019s Under Secretary for Enforcement had asked that FinCEN try to publish final rules for these three issues by the end of December 1997. FinCEN officials told us that these regulations, given their usefulness to law enforcement, have a high priority. According to FinCEN officials, adherence to the December 1997 schedule would have meant that the registration of existing MSBs would have been accomplished about 6 months later (i.e., by the end of June 1998).", "Another regulatory initiative under development, as table 2 shows, involves discretionary CTR exemptions. FinCEN issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on September 8, 1997, and requested that written comments be provided by December 8, 1997. Subsequently, FinCEN extended the comment period to January 16, 1998.", "Also, table 2 shows that FinCEN has not issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to delegate to federal banking regulatory agencies the authority to assess civil monetary penalties for BSA violations. Currently, such assessment authority is vested solely in FinCEN. In April 1997, in response to questions we asked in initiating our review, FinCEN officials told us they had been working with the banking agencies for over a year to devise an appropriate plan for delegating civil penalty assessment authority, but some issues still required resolution.", "In our follow-up discussions in July and September, 1997, FinCEN officials described the unresolved issues largely as establishing a common frame of reference for evaluating BSA violations and, in turn, for determining the appropriate penalty amounts. Additionally, FinCEN officials noted that, even with the delegation of assessment authority to the banking agencies, another unresolved issue is FinCEN\u2019s role in monitoring the various agencies\u2019 use of that authority. FinCEN also indicated that the federal banking regulatory agencies may be less inclined to assess BSA penalties and will instead use their present non-BSA authorities under the general examination powers granted to them (i.e., Title 12 of the U.S. Code).", "Accordingly, FinCEN officials told us they believe oversight of the delegated authority is necessary, and they are considering proposing that each banking regulatory agency prepare and submit to FinCEN quarterly reports of its efforts to enforce the BSA. FinCEN officials told us that they had not reached a mutual agreement with the federal banking regulators regarding proposed monitoring requirements. According to a FinCEN official, these unresolved issues are policy-oriented and will require consultation with Treasury officials. Also, the FinCEN official noted that the delegation issue has lower priority than other issues, such as the development of final MSB rules. As of December 1997, FinCEN had not established a projected issuance date for either a notice of proposed rulemaking or a final rule. According to FinCEN officials, the agency\u2019s disinclination to move quickly in this area reflects its sense that more needs to be learned about the implications of various approaches for cost-effective enforcement of banking regulation before the ultimate policy choices are made. FinCEN officials stated that the issues raised by delegation of civil penalty authority ultimately go beyond purely enforcement concerns. According to FinCEN officials, a briefing paper describing the issues for senior-level Treasury officials is to be prepared and submitted to Treasury by the end of February 1998.", "Another open issue for FinCEN, at the time of our review, involved a requirement that Treasury publish (1) written rulings interpreting the BSA and (2) annual staff commentaries on the BSA regulations. To assist FinCEN, the BSA Advisory Group formed a working group to prepare summaries that were provided to FinCEN for its use in meeting the requirement to publish commentaries. According to a FinCEN official, the agency has begun to review its written rulings to identify information that can and cannot be made public. This official estimated that redacted versions of the rulings may be published during the first quarter of calendar year 1998. On the other hand, the FinCEN official said that 2 or 3 years may be needed to write the commentaries because they involve more complicated issues."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FinCEN Did Not Fully Communicate Its Regulatory Priorities and Time Lines", "paragraphs": ["FinCEN prepared annual (fiscal year) plans presenting its priorities and regulatory agenda for the most significant regulatory actions that it expected to issue in proposed or final form during the applicable 12-month period. However, a limitation of FinCEN\u2019s annual plans is that they do not always present what is not being accomplished. For example, FinCEN\u2019s fiscal year 1996 regulatory plan accorded priority to three MLSA-related regulatory initiatives (mandatory CTR exemptions, suspicious activity reporting, and tribal casinos), but the plan did not mention that FinCEN would not be giving priority to other regulatory initiatives (e.g., registration of MSBs) requiring action under the MLSA.", "A limitation of the regulatory agenda is that it may not always present estimated dates for issuing final rules, particularly if a regulatory initiative involves a period beyond 12 months. For example, FinCEN\u2019s fiscal year 1995 regulatory agenda did not provide estimated dates for issuing final rules for any of the eight MLSA-related regulatory initiatives we reviewed. In fact, 2 years later, the fiscal year 1997 regulatory agenda represented FinCEN\u2019s first publication of estimated dates for issuing final rules involving any of these eight initiatives. The 1997 regulatory agenda provided estimated final rule issuance dates for three of the eight regulatory initiatives\u2014mandatory CTR exemptions, card clubs, and foreign bank drafts.", "Although FinCEN\u2019s 1995 plan did not address final rules, it did present estimated dates for issuing notices of proposed rulemaking for seven of the eight regulatory initiatives. In subsequent annual plans, FinCEN extended some of these dates. An example is the regulatory initiative involving the delegation of civil penalty assessment authority to the federal banking regulatory agencies. In the 1995 plan, FinCEN estimated that it would issue a notice of proposed rulemaking in July 1995. Later, FinCEN extended the estimated issuance date several times\u2014that is, to March 1996, then to September 1996, and then to February 1997. At the time of our review, a notice of proposed rulemaking still had not been issued, and FinCEN had not established a projected issuance date.", "Another mechanism that FinCEN has used to inform Congress of its regulatory agenda has been congressional hearings. We reviewed FinCEN\u2019s testimony given at hearings held during 1997 and found that agency officials generally discussed either final rules that had already been issued or regulatory initiatives that were currently under development. However, the testimonies did not discuss the MLSA-related directive related to delegating authority to federal banking agencies to assess civil penalties. Furthermore, with one exception\u2014a July 1997 hearing that focused on MSB regulations\u2014none of the testimonies provided specific target dates for issuing final rules or discussed why statutory deadlines had not been met.", "In addition to hearings, FinCEN officials believe that their briefings with congressional Members and staff have kept appropriate committees informed of the agency\u2019s regulatory agenda. However, FinCEN officials were unable to provide us with specific information about whether the implementation of all of its MLSA-related directives, including specific target dates for issuing final rules, had been discussed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["FinCEN\u2019s process for developing and issuing BSA regulations was generally designed to reflect applicable procedures set forth in the APA and Executive Order 12866. For example, FinCEN published notices of proposed rulemaking and final rules. In addition, FinCEN used a partnering approach to actively seek input from the law enforcement, regulatory, and financial services communities.", "Since 1994, when it was delegated responsibility for administering the BSA, FinCEN has issued a number of proposed and final rules pursuant to MLSA amendments to the BSA. At the time of our review, however, several final regulations related to the MLSA were still pending, including two regulations (discretionary CTR exemptions and registration of MSBs) that had statutory deadlines for implementation of over a year ago. In recognizing that development of quality regulations can be time consuming, FinCEN prioritized its regulatory program initiatives by considering, among other things, the number of experienced staff available.", "FinCEN did not meet any of the three statutory deadlines imposed by the MLSA. Clearly, Congress\u2019 inclusion of statutory deadlines with respect to the MLSA provisions shows that it intended that those initiatives be completed in a timely manner. We note in this report that the intended law enforcement benefits of the MLSA amendments cannot be fully achieved until all of the regulations are implemented.", "FinCEN published its annual regulatory plans in the Federal Register. However, the annual plans do not (1) cover regulatory initiatives that are not under development but that need to be addressed; (2) prioritize among all of the open statutory directives and other identified needs; (3) set target dates for issuing both notices of proposed rulemaking and final rules; and (4) provide a means for obtaining input on long-range priorities from the appropriate congressional committees. FinCEN also said that it communicated the agency\u2019s regulatory plans through various other means, including testimony at congressional hearings. However, we found that FinCEN\u2019s testimonies during 1997 generally did not provide specific target dates for issuing final rules or discuss why statutory deadlines had not been met.", "Thus, congressional committees have not been in a good position to assess FinCEN\u2019s regulatory program, including the agency\u2019s prioritization of regulatory initiatives, the time lines for issuing final regulations, and the allocation of resources necessary for completing these initiatives. An illustration of this point is our review, which was requested because the Subcommittee lacked information about FinCEN\u2019s rulemaking plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations to the Director, FinCEN", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Director, FinCEN, establish target dates for implementing all relevant statutory BSA-related regulatory directives and provide the appropriate congressional committees with information on the status of FinCEN\u2019s implementation efforts. This information should include FinCEN\u2019s plans, priorities, target dates for issuing notices of proposed rulemaking and final rules, and accomplishments. Where delays would be significant, it could also include a request for legislation to extend the statutory completion date. Furthermore, recognizing that circumstances can change, we recommend that the Director periodically update this information and transmit it to the appropriate congressional committees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In a letter dated January 8, 1998, FinCEN\u2019s Director provided written comments on a draft of this report (see app. VI). The Director noted that the draft report contained a detailed and comprehensive discussion of the process that FinCEN used to develop and issue regulations and the status of those regulations. However, the Director had two main disagreements with the draft report.", "First, he commented that the draft report did not accurately describe the level of effort FinCEN devoted to its regulatory initiatives or reflect the agency\u2019s other money laundering missions. We believe this report adequately addresses FinCEN\u2019s efforts to develop regulations and carry out its other missions. We describe FinCEN\u2019s multiple missions; the number of staff the agency had working on developing regulations; and its coordination efforts with the law enforcement, regulatory, and financial services communities. However, as mentioned in this report, FinCEN does not track the amount of time staff spend on specific functions or strategic goals and objectives. Thus, FinCEN could not provide us with, and we could not report on, more specific information on the level of effort FinCEN expended on its regulatory initiatives.", "Second, the Director commented that the draft report did not describe the extent to which FinCEN informs Congress of its objectives. According to the Director, the agency has adequately communicated its rulemaking agenda to appropriate congressional committees. Furthermore, the Director commented that the results of our audit work did not support the recommendation that FinCEN needed to better communicate its regulatory priorities as indicated in the report and the draft report\u2019s title. In his comment letter, the Director mentioned that FinCEN had informed Congress of its work through various hearings, briefings, and other communications or interactions involving congressional committees and subcommittees and/or their staff.", "We recognize that FinCEN, at various times, has informed certain committees and subcommittees or their staffs of the progress made on a number of regulatory initiatives, and we expanded our discussion of these communications in this report (see pp. 14 and 15). However, these communications were neither systematic in providing uniform information to all interested congressional parties nor done on any periodic basis. A consequence of this type of ad hoc communication is to make it more difficult for Members of Congress and staff who are not directly involved in congressional testimonies and briefings to effectively perform their oversight responsibilities. Moreover, at the time of our review, FinCEN could not provide us with any evidence that it had\u2014through the means described by the Director or through its annual plans\u2014communicated time-specific goals for implementing all relevant statutory BSA-related directives. For example, FinCEN had not communicated to Congress estimated completion dates for final rules for five of the eight statutory directives that we reviewed, two of which had statutory deadlines. Clearly, Congress\u2019 inclusion of statutory deadlines with respect to such MLSA provisions shows an interest in implementing these initiatives in a timely manner.", "The Director attached to his January 8, 1998, letter a summary of the status of the implementation of MLSA initiatives (\u201cSummary of Status under the MLSA\u201d), which he offered as an example of the kind of information provided by FinCEN to Congress. FinCEN added a column labeled \u201cProposed Action and Date\u201d to the summary in response to December 1997 discussions with us on a draft of this report. This summary, with the recently added information, represents progress toward meeting the intent of our recommendation. Nonetheless, while the additional information is helpful, the summary still does not provide expected dates for issuing final rules for three statutory provisions\u2014the discretionary CTR exemption system (phase II), delegation to federal banking regulatory agencies the authority to assess civil penalties, and registration of money services businesses. Two of these\u2014the CTR exemption system and registration of MSBs \u2014are past their statutory deadlines by more than a year.", "In his letter, the Director stated that \u201cit is unprecedented that an agency should be mandated to provide such a level of detail as to its regulatory operations in absence of any findings of serious deficiency.\u201d In addressing this comment, we want to emphasize three points.
