To configure the EHR system, which VA planned to implement initially at the Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center, in Spokane, Washington, in July 2020, and at the Puget Sound Health Care System in the fall of 2020, VA established 18 EHR councils comprising VA clinicians, staff, and other experts in various clinical areas and held eight national workshops between November 2018 and October 2019. At these workshops, the councils decided how to design the functionality of the EHR software to help clinicians and other staff deliver care and complete tasks such as administering medication. VA also held eight local workshops at both medical centers to help ensure that the EHR configuration supported local practices. As of March 2020, the EHR councils were continuing to meet to complete configuration decisions. Furthermore, VA plans to hold local workshops in advance of the EHR system implementation at future VA medical facilities. In April 2020, the VA Secretary announced that the department had shifted priorities to focus on caring for veterans in response to the pandemic created by COVID-19. According to program officials, at that time, they paused the implementation of the EHR system and were assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on VA's planned implementation schedule.", "GAO found that VA's decision-making procedures were generally effective as demonstrated by adherence to applicable federal internal control standards for establishing structure, responsibility, and authority, and communicating internally and externally, but that VA did not always ensure key stakeholder involvement. Specifically, the councils included a wide range of stakeholders from various geographic regions. However, according to clinicians from the two initial medical facilities for implementation, VA did not always effectively communicate information to stakeholders, including medical facility clinicians and staff to ensure relevant representation at local workshop meetings. As a result, local workshops did not always include all relevant stakeholders. VA has not indicated how it plans to describe these future sessions and define key terms to ensure key stakeholder participation in local workshops. By ensuring that all relevant stakeholders are included, VA will increase the likelihood that it is obtaining input from a wide range of clinicians and staff who will use the EHR system and will increase the likelihood that when it is implemented, the EHR system will effectively support the delivery of care at VA medical centers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that VA ensure the involvement of all relevant medical facility stakeholders in the EHR system configuration decision process.

VA relies on its  electronic health record (EHR) system\u2014the Veterans Health Information  Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)\u2014to document the delivery  of health care services to veterans. However, in our prior work, we have  found this technically complex system, which has been in operation for  more than 30 years, is costly to maintain and does not fully support VA\u2019s  need to electronically exchange health records with other organizations,  such as the Department of Defense (DOD) and private health care  providers. Moreover, customization of the system by VA medical facilities  has resulted in approximately 130 versions of VistA across the VA health  care system, raising questions about the consistency of the information  collected, among other issues. As such, the department has undertaken a  modernization effort to replace VistA with a commercial EHR system,  developed by Cerner Government Services, Inc., (Cerner)\u2014a  configuration of the same system DOD is implementing.", "Before VA transitions from VistA to the commercial EHR system, the  department has to make design configuration decisions\u2014such as,  determining all the data that need to be incorporated into the EHR  system. Such data configuration decisions would enable the system to  support the work processes that VA clinicians and staff follow in delivering  care. Furthermore, the department has to assess the compatibility of the  EHR system with the processes clinicians and staff use to deliver care.  VA expects to implement the new EHR system initially at two medical  centers in 2020 before implementing it across VA. With the new system,  VA has the opportunity to reduce clinical and procedural variations, both  between VA and DOD, and across the VA health care system\u2019s more  than 1,500 medical facilities. Such variations can cause challenges,  including ensuring information on veterans\u2019 care is documented  consistently.", "You asked us to review the VA\u2019s Electronic Health Record Modernization  (EHRM) program\u2019s process towards making decisions for configuring the  new EHR system. In this report, we focus on VA\u2019s ongoing efforts to  implement its new EHR system at the two medical centers. Specifically,  we  1.  describe how VA made EHR system configuration decisions and  assessed the compatibility of the Cerner EHR system with the work  processes that medical facilities follow,  2.  evaluate the extent to which VA met its schedule for making EHR  system configuration decisions, and  3.  assess the effectiveness of VA\u2019s system configuration decision- making procedures, including the extent to which VA ensured that key  stakeholders are involved.", "To address the first objective, we reviewed available documentation on  the process VA developed to make EHR system configuration decisions,  which included establishing 18 EHR councils responsible for developing  clinical workflows, design decision matrices, and data collection  workbooks. As part of this review, we examined how configuration  decisions may vary between VA medical facilities. We also reviewed  assessments performed by VA\u2019s EHR councils to determine the  compatibility of the commercial EHR system with the work processes VA  medical facilities follow and efforts to address any incompatibilities.", "To address the second objective, we assessed VA\u2019s EHR councils\u2019  progress in meeting the EHRM program\u2019s schedule for making EHR  system configuration decisions.

Specifically, we reviewed data on the  workflows, design decision matrices, and data collection workbooks that  the councils developed. We also compared that information to the EHRM  program\u2019s documented schedule. To assess the reliability of these data,  we reviewed the data to determine its completeness and identified causes  for any deviations from the program\u2019s schedule. In addition, we  interviewed officials responsible for entering and reviewing the data about  their accuracy and reliability. We also compared summary reports to data  extracts on completed workflows and design decision matrices. Based on  these steps, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our reporting objective. Our scope focused on examining  VA\u2019s progress in meeting its schedule for making EHR system  configuration decisions. Therefore, we did not examine Cerner\u2019s progress  towards the actual configuration of the system or implementation of it.", "To address the third objective, we reviewed documentation on VA EHR  council member roles and responsibilities and procedures to identify the  councils\u2019 organization and governance structures for decision-making and  dispute resolution. Since VA is using the same commercial system as  DOD, we also reviewed VA\u2019s procedures for coordinating with DOD on  the implementation of its version of the Cerner commercial EHR system,  known as Military Health System (MHS) Genesis. Furthermore, we  reviewed the procedures that VA used to select EHR council members to  ensure broad and relevant representation. To do this, we obtained a list of  EHR council participants\u2014including chairs, members, and consultants\u2014 and analyzed the data to determine the geographic region participants  represented and the extent to which they represented VA\u2019s central office,  Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), or VA medical facilities  (including the complexity level of these medical facilities). We assessed  the reliability of data on EHR council participants through electronic  testing for missing or duplicate data, and obvious errors, and noted any  limitations found, accordingly. Lastly, we assessed the effectiveness of  VA\u2019s decision-making procedures by comparing these procedures to  applicable standards for internal control in the federal government for  establishing structure, responsibility, and authority, and communicating  internally and externally. We also assessed VA\u2019s procedures against  leading collaboration practices as defined in GAO\u2019s collaboration criteria.", "To further inform our work on all three objectives we observed three VA  national EHR council workshop meetings held during the period of our  review, as well as two corresponding local workshop meetings for the first  two VA medical facilities where VA plans to implement the commercial  EHR system (Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center in Spokane,  Washington, and VA Puget Sound Health Care System\u2014American Lake,  Washington and Seattle, Washington divisions). In addition, we  interviewed cognizant officials from VA, DOD, and Cerner. We also  selected and contacted Veterans Service Organizations to obtain their  perspectives on the EHRM program and VA\u2019s efforts to make system  configuration decisions. We selected organizations that we had identified  in our prior work related to VA\u2019s electronic health record system.

According to EHRM program  officials, as of February 2020, there were no issues escalated from the  Functional Governance Board to the Governance Integration Board  because the council governance structure strived to make decisions at  the lowest level possible. Figure 5 provides an overview of the EHRM  program\u2019s decision-making procedures.", "With respect to collaboration, because VA is using the same system as  DOD, VA has had to coordinate with DOD on some decisions. Although  both departments have procedures for configuring the Cerner EHR  system for their individual needs, VA EHRM program officials noted the  importance of coordinating to design a system that would allow sharing of  information and tasks between VA and DOD.", "According to VA EHRM program officials, for example, VA and DOD  coordination is necessary for workflows pertaining to durable orders for  life-sustaining treatments\u2014medical treatments intended to prolong the life  of a patient who would die soon without the treatment (e.g., artificial  nutrition and hydration, and mechanical ventilation). VA and DOD\u2019s  practices differed on how to address such treatment, and Cerner\u2019s  process did not accommodate VA\u2019s need to maintain durable orders  across patient encounters, so they would not need to be re-written every  time a patient changed care setting or location. VA requested changes  to the Cerner EHR system to allow it to continue to follow its current  process for documenting life-sustaining treatments, but according to DOD  officials, the proposed changes did not align with DOD\u2019s position on such  treatments, specifically resuscitation statuses. After multiple discussions  between the VA and DOD clinicians, the two departments plan to adopt  an interim solution.", "According to VA and DOD officials, VA and DOD\u2019s joint decision-making  body, the Functional Decision Group, has met weekly to address  coordination issues since early 2019. These officials said that the joint  Functional Decision Group determined whether it could make a decision,  or whether additional information was needed and a team should be  established to work on dispute resolution between the departments. VA  EHRM program officials said that the coordination procedures for the joint  Functional Decision Group would be formalized and that the roles and  responsibilities for coordination between VA and DOD would be clearly  defined, in response to a recommendation we made in a previous  report. Specifically, VA and DOD have developed a charter for the joint  Functional Decision Group, which was signed in April 2020.", "According to EHR council participants, VA and DOD had been developing  their coordination procedures as system configuration decisions were  made, and decisions that required input from both departments may not  have been as timely as they could have been. According to EHRM  program officials, the departments ultimately were able to address most  decisions and coordination on remaining decisions was ongoing as of  March 2020."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA\u2019s EHRM Program Included a Wide Range of Participants at National and Local Workshops, but Did Not Always Ensure the Involvement of Key Stakeholders", "paragraphs": ["VA\u2019s EHRM Program Largely Met EHR Council Charter Goals for  Representation  VA generally included a wide range of stakeholders in its 18 EHR  councils.

Specifically, VA data show that about 83 percent  (861 of 1,039) of participants represented level 1 VA medical facilities,  whereas about 3 percent (33 of 1,039) and 7 percent (75 of 1,039)  represented medium (level 2) and low (level 3) complexity VA medical  facilities, respectively. EHRM program officials said that the majority  of participants represented higher-complexity facilities because  participants were drawn from national experts and published authors,  and often performed VA-specific processes. Furthermore, smaller  medical centers had fewer resources so clinicians were more likely to  be needed to continue providing patient care at those facilities and  less likely to be available to serve on councils.", "According to a voluntary questionnaire VA asked council participants  to complete, about 37 percent of the 304 participants who completed  the survey had at least 6 years of experience at VA; 29 percent had at  least 16 years of experience; and, 19 percent had more than 25 years  of experience.", "In addition to participants from the VA, we observed that EHR council  national workshop meetings included participants from outside of the  department\u2014such as clinicians from DOD sites and commercial  health care systems that had already implemented Cerner\u2019s EHR  system. These participants provided support for discussions and  insight into industry best practices.", "While the EHR councils included a wide range of participants, in  September and October 2019, council participants from both of the initial  operating capability sites raised concerns that the councils did not include  adequate representation from specialty areas at national workshop  meetings. Specifically, these officials said that an insufficient number of  specialty physicians, including pulmonologists and gastroenterologists,  were included. In addition, VA\u2019s summary from the last workshop,  national workshop 8, observed that additional subject matter experts  representing medical specialties should be included in the EHR system  configuration decision process to enhance collaboration and decision- making.", "EHRM program officials, including the Chief Medical Officer and  Ambulatory Council chairs, said they had not included certain specialists  and scheduled workshops on specialty areas, such as pulmonology and  gastroenterology as they decided to focus first on more foundational  decisions, such as those for primary care. Starting in November 2019,  following the completion of the eight national workshops, VA EHR  councils continued to meet, as necessary, to complete capability set 1  and 2 configuration decisions and had begun to include clinicians from  specialty areas in these meetings. VA plans to continue these meetings  through September 2020. VA\u2019s approach of including clinicians from  specialty areas in ongoing configuration decision meetings is generally  consistent with our leading collaboration practice that agencies should  ensure that all relevant participants be included in any collaborative effort  they undertake.", "By including relevant participants, the program increases the likelihood  that it has considered input from participants with unique knowledge,  skills, and abilities. Further, including relevant participants increases the  likelihood that when implemented, the EHR system will be properly  configured to meet the needs of clinicians, and effectively support their  efforts to deliver care.", "VA\u2019s EHRM Program Did Not Always Include Key Stakeholders at Its  Local Workshops  Local workshops at the Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center and VA  Puget Sound Health Care System did not always include representation  from relevant stakeholders, including facility clinicians and staff.  Specifically, multiple participants in the local workshop meetings,  including clinicians and department leads, at these facilities said that VA\u2019s  EHRM program did not always effectively communicate information about  local workshop meetings to facility clinicians and staff to facilitate the  designation of staff to participate and ensure relevant representation at  local workshops. Local workshop participants stated that they did not  always know which local workshop meetings they needed to attend,  because they did not receive adequate information about the session  topics.", "This is inconsistent with key collaboration practices identified in our prior  work to ensure that relevant participants be included in any collaborative  effort and that participating entities have agreed on common  terminology. Furthermore, standards for internal control in the federal  government call for effective communication and information sharing.", "Local workshop participants, including clinicians and department leads  from medical facilities said that differences in the use of terminology  between VA and Cerner sometimes made it challenging to identify the  clinicians and staff that should attend local workshop meetings. For  example, some officials reported that they did not believe that a meeting  on \u201ccharge services\u201d would be relevant to their work given that VA does  not typically bill veterans for services. However, they later learned that the  meeting actually covered topics beyond billing, such as capturing  workload data that was relevant to their work.", "Because Cerner and VA did not always effectively communicate  regarding workshop content for local workshops, local workshops did not  always include all relevant stakeholders. As previously stated, VA plans  to hold local workshops in advance of the Cerner EHR system  implementation at future VA medical facilities. However, VA has not  indicated how it will improve the ways in which it describes the topics of  these workshops, including providing sufficient detail and defining key  terms.
