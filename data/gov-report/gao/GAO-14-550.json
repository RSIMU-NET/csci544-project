This study, along with other associated studies and analyses, initially led the Air Force to pursue leasing the plant to a private-sector entity or public utility. When no lease proposals were submitted, the Air Force pursued the option to close the plant, finding that the estimated costs of closing it were significantly less than the estimated costs of continuing to operate and maintain it. GAO found that the Air Force generally followed its own guidance for preparing cost estimates and analyses of alternatives. However, in the plant-closure option considered in the feasibility study, some costs\u2014such as labor costs for operating and maintaining the new heat system\u2014were not fully developed. While it is unlikely that adding this information would have materially affected the final outcome, more fully developing those costs would have provided decision makers with more complete information and a better understanding when considering the proposed options. In addition to economic factors, several noneconomic goals significantly influenced the Air Force's decision concerning the power plant, including the goals of no longer operating and maintaining a power plant, reducing energy costs, and ensuring reliable power for current and future missions.", "The Air Force considered and evaluated several options for the plant's future before selecting the option to close the plant after first connecting to the local power grid and building a separate heat system.

Still other options were considered but were not fully evaluated because they did not generate as much savings or the Air Force did not consider them to be economically feasible. For example, the Air Force looked in detail at options for leasing the plant but did not fully assess the costs of more incremental options, such as retaining ownership of the plant but downscaling its operations.

The ratio  for this project was significantly greater than the program requirement  of 1.25. Also, the payback period was within the requirement of 10  years or fewer.", "Although the costs of power and diesel fuel are shown to be greater than the costs of  coal in this projection, these costs are less than the anticipated savings in labor and  capital costs.", "Revised Cost Estimate. In the revised DD Form 1391, annual cost  savings from reduced operation and maintenance expenditures were  estimated to result in a net first-year savings of $2.68 million. The  same capital costs would be avoided. The savings-to-investment ratio  was now 3.30 and the payback period was now about 6.62 years.  This was a marked drop from the earlier 8.42 savings-to-investment  ratio but was still greater than the 1.25 threshold. Additionally, the  payback period was well within the requirement of 10 years or less.", "We talked to Air Force officials about the reasons for the decrease in  expected savings for the grid tie-in and heat plant project in the second  estimate. These officials told us that the original DD Form 1391 was  based on information that had been collected from the raw steam and  electrical output of the plant that is supplied to the composite area. They  said that, because the energy is measured at the production point, much  of the wasted energy in the generation process was captured in the  operation and maintenance costs. According to the officials, the revised  DD Form 1391 has more refined costs because an engineering heat  analysis that modeled the heat consumption of the composite area  buildings was performed in support of the design of the new heat plant.  The officials said that the modeled data provided a more accurate picture  based on seasonal and peak load conditions and enabled the Air Force to  identify more accurate maintenance costs compared to those in the  feasibility study.", "Another change was in the estimated costs to purchase power from  Golden Valley Electric Association. The feasibility study estimated that  Clear Air Force Station could purchase electricity at a price of 11.5 cents  per kilowatt hour. As of April 2013, this price was estimated to be  approximately 13.23 cents per kilowatt hour under the GS-3 industrial  rate. Representatives from the union that represents plant personnel had  questioned the accuracy of the Golden Valley Electric Association rate  used by the Air Force, but Air Force officials told us that the Air Force had  confirmed with Golden Valley Electric Association that it would receive the  industrial rate, as opposed to the GS-2 commercial rate of almost 16  cents per kilowatt hour. The officials told us that this was because the Air  Force, not the public utility, would be responsible for maintenance of the  substation and switchgear that will be located on the installation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "For Options Considered in the Feasibility Study, Some Plant-Closure Costs Were Not Fully Developed, but Adding This Information Would Not Have Materially Affected the Outcome", "paragraphs": ["In reviewing the cost estimates for the five options for the plant, we found  there were some items and associated costs that were not fully  developed in the feasibility study but were later more fully developed as  the Air Force took steps to carry out its plans.

However, although the feasibility study  presented the option to close the plant as the alternative the Air Force  would pursue if it did not receive any proposals for an enhanced-use  lease, the study did not fully document all of the expected costs for the  plant-closure option. While adding this information is unlikely to have  materially affected the Air Force\u2019s decision to close the plant, fully  developing those costs in the feasibility study would have provided  decision makers with more complete information and a better  understanding of the proposed actions. Although some cost details were  not available at the time of the feasibility study, having a better description  of the sources of costs and what actions the Air Force would need to take  to provide a heat system for the composite area would have given  decision makers a fuller picture of what the Air Force would need to buy  or consider in assessing the costs of this option. In particular, it would  have been useful to present an estimate of other associated costs, such  as the labor or additional contract costs, over the same period.

The information in the study did not specify the types of  systems that the Air Force anticipated using, nor did it provide information  on the source of the $13 million estimated cost. Further, there are likely to  be other costs associated with the heat system, such as diesel storage  tanks, possible modifications to the existing buildings to accept a different  method of receiving heat, and a means of protecting existing water and  sewage pipes that are currently kept warm by their proximity to the steam  lines; these other costs were not presented in the study. Additionally,  boilers have a shorter life span than a power plant. The Air Force\u2019s  revised building life-cycle cost estimate included a life cycle of  approximately 20 years, which is OSD\u2019s estimated economic life cycle for  boilers. As a result, the Air Force would likely have to replace the boilers  at least twice during the 50-year period covered by the plant-closure  option. The Air Force\u2019s estimated cost for the boilers in 2015 was $15  million.

The  plant-closure option accounts for savings in labor costs, since the existing  plant personnel would no longer be needed once the plant is  decommissioned. While these costs would no longer be associated with  operating and maintaining the plant, there would likely be some personnel  costs incurred for this option. The plant currently provides both power and  heat to the composite area, and connecting to the grid and purchasing  electricity from Golden Valley Electric Association addresses only the  provision of power. As described above, the Air Force will be installing  heat systems for the composite area, which will require personnel to  operate and maintain them. Air Force officials told us that operating the  heat boilers could require two to eight personnel, depending on the  number, type, and size of the heat system that is developed.

For this reason,  the 21st Space Wing did not formally program any requirements prior to  2008 that would have led them to seek funding for such projects. In  August 2009, the Air Force Real Property Agency prepared a briefing that  referenced a 2008 concept opportunity study that identified the plant as  underutilized and identified opportunities and challenges associated with  an enhanced-use lease for the plant. For example, the briefing identified  potential environmental review as a challenge that might undermine the  value of the plant for a potential lessee. The same briefing discussed the  establishment of a working group to conduct an opportunity analysis for  the plant. In the same month, officials from Air Force Space Command,  the 21st Civil Engineering Squadron, the Air Force Real Property Agency,  and the Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency met to discuss  opportunities for utilities privatization or an enhanced-use lease of the  plant. The meeting attendees discussed potential interest from Golden  Valley Electric Association to acquire the plant\u2019s excess energy and  agreed to conduct a prefeasibility study to compare available options in  order to determine the best approach for the power situation at Clear Air  Force Station. The Air Force then prepared a draft concept opportunity  study in June 2010, as a precursor to the feasibility study. The concept  opportunity study was a qualitative study that identified strengths,  weaknesses, opportunities, and threats for four options as they pertained  to energy reliability; environmental requirements; potential for revenues,  savings, or energy efficiency for the Air Force; and reductions in non- mission-critical resources and the time involved in plant functions. Three  of the options were also studied in the feasibility study, which provided a  quantitative comparison of the savings generated for the Air Force by  each of the five options when compared to the status quo. Both studies  considered the options for the enhanced-use lease, utilities privatization,  and selling excess power. The possibility of closing the plant was first  raised in the concept opportunity study and was studied further in the  feasibility study.", "Air Force officials said that economic analyses drove the decision they  made regarding the power plant and determined that some options were  not economical because they did not generate as much savings for the  Air Force. The concept opportunity study stated that the Air Force  continuing to own and operate the plant would not be advantageous  because the plant would continue to produce energy in excess of  requirements, using old equipment. These officials said the feasibility  study indicated that it would be cost-prohibitive to update the existing  plant. The feasibility study estimated the costs for updating the existing  plant in the near term as about $21 million. Those costs include items  such as installing a new combustion-control system and replacing a boiler  tube. Additionally, plant employees told us that, due to the age of the  plant, replacement parts for plant equipment and controls have become  difficult to find. The feasibility study found that options for the Air Force to  operate a smaller replacement plant, with or without selling excess power  from this smaller plant, would not generate as much savings for the Air  Force as certain other options. The feasibility study also found that the  utilities privatization option would generate slightly greater savings than  an enhanced-use lease and that the option to close the plant would  generate the most savings for the Air Force compared to the status quo.The feasibility study concluded that the Air Force should pursue the  enhanced-use lease in order to obtain realistic valuations of the plant  from potential lessees, or, if the lease project were unsuccessful, close  the plant. Table 2 provides a summary of several of the options that the  Air Force considered. The details of the options considered in either the  concept opportunity study or the feasibility study are discussed below.  1.  Replace the current plant with a plant sized at 8 megawatts: This  option was not considered in the concept opportunity study but was  included in the feasibility study. Under this scenario, the current plant  would be replaced over a 5-year period with a plant sized for the  energy demand at the installation at 8 megawatts. This option was  shown to generate some savings compared to the status quo in the  feasibility study, but not to generate as much savings as the other  options. 2.  Connect to the power grid and sell excess power: In both the  concept opportunity study and the feasibility study, the Air Force  considered connecting a plant on the installation to the local power  grid in order to sell the excess power it would generate. The concept  opportunity study considered the option for the existing plant to  produce power in excess of mission requirements and sell the excess  power through the grid connection. The study concluded that, in order  for power sales to be economical, the plant would likely need to  operate at its full 22.5-megawatt capacity. Under this scenario in the  feasibility study, the Air Force would replace the existing plant with a  plant sized at 8 megawatts and sell any excess power to a utility or  another military base in Alaska. The feasibility study found that this  option generated lower savings than other options and that revenues  generated from the smaller plant would not cover the cost of the  connection to the grid, because there would not be as much power in  excess of the installation\u2019s needs available for sale. Furthermore,  there were some complications associated with operating the plant at  its full 22.5-megawatt capacity:", "As previously stated, the Air Force currently does not operate the  plant at full capacity in order to avoid having it classified as a  major source for hazardous air pollutants. According to Air Force  officials, increasing power production at the current plant would  also require them to install new combustion and emission  monitoring controls and to consider changes to the air quality  control operating permit. Officials additionally said that an  environmental analysis associated with obtaining a new permit  would also be required, and that permit would take 2 to 3 years to  obtain.", "Air Force officials indicated that the Air Force would not be able to  sell power to private entities and that selling power to a public  utility or other government entities was not economically viable.They also said that, if the Air Force sold power to other  government entities, such as Army bases in Alaska, it would still  incur the costs of capital improvements to the plant but would not  be reimbursed for that investment. In addition, they said that they  had considered selling excess power to the Army but determined  that this option would not have been economical for the Army  because the Army could buy any additional power it might need at  a cheaper rate from the local public utility.  3.  Lease the plant to a private entity or public utility through an  enhanced-use lease: This option was considered in both the concept  opportunity study and the feasibility study. Under this scenario in the  concept opportunity study, the Air Force would negotiate with the  lessee to purchase power and steam. The concept opportunity study  recommended moving forward with a quantitative evaluation, or  business-case analysis, of the enhanced-use lease option. Under this  scenario in the feasibility study, the Air Force would pay for the  connection from the existing plant to the grid and would negotiate a  power and steam purchase agreement with the lessee. Additionally,  the lessee would sell power to the market over the grid. The feasibility  study makes the assumption that the lessee would replace the plant  at a capacity of 22.5 megawatts and that the Air Force would  reimburse the lessee for capital upgrades to the plant, while the  revenue that the lessee generated through power sales would be  deducted from the amount the Air Force would pay the lessee for the  capital upgrades. The feasibility study found the enhanced-use lease  to be the option that generated the third greatest savings among the  options that were evaluated, close to the savings generated for one of  the scenarios for utilities privatization. In February 2011, officials from  the Air Force Real Property Agency briefed the Privatization Executive  Steering Group and the Basing Requirement Review Panel, both of  which concurred with the recommendation to pursue an enhanced- use lease.  4.  Privatize the plant: This option was also considered in both the  concept opportunity study and the feasibility study. Under this option  in the concept opportunity study, the Air Force would sell the existing  plant to a third party and negotiate a power and steam purchase  agreement with the new owner. The Air Force evaluated two  scenarios under this option in the feasibility study. Under both  scenarios, the Air Force would pay for the connection from the plant to  the grid, and the new owner would replace the plant up front (by 2020)  at a capacity of 22.5 megawatts. As in the enhanced-use lease option,  the Air Force would reimburse the new owner for plant upgrades, and  the new owner would sell power to the Air Force and to the market  over the grid. Revenue generated by the plant owner would be  deducted from the amount the Air Force would reimburse the new  owner for capital upgrades. In one scenario, the Air Force would pay  its share of the owner\u2019s capital investment; in the second scenario, the  Air Force would compensate the owner for all of the capital  investments. While the first scenario would generate some savings to  the Air Force, the second scenario would generate costs rather than  savings.", "The concept opportunity study identified several advantages that an  enhanced-use lease would have over utilities privatization. For  example, under the enhanced-use lease, the Air Force would have  more flexibility to revert the equipment and operations back to Air  Force control and, if desired, to purchase power through a grid  interconnection in the future. According to this study, an enhanced- use lease could also better accommodate changes in mission  requirements, energy pricing, and utility and environmental  regulations. The feasibility study identified similar issues for  consideration for both the enhanced-use lease and utilities  privatization options, including that for either option to be attractive to  an outside entity, a major upgrade of equipment would likely be  required to enable the lessee or new owner to maximize the amount  of excess power it could sell on the grid.  5.  Close the plant: The concept opportunity study raised the possibility  of connecting to the local power grid as the installation\u2019s sole source  of power, with backup diesel generators for power, and briefly  identified some issues to take into account were the Air Force to  consider this option. Under this option in the feasibility study, the Air  Force would build the connection to the grid, install power and steam  backup systems, purchase power from Golden Valley Electric  Association, and shut down the plant. The costs associated with this  option include approximately $22 million (in 2010 dollars) to  decommission the existing plant. The option to close the plant  generated the most savings for the Air Force compared to the other  options considered in the feasibility study."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Air Force Did Not Fully Evaluate Some Options", "paragraphs": ["Air Force officials said that other options were discussed but were not  formally evaluated and documented in studies. For example, officials told  us that they considered connecting to the local grid and then running the  plant seasonally or running the plant to failure, that is, performing  maintenance as needed but not making any major upgrades to extend the  life of the plant. Some plant employees said they believed that the most  efficient way to run the plant would be to run one boiler and one turbine  generator instead of two and investing in the plant to continue its  operation, for example by upgrading its combustion controls. In the  scenario envisioned by plant employees, the plant would provide primary  power and heat to the installation. But the installation could still establish  a connection to the local grid for sale of electricity and install a separate  heat system as backup power and heat for nonradar areas.employees believed that operating the plant would be less expensive  under this scenario. Air Force officials said that they had considered  running only one boiler and one turbine generator and had run the plant  this way in the summer of 2012 as part of a study on ways to cut utility  costs. They said that this option would reduce the costs of coal but would  still require the Air Force to invest in extensive capital improvements to  the plant and be responsible for the environmental liabilities of operating  the plant. The Air Force did not fully assess the costs of this option,  including its effects on labor and maintenance costs, for these reasons.", "Plant  Since the Air Force began considering alternatives to its current operation  of the power plant, it has taken steps to improve the reliability of its  energy supplies. In particular, the availability of backup power generation  and heat for the radar and related facilities and for the composite area  means that the only service provided by the existing power plant that  does not have an independent backup supply is the heating for the  composite area. In the feasibility study, the Air Force did not formally  evaluate the feasibility or cost of installing boilers to provide heat to the  composite area as a backup to the existing plant because, as stated  earlier, this study focused on those options that the Air Force considered  to be economically feasible. Rather, boilers to provide heat for the  composite area were considered only under the option to close the plant.  However, as part of developing the enhanced-use lease project, the Air  Force has subsequently taken steps to acquire a backup heat system,  which is discussed later in this report. Table 2 provides a summary of  several of the options that the Air Force considered."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Air Force Pursued an Enhanced-Use Lease but Did Not Receive Proposals", "paragraphs": ["Although the results of the feasibility study showed that closing the plant  would generate greater cost savings for the Air Force than an enhanced- use lease, the study recommended that the Air Force first pursue the  enhanced-use lease. The study stated that the cost for a lessee to  implement capital investments in the plant could possibly be lower than  the estimates provided in the study and that the lessee might be able to  capture revenue and increase the market value of the plant. Air Force  officials said the Air Force pursued the enhanced-use lease in order to  leverage industry knowledge and resources and seek creative solutions  for keeping the plant open. One Air Force official said that proposals for  the enhanced-use lease could have varied by offeror and led the Air  Force in different directions than what was envisioned for the enhanced- use lease in the feasibility study. Additionally, negotiations with the  highest-ranked offeror would have determined the final terms and  conditions of the enhanced-use lease.", "As noted earlier, the Air Force released a statement of need in August  2012 to notify interested parties of the enhanced-use lease opportunity,  and it held an Industry Day. The companies and public utility that  participated in the Industry Day had an opportunity to ask questions, and  officials from two of the entities we spoke with said that they had  requested and been provided a separate tour of the plant. In October  2012, the Air Force released its final request for qualifications, in which it  indicated that the lease would begin after the Air Force completed the  project to provide a new heat plant and connect the installation to the  power grid. Additionally, the document stated that the Air Force did not  plan to incur additional expenses to maintain the plant after the  completion of this project.", "Between the conclusion of the feasibility study in 2010 and the release of  the statement of need in 2012, the Air Force\u2019s plans for the enhanced-use  lease changed due to several factors:", "At the conclusion of the feasibility study and as the Air Force began to  develop the enhanced-use lease option, the Air Force intended to  connect the plant\u2019s electrical distribution system to the power grid and  enter into an agreement with a lessee to obtain both power and steam  for heat. Officials said that connecting the plant to the power grid  would make the plant economically viable to the lessee, which might  then be able to sell electricity to other customers through the power  grid. The Air Force also intended to discuss recouping the cost of the  connection from the lessee through the lease negotiation process.", "When the enhanced-use lease project was approved within the Air  Force and sent to OSD for review, OSD determined that the project  did not meet the conditions for an enhanced-use lease because a  heat plant was not considered and the plant would still be needed for  \u201cpublic use\u201d until the connection to the power grid was made. As a  result of this review, the Air Force expanded the scope of its project to  include a heating system and a backup generator. Additionally, the  transmission line would now be connected to a substation on the  installation rather than to the power plant\u2019s electrical distribution  system, as originally considered in the feasibility study. Officials said  that this change resulted in a delay of about a year for the enhanced- use lease solicitation process to begin.", "The Air Force did not receive any responses to its request for  qualifications, and officials said the Air Force determined that receiving no  bids on the enhanced-use lease demonstrated that keeping the plant  running did not make business sense. We spoke with representatives  from two companies and a public utility that had attended Industry Day  and with Air Force officials about possible reasons for this lack of industry  interest in pursuing the enhanced-use lease. Among the things they cited  were the following:", "Environmental standards: Air Force officials and a representative of  the public utility we spoke with cited the costs of upgrading the power  plant to meet environmental standards as a deterrent. One company\u2019s  representative said that because the Air Force\u2019s energy demand at  Clear Air Force Station is only a small percentage of the load capacity  of the plant, the lessee would likely have to sell excess power to other  customers. However, as discussed previously, if the plant operated at  increased capacity, it would potentially be reclassified as a major  source for hazardous air pollutants, which might necessitate additional  controls and monitoring requirements. The representative for the  public utility additionally cited concern with the level at which the plant  would be allowed to produce output if a new permit could not be  obtained and the length of time associated with obtaining a new  permit. A representative from another company also cited the lengthy  time associated with obtaining a new permit as a concern. The Air  Force believed that a new permit would take 2 to 3 years to obtain.", "Need for upgrades: Air Force officials and company representatives  said that the plant required major upgrades. A representative from  one company we spoke with said that the Air Force would have  required the lessee to upgrade the plant to meet government  standards but that those standards were unclear in the information  that the Air Force provided to potential lessees. A representative from  the public utility said that in order for the plant to meet environmental  standards, it would need to upgrade the central plant control system.  The utility conducted its own assessment of needed plant upgrades  and found that additional repairs may be needed.", "Uncertainty of the plant\u2019s profitability: A representative from the  public utility told us that the utility conducted its own assessment of  the plant and found that even if the plant could be run at its full  capacity after obtaining the necessary environmental permits,  production would be more costly than that utility\u2019s other power-  production alternatives. The utility\u2019s assessment also found the  estimated cost per megawatt hour would be higher than the utility had  expected.", "Transformer with greater transmission capacity needed: One  company\u2019s representative with whom we spoke also cited the  transformer\u2019s transmission capacity as a potential issue that would  affect the company\u2019s ability to sell excess power. The transformer the  Air Force planned to buy and place on the installation to receive  power from Golden Valley Electric Association did not have the  capability to increase the transmission voltage in order to deliver  electricity back to the power grid for sale to outside customers.  Additionally, since the transmission line as described in the request  for qualifications for the enhanced-use lease would not be connected  to the power plant, an electrical connection would need to be made  between the power plant and the substation on the installation with a  transformer capable of increasing the voltage. Air Force officials  said that the Air Force did not want to incur the additional cost of  purchasing a transformer that could deliver electricity back to the grid,  because a larger capacity transformer would potentially not add value  for the Air Force.", "Competition regarding rates: One Air Force official and a  representative from a company we spoke with said that Golden Valley  Electric Association, the local utility, was perceived to have  advantages over other companies in negotiating the enhanced-use  lease, because the Air Force was already planning to build the  transmission line connecting the installation to the power grid  operated by Golden Valley Electric Association. Air Force officials said  they did not want to commit during Industry Day to buying electricity or  steam for heat from any potential lessee but instead told participants  to include a power sale offer in their proposals. One company\u2019s  representative said that he believed the Air Force would opt to buy  electricity at the least-cost rate by comparing the rate offered by  Golden Valley Electric Association to the rate offered by the lessee.  Therefore, any lessee other than Golden Valley Electric Association  would have had to compete with Golden Valley Electric Association\u2019s  rate. This representative also believed that the Air Force would obtain  heat from the lessee, because that would be less expensive than  potentially using oil-fired generators to heat the composite area. Air  Force officials provided a similar assessment.", "Disposal of coal ash: One company\u2019s representative said that the  treatment of the ash produced from the burning of coal was a  concern. Due to an Air Force decision not to allow the potential lessee  to use the landfill located on the installation that is primarily used for  the disposal of the coal ash produced from burning coal, the lessee  would have to find a solution offsite. The representative said that,  based on the company\u2019s operation of other coal plants, finding a  solution to the disposal of coal ash is a difficult issue for the company.  Air Force officials said that the Air Force\u2019s decision was based on  concerns about long-term risks and environmental concerns for the  Air Force if it were to let the potential lessee use the landfill.", "Available alternatives to Clear Air Force Station plant: Air Force  officials said that Golden Valley Electric Association had expressed  interest in the plant in the past. However, in the interim the utility had  proceeded to take the steps necessary to reopen a dormant power  plant that would have more than twice the capacity of the Clear Air  Force Station plant. The Golden Valley Electric Association  representative we spoke with said that the company will invest heavily  in capital improvements at that plant and did not know if the risk with  the Clear Air Force Station plant would be worthwhile."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Design of Heat Systems Evolved over Time", "paragraphs": ["In the feasibility study, the option to close the plant was the only option  that included installing a new heat system. Under the other options  considered in the feasibility study, the Air Force made the assumption  that it would be able to obtain heat from a replacement plant or from the  lessee or new owner. As discussed above, in response to OSD\u2019s review  of the enhanced-use lease, the Air Force revised its plans to include  construction of a new heat system for the installation. As the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers conducted studies to further refine the design of the  heat system, various technical issues emerged, leading to changes in the  design.", "The Air Force first considered building a central heat system for the  installation. Officials said that if the enhanced-use lease had succeeded,  the Air Force would have negotiated with the lessee to purchase the  steam from the plant and use it as the primary source of heat, using the  new central heat system only in circumstances where it could not obtain  heat from the lessee. The Air Force asked the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers to begin designing a heat system in April 2012, before it  released its request for qualifications for the enhanced-use lease. Around  this time, the Air Force asked the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to  conduct a study to evaluate the relative advantages of a central versus a  decentralized heat system.that a decentralized heat system would cost less than a centralized heat  system. Air Force officials said that the concern was about what type of  fuel would be used for the heat system. The design of the heat system  was put on hold for a month, in September 2012, while Air Force officials  reviewed the completed study and finalized consensus on the preferred  heating system. Some Air Force officials thought that whether the  enhanced-use lease succeeded would affect the design of the heat  system. Air Force officials decided to restart the design with a  decentralized heat system in October 2012, prior to the December 2012  due date for the responses to the request for qualifications for the  enhanced-use lease. Air Force officials said that they concluded from the  August study that a decentralized heat plant would be preferable whether  or not the enhanced-use lease succeeded. Air Force and Army officials  told us that, as the Army conducted further studies on the decentralized  heat system, several technical issues emerged with the design, including  concerns regarding how to keep the water pipelines from freezing.  Officials said that these technical issues, which were at times associated  with high costs, affected the direction of the design for the heat system. In  April 2013, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers studied the costs of using  three to four low-pressure steam heat plants, which would resolve the  technical complication that had emerged. However, this revised design  raised new concerns, such as the logistics of refueling the heat plants  each day using small vehicles and the proximity of the heat plants to the  buildings where personnel are located. As of February 2014, the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers had not completed the design of the heat  system, but the currently preferred design is two medium-sized buildings,  each containing three steam boilers. The third boiler in each building  would serve as backup for the other two. Additionally, if one of the  building\u2019s boilers failed, Air Force officials said that the other building\u2019s  boilers would be able to supply enough heat for the entire composite  area. Officials said that using this configuration would address the  concerns raised by previous designs of the heat system, including fueling  logistics and proximity to personnel."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of our restricted report, the Air Force  concurred with our observations.
