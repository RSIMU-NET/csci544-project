To address these issues, GAO interviewed EOIR officials; reviewed information on caseload trends, caseload management, and court evaluations; and analyzed caseload data, case completion goal data, and OCIJ court evaluation reports."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal years 2000 to 2005, despite an increase in the number of immigration judges, the number of new cases filed in immigration courts outpaced cases completed. During this period, while the number of on-board judges increased about 3 percent, the courts' caseload climbed about 39 percent from about 381,000 cases to about 531,000 cases. The number of completed cases increased about 37 percent while newly filed cases grew about 44 percent. EOIR attributes this growth in part to enhanced border enforcement activities. The courts reduced the number of proceedings awaiting adjudication for more than 4 years, but did not meet their goal to complete all proceedings more than 3 years old by December 31, 2005. OCIJ relies primarily on an automated system to assign cases to immigration judges within a court. To balance the judges' caseload, OCIJ considers the number of newly filed cases and cases awaiting adjudication from prior years, historical data, and the type and complexity of cases. To manage its growing caseload, OCIJ, among other means, details judges from their assigned court to a court in need of assistance and uses available technology such as video conferencing. According to OCIJ, if it recognizes a pattern of sustained need, it recommends that EOIR establish a court in a new location. EOIR evaluates the performance of the immigration courts based on the immigration courts' success in meeting case completion goals. GAO's review of EOIR's quarterly reports on these goals identified a recurring inconsistency between reports as well as other inconsistencies. EOIR explained that these inconsistencies were due to a variety of factors, including the exemption of different categories of cases from the goals in different quarters, delays in data entry, and programming errors in the calculation of the data. Because EOIR has changed its criteria for cases covered by these goals and only maintained the queries for its current reporting process, GAO could not replicate past case completion reports to determine their accuracy. The inconsistencies indicate that EOIR should maintain appropriate documentation to demonstrate the reports' accuracy."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The former U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) estimated  that about 7 million unauthorized immigrants resided in the United States  as of January 2000 and a recent study estimated that the unauthorized  immigrant population was about 11.5 to 12 million in 2006. These totals  include those who entered the United States illegally and those who  entered legally but overstayed their authorized period of stay. Identifying  this increased number of unauthorized immigrants and adjudicating their  cases has placed enormous demands on federal agencies responsible for  enforcing and administering immigration laws. This demand continues to  grow as an estimated 700,000 to 850,000 immigrants enter illegally or  overstay their authorized period in this country each year.", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for identifying  and removing unauthorized immigrants who are in the United States in  violation of immigration laws.

In this report, we address the  following questions:  1.  In recent years, what has been the trend in immigration courts\u2019  caseload?  2.  How does OCIJ assign and manage immigration court caseload?  3.  How does EOIR/OCIJ evaluate the immigration courts\u2019 performance?", "To address these objectives, we met with officials from DOJ\u2019s EOIR  headquarters to obtain information and documentation on caseload  trends, caseload management, and evaluation of immigration courts. To  gain a better understanding of the operations and management of  immigration courts, we also visited four immigration courts\u2014Arlington in  Arlington, Virginia; Newark in Newark, New Jersey; and two courts in New  York City, New York. We selected these four courts to include courts  varying in size, based on the number of immigration judges. At these  locations, we observed court proceedings and met with immigration  judges, court administrators, and attorneys that litigate cases before the  immigration courts\u2014attorneys from the Office of Chief Counsel of DHS\u2019s  Immigration and Customs Enforcement and private bar attorneys. We also  interviewed representatives of the National Association of Immigration  Judges, the American Immigration Lawyers Association, and the American  Bar Association, Commission on Immigration. For the first objective, we  obtained and analyzed caseload data contained in EOIR\u2019s case  management system. To assess the reliability of those data needed to  answer this objective, we (1) performed electronic testing for obvious  errors in accuracy and completeness, (2) reviewed related documentation  about the data and the systems that produced them, including a  contractor\u2019s report on data verification of the case management system,  and (3) interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about the data. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  report. For the second objective, we obtained and reviewed policies,  procedures, and other documents about caseload management, as well as  staffing data for fiscal years 2000 through 2005. For the third objective, we  obtained and reviewed policies, procedures, and other documents about  the evaluation of immigration courts\u2019 performance. We also obtained and  analyzed EOIR\u2019s case completion goal reports for fiscal years 2001 through  2005 (as discussed later in this report, our review raised questions about  these reports) and reviewed the relevant internal control standards for  such reports. We also reviewed OCIJ\u2019s reports for court evaluations  conducted in fiscal years 2000 and 2004 and EOIR\u2019s data on complaints  against immigration judges for fiscal years 2001 through 2005.", "We conducted our work from March 2005 through August 2006 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

EOIR was established on January 9, 1983, as a result of an internal DOJ  reorganization. This reorganization combined the BIA with the  immigration judge function previously performed by the former INS. The  Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer was added in 1987. A  Director who reports directly to the Deputy Attorney General heads EOIR.", "EOIR\u2019s mission is to provide for the fair, expeditious, and uniform  interpretation and application of immigration law. In support of this  mission, one of EOIR\u2019s strategic goals is to adjudicate all cases in a timely  manner while assuring due process and fair treatment for all parties.  According to its strategic plan for fiscal years 2005 through 2010, EOIR  plans to accomplish this goal by, among other things, (1) eliminating case  backlog by the end of fiscal year 2008, (2) implementing improved  caseload management practices, and (3) adjudicating cases within  specified time frames.", "As of October 1, 2005, EOIR had 1,182 authorized full-time permanent  positions. OCIJ was the largest of the three primary components with 789  positions. The majority of these 789 positions (745) were in the  immigration courts located throughout the nation. Of these 745 positions,  225 were immigration judges. The remaining court staff included 45  court/deputy court administrators, 367 assistants/clerks, and 108 court  interpreters.", "OCIJ provides overall program direction, articulates policies and  procedures, and establishes priorities for the immigration courts. OCIJ is  headed by a Chief Immigration Judge who carries out these  responsibilities with the assistance and support of two Deputy Chief  Immigration Judges and nine Assistant Chief Immigration Judges (ACIJ).  The ACIJs serve as the principal liaison between OCIJ headquarters and  the immigration courts and have supervisory authority over the  immigration judges, the court administrators, and judicial law clerks. At  the court level, court administrators manage the daily court operations as  well as the administrative staff. Currently there are 53 immigration courts  including 17 courts that are co-located with a detention center,  correctional facility, or service processing center and a court located at  EOIR headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia, and numerous other hearing  locations. The sizes of the immigration courts vary. In fiscal year 2005,  the smallest of the 53 immigration courts (Fishkill in New York) consisted  of 2 authorized legal assistants. In contrast, the largest court (New York  City in New York) consisted of the following authorized staff:   27 immigration judges, 1 court administrator, 1 deputy court administrator,  46 assistants/clerks, and 8 court interpreters.", "The immigration judges are responsible for hearing all cases that come  before them, and act independently in deciding the cases. They hear a  wide range of immigration related cases that consist primarily of removal  proceedings conducted to determine whether certain immigrants are  subject to removal from the country. If DHS alleges a violation of  immigration law(s) that is subject to adjudication by the immigration  courts, it serves the immigrant with a charging document, ordering the  individual to appear before an immigration judge. The charging document  is also filed with the immigration court having jurisdiction over the  immigrant, and advises the immigrant of, among other things, the nature  of the proceeding; the alleged act(s) that violated the law; the right to an  attorney at no expense to the government; and the consequences of failing  to appear at scheduled hearings. Removal proceedings generally require  an immigration judge to make: (1) a determination of the immigrant\u2019s  removability from the United States and (2), thereafter, if the immigrant  applies, a decision whether the immigrant is eligible for a form(s) of relief  from removal such as asylum, adjustment of status, cancellation of  removal, or other remedies, or voluntary departure, which is an alternative  to removal. Once an immigration judge orders the removal of an  immigrant, DHS is responsible for carrying out the removal.", "As shown in figure 1, immigration court removal proceedings generally  involve an initial master calendar hearing and, subsequently, an individual  merits hearing. During the master calendar hearing, the immigration judge  is to ensure that the immigrant understands the immigration violation  charges and provide the immigrant information on available free of charge  or low-cost legal representation in the area. During the individual merits  hearing, the merits of the case are presented before the immigration judge  by the immigrant, or the immigrant\u2019s legal representative, and the DHS  attorney who is prosecuting the case. DHS must prove that an immigrant is  in the United States unlawfully and should be removed. In most cases, the  immigration judge issues an oral decision at the conclusion of the  individual merits hearing. The immigration judge may order the alien  removed or may grant relief. If the immigration judge decides that  removability has not been established by DHS, he or she may terminate  the proceedings. Once a case is completed, if the immigrant or DHS  disagrees with the immigration judge\u2019s decision, either party or both  parties may appeal the decision to the BIA. If the BIA ruling is adverse to  the immigrant, the immigrant generally may file an appeal in the federal  court system.

As a result, the average number of cases per on-board  immigration judge has increased slightly more than 35 percent, from 1,852  in fiscal year 2000 to 2,505 in fiscal year 2005 (see fig. 3). In particular, the  case-per-judge ratios were generally higher in southwestern border courts  where the proportion of in absentia cases is also among the highest in the  country.

According to OCIJ, in general, the need for court personnel  is driven by the immigration courts\u2019 caseload. Specifically, OCIJ considers  the number of newly filed cases and cases awaiting adjudication from  prior years, historical data, and the nature of the caseload, such as the type  of cases prevalent in the court and their complexity. As newly filed cases  are received, OCIJ said that it evaluates the impact of these cases on the  allocation of resources at the immigration courts. For example, according  to OCIJ, through experience, it has learned that the immigration courts  will have difficulty meeting and maintaining its case adjudication time  goals when immigration judges have more than 1,050 and 1,500 newly filed  cases involving non-detained and detained immigrants, respectively.  Therefore, OCIJ attempts to keep the list of cases that appears on the  judges\u2019 calendars under these levels. In addition, on the basis of feedback  from the courts, the responsible ACIJ notifies OCIJ headquarters of any  unexpected increases in newly filed cases in a given court due to emerging  or special situations, such as mass migration or enhanced border  enforcement actions. According to OCIJ, if a pattern of need emerges, it  reassigns personnel or provides other assistance, if available.", "OCIJ noted that the judges\u2019 calendar of cases might vary among courts due  to the type and complexity of the cases received. Thus, the case-per-judge  ratios will be higher in some courts than others. Courts with a high  number of change of venue cases (cases that are transferred from one  court to another court) and/or in absentia cases that require less time to  complete have a higher volume of cases per judge than courts with more  merits asylum cases and other complex cases awaiting adjudication. For  example, judges in the Harlingen and San Antonio immigration courts  located in Texas are assigned a higher number of cases because these  courts have a high number of change of venue and in absentia cases  adjudicated in a given year compared to the San Francisco, California,  New York City, New York, and Miami, Florida, immigration courts, where  most cases are merits asylum hearings that require more time to complete.  In fiscal year 2005, judges in the Harlingen and San Antonio immigration  courts had, on average, over 8,000 cases compared to judges in San  Francisco, New York City, and Miami immigration courts who had, on  average, about 1,200, 1,500, and 2,400 cases, respectively.", "Within each immigration court, newly filed cases are generally assigned to  immigration judges through an automated process; however, some  flexibility exists. After a charging document has been filed, either DHS  through an interactive scheduling system or immigration court staff are to  enter data on newly filed cases in EOIR\u2019s case management system. The  case management system automatically assigns newly filed cases within  each court on the basis of the next available judge\u2019s calendar, rotating  through all of the judges to equalize the number of cases assigned to each  immigration judge. In addition, OCIJ stated that court staff has the  flexibility to manually assign newly filed cases to a specific immigration  judge rather than use the automated system. For example, the court  administrator may manually schedule some cases to correct inequities that  occurred in the number and type of cases that were assigned to a judge by  the automated system. Also, cases that are re-entering the immigration  court system are generally manually assigned to the immigration judge  who had initially adjudicated the case. Further, if a judge already has a  heavy caseload, OCIJ officials said that an ACIJ, through authority  delegated by the Chief Immigration Judge, may decide to exclude a judge  from assignment of newly filed cases through the automated system.", "EOIR\u2019s Strategic Plan for fiscal years 2005 through 2010 states that it  intends to consider changes in workload, establish better methods to  project future workload, and adjust resources accordingly. Additionally,  EOIR proposes to refine its current caseload management practices to  ensure that cases move through the system as efficiently as possible.

Details usually occur to cover situations such as emerging needs that  result in a surge of newly filed cases; staff shortages in a court due to  illness, retirements, or annual leave; or the need to hear cases in other  designated hearing locations. OCIJ advertises the detail opportunities to  solicit volunteers. In selecting from the judges that volunteer, OCIJ said  that it considers the needs of these immigration judges\u2019 respective  assigned courts. Volunteers from courts that have heavy caseloads and are  not meeting their goals for timely case adjudication will usually not be  selected. According to EOIR, it does not maintain readily available data on  the number and duration of immigration judge details.", "OCIJ also uses available technology to address staff shortages. Many  courts have the capability to use videoconferencing to conduct  immigration hearings in other courts and locations such as detention  centers and correctional facilities throughout the country. As of May 1,  2006, EOIR had videoconferencing capability at 47 of the 53 immigration  courts, and 77 other locations where immigration hearings were  conducted. According to OCIJ, videoconferencing allows immigration  judges in one court to assist another immigration court with an unusually  heavy caseload, on an ad hoc basis. For example, the two immigration  judges in the court located at EOIR headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia,  use videoconferencing to address short-term resource needs as they arise  in the other immigration courts nationwide. OCIJ said that it will use this  technology where available and feasible until this remedy is deemed  insufficient to meet the needs of the courts. OCIJ also said that it has used  videoconferencing as an interim measure while it assesses the ongoing  need to establish a new immigration court. According to EOIR\u2019s fiscal year  2005 performance work plans, ACIJs were expected to increase the usage  of video technology to address case requirement needs of immigration  courts.", "In addition, EOIR transfers responsibility for some hearing locations  among immigration courts to more evenly distribute the caseload among  immigration judges. For example, in July 2003, EOIR redistributed the  Detroit, Michigan, immigration court\u2019s caseload by transferring cases from  Cincinnati and Cleveland, Ohio, to the Arlington, Virginia, court; and cases  from Louisville, Kentucky, to the Memphis, Tennessee, court. According  to EOIR, unless the parties are notified otherwise, immigration hearings  continue to be conducted at the same hearing locations in each of these  states, with immigration judges traveling to those locations or holding  hearings by videoconference when appropriate. EOIR stated that these  transfers are infrequent.", "When a pattern of sustained need emerges, OCIJ officials said that they  recommend to EOIR establishing a court in a new location, usually a  previous hearing location\u2014especially if there is a significant distance to  travel, along with significant travel costs. A permanent court is usually  recommended if the hearing location can no longer be effectively covered  by an existing immigration court (e.g., if a court fails to meet its goals for  timely case adjudication). However, according to OCIJ, whether a new  court can be established depends on the available resources. During fiscal  years 2000 through 2005, EOIR established three new immigration courts.  For example, in July 2005, EOIR established the newest immigration court  in Salt Lake City, Utah, which was previously a hearing location of the  Denver immigration court in Colorado.

Each case type has an associated case completion goal (the percentage of  cases to be completed within the established time frame). (See table 3 for  a list of case types and their corresponding goals.) The case completion  goals were formulated beginning in June 2000, when EOIR\u2019s Director  recognized that not all case types had completion time frames. Some case  types had completion time frames established by law; others had long- standing agency completion time frames, while some had none.  Consequently, EOIR\u2019s Director solicited input from OCIJ regarding the  impact and feasibility of establishing completion goals across all case  types. OCIJ, in turn, solicited input from the immigration judges and court  administrators.

According to EOIR, the case completion goal reports are intended to  measure whether the courts are meeting their completion goals, not to  define the total caseload of the courts (all cases awaiting adjudication).  In developing these reports, EOIR management decided to exclude from  the measurement certain categories of cases that, due to extenuating  circumstances, are not expected to be completed within the established  goals. For example, DHS is responsible for conducting background and  security checks on all immigrants in immigration court proceedings. Since  the courts cannot grant an applicant relief from removal until all checks  have been favorably completed, these cases are exempted from case  completion goals. As a result, the number of cases covered by the  quarterly reports is less than the total court caseload.  Additionally,  depending on what cases are excluded from the case completion goals, the  makeup of the cases included in the reports can change from one quarter  to the next. These facts are not clearly reflected in the reports themselves.", "Our preliminary review of EOIR\u2019s quarterly reports identified  inconsistencies in some reports. For example, we noted a recurring  inconsistency between reports: the number of cases awaiting adjudication  at the end of a quarter was not the same as the number of cases awaiting  adjudication at the beginning of the following quarter. EOIR provided  several reasons for the inconsistency, as follows: (1) the EOIR case  management system is a live data base that is constantly changing as  events occur to immigration cases in the courts; (2) changes occur to the  number of cases awaiting adjudication from one quarter to another when  categories of cases are exempted from the case completion goals, since  once a case is exempted it is no longer included in the reports; (3) cases  double entered by DHS in the automated scheduling system were deleted;  (4) reconciliations were necessary due to changes to date fields to update  cases in the data base; (5) delays in data entry occurred; and (6)  programming errors occurred in the calculation of the data.", "We could not evaluate the reasonableness of EOIR\u2019s explanation; however,  EOIR\u2019s reasons did not appear to explain completely the inconsistency  between the number of cases awaiting adjudication at the end of the  quarter and the number of cases awaiting adjudication at the beginning of  the following quarter. EOIR said that the agency does not use the quarterly  reports to monitor and report on cases awaiting adjudication; rather, other  comprehensive reports serve that purpose. According to EOIR, the case  completion goal reports have a specific purpose: to report solely on the  percentage of cases completed within the goals for the appropriate  reporting period. EOIR stated that it evaluates the case completion goal  data against other sources of data to ensure the accuracy of the case  completion goal data prior to release within the agency, following  established protocols.", "We also identified inconsistencies in a 2002 report where the reported  total number of completions did not equal the sum of its components.   EOIR responded to our inquiry about this inconsistency that a  programmer had used the wrong end date for a quarter and therefore  retrieved more cases than should have been included.", "EOIR has changed its criteria for compiling the case completion goal  reports over time, as EOIR management has established new  specifications to identify the cases to be included in the case completion  goals. When the agency approves categories of cases to be excluded from  the reports, the queries used to run the reports are updated accordingly.  EOIR reported that it maintains the historical documentation of the  changes it has made to the reports through memos approved by EOIR  management outlining each change in the case completion goal criteria.

The evaluation  program seeks to make recommendations for improving court operations  by evaluating the courts\u2019 organizational structure, caseload, and workflow  processes to assess the efficiency of the court in accomplishing its  mission. Judges\u2019 individual hearing decisions are the only aspect of court  operations that are not evaluated.", "OCIJ established a Court Evaluation Unit (CEU) to manage the  coordination and operation of the court evaluation program. The CEU  selects courts to be evaluated, notifies the courts being selected, prepares  an evaluation schedule, and sends out pre-evaluation questionnaires.  While the Chief Immigration Judge selects the evaluation team members,  the CEU is responsible for training the evaluation team as well as  identifying a team leader. The evaluation team is comprised of volunteers  of one or more immigration judge(s), court administrator(s), court  interpreter(s), and legal technician(s). The participation of team members  from diverse courts and positions is intended to facilitate the exchange of  information regarding best practices of court operations. The size of the  evaluation team depends on the size of the court being evaluated. For  example, in fiscal year 2004, the team that evaluated the Bradenton  immigration court in Florida, a small court with 2 authorized full-time  permanent immigration judges, consisted of 3 team members, while the  team that evaluated the Miami immigration court in Florida, a large court  with 21 authorized full-time permanent immigration judges, had 13  members. OCIJ has established an evaluation program cycle in which  approximately 10 to 12 courts have been evaluated per year. Each court  has typically been evaluated approximately once every 4 years.", "During the onsite visit, the evaluation team gathers information about the  court under review in a variety of ways. The evaluation team conducts  interviews with local court personnel, DHS officials, and members of the  private bar. Evaluation team members select and review a random sample  of court files and administrative records maintained by the court. While  conducting interviews and reviewing court documentation, the evaluation  team assesses aspects of court operations: immigration court initiatives,  security, case management and case processing, DHS/immigration bar  relations, administrative operations, and database management.", "As shown in figure 5, the ICEP is comprised of a five-stage process.  Following the week long onsite visit, the evaluation team summarizes the  evaluation findings and recommendations and prepares a draft report for  the Chief Immigration Judge\u2019s review. Within 10 business days of receipt  of the draft report, the evaluated court is to submit written comments on  the draft report. After reviewing the draft report and court\u2019s comments,  the Chief Immigration Judge prepares an action plan addressing the draft  report\u2019s specific recommendations\u2014the action plan clarifies which  corrective actions will be taken, who will be responsible for completing  that action, and the date by which the action must be completed.  Approximately 3 months after completion of the action plan, the court  must submit a written \u201cSelf-Certification\u201d attesting to the actions taken to  implement the action plan. After receipt of the self-certification, the CEU  drafts a final report for the Deputy Chief Immigration Judge\u2019s signature.  After the court evaluation process is complete, the final evaluation report  is distributed to the EOIR Director and Deputy Director, the Chief  Immigration Judge, the Deputy Chief Immigration Judges, the responsible  ACIJ, the liaison immigration judge and court administrator for the  evaluated court, the chief clerk of the immigration court, all evaluation  team members, and the CEU program analyst."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EOIR/OCIJ Monitors Complaints against Immigration Judges", "paragraphs": ["EOIR/OCIJ also monitors complaints against immigration judges, a  practice that began in October 2003, at the direction of the EOIR Director.

Immigrants depend upon the courts to ensure the timely  and fair adjudication of their cases, and U.S. residents depend upon the  courts to order the removal of individuals from the United States who lack  a legal right to be here. If the increase in caseload continues to outpace the  growth in the number of immigration judges, the strain on the immigration  courts will likely intensify. Given these conditions, EOIR will be  challenged to judiciously manage its caseload and improve its courts\u2019  performance. EOIR has taken steps to improve the immigration courts\u2019  performance. As part of this process, EOIR has used quarterly case  completion goal reports that contained inconsistencies. However, EOIR\u2019s  lack of historical data on the individual queries used to run each quarterly  report precluded our ability to replicate the data and determine the  accuracy of the reports.

To gain a better understanding of the operations and management  of immigration courts, we also visited four immigration courts\u2014Arlington  in Arlington, Virginia; Newark in Newark, New Jersey; and two courts in  New York City, New York. We selected these four courts to include courts  varying in size, based on the number of immigration judges. At these  locations, we observed court proceedings and met with immigration  judges, court administrators, and attorneys that litigate cases before the  immigration courts\u2014attorneys from the Office of Chief Counsel of DHS\u2019s  Immigration and Customs Enforcement and private bar attorneys.  Furthermore, we obtained and analyzed case information contained in  EOIR\u2019s case management system as well as staffing data for fiscal years  2000 through 2005 and OCIJ\u2019s reports for court evaluations conducted in  fiscal years 2000 and 2004. We also interviewed representatives of the  National Association of Immigration Judges, the American Immigration  Lawyers Association, and the American Bar Association, Commission on  Immigration.", "To address the first objective concerning the trend in immigration courts\u2019  caseload in recent years, we reviewed data from EOIR\u2019s case management  system, Automated Nationwide System for Immigration Review, and  obtained and reviewed relevant documents, regulations, and policies  pertaining to the immigration courts\u2019 caseload and factors affecting  caseload. We assessed the reliability of those data needed to answer this  objective by (1) performing electronic testing for obvious errors in  accuracy and completeness, (2) reviewing related documentation about  the data and the system that produced them, including a contractor\u2019s  report on data verification of the case management system, and                (3) interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the data. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. From this system, we generated immigration court caseload data  for fiscal years 2000 through 2005 for all cases\u2013-proceedings, bond  redeterminations, and motions to reopen or reconsider\u2013--and analyzed  them for accuracy and completeness. Using SAS software, based on  criteria provided by EOIR, we generated and reviewed unique data at both  the global and immigration court level, on the number of newly filed cases,  cases awaiting adjudication, completed cases, and in absentia decisions,  as well as the age of proceedings awaiting adjudication.", "To address the second objective concerning how OCIJ assigns and  manages immigration courts\u2019 caseload, we conducted interviews with  OCIJ officials, conducted site visits to four immigration courts, and  reviewed EOIR\u2019s authorized and on-board staffing data for fiscal years  2000 through 2005, as well as their procedures for detailing immigration  judges. We also reviewed policies, procedures, and other documents  relating to OCIJ\u2019s caseload management. According to EOIR, the staffing  data are from the Department of Agriculture\u2019s National Finance Center  database, which handles payroll and personnel data for DOJ and other  agencies. While we did not independently verify the reliability of the  staffing data, we compared them with other supporting documents, when  available, to determine data consistency and reasonableness.", "To address the third objective concerning how EOIR/OCIJ evaluates the  immigration courts\u2019 performance, we obtained and reviewed from EOIR  internal quarterly case completion goal reports for fiscal years 2001 to  2005; documents concerning the establishment and refinement of the case  completion goals; 22 court evaluation reports and related documents for  the 12 immigration courts evaluated in fiscal years 2000 and 2004; and  monthly reports containing information on complaints against immigration  judges received in fiscal years 2001 to 2005.

To assess the reliability of EOIR\u2019s case  completion goal reports, we (1) performed logic testing of the data for  obvious inconsistencies in accuracy and completeness and (2) interviewed  and sent questions to agency officials knowledgeable about the reports.  We also reviewed the relevant internal control standards for such reports.  When we found inconsistencies in the reports we brought them to the  EOIR officials\u2019 attention and they provided reasons for the inconsistencies.  However, we could not evaluate the reasonableness of EOIR\u2019s  explanations of the inconsistencies or the overall reliability of each of its  quarterly reports because EOIR has changed its criteria for compiling the  reports over time and only maintains documentation on the current set of  queries used to run the reports.
