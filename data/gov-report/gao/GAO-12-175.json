Although services have shared technical data among these programs, they continue to pursue unique systems intended to counter similar threats. As military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan decrease, opportunities exist to consolidate current acquisition programs across services. However, this consolidation may be hampered by DOD\u0092s acknowledged leadership deficiencies within its electronic warfare enterprise, including the lack of a designated, joint entity to coordinate activities. Furthermore, current and planned acquisitions will not fully address materiel-related capability gaps identified by DOD\u0097including some that date back 10 years. Acquisition program shortfalls will exacerbate these gaps.", "To supplement its acquisition of new systems, DOD is undertaking other efforts to bridge existing airborne electronic attack capability gaps. In the near term, services are evolving tactics, techniques, and procedures for existing systems to enable them to take on additional mission tasks. These activities maximize the utility of existing systems and better position operators to complete missions with equipment currently available. Longer-term solutions, however, depend on DOD successfully capitalizing on its investments in science and technology. DOD has recently taken actions that begin to address long-standing coordination shortfalls in this area, including designating electronic warfare as a priority investment area and creating a steering council to link capability gaps to research initiatives.

Further, Navy and Air Force  plans to separately invest in new expendable decoy jammers\u2014systems  intended to counter near-peer adversaries\u2014also appear to overlap.  Declining military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan\u2014coupled with recent  changes in the Air Force\u2019s MALD-J program\u2014afford opportunities to  consolidate current service-specific acquisition activities. The  department\u2019s ability to capitalize on these opportunities, however, may be  undermined by a lack of designated, joint leadership charged with  overseeing electronic warfare acquisition activities.", "DOD is investing millions of dollars to develop and procure airborne  electronic attack systems uniquely suited for irregular warfare operations.  Services are acquiring these systems under both rapid acquisition  authorities as well as through the traditional acquisition process. These  systems overlap\u2014at least to some extent\u2014in terms of planned mission  tasks and technical challenges to date. Yet, they have been developed as  individual programs by the different services. Table 4 highlights overlap  among three of these systems.", "According to DOD officials, airborne electronic attack limitations in recent  operations, urgent needs of combatant commanders, and the desire to  provide ground units with their own locally controlled assets have all  contributed to service decisions to individually develop their own systems  to address irregular warfare threats. For example, one Marine Corps  official told us that his service is focused on increasing its airborne  electronic attack capacity to meet Marine Air-Ground Task Force  requirements in combat. Marine Corps systems typically equipped to  perform these tasks\u2014especially the EA-6B Prowler aircraft\u2014have  reached their capacity limits responding to combatant commander  taskings. Similarly, Air Force officials stated that ground warfighter  requests for airborne electronic attack capabilities sometimes go  unfulfilled or are delayed because of the overall constrained capacity  during current operations. Further, Army and Marine Corps officials see  operational benefits to providing ground unit commanders with smaller  airborne electronic attack assets\u2014permanently integrated within the  unit\u2014to free up Air Force and Navy assets for larger-scale missions. In  addition, the capabilities offered by current jamming pods, such as the  AN/ALQ-99, are often overkill for the irregular warfare mission needs\u2014 such as counter-improvised explosive device activities\u2014facing ground  unit commanders.", "Requirements for several of these irregular warfare systems were derived  from DOD urgent needs processes\u2014activities aimed at rapidly  developing, equipping, and fielding solutions and critical capabilities to the  warfighter in a way that is more responsive to urgent requests than the  department\u2019s traditional acquisition procedures. As we previously  reported, the department\u2019s urgent needs processes often lead to multiple  entities responding to requests for similar capabilities, resulting in  potential duplication of efforts. Even under these circumstances, the  services have shown it is possible to take steps to share technical  information among the different programs and services. For instance, the  Army\u2019s CEASAR pod is derived from the AN/ALQ-227 communications  jammer used on the Navy\u2019s EA-18G\u2014an attribute that Army officials state  reduced design risk in the program and provided opportunities for  decreased sustainment costs and reuse of jamming techniques between  the two services. Similarly, Air Force efforts to develop electronic attack  pods flown on MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles (prior to that  program\u2019s cancellation) leveraged previous technology investments for  the canceled B-52-based stand-off jammer.", "As military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan wind down\u2014and the  services evaluate whether to transition their current urgent needs  programs over to the formal weapon system acquisition process\u2014 opportunities may exist to consolidate program activities, such as the  Intrepid Tiger II and CEASAR systems that are still demonstration  programs whose transitions to formal acquisition programs have not yet  been determined.", "The potential for unnecessary overlap in efforts within the airborne  electronic attack area is not limited to irregular warfare systems. With  respect to near-peer systems, both the Air Force and Navy are separately  pursuing advanced jamming decoys\u2014the Air Force through its MALD-J  program, and the Navy through its planned Airborne Electronic Attack  Expendable initiative.", "The two services have held discussions with one another about  combining efforts toward a joint solution, including a meeting between  Navy and Air Force requirements offices and acquisition officials in  December 2010, but they have not yet reached resolution on a common  path forward. According to Navy officials, relatively minor design and  software modifications to what was a planned second increment to the Air  Force\u2019s MALD-J system could produce a system that satisfies both  services\u2019 mission requirements. However, Air Force officials stated that  accommodating the Navy\u2019s mission requirements within the system would  increase program costs and delay planned fielding of the Increment II  system, essentially rendering the planned program unexecutable.  Subsequently, Air Force officials stated that unless Increment II, in its  planned configuration, sufficiently met Navy requirements, they did not  expect the Navy to have any formal role in the program. In July 2011,  however, the Air Force suspended MALD-J Increment II activities  because of a lack of future funding availability. In February 2012, the Air  Force\u2019s fiscal year 2013 budget submission officially canceled the  program. This cancellation affords an opportunity for continued dialogue  between the two services on the potential benefits and drawbacks to  pursuing a common acquisition solution.", "In 2009, DOD completed a capabilities analysis that cited electromagnetic  spectrum leadership as the highest priority among 34 capability gaps  identified. The study concluded, in part, that leadership deficiencies, or its  absence, significantly impede the department from both identifying  departmentwide needs and solutions and eliminating potentially  unnecessary overlap among the services\u2019 airborne electronic attack  acquisitions. Specifically, the department lacks a designated, joint entity  to both coordinate internal activities and represent electronic warfare  activities and interests to outside organizations. Acknowledging this  leadership gap, and its relation to acquisition activities, the department  has initiated efforts to organize the Joint Electromagnetic Spectrum  Coordination Center under the leadership of U.S. Strategic Command. In  addition, officials representing the Office of the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Research and Engineering stated that they are considering  actions they might take to improve leadership and oversight of electronic  warfare acquisition activities across the services.

The  2004 study revalidated these gaps and outlined 10 potential materiel  solutions to fill those gaps. It also acknowledged the existence of both  near-peer and irregular warfare threats requiring airborne electronic  attack solutions. The Army and Marine Corps requested that the analysis  address irregular warfare threats because of the growing concern over  improvised explosive devices in Iraq and Afghanistan and the suboptimal  application of existing systems in the inventory to defeat those threats.  The Air Force concluded in its analysis that fulfilling airborne electronic  attack mission needs would require developing and fielding multiple new  systems.", "The most recent study, U.S. Strategic Command\u2019s Electronic Warfare  Initial Capabilities Document, identified additional capability gaps affecting  airborne electronic attack.

This approach was consistent with the analysis\u2019s  charter to guide and inform the services\u2019 acquisition programs. However,  the analysis did recommend specific capabilities and system attributes for  the Next Generation Jammer program to consider that would assist in  mitigating some of the gaps identified in the 2009 analysis.

In the  interim, tactics, techniques, and procedures for existing systems must  evolve to provide at least partial mitigation to the threat being faced.  Development and refinement of new ways to use existing equipment  allow the services to maximize the utility of their airborne electronic attack  systems and leave them better positioned to complete missions with the  assets they have available.

Some acquisition programs, such as the Next Generation Jammer and  the MQ-9 Reaper Electronic Attack Pod, invest directly in research to  guide the transition process and increase the likelihood of success. But  even with this direct attention, technology maturation and development for  Next Generation Jammer is expected to last 8 to 9 years. Consequently,  current science and technology initiatives represent a long-term  investment in future capabilities and are less suited to meeting existing  needs.", "DOD analyses during the past decade have identified coordination  deficiencies that constrain the department\u2019s ability to capitalize on its  science and technology investments. For instance, a 2005 Naval  Research Advisory Committee report found that within the Navy, research  and development efforts were unduly fragmented, with one laboratory or  development activity often being unaware of what another was doing.  Further, this study highlighted the lack of a long-range science and  technology investment planning process within the Navy. Similarly, in  2007, the Defense Science Board reported that although relevant and  valuable science and technology activity was occurring, an overarching,  departmentwide strategic technology plan with assigned responsibility,  accountability, and metrics did not exist. According to the board, DOD\u2019s  science and technology activities and investments should be more  directly informed by the department\u2019s strategic goals and top-level  missions\u2014an objective that would require a closer coupling of  technologists and users, including requirements and capabilities  developers. A 2010 Naval Research Advisory Committee report built on  previous findings noted that stewardship of long-term naval capabilities  was \u201cvague at best\u201d and lacked specific organizational assignment. The  report recognized the Navy as having the lead role within DOD for  electronic warfare, but identified sporadic and uncoordinated execution  across the technical community\u2014noting little evidence of engagement  among the science and technology community at large. Further, the  report advised that closer coordination between operational and technical  communities was essential for the realization of desired long-term  capabilities.", "DOD has recently taken actions that begin to address these shortfalls,  including formalizing existing investment processes for several key  science and technology areas. Most notably, in April 2011 the Secretary  of Defense designated electronic warfare as one of seven priority areas  for science and technology investment from fiscal years 2013 through  2017. According to officials from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)), this designation  carries the promise of increased research funding and has prompted  chartering of the interdepartmental Electronic Warfare Priority Steering  Council. This council is made up of research officials from ASD (R&E),  the services, and various defense science and technology groups, such  as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and is charged with  effectively evaluating electronic warfare capability gaps and linking them  with research initiatives necessary to fill them. To support this process,  the council is developing an implementation roadmap to guide  coordination of investments within the electronic warfare area. The  council also facilitates ASD(R&E) coordination with requirements teams  and service/external research offices to determine the specific fields of  inquiry that will be needed to support planning for future electronic  warfare capability needs. Previously, this coordination was handled  informally, whereas the new council provides authority and visibility to the  discussions and decisions made.", "Notwithstanding these important steps, services may inevitably face  situations where they have to choose between funding their own, service- specific research priorities and funding departmentwide priorities. As the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering testified in  2011, DOD\u2019s seven priority areas for science and technology investment  are meant to be in addition to the priorities outlined by individual  components (i.e., service research agencies and DARPA). In other  words, departmentwide science and technology priorities do not  necessarily supplant service priorities. Absent strategic direction,  however, services have generally been inclined to pursue their own  research interests ahead of departmentwide pursuits.

This dynamic makes it  imperative that the department get the most out of its electronic warfare  investments. At this point, that does not appear to be the case. The  systems being acquired have problems and will not deliver as expected;  potential overlap, to the extent that it leads to covering some gaps  multiple ways while leaving others uncovered, drains buying power from  the money that is available; and DOD acknowledges a leadership void  that makes it difficult to ascertain whether the current level of investment  is optimally matched with the existing capability gaps.", "Within the airborne electronic attack mission area, budgetary pressures  and related program cancellations prompted the department to change its  acquisition strategy from a system of systems construct\u2014as underpinned  by the 2002 analysis of alternatives\u2014to a potentially less robust, but more  affordable, family of systems. In addition, new systems, including AARGM  and MALD, that are designed to replace or augment legacy assets have  encountered technical challenges while in acquisition, subsequently  requiring the services to delay fielding plans within each program. Other  acquisition programs, including IDECM and MALD-J, are structured with a  high degree of concurrency between development, production, and  testing that position them for similar suboptimal outcomes. Although  individual service decisions to delay or cancel underperforming or  resource-intensive programs may be fiscally prudent, the cumulative  effect of these decisions creates uncertainty as to when, or if, current  departmentwide airborne electronic attack capability gaps can be filled. At  present, even if the department successfully acquires the full complement  of systems outlined in its family of systems strategy, some capability gaps  identified a decade ago may persist. As such, the department can benefit  from reevaluating its capability gaps\u2014using structures like the new  Electronic Warfare Priority Steering Council\u2014to identify which ones are  highest priorities for science and technology investment and to determine  areas where it is more willing to accept mission risk. This analysis, when  coupled with an examination of current service-specific science and  technology investments, can position DOD to realize improved  efficiencies in its electronic warfare research activities and better align  constrained budgets with highest-priority needs. Additionally, because  underperformance in acquisition programs exacerbates existing capability  gaps, realistic assessments of higher-risk programs can provide needed  insight into what capabilities each platform is likely to deliver and when.  Shortfalls in acquisition should not be the deciding factor on which  capability gaps the department accepts.", "At the same time, services continue to pursue and invest in multiple  separate airborne electronic attack systems that potentially overlap with  one another. This overlap is most evident in irregular warfare systems,  including the Marine Corps\u2019s Intrepid Tiger II and the Army\u2019s CEASAR  systems, but is also present in Air Force and Navy efforts to develop  expendable jamming decoys through their respective MALD-J and  Airborne Electronic Attack Expendable initiatives. Pursuing multiple  separate acquisition efforts to develop similar capabilities can result in the  same capability gap being filled twice or more, can lead to inefficient use  of resources, and may contribute to other warfighting needs going  unfilled. Leveraging resources and acquisition efforts across services\u2014 not just by sharing information, but through shared partnerships and  investments\u2014can simplify developmental efforts, can improve  interoperability among systems and combat forces, and could decrease  future operating and support costs. Such successful outcomes can  position the department to maximize the returns it gets on its airborne  electronic attack investments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the following five  actions:", "Given airborne electronic attack programmatic and threat changes  since 2002, complete the following:", "Conduct program reviews for the AARGM, IDECM, MALD, and  MALD-J systems to assess cost, schedule, and performance and  direct changes within these investments, as necessary.", "Determine the extent to which the most pressing airborne  electronic attack capability gaps can best be met\u2014using the  assets that are likely to be available\u2014and take steps to fill any  potential gaps.", "Align service investments in science and technology with the  departmentwide electronic warfare priority, recognizing that  budget realities will likely require trade-offs among research areas,  and direct changes, as necessary.", "To ensure that investments in airborne electronic attack systems are  cost-effective and to prevent unnecessary overlap, take the following  actions:", "Review the capabilities provided by the Marine Corps\u2019s Intrepid  Tiger II and Army\u2019s CEASAR systems and identify opportunities  for consolidating these efforts, as appropriate.", "Assess Air Force and Navy plans for developing and acquiring  new expendable jamming decoys, specifically those services\u2019  respective MALD-J and Airborne Electronic Attack Expendable  initiatives, to determine if these activities should be merged."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD for comment.

For MALD and MALD-J, DOD plans to  conduct a program review in early 2014, which will coincide with a  planned full rate production decision for MALD-J. In the interim, DOD  intends to continue low rate initial production of MALD-J units. However,  because MALD has experienced significant technical challenges within  the past 2 years, and because DOD plans to invest an additional $176.9  million toward MALD-J production through fiscal year 2014, we believe an  earlier review may be warranted. In its written comments, DOD also  stated that the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategic and  Tactical Systems will chair a meeting to review AARGM, IDECM, MALD,  and MALD-J with the Navy and Air Force to verify progress, but it did not  provide a timetable for this review.", "DOD also concurred with our second recommendation to determine the  extent to which the most pressing airborne electronic attack capability  gaps can best be met\u2014using the assets that are likely to be available\u2014 and take steps to fill any potential gaps.

However, the basis for DOD\u2019s partial  agreement on these two recommendations appears to stem from its  desire to achieve efficiencies through increased coordination among  programs\u2014not through consolidation of systems possessing similar  capabilities.

These cancellations were announced after we had completed our work  and drafted the report. During the period that our draft report was with the  agency for comment, we revised our report and recommendations, in  coordination with DOD, to account for these recent changes. Most  notably, we revised our fourth and fifth recommendations to remove the  newly canceled MQ-9 Electronic Attack Pod and MALD-J Increment II  systems, respectively, as additional platforms where DOD may identify  opportunities for consolidation. DOD\u2019s written comments were  subsequently crafted in response to our revised set of recommendations.  As noted above, opportunities to reduce duplication further remain.

The EA-6B uses the  AN/ALQ-99 radar jamming pod for non-lethal protection by jamming air  defense systems and its AGM-88 High Speed Anti-Radiation Missile for  lethal physical attack of air defense systems.", "Status: In 2010, we reported that the Navy had started replacing its EA- 6B aircraft with EA-18G Growlers and expected all Prowlers to be out of  its inventory by 2012. However, the Navy projects Prowlers to remain in  service until 2016 to further meet the joint expeditionary need. According  to the Navy, this is subject to additional change contingent on the fiscal  year 2013 budget. The Marine Corps plans to retire its Prowlers by 2020.  In addition, the most recent upgrade program for the EA-6B\u2014the third  Improved Capability electronic suite modification (ICAP III)\u2014is nearing  completion.

The system is capable of  intercepting, automatically processing, and jamming received radio  frequency signals.", "Status: Obsolescence issues and advances in adversary technology  have reduced the AN/ALQ-99\u2019s ability to counter emerging threats. The  Navy is developing its Next Generation Jammer program to replace the  AN/ALQ-99 and plans to begin fielding the system in 2020. In the interim,  the Navy is currently replacing three aging legacy low-band transmitters  to resolve obsolescence and reliability problems.", "Budget: See the following table for budget information.", "Estimated end of service life: 2053  Mission description: The EC-130H Compass Call is an airborne, wide  area, persistent stand-off electronic attack weapon system able to disrupt  and deny adversary use of the electronic battlespace using offensive  radio frequency countermeasures.

Its  secondary mission is to support ground and special operations forces by  denying enemy communications and defeating improvised explosive  devices.", "Status: The Air Force has evolved the Compass Call since it was first  fielded in 1982 to meet modern and emerging threats, including  commercial communications, early warning radars, and improvised  explosive devices. Upgrades and modernization efforts are completed  during regularly scheduled depot maintenance. In 2003, as a response to  Operation Enduring Freedom, these upgrades transitioned from \u201cBlock\u201d  upgrades to \u201cBaseline\u201d upgrades to allow for smaller and more focused  modernization efforts. Currently, the Air Force is completing Baseline 1  upgrades, beginning Baseline 2 efforts, and developing Baseline 3  requirements. In addition, the Air Force is also replacing the center wing  box on all 14 Compass Call aircraft, which will extend the service life of  the fleet. Compass Call has been on continuous deployment in support of  operations in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2003; which has accelerated the  need to replace the center wing boxes.

Originally developed as an air-to-air fighter, additional capabilities will  allow the F-22A to perform multiple missions including destruction of  enemy air defenses, air-to-ground attack, electronic attack, and  intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance.", "Status: The F-22A, along with the F-35, is expected to fulfill the Air  Force\u2019s requirement for penetrating escort jamming capability. The Air  Force initiated a formal F-22A modernization and reliability improvement  program in 2003 to incrementally develop and deliver increasing  capabilities over time. These increasing capabilities would allow the F- 22A to provide penetrating escort jamming, as envisioned in the airborne  electronic attack family of systems strategy. However, fielding of these  capabilities has been delayed because of reductions in program funding.  In addition, we have previously reported on schedule delays within the  modernization and reliability improvement program and their effect on  fielding additional capabilities within expected time frames.

The EA-18G incorporates jamming  capabilities, such as the AN/ALQ-99 Tactical Jamming System, and the  use of onboard weapons such as the High Speed Anti-Radiation Missile,  for the suppression of enemy air defenses. The Growler is the Navy\u2019s  platform to fulfill modified escort jamming capability needs.", "Status: The Growler program entered full rate production in 2009, with a  planned acquisition of 88 aircraft. However, in 2009, the Office of the  Secretary of Defense directed the Navy to buy an additional 26 aircraft,  bringing the total units to be acquired to 114. Through fiscal year 2011,  the Navy placed 90 of 114 planned EA-18G aircraft under contract for  production. Production is slightly ahead of schedule and has incorporated  the increase in total units with limited per-unit cost growth.", "In 2010, the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, declared the  Growler operationally effective, but also found that the aircraft was  unsuitable for operations based on maintainability concerns. Since then,  the Navy has taken steps to improve the EA-18Gs suitability through  software fixes, and the system recently completed follow-on operational  test and evaluation. In addition, initial deployment of the aircraft in support  of operations in Iraq, Libya, and Afghanistan recently concluded, and the  Navy is assessing the aircraft\u2019s performance, including the remaining  challenges mitigating electromagnetic interference with the AN/ALQ-99.  Additional software improvements are planned through fiscal year 2018.", "Budget: See the following table for budget information.", "Estimated fielding date: 2012  Mission description: AARGM is an air-to-ground missile for carrier- based aircraft designed to destroy enemy radio-frequency-enabled  surface-to-air defense.

A total of 1,919 units  were planned, with initial operational capability scheduled for March 2011.  The program began operational testing in June 2010 after a 9-month  delay owing, in part, to concerns about the production representativeness  of test missiles. The Navy halted operational testing in September 2010  after hardware and software deficiencies caused a series of missile  failures.", "These testing challenges prompted the Navy to delay AARGM\u2019s planned  initial operational capability date and undertake corrective actions to the  system. These actions included an evaluation of the AARGM system  through laboratory, ground, and flight tests from November 2010 through  June 2011. Following this testing, Navy officials concluded that previous  testing anomalies were successfully corrected but that the system was at  high risk of not meeting suitability requirements during operational testing.  The Navy found that insufficient system reliability and manufacturing  quality controls remain open deficiencies that will likely result in an  excessive number of system failures experienced by operational units,  which could prevent the Navy from effectively executing planned  missions. To address reliability concerns, the Navy instituted a \u201cfly before  you buy\u201d program to screen poor weapons prior to government  acceptance. As of July 2011, one-third of missiles delivered for testing  were returned to the factory for repair.", "Recently, the AARGM system resumed operational testing.

The Navy has fielded IDECM in  different blocks dating back to 2002 (Block 1), 2004 (Block 2), and 2011  (Block 3). Each block improved the system\u2019s jamming capabilities, decoy  capabilities, or both. Block 4\u2014the phase of production currently in  development\u2014extends IDECM onboard jamming capabilities to F/A- 18C/D aircraft.", "Status: IDECM Block 4 entered development in 2009 and includes  redesign of the ALQ-214 onboard jammer from the component design  used for earlier blocks. This redesign is driven by the need to reduce  weight in order to accommodate the IDECM onboard system on F/A- 18C/D aircraft. Essentially, the new ALQ-214 will perform the same  onboard jammer function as found in IDECM Blocks 2 and 3 but with a  different form and fit. The Navy expects to transition current IDECM Block  3 full rate production to Block 4 units by April 2012. This production  transition will occur concurrent with ground and flight testing of the Block  4 system\u2014a strategy that could drive costly design changes, retrofits, or  both to units in production, in the event that the ALQ-214 redesign effort  does not materialize on schedule. To mitigate this risk, Navy officials  stated that Block 4 full rate production will initially be for 19 systems, with  production rates increasing to as many as 40 per year following  completion of testing. Further, DOD officials report that Block 4 production  will be executed under a firm fixed-price contract\u2014a strategy that DOD  officials state will place the financial burden of any retrofits on the vendor.", "Budget: See the following table for budget information.", "Estimated fielding date: 2020 (Mid-band on EA-18G)", "Mission description: The Next Generation Jammer will be an electronic  warfare system to support the suppression of enemy air defenses,  replacing and improving the capability currently provided by AN/ALQ-99  Tactical Jamming System. The Navy\u2019s EA-18G will employ the Next  Generation Jammer as the electronic attack payload. In a separate  increment of capability, the Navy plans to integrate the Next Generation  Jammer onto the F-35B, which will eventually replace Marine Corps EA- 6B Prowlers. Each increment of capability will be divided into  developmental blocks\u2014Block 1 for mid-band, Block 2 for low-band, and  Block 3 for high-band frequencies.", "Status: The Next Generation Jammer is nearing completion of  technology maturation activities performed by four different contractors  before the program\u2019s entry into the technology development phase. The  Navy plans to enter the technology development phase in the third  quarter of fiscal year 2013, with an engineering and manufacturing  development contract planned for 2015. The Navy has adopted an  evolutionary block approach to fielding the Next Generation Jammer.  Initial operational capability for Block 1, on the EA-18G aircraft, is  scheduled for 2020. The Navy expects to field Blocks 2 and 3 on the EA- 18G in 2022 and 2024, respectively. Fielding dates for the F-35  increment\u2019s blocks are currently undetermined.", "Budget: See the following table for budget information.  2012 (MALD\u2014actual)  2012 (MALD-J\u2014estimated)", "Mission description: MALD is an expendable decoy able to represent  small, medium, or large aircraft in order to saturate or degrade enemy air  defense systems. MALD-J is a variant of MALD that adds jamming  capability to the decoy and forms the stand-in jamming component for the  airborne electronic attack family of systems. The Air Force plans to  acquire a total quantity of 596 MALD and 2,404 MALD-J units.", "Status: The Air Force approved MALD for low rate initial production in  2008. The Air Force expected to procure 300 MALD units in low rate  production before transitioning to full rate production. However, following  flight testing failures in summer 2010\u2014attributable, in part, to design  issues with the fuel filter\u2014and a later test failure in February 2011 caused  by foreign object debris in the fuel line, the MALD system was decertified,  and remaining initial operational testing and evaluation activities were  suspended. After additional corrective actions by the program office to the  MALD design, the system reentered operational testing in July 2011, with  test shots fired in late August 2011. According to Air Force testing  officials, during the last test shot in the August series (OT-8), the engine  for one decoy never started after it detached from the host aircraft,  causing that MALD unit to crash. This operational testing event was the  final one scheduled for MALD, and DOD officials report that, in January  2012, the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center delivered the  MALD initial operational test and evaluation report assessing system  performance.", "As a result of MALD\u2019s testing shortfalls, the Air Force authorized  additional low rate initial production purchases for MALD quantities\u2014to  the extent that the Air Force will now purchase the entire 596 unit  inventory of MALD quantities under low rate initial production, without  ever authorizing or achieving full rate production. Technical deficiencies  and design changes during low rate initial production prevented  demonstration of an efficient manufacturing capability, which in turn  prevented MALD from meeting the department\u2019s criteria to enter full rate  production. DOD policy states that in order for a system to receive full  rate production approval, the system must (1) demonstrate control of the  manufacturing process and acceptable reliability, (2) collect statistical  process control data, and (3) demonstrate control and capability of other  critical processes. Because the MALD and MALD-J designs are  identical\u2014except for the addition of a jammer module to MALD-J\u2014the  absence of a proven manufacturing process for MALD introduces cost  and schedule risk to production of MALD-J.", "Deficiencies affecting the MALD vehicle have already contributed to  MALD-J program delays. The MALD-J low rate initial production decision  review\u2014previously planned for September 2009\u2014was delayed until  September 2011. Operational testing has subsequently been delayed and  is now expected to begin in May 2012. To mitigate this schedule delay,  the Air Force has moved to compress MALD-J operational testing from 15  months to 7 months, which program officials report reflects an increase in  test range priority and decrease in data turnaround time. According to  DOD officials, however, test range execution issues such as aircraft and  test equipment availability could potentially extend MALD-J operational  testing beyond the currently projected completion date. In addition, the Air  Force delayed, and later canceled, plans to develop a second increment  of capability for MALD-J\u2014one intended to provide more advanced  jamming capabilities. Prior to these decisions, the Air Force\u2019s fiscal year  2012 budget submission outlined plans to budget $54.8 million in  research, development, testing, and evaluation funding to MALD-J  Increment II in fiscal year 2013. According to DOD, the Air Force is to  provide a new plan for developing and procuring an Increment II variant of  MALD-J and report to the Deputy Secretary of Defense by March 30,  2012.", "Budget: See the following table for budget information.", "Estimated fielding date: To be determined  Mission description: The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is a family of fifth- generation strike aircraft to replace and complement existing Navy, Air  Force, and Marine Corps aircraft, such as the F-16 and the F/A-18.

The program experienced  development challenges, including delays in testing, leading to a  program-wide review. Based on this review, DOD restructured the  program in 2010, increasing the time and funding for development. This  restructure triggered a breach of the critical Nunn-McCurdy cost growth  threshold.
