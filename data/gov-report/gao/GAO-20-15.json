Organizations then  develop a plan to fill those positions with qualified and capable  employees. The guidance also states that organizations should take a  planned, deliberate, and holistic approach to selecting, developing, and  engaging their workforce.

VA\u2019s directive identifies succession  planning as an ongoing activity intended to best meet the needs of the  department over time. According to VA officials, VA has attempted to  update the directive twice since 2003, but has not completed the update  due to leadership turnover. In addition, officials stated that they had to  delay updating the directive to revise it to incorporate new regulatory and  legislative changes that occurred during those past efforts to update the  directive.", "A key update to legal requirements since 2003 is OPM\u2019s strategic human  capital regulations. These regulations establish the framework agencies  are to use to plan, implement, evaluate, and improve human capital  policies and programs. OPM originally issued the regulations in 2008 and  then revised them in December 2016. In addition, the VA Choice and  Quality Employment Act of 2017 requires VA, among other things, to  establish a single database that lists each vacant position in VA that the  Secretary determines is critical to the mission of VA, difficult to fill, or  both.", "Updating the directive could help to ensure it reflects legal requirements  put in place since 2003, such as OPM\u2019s strategic human capital  regulations. Updating the directive is also consistent with GAO\u2019s  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, which requires  management to identify and respond to significant changes, such as new  laws and regulations.", "In addition, we found that VA, VHA, and VBA do not follow all of the  requirements outlined in the directive. For example, the directive assigns  responsibility to VA, VHA, and VBA for monitoring and evaluating their  succession planning strategies, which is consistent with leading practices.  However, as stated above, we found that VA, VHA, and VBA do not  conduct sufficient monitoring and evaluation. Updating the directive could  help VA clarify and recommunicate succession planning roles and  responsibilities across the department and its administrations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["We and others have previously identified leadership turnover and  mission-critical vacancies that have affected VA\u2019s ability to provide  services to veterans.

For  example, each has developed training and development programs for  aspiring leaders. However, VA lacks a current department-wide  succession plan for leadership positions and mission-critical occupations,  as required by its own directive. Establishing a department-wide  succession plan and improving existing workforce plans would help VA  identify and develop pools of high-potential staff to meet VA\u2019s mission  over the long term. Meanwhile, VHA and VBA could each take additional  steps to fully incorporate key leading practices into their succession  planning.", "Addressing VA\u2019s challenges will require active leadership support and  clear departmental guidance outlining VA\u2019s and its administrations\u2019  responsibilities for succession planning.

The list below explains the importance of the practices and  provides examples of how agencies can demonstrate them.  1.  Obtain active support and participation from leadership. Agencies\u2019 top  leadership actively participates in, regularly uses, and ensures the  needed financial and staff resources for key succession planning and  management initiatives. This leadership is important because it can  provide (1) stability during plan development and implementation, (2)  champions within the agency, and (3) integration with other key  management planning efforts. This practice may be demonstrated by,  for example, leadership participating in key succession planning  meetings and ensuring succession planning policies are up-to-date.  2.  Develop succession plans aligned with strategic goals. Agencies  discuss how workforce knowledge, skills, and abilities for leadership  and mission-critical occupations will contribute to the achievement of  strategic and annual performance goals. This alignment helps ensure  agencies\u2019 plans provide the talent needed to meet their current and  future mission requirements. This practice may be demonstrated by,  for example, integrating succession planning into strategic planning  and annual strategic objectives review assessments.  3.  Analyze current and future workforce gaps. For leadership and  mission-critical occupations, agencies identify the current talent state  and critical skills in the workforce, future workforce needs, and current  and future workforce gaps. This gap analysis is important for  identifying the skills and competencies needed for achieving its  missions and goals even as the agency\u2019s operating environment  changes. This practice may be demonstrated by, for example,  conducting and documenting current and projected workforce  analysis, including workforce gaps.  4.  Identify strategies for closing workforce gaps. Agencies identify  strategies for closing workforce gaps for leadership and mission- critical occupations, such as recruitment strategies, training, and  developmental opportunities. This planning is important for aligning  strategies to eliminate gaps, and tailoring workforce programs and  processes to the agency\u2019s needs. This practice may be demonstrated  by, for example, developing and implementing action plans and  training and development programs.  5.  Monitor, evaluate, and update succession plans and strategies.", "Agencies identify and track performance measures and progress  against goals to measure the effectiveness of succession  management programs, and regularly update plans to reflect lessons  learned. This performance monitoring is important for measuring both  the outcomes of strategies and how the outcomes have helped  accomplish the agencies\u2019 missions and goals. This practice may be  demonstrated by, for example, conducting progress assessments or  revising programs based on past performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["Robert Goldenkoff, (202) 512-2757 or goldenkoffr@gao.gov."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Shannon Finnegan (Assistant  Director), Alexander Ray (Analyst-in-Charge), Colleen Corcoran, Karin  Fangman, Robert Gebhart, and Sarah Green made key contributions to  this report.
