The memorandum was intended to highlight various challenges that have hindered ISCD efforts to implement the CFATS program. According to the Director, the challenges facing ISCD included not having a fully developed direction and plan for implementing the program, hiring staff without establishing need, and inconsistent ISCD leadership\u0097factors that the Director believed place the CFATS program at risk. These challenges centered on human capital issues, including problems hiring, training, and managing ISCD staff; mission issues, including overcoming problems reviewing facility plans to mitigate security vulnerabilities and performing compliance inspections; and administrative issues, including concerns about NPPD and IP not supporting ISCD\u0092s management and administrative functions.", "ISCD has begun to take various actions intended to address the human capital management, mission, and administrative issues identified in the ISCD memorandum and has developed a 94-item action plan to track its progress. According to ISCD managers, the plan appears to be a catalyst for addressing some of the long-standing issues the memorandum identified. As of June 2012, ISCD reported that 40 percent (38 of 94) of the items in the plan had been completed. These include (1) requiring ISCD managers to meet with staff to involve them in addressing challenges, clarifying priorities, and changing ISCD\u0092s culture and (2) developing a proposal to establish a quality control function over compliance activities. The remaining 60 percent (56 of 94) that were in progress include those requiring longer-term efforts--\u0097i.e., streamlining the process for reviewing facility security plans and developing facility inspection processes; those requiring completion of other items in the plan; or those awaiting action by others, such as approvals by ISCD leadership. ISCD appears to be heading in the right direction, but it is too early to tell if individual items are having their desired effect because ISCD is in the early stages of implementing corrective actions and has not established performance measures to assess results. Moving forward, exploring opportunities to develop measures, where practical, to determine where actual performance deviates from expected results, consistent with internal control standards could help ISCD better identify any gaps between actual and expected results so that it can take further action, where needed. For example, as ISCD develops a new security plan review process, it could look for ways to measure the extent to which the time to do these reviews has been reduced as compared with the time needed under the current review process.", "According to ISCD officials, almost half of the action items included in the June 2012 action plan require ISCD collaboration with or action by NPPD and IP. The ISCD memorandum stated that IP and NPPD did not provide the support needed to manage the CFATS program when the program was first under development.

Chemicals  held at these facilities can be used to cause harm to surrounding  populations during terrorist attacks, can be stolen and used as chemical  weapons or as precursors (the ingredients for making chemical  weapons), or stolen and used to build an improvised explosive device. To  mitigate this risk, the DHS appropriations act for fiscal year 2007  required DHS to issue regulations to establish risk-based performance  standards for securing high-risk chemical facilities. DHS established the  CFATS program to assess the risk, if any, posed by chemical facilities;  place high-risk facilities in one of four risk-based tiers; require high-risk  facilities to develop security plans; review these plans; and inspect the  facilities to ensure compliance with the regulatory requirements.

DHS is to use this information to initially determine  whether the facility is high risk. If so, DHS is to notify the facility of its  preliminary placement in one of four risk-based tiers\u2014tier 1, 2, 3, or 4.", "Facilities preliminarily placed in any one of these tiers are considered to  be high risk, with tier 1 facilities considered to be the highest risk.  Facilities that DHS initially determines to be high risk are required to  complete a security vulnerability assessment, which includes the  identification of potential critical assets at the facility and a related  vulnerability analysis. DHS is to then review the security vulnerability  assessment and notify the facility of DHS\u2019s final determination as to  whether or not it is considered high risk, and if the facility is determined to  be a high-risk facility about its final placement in one of the four tiers.  Once this occurs, the facility is required to submit a site security plan or  participate in an alternative security program in lieu of a site security  plan. The security plan is to describe the security measures to be taken  to address the vulnerabilities identified in the vulnerability assessment,  and identify and describe how security measures selected by the facility  will address the applicable risk-based performance standards. DHS then  is to do a preliminary review of the security plan to determine whether it  meets the regulatory requirements. If these requirements appear to be  satisfied, DHS issues a letter of authorization for the facility\u2019s plan. DHS  then conducts an authorization inspection of the facility and subsequently  determines whether to approve the security plan. If DHS determines that  the plan does not satisfy CFATS requirements (based on its preliminary  review after an authorization inspection), DHS then notifies the facility of  any deficiencies and the facility must submit a revised plan correcting  those deficiencies. If the facility fails to correct the deficiencies, DHS may  then disapprove the plan.

In November 2011, the Director and Deputy Director  provided the Under Secretary the ISCD memorandum entitled  \u201cChallenges Facing ISCD, and the Path Forward.\u201d These officials stated  that the memorandum was developed to inform leadership about the  status of ISCD, the challenges it was facing, and the proposed solutions  identified to date. In transmitting a copy of the memorandum to  congressional stakeholders following the leak in December 2011, the  NPPD Under Secretary discussed caveats about the memorandum. He  stated that the memorandum was not a formal compliance audit or  program review and in several instances it lacked useful, clarifying  context. He stated that the ISCD memorandum was not intended for  wider internal or external dissemination beyond the Under Secretary\u2019s  office.

He also noted that the  memorandum did not discuss the \u201csignificant progress\u201d ISCD had made  to date reaching out to facilities of concern to improve their security  posture. For example, senior division officials told us that the  memorandum did not note the positive impact of ISCD\u2019s initial screening  of facilities, which resulted in many facilities reducing their holdings of  regulated materials so that they would no longer be subject to the rule.", "The ISCD Director confirmed that she was the primary author of the ISCD  memorandum, in consultation with the Deputy Director, and said that the  memorandum was intended to be used as an internal management tool.  The Director stated that when she was brought onboard, the Under  Secretary tasked her to look at CFATS from an outsider\u2019s perspective and  identify her thoughts on the program relative to other regulatory regimes,  particularly in light of growing concerns about possible human capital  issues and problems tiering chemical facilities covered by CFATS. She  confirmed that the memo was intended to begin a dialog about the  program and challenges it faced. The Director also confirmed that she  developed the memorandum by (1) surveying division staff to obtain their  opinions on program strengths, challenges, and recommendations for  improvement; (2) observing CFATS program operations including the  security plan review process; and (3) analyzing an internal DHS report on  CFATS operations, which, according to the Director, served as a basis  for identifying some administrative challenges and corrective action.

As discussed earlier, the ISCD memorandum was  accompanied by a proposed action plan that, according to the director,  was intended to provide proposed solutions to the challenges identified.  The January 2012 version of that plan listed 91 actions to be taken  categorized by issue\u2014human capital management issues, mission  issues, or administrative issues\u2014that, according to the ISCD Director,  were developed to be consistent with the ISCD memorandum. Each  action item also listed the coordinator, or individual or unit responsible for  the action, and discussed the status of the action, including whether the  item was complete or in progress. For example, in the human  capital/staffing issues area, one action item was intended to engage ISCD  leadership to develop an integration plan for newly hired employees. The  IP Business Support Team, which is co-located with ISCD, was  responsible for coordinating this action, and at the time the plan was  prepared, the action was in progress.

Our analysis of the  38 completed items showed that 32 of the 38 items were associated with  human capital management and administrative issues, including those  involving culture and human resources, contracting, and documentation.  For example, one human capital management issue that is complete  called for ISCD to survey staff to obtain their opinions on program  strengths and challenges and recommendations for program  improvements. According to the June 2012 action plan, the survey was  completed and ISCD\u2019s action plan showed the item as completed on  January 10, 2012.

In accordance with the affected action items, ISCD and a  contractor developed the several elements of the realignment plan for  review, and ISCD was awaiting input or guidance from NPPD and IP  before associated action items can be completed.", "Sixteen of 56 remaining actions items in progress covered mission issues  that will likely also require long-term efforts to address. For example, 1 of  these mission-related action items entails the development of  requirements for an information technology platform to support inspection  activities. Another entails the development of plans to improve ISCD\u2019s site  security plan review process. Regarding the latter, ISCD encountered  delays approving security plans because, according to ISCD officials, the  quality of the plans submitted was inconsistent and ISCD did not have  dedicated staff with the skills needed to work with facilities to review and  approve them. As noted in the ISCD memorandum, the site security plan  review process was overly complicated, did not leverage available  resources, and created bottlenecks and clearing the backlog of security  plan\u2019s was ISCD\u2019s highest priority. To address these concerns, ISCD  developed an interim review process to clear the backlog of tier 1 security  plans with a goal of completing reviews of those plans by the end of the  calendar year. ISCD began to track the action item intended to develop a  plan for introducing a new security plan review process, which, according  to the June 2012 action plan, is supposed to be completed in July 2012.  The development of a new security plan review process may be critical to  the effective implementation of the CFATS program. According to an  ISCD official, compliance inspections cannot begin until ISCD reviews  and approves a facility\u2019s site security plan. In March 2012, the official  estimated that it could take at least 18 months for ISCD to complete its  first compliance inspections.

ISCD officials told us that they had not yet begun to  plan or develop any measures, metrics, or other documentation focused  on measuring the impact of the action plan on overall CFATS  implementation because they plan to wait until corrective action on all  items has been completed before they can determine the impact of the  plan on the CFATS program. For the near term, ISCD officials stated that  they plan to assess at a high level the impact of the action plan on  CFATS program implementation by comparing ISCD\u2019s performance rates  and metrics pre-action plan implementation and post-action plan  implementation. However, because ISCD will not be completing some  action items until 2014, it will be difficult for ISCD officials to obtain a  complete understanding of the impact of the plan on the program using  this comparison only.", "Now that ISCD has begun to take action to address the challenges  identified, ISCD managers may be missing an opportunity to measure the  effects or results of some of the actions taken thus far, particularly actions  that are either in the early stages of implementation or are in the  formative stages. Measuring results associated with particular action  items would be consistent with Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government, which calls for the establishment and review of  performance measures and indicators to monitor activities and compare  actual performance with planned or expected results throughout the  organization and analyze significant differences. We recognize that it  might not be practical to establish performance measures for all action  items, for example; 1 of the 94 items calls for ISCD to initiate the hiring  process for an economist. However, other action items may be  candidates for performance measurement because they focus on  organizational changes or mission-related issues. For example, once  ISCD gets approval to move forward with a plan to reorganize, it could  develop interim plans and measures to monitor the progress of integrating  various functions and use the information to identify barriers, if any, for  completing this effort. Likewise, once ISCD makes the decision to revise  its site security plan review process, it could develop measures for  implementing those revisions and consider what measures might be  appropriate for gauging its success in streamlining the process and  completing security plan reviews. By looking for opportunities to develop  performance measures covering the various action items and developing  such measures, ISCD managers would be better positioned to identify  any gaps in their efforts to address the challenges and have tools  available to measure and monitor performance in the future. ISCD would  also have a framework for providing continuity of operations when new  managers or staff are hired, managers move from position to position, or  as the program changes. Furthermore, ISCD would be better equipped to  inform stakeholders of its progress as the organization moves toward  resolving the challenges identified in the ISCD memorandum."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "ISCD Officials Stated That Almost Half of the Action Items Require Collaboration with or Action by NPPD or IP", "paragraphs": ["According to ISCD officials, almost half of the action items included in the  June 2012 action plan either require ISCD to collaborate with NPPD and  IP or require NPPD and IP to take action to address the challenges  identified in the ISCD memorandum. NPPD, IP, and ISCD officials have  been working together to identify solutions to the challenges the  memorandum identified and to close pertinent action items.", "One of the issues identified in the ISCD memorandum was the level of  NPPD and IP communication and support. According to ISCD officials, at  the time the program was established, NPPD and IP communication and  support were not adequate for the division to implement the CFATS  program within the statutory time frames (which was 6 months following  the passage of the CFATS statute). Regarding the ISCD memorandum  and the action plan, NPPD, IP, and ISCD officials have been working  together to identify solutions to these human capital and administrative  challenges. According to division officials, 46 of the 94 action items  included in the June 2012 action plan require either action by NPPD and  IP or collaboration with NPPD and IP. This includes collaborating with  NPPD officials representing the NPPD human capital, facilities, and  employee and labor relations offices, among others, and with IP\u2019s  Directorate of Management Office.that require action by or collaboration with NPPD or IP are complete; 33  of 46 are in progress.", "As of June 2012, 13 of the 46 items  With regard to completed items, these focused largely on human capital  and administrative issues. For example, 1 completed item required ISCD  leaders to establish regular meetings with NPPD and IP human capital  officials to ensure better communication and visibility on human capital  issues. Our discussions with ISCD and NPPD officials confirmed that this  action item was closed because meetings covering human capital issues  have begun and are held on a weekly and recurring basis. NPPD, IP, and  ISCD told us that one of the topics of discussion during the weekly  meetings is the hiring of specialists so that the division has assurance  that the CFATS reviews and inspection process properly include their  expertise. According to these officials, hiring certain types of specialists is  a difficult challenge given that ISCD is competing with other  organizations, including organizations within DHS, for individuals that  possess these specialized skills. These officials also stated that these  weekly meetings provide NPPD, IP, and ISCD an opportunity to discuss  human capital issues as they come up and ensure that the division\u2019s  hiring process runs smoothly. To further assist with ISCD\u2019s hiring efforts,  IP officials said that one IP human capital staff member is moving to be  co-located with the division with the intent that this co-located staff  member will be an important accelerator to the hiring process and help  keep ISCD hiring on track. Another related action item required similar  meetings between ISCD and NPPD\u2019s Office of Employee and Labor  Relations to discuss union-related issues. This item was closed because  these NPPD staff members meet weekly with ISCD senior leaders to  discuss how the union operates and how they should work with the union,  and help them understand and properly address the division\u2019s obligations  to the union.", "With regard to the 33 of 46 actions items requiring collaboration with  NPPD and IP that are in progress, 23 require NPPD or IP to review and  approve work completed by ISCD or make policy decisions before the  division can list the action item as complete. For example,", "Twelve of the 33 action items involve ISCD\u2019s development of the  aforementioned realignment plan. As of June 2012, ISCD had  forwarded the realignment plan to NPPD and IP for review and was  awaiting approval so that the plan could be forwarded to DHS for  review and comment.", "Another action item requires ISCD to develop a human capital  strategic plan. According to the June 2012 action plan, ISCD is  waiting for NPPD to release its Human Capital Strategic Plan to  finalize this action item and plans to use the guidance provided in the  NPPD plan to develop an ISCD Strategic Human Capital Plan.", "ISCD continues to work on the remaining 10 of the 33 in-progress action  items that require NPPD or IP action or division collaboration with NPPD  and IP. According to the June 2012 action plan, completion of these  action items is dependent upon ISCD staff completing an internal review  of an ISCD-drafted set of standard operating procedures or  memorandum, or an analysis of an existing ISCD procedure. Once ISCD  finalizes these 10 action items, the outputs are to be forwarded to NPPD  and IP for review, comment, and approval, where appropriate.", "Additional details on action items that require collaboration with or action  by NPPD or IP are considered \u201cfor official use only.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["ISCD has identified numerous challenges it has encountered  implementing the CFATS program and has developed an action plan that  is intended to help address these challenges.

First, ISCD\u2019s memorandum is largely based on the efforts of the  ISCD Director in consultation with the ISCD Deputy Director and may not  be representative of the views of other senior officials within the CFATS  program. Furthermore, the conclusions reached in the memorandum  were not obtained by using a formal compliance audit or program review  procedures, nor were the assumptions validated. Second, our results are  based on the status of the action plan as of June 2012, so these results  are valid only up until this point in time. Third, documentary evidence  about the development of the CFATS program and the causes for the  issues identified in the ISCD memorandum is, for the most part, not  available. Program officials did not maintain records of key decisions and  the basis for those decisions during the early years of the program.  During preliminary discussions, the members of current management  team qualified that much of their knowledge about program decisions  during the early years of the program is their best guess of what  happened and why.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2012 to July 2012 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
