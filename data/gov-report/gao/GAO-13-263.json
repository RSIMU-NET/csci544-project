For example, the plan lists costs for the next phase of the 12 recommended courthouse projects, which have several phases, but does not list previous funding or ongoing annual costs for the projects. As a result, the plan lists about $1 billion in costs for the 12 projects, but the projects would actually cost the federal government an estimated $3.2 billion over the next 20 years. Congress has appropriated a small share of the money needed for the projects, and most will need design changes before construction can begin. As a result, there is a risk that congressional funding decisions could be made without complete and accurate information. However, with this information, decision makers could weigh current-year budget decisions within the context of projects' expected future costs, spur discussion and debate about actions to address them, and put the judiciary's requests in context with other federal spending.", "Ten of the 12 recommended projects were not evaluated under the AMP process.

Furthermore, 10 of the 12 recommended construction projects do not qualify for a new courthouse under the AMP criterion, which requires that new courthouses need two or more additional courtrooms. These conditions call into question the extent to which the projects remaining on the 5-year plan represent the judiciary's most urgent projects and whether proceeding with these projects represents the most fiscally responsible proposal.

To date this program has  resulted in the completion of 78 new courthouses or annexes and 16  projects in various stages of development. However, rising costs and  other budget priorities have slowed the construction program. In addition,  we found in 2010 that recent federal courthouses had been constructed  larger than necessary because of poor planning, oversight, and inefficient  courtroom use. Specifically, 33 federal courthouses completed from  2000 to 2010 included 3.56 million square feet of extra space that cost an  estimated $835 million to construct and $51 million annually to operate  and maintain. We recommended that GSA should: (1) ensure that  courthouses are within their authorized size or notify congressional  committees; and that the judiciary should: (2) retain caseload projections  to improve the accuracy of its 10-year judge planning and (3) establish  and use courtroom-sharing policies based on scheduling and use data.

The AMP process establishes criteria for qualifying for new  courthouse construction, such as requiring that an existing courthouse  have a chamber for each judge and needing two or more additional  courtrooms. Judiciary officials told us that unlike the previous capital- planning process, a new courthouse could no longer be justified as part of  the AMP process based solely on security or operational deficiencies.  The judiciary has chosen to improve security within existing courthouse  rather than replace them with new courthouses. After the Judicial  Conference identifies courthouse projects, GSA conducts feasibility  studies to assess alternatives for meeting the judiciary\u2019s space needs and  recommends a preferred alternative. The judiciary adopts the GSA  recommended alternative, which may differ from the alternative  recommended in the AMP process.

Specifically, transparency about  future priorities could allow decision makers to weigh current-year budget  decisions within the context of projects\u2019 expected future costs. In the case  of the judiciary, which has identified a number of future courthouse  projects estimated to cost several billion dollars, full transparency  regarding these future priorities may spur discussion and debate about  actions Congress can take to address them. Additionally, transparency  regarding future capital costs would put the judiciary\u2019s priorities in context  with federal spending.

Our 2010 report  based on judiciary data on courtroom scheduling and use showed that  judges of all kinds, including district judges, could share courtrooms  without delaying any scheduled events and recommended that the  judiciary expand courtroom-sharing to more fully reflect the actual  scheduling and use of district courtrooms. Specifically, judiciary data  showed that three district judges could share two courtrooms or a district  judge and a senior district judge could share one courtroom.

While the judiciary has made significant strides in  improving its capital-planning process, most of the 12 projects listed on  the 5-year plan are products of its former process. It is possible that some  of the 12 projects do not reflect the most urgent capital investment needs  of the judiciary under its current criteria. Two projects on a previous 5- year plan that were assessed under the AMP process were removed from  the list and now rank well down on the judiciary\u2019s list of priorities, but the  judiciary has not applied the AMP process to 10 courthouses on the  current 5-year plan dated September 2012. Furthermore, 10 of the 12  projects on the current 5-year plan do not require a sufficient number of  courtrooms to qualify for new construction under the AMP courtroom  criterion. In addition, there is no evidence that the judiciary considered  how it could meet the need for courtrooms without new construction if  district judges shared courtrooms. Although there would be some  incremental costs involved with an additional 10 AMP reviews, those  costs appear justified given the billions involved in moving forward with  the construction of those 10 courthouses. Similar to the 2-year  moratorium the judiciary placed on courthouse construction while it  developed the AMP process, it is not too late to apply the AMP process to  the 5-year plan projects and possibly save taxpayers from funding  construction of projects that might not represent the judiciary\u2019s highest  priorities under current criteria. It is critical that the judiciary accurately  determine its most urgent projects because of the taxpayer cost and the  years of work involved in designing and constructing new courthouses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To further improve the judiciary\u2019s capital-planning process, enhance  transparency of that process, and allow for more informed decision  making related to the federal judiciary\u2019s real property priorities, we  recommend that the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S.  Courts, on behalf of the Judicial Conference of the United States, take the  following two actions:  1.  Better align the AMP process with leading practices for capital- planning. This should include linking the AMP process to the  judiciary\u2019s strategic plan and developing and sharing with decision  makers a long-term capital investment plan. In the meantime, future 5- year plans should provide comprehensive information on new  courthouse projects, including:  a)  a summary of why each project qualifies for new construction and  is more urgent than other projects, including information about  how the AMP process and other judiciary criteria for new  courthouse construction were applied to the project;  b)  complete cost estimates of each project; and  c)  the alternatives to a new project that were considered, including  courtroom-sharing, and why alternatives were deemed insufficient.  2.

GSA and AOUSC provided technical comments  that we incorporated as appropriate. Additionally, AOUSC provided  written comments in which it agreed with our recommendation to link the  AMP process to the judiciary\u2019s strategic plan. However, AOUSC raised a  number of concerns that the subpoints related to our first  recommendation on improving capital planning would duplicate other  judiciary or GSA documents. Furthermore, AOUSC disagreed with our  recommendation to place a moratorium on the projects in the 5-year plan  until it could perform AMP evaluations of those projects because it would  take years and not change the result. We continue to believe that our  recommendation is sound because the projects included on the 5-year  plan were evaluated under the judiciary\u2019s previous capital planning  process and evidence suggested they no longer represent the judiciary\u2019s  highest priorities. Specifically, two projects on a previous 5-year plan that  were assessed under the AMP process were removed from the list and  now rank well down the judiciary\u2019s list of priorities. In addition, 10 of the  12 projects on the current 5-year plan do not qualify for new construction  under the AMP process.

Specifically, AOUSC disputed our characterization of  the judiciary\u2019s role in the capital-planning process for new courthouses  and the information provided to Congress to justify new courthouses.  According to AOUSC, Congress receives extensive, detailed information  on new courthouse projects from GSA, and our recommendation for the  judiciary to provide more comprehensive information on courthouse  projects in 5-year plans would duplicate the GSA\u2019s work. AOUSC also  disputed our presentation of the AMP process, stating that GAO did not  consider all documents when making our conclusions. AOUSC disagreed  with our recommendation for a moratorium on all projects currently on the  5-year plan because completing AMP evaluations for those projects  would unnecessarily delay the projects and exacerbate existing security  and structural issues with the existing courthouses. In AOUSC\u2019s view,  AMP evaluations for these courthouses would take years and not alter the  justification for new construction projects. AOUSC further disputed the  data we used to support our conclusions about the projects on the 5-year  plan and our explanation of the data\u2019s source. AOUSC also questioned  our characterization of the judiciary\u2019s actions in response to  recommendations in a prior GAO report.", "We believe our findings, analysis, conclusions, and recommendations are  well supported. GAO adheres to generally accepted government auditing  standards, which ensure the accuracy and relevance of the facts within  this report. These standards include a layered approach to fact validation  that includes supervisory review of all work papers, independent  verification of the facts within the report, and the judiciary\u2019s review of the  facts prior to our release of the draft report for agency comment. To the  extent that the judiciary is questioning any facts, the judiciary had multiple  opportunities provide supporting documentation to substantiate its view.  We believe that our description of the roles and responsibilities of the  judiciary and the GSA in the capital-planning process for new  courthouses is correct and appropriate. In reaching our conclusions about  the information provided to Congress, we relied on documents we  received from the judiciary and GSA. We continue to believe that by  implementing our recommendation about providing additional information  to Congress, the judiciary would improve the completeness and  transparency of the information that Congress needs to justify and  authorize funding of new courthouse projects. We will review AOUSC\u2019s  steps, once finalized, to address our recommendation that the AMP  process be linked to the judiciary\u2019s strategic plan. We continue to believe  that any steps that AOUSC takes should be aligned with leading  practices, including presentation of total project cost estimates and  alternatives considered, such as greater courtroom sharing in existing  courthouses.", "With regard to our recommended moratorium on projects on the current  5-year plan, we note that the AMP process represents progress by the  judiciary in better aligning its capital-planning process with leading  practices. Consequently, we believe that it would be worthwhile to use  this improved process to ensure that all courthouse construction  proposals remain the judiciary\u2019s top priorities and qualify for new  construction under the AMP process. The San Jose and Greenbelt  projects were approved as among the highest priorities for new  construction under the old process but, after being evaluated under the  AMP process, now rank far lower on the judiciary\u2019s list of priorities\u2014117th  and 139th, respectively. We also noted that regardless of whether a  project is on the 5-year plan, GSA is responsible for ensuring that  courthouses are adequately maintained. We relied on data provided by  the judiciary and the GSA to support our analysis of whether the projects  on the 5-year plan would qualify under the AMP process, and stand by  our conclusions.

We did not review the  appropriateness of criteria used by judiciary in its AMP process. We  reviewed documentation on the status of courthouse construction projects  and information about other federal buildings occupied by the judiciary.  We reviewed GSA data on actual costs of construction and tenant  improvements at two courthouse projects (Las Cruces, NM and Ft.  Pierce, FL) one completed in 2010 and one completed in 2011; and GSA  and judiciary estimated costs of construction for the courthouse projects  on the most recent 5-year plan, covering fiscal years 2014 to 2018. To  determine if life-cycle cost estimates were provided in the 5-year plan, we  assessed the judiciary data against GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating and  Assessment Guide. To determine the current dollar value of the  judiciary\u2019s estimate of courthouse projects\u2019 rents, we calculated the  present value of the estimated project cost based upon averages of  monthly indexes from U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor  Statistics, and rent based upon 20 year OMB published discount rate for  analyses. In addition, we interviewed judiciary officials on the AMP  process and its alignment with leading capital-planning practices. To  analyze judiciary\u2019s capital-planning process, we reviewed our previous  reports on capital-planning across the federal government, including the  efforts by the judiciary and the Department of Veterans Affairscommunicate its urgent housing needs to Congress.", "To assess recent courthouse projects recommended for funding under  the judiciary\u2019s current capital-planning process, we reviewed the  judiciary\u2019s documents detailing the projects recommended for funding for  fiscal years 2009 through 2018, called 5-year plans, and other documents  on: congressional authorizations and funding appropriations for  courthouse projects; judiciary information on courts and courthouses; and  GSA information on federal buildings, existing and planned federal  courthouses, courthouse design, and federal historic property. We  interviewed judiciary and GSA officials in Washington, D.C., and federal  courthouses we selected in Anniston, AL; Macon, GA; and Savannah,  GA. To observe existing courthouses, we selected Anniston and  Savannah because they were evaluated under judiciary\u2019s old capital- planning process and are on the most recent 5-year plan, covering fiscal  years 2014 to 2018. We selected Macon because it was highly ranked  under the judiciary\u2019s new capital-planning process and is in close  proximity to Anniston and Savannah. While our observations cannot be  generalized to all federal courthouses, they provide keen insights into  physical conditions at old historic courthouses. We reviewed  documentation provided by the judiciary on strategic planning, capital- planning, existing courthouse evaluations, the rating and ranking of  existing courthouse deficiencies, existing and future judgeships, and  courtroom-sharing by judges. To determine the extent that courthouse  projects on the 5-year plan reflect future judges needed and courtroom- sharing, we compared the judiciary\u2019s planned occupancy information to  the judiciary\u2019s own guidance, our previous work on judiciary\u2019s courtroom- sharing, and a recently proposed bill from the 112th Congress that would  have required GSA to design courthouses with more courtroom-sharing.", "We determined the number of courtrooms in the existing courthouses and  compared them to the number of courtrooms needed in the new  courthouses using the judiciary\u2019s courtroom-sharing policy.

AOUSC stated that we failed to understand the purpose of the 5-year plan,  indicating that it is not a long-term capital investment plan. The draft report  that we provided to AOUSC for comment indicates that the 5-year plan is not  a long-term capital investment plan. However, the 5-year plan represents the  only document that communicates the judiciary\u2019s recommendations related to  new courthouse projects to Congress and other stakeholders. Since it is  important for stakeholders to understand the context for new courthouse  projects, we continue to believe that the judiciary should improve the  completeness and transparency of the information the judiciary uses to justify  these projects.  2.  AOUSC stated that funding for the projects totaled $188.29 million, but did  not provide any supporting information for this amount. We used General  Services Administration (GSA) data to determine the amount of funding  appropriated for the projects on the 5-year plan, which we state to be $177  million in our report.  3.  AOUSC stated that GSA already provides sufficient information to Congress  on the judiciary\u2019s behalf for courthouse projects. While GSA provides  information to congressional committees when seeking authorization for new  courthouse projects, by that time, the judiciary has already recommended the  projects for new construction. The 5-year plan represents the only document  that communicates the judiciary\u2019s recommendations for new construction,  and it is incomplete and lacks transparency. For example, the 5-year plan  underestimates the total costs of these projects by about $2 billion because it  does not include all project phases and because the judiciary no longer  includes its rent costs on the 5-year plan.  4.  AOUSC was critical of our conclusion that the AMP process does not link to  the judiciary\u2019s strategic plan. According to AOUSC, the template for future  Long-Range Facilities Plans will clearly illustrate how the AMP process  supports and links to the judiciary\u2019s strategic plan. We continue to welcome  improvements to the judiciary\u2019s approach to strategic planning for courthouse  construction. We will assess these changes when they are implemented, as  part of our recommendation follow-up process.  5.  AOUSC noted that, with respect to our recommendation, imposing a  moratorium and reviewing the projects on the 5-year plan under the AMP  process would create a delay of up to 6 years and that 10 of the 12 projects  have been on the 5-year plan since 1999 or earlier. AOUSC states in its  response that the previous capital-planning process was \u201cstringent,\u201d and as a  result should be respected for its policy and budgetary implications. We have  previously found deficiencies in the judiciary\u2019s previous capital planning  process, including that the judiciary tends to overstate the number of judges  that will be located in a courthouse after 10 years. Our draft report noted that  the AMP process represents progress by the judiciary in better aligning its  capital-planning process with leading practices. When the judiciary applied  the AMP process to two projects on a previous 5-year plan\u2014San Jose,  California, and Greenbelt, Maryland\u2014neither project ranked among the  judiciary\u2019s revised priorities for new construction, indeed, they ranked 117th  and 139th, respectively. In addition, only two projects in the current 5-year  plan qualify for new construction under the judiciary\u2019s AMP process. Shifting  courthouse priorities demonstrate a process that is not yet finalized. Given  the federal government\u2019s current budgetary condition, the judiciary should  assure the Congress through its planning process that the courthouses  prioritized for construction funding truly represent its most urgent needs.  Otherwise, the government stands to potentially spend billions of dollars on  courthouse construction that does not meet the judiciary\u2019s most urgent needs.  Assessing all courthouses under the AMP process, given the problems of the  previous process, would help assure the judiciary and the Congress that the  highest priority courthouses are selected and that the government is  effectively spending construction funds.  6.  AOUSC stated that the declining conditions in existing courthouses on the 5- year plan place judges, staff, and the public in harm\u2019s way. Our work over a  number of years has shown that many federal buildings face deteriorated  conditions, a reason that federal property was included on GAO\u2019s High Risk  List. The courts are not alone in this regard. Our draft report noted that GSA  is responsible for ensuring that courthouses are adequately maintained. As a  result, GSA addresses building maintenance issues regardless of the status  of the courthouse construction program. In addition, we note that the criteria  the judiciary uses to select new courthouse construction projects are its own.  The AMP process established that space shortages, not facility condition, are  the only criteria for requesting new courthouse construction.   7.  AOUSC noted the security concerns at existing courthouses we visited that  we did not independently evaluate. For additional context, we added to the  report references to the judiciary\u2019s approach to improve security within  existing courthouses rather than replace them with new courthouses. The  judiciary\u2019s AMP process criteria are consistent with this approach, as facility  security deficiencies under the AMP process are no longer a justification for  new courthouse construction.  8.  AOUSC attached a letter from Chief Judge Lisa Godbey Wood of the  Southern District of Georgia, which we have printed in this report on pages 47  to 54. We address Judge Wood\u2019s comments separately (see comments 21- 27).   9.  AOUSC stated table 2 included incorrect information and provided revisions  to the table. We stand by the information provided in our report, which was  provided by the GSA and the judiciary and was reviewed consistent with our  internal controls under generally accepted government auditing standards.  The AOUSC\u2019s most recent numbers relate only to one courthouse in each  city, but our numbers represent all the judiciary\u2019s courtrooms in each city for  which we used judiciary and GSA data. We revised our final report to clarify  that the number of courtrooms in table 2 were for cities, some of which have  more than one existing courthouse. For example, in Chattanooga,  Tennessee, the AOUSC revised our number of courtrooms from six to four  possibly because there are only four courtrooms in the Joel W. Solomon  Federal Building and United States Courthouse from which the judiciary is  seeking to relocate district and magistrate judge\u2019s chambers and courtrooms.  However, there are six courtrooms in Chattanooga because the bankruptcy  judges\u2019 chambers and courtrooms are located in a leased former post  office/customs house.  10. AOUSC stated that the criteria of needing two or more courtrooms in order to  recommend constructing a new courthouse pertains to the housing strategy  recommendations contained in a district\u2019s Long Range Facilities Plan, and  that the next step is the completion of a GSA feasibility study. However,  AOUSC is describing the new AMP process. The fact remains that most  projects on the current 5-year plan were selected based on their evaluation  under the judiciary\u2019s previous capital-planning process, which did not include  the courtroom shortage criteria. As a result, those courthouses slated for new  construction under the old process and those selected under the new process  are not comparable and do not represent the judiciary\u2019s highest priorities.     11. AOUSC noted that when projects on the 5-year plan have a shortfall of one  courtroom as opposed to two, the GSA feasibility study concluded that new  courthouse construction was recommended. Our draft report observed that  although a project may not qualify for new courthouse construction under the  AMP process, GSA may determine through a feasibility study that new  construction is the most cost-efficient, viable solution despite the fact the  courthouse in question did not rise to the top in the selection process.    12. According to AOUSC, two projects were removed from the 5-year plan  because their space needs had changed and not because their rankings  dropped. Our draft report correctly stated that reduced space needs  contributed to the removal of these projects from the 5-year plan.   13. AOUSC questioned if we reviewed any of the Long Range Facility Plans  produced as part of the AMP process and the previous capital planning  process. We reviewed these judiciary documents and have revised the  description of our methodology discussed in appendix I to include the names  of the documents related to the judiciary\u2019s capital-planning process that we  reviewed while developing this report. Specifically, we added the Long Range  Facility Plans, Facility Benefit Assessments, Citywide Benefit Assessments,  Urgency Evaluations, and the 5-year plan.  14. AOUSC stated that our assessment that the AMP process partially aligns with  the leading capital practice related to \u201cneeds assessment and gap  identification\u201d was a gross error. According to AOUSC, it is not the judiciary\u2019s  role to generate cost estimates, and they believe that our partially aligns  assessment is too low. While GSA is responsible for estimating the costs of  courthouse projects, we continue to believe that the judiciary\u2019s capital- planning process partially\u2014not fully\u2014aligns with this leading practice. GAO  and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance has established that  estimates of life-cycle costs are necessary for accurate capital planning. The  judiciary\u2019s 5-year plan lists GSA estimated costs, but they are incomplete.  Specifically, the cost estimates do not include all project phases\u2014site  acquisition, building design, and construction. In addition, the judiciary no  longer includes the estimated cost of rent in its 5-year plan even though they  have estimated costs for all project phases and rent. We believe this  omission denies stakeholders and congressional decision makers complete  information on judiciary construction-program costs. In addition, our draft  report notes that these estimates are not life-cycle costs, which would also  have to be included for the cost estimate to be comprehensive.   15. AOUSC disagreed with our assessment that the AMP process partially aligns  with the leading capital practices related to \u201calternatives evaluation\u201d because  the judiciary does evaluate options with an emphasis on the least costly  option. AOUSC also indicated that we did not consider Long Range Facility  Plans in making this determination. We did consider Long Range Facility  Plans, and continue to believe that the judiciary\u2019s capital-planning process  partially aligns with this leading practice. GAO and OMB guidance  established that leading organizations carefully consider a wide range of  alternatives. Our draft report noted that the AMP process evaluates some  alternatives, such as renovating existing courthouses to meet needs, but the  judiciary provided no evidence that it considered other viable options, such as  courtroom sharing in existing courthouses, even though courtroom sharing is  required in new courthouses.   16. AOUSC disagreed with our assessment that the AMP process partially aligns  with the leading capital practices related to establishing a \u201creview and  approval framework with established criteria for selecting capital investments\u201d  because our draft report indicated that the judiciary has established such a  framework. We continue to believe that the judiciary\u2019s capital-planning  process partially aligns with this leading practice because while we were able  to discern that there are review and approval criteria in the AMP process, we  found no evidence that the judiciary\u2019s current 5-year plan applies those  criteria. Specifically, the judiciary established the criterion that courthouses  need to have a shortage of two or more courtrooms to qualify for a new  courthouse construction project. However, 10 of the 12 projects  recommended for new construction on the 5-year plan do not qualify under  this criterion.   17. AOUSC stated that we used incorrect and inflated estimates for project costs.", "We sought to provide total project cost estimates for each project on the 5- year plan. Our draft report uses estimates that the judiciary provided for total  project costs and rent, which we adjusted for inflation to the current fiscal  year. In response to our statement of facts, AOUSC provided a revised table  (reprinted on p. 51 of this report). However, the data in the table that AOUSC  provided were incomplete and they did not include supporting documentation.  Consequently, we continue to use the most current, complete estimates of  the total project costs and rent available.   18. AOUSC stated that the estimates of total project costs were provided to them  by GSA. We added GSA to the source of table 1.  19. AOUSC stated that the judiciary has implemented changes to address  recommendations from our 2010 report (GAO-10-417). GAO has a process  for following up and closing previous recommendations. We have not yet  assessed the extent to which the judiciary\u2019s actions have fulfilled the  recommendations from our 2010 report. We will, however, consider this and  all other information from the judiciary when we determine whether to close  the recommendations from our 2010 report. We plan to examine this  recommendation in the summer of 2013.  20. According to AOUSC, the projects on the 5-year plan are fully justified under  its previous \u201cstringent\u201d process that preceded the AMP process. However, as  we have previously noted, the former process had shortcomings and in our  opinion does not represent a process that the Congress should rely upon for  making capital budget decisions. The new AMP process will, when complete,  likely provide Congress with greater assurance that the judiciary\u2019s  construction priorities represent the highest priority needs. We addressed the  difference in funding for the projects on the current 5-year plan in comment 2.  21. Judge Wood stated that the number of judges in Savannah may change. For  each project, we used data provided by AOUSC. However, in our 2010 report  (GAO-10-417), we found that the judiciary often overestimated the number of  future judges it would have in planning for new courthouses.   22. According to Judge Wood, it is inappropriate to subject the Savannah  courthouse to the AMP process when over $6 million has already been spent  on design services. We found, and the AOUSC agreed, in comments to our  draft report, that the Savannah courthouse has four courtrooms and four  judges. Consequently, it does not qualify for new construction under the AMP  criterion. In addition, according to GSA, the original courthouse design from  1998, to which Judge Wood refers, is old and outdated. As a result, if the  project moves forward, the government would need to spend additional  money to redesign a new courthouse for Savannah.   23. Judge Wood noted the poor condition of the existing Savannah courthouse  and the need for a repair and alterations project to address deferred  maintenance issues. We toured this courthouse and noted many of the same  deficiencies. Our draft report noted that regardless of whether a project is on  the 5-year plan, GSA is responsible for ensuring that courthouses are  adequately maintained. In addition, as the current plan for the Savannah  project is to continue to use the existing courthouse and build an annex,  deferred maintenance in the existing courthouse would still need to be  addressed if the plan moved forward.  24. Judge Wood noted that the existing Savannah Courthouse was built in 1899  and has several deficiencies to Design Guide standards. Our draft report  noted that some existing courtrooms may not meet Design Guide standards  for size. However, as we also note, according to AMP guidance, a disparity  between space in an existing facility and the Design Guide standards is not  justification for facility alteration and expansion.  25. Judge Wood noted several security concerns in the existing Savannah  Courthouse. See comment 7.  26. Judge Wood noted that the Savannah Courthouse project preceded the AMP  process and the courthouse needs an additional courtroom and judge\u2019s  chamber. We address the judiciary\u2019s previous capital planning process and  judge and courtroom counts in Savannah in comments 20 and 21,  respectively.  27. Judge Wood attached photos documenting some of the building condition  problems at the Savannah Courthouse, and those are reprinted on pages 49  and 50. See comment 23.  28. AOUSC provided changes to the courtroom numbers in table 2 from our draft  report. As we explained in comment 9, we changed the table to make clear  that the courtroom count refers to the number of courtrooms citywide, not just  in one courthouse."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Keith Cunningham, Assistant  Director; George Depaoli; Colin Fallon; Geoffrey Hamilton; James  Leonard; Faye Morrison; and Sara Ann Moessbauer made key  contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
