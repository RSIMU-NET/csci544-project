During the last 40 years, many reports have documented problems in FAA's rulemaking efforts that have delayed the formulation and finalization of its rules. This report reviews FAA's rulemaking process. GAO reviewed 76 significant rules and found that FAA's rulemaking process varied widely.

For one-fourth of the mandates and one-third of the recommendations however, at least five years passed before FAA began the process. Once the rule was formally initiated, FAA took a median time of two and a half years to proceed from formal initiation of the rulemaking process through publication of the final rule. In 1998, FAA improved the rulemaking process and shortened the time frames for finalizing rules. These reforms included establishing a steering committee and a rulemaking management council to improve management involvement in setting priorities and resolving policy issues. GAO found that after the reforms were implemented, the median time for reviewing and finalizing a rule increased. This suggests that the productivity of FAA's rulemaking process for significant rules decreased after FAA's reforms."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In response to your request to conduct a review of the Federal Aviation  Administration\u2019s (FAA) rulemaking process in order to identify ways to  improve its efficiency, we established three research questions:  What are the time frames for FAA\u2019s rulemaking, including the time FAA  took to initiate the rulemaking process in response to statutory  requirements and safety recommendations and, once begun, to develop  and publish significant rules?", "What were the effects of FAA\u2019s 1998 reforms on its process and on its  time frames for completing rulemaking?", "How effective were FAA\u2019s reform efforts in addressing the factors that  affect the pace of the rulemaking process?", "This report contains recommendations to the Secretary of Transportation  on steps that FAA can take to improve the timeliness of its rulemaking  through better management of the process and its participants.", "As we agreed with your offices, unless you publicy announce the contents  of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution of it until 30 days from  the date of this letter.

Generally, a regulation is an agency  statement that is designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or  policy or to describe procedural requirements. The process by which FAA  and other federal agencies develop regulations is called rulemaking.", "FAA\u2019s rulemaking activities encompass all of the agency\u2019s areas of  responsibility, including air traffic control, aviation security, and  commercial space transportation. FAA must address both long-standing  and emerging issues in its rulemaking efforts. For example, questions about  the safety of aging aircraft and the adequacy of flight duty rest  requirements for airline pilots have been debated for decades. In contrast,  the issues of fire safety standards for cargo compartments and the  transport of oxygen generators emerged after the Valujet crash outside of  Miami in May 1996.", "Rulemaking can be a complex and time-consuming process, and the  Congress expressed its concerns about the speed of FAA\u2019s rulemaking in  1996, when it enacted legislation that established time frames for steps in  the process. While some rules may need to be developed quickly to address  safety issues or guide the use of new technologies, rules must be carefully  considered before being finalized because they can have a significant  impact on individuals, industries, the economy, and the environment.  Figure 4 provides a case study of FAA\u2019s efforts to address a complex, long- standing aviation safety issue by creating a rule to regulate flight duty and  rest requirements for flight crew members."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Rulemaking Process Involves Common Steps and Documents", "paragraphs": ["Rulemaking involves three stages of agency activity. First, an agency  identifies a need for rulemaking. Second, it initiates the rulemaking  process, develops a proposed rule, and publishes it for public comment.  After a public comment period, the agency finalizes the rule by considering  the comments received and drafting and publishing the final rule. Figure 5  provides an overview of the process as it applies to FAA.", "A rulemaking issue may be identified internally or externally. For example,  FAA staff may find that changes in aviation technology or operations or the  emergence of a safety problem warrant rulemaking. Alternatively, the  public or the aviation industry may petition the agency to develop a new  rule or provide an exemption from existing rules. At the beginning of fiscal  year 2001, FAA was responding to 57 petitions for rulemaking and 415  petitions for exemptions while reviewing 84 recommendations by its  advisory committee\u2014the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee  (ARAC). In addition, the Congress, the President, or the Secretary of the  Department of Transportation (DOT) may direct FAA to develop a rule, or  the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) may issue a safety  recommendation. After a rulemaking issue is identified, an agency must  consider the issue in light of its resources and other rulemaking issues that  may be equally compelling. Some rulemaking issues may require study and  analysis before an agency\u2019s management can decide whether to initiate the  rulemaking process and devote resources to developing a proposed rule.", "Once an agency has decided to initiate rulemaking, the basic process for  developing and issuing regulations is spelled out in section 553 of the  Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 (APA). Most federal agencies,  including FAA, use notice and comment rulemaking. Once rulemaking is  initiated, agencies generally must develop and publish a proposed rule or  \u201cnotice of proposed rulemaking\u201d in the Federal Register. A public  comment period follows, during which interested persons have the  opportunity to provide \u201cwritten data, views, or arguments.\u201d After the  comment period ends, the agency finalizes the rule by reviewing the  comments, revising the rule as necessary, and publishing the final rule in  the Federal Register at least 30 days before it becomes effective. Most  rules are later incorporated into the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).", "For the remainder of this report, we will use the term \u201crulemaking\u201d to refer  to the notice and comment process by which FAA\u2019s rules are developed and  codified in the CFR.", "Rules vary in importance, complexity, and impact. Under Executive Order  12866, federal agencies and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  categorize proposed and final rules in terms of their potential impact on the  economy and the industry affected. Executive Order 12866 defines a  regulatory action as \u201csignificant\u201d if it   has an annual impact on the economy of $100 million or more;   adversely affects the economy in a material way (in terms of  productivity, competition, jobs, environment, public health or safety, or  state, local, or tribal governments or communities);   creates a serious inconsistency or interferes with another agency\u2019s   materially changes the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user  fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof;  or   raises novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the  President\u2019s priorities, or the principles set forth in the order.", "Since 1996, significant rulemaking entries have constituted about half of all  of FAA\u2019s rulemaking entries in the Unified Agenda, a semiannual report of  federal regulatory activities.  Figure 6 shows the total number of FAA\u2019s  rulemaking entries and the number of significant rulemaking entries listed  in the October Unified Agendas from 1995 through 2000.", "Significant rules often take longer to issue than nonsignificant rules. They  may require extensive regulatory analyses of the potential economic,  social, and environmental impacts of one or more alternatives. These  analyses may take months to complete and are needed to ensure that the  projected economic impact has been correctly quantified and that the costs  the rule will impose on the affected industry and individuals are justified.", "Significant rules typically require more levels of review than nonsignificant  rules. Executive Order 12866 requires that OMB review agencies\u2019 proposed  and final significant rules before they are published in the Federal Register.  Moreover, clearances for proposed and final rules may be required at the  departmental level for those agencies that are part of a cabinet-level  department.", "To reduce this burden, the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996  grants rulemaking authority directly to the Administrator, except that the  Administrator may not issue a proposed or final rule without obtaining the  Secretary\u2019s approval if that rule is significant as defined by statute. The  Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century  narrowed the scope of rules that would be considered to be significant,  setting the threshold for economic significance to $250,000,000 and  eliminating inconsistency and interference with other agencies\u2019 actions and  material changes to budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or  loan programs and recipients\u2019 rights and obligations as criteria.", "Nevertheless, agencies that report to the Office of the Secretary of  Transportation (OST), including FAA, have also been required by the  Secretary to submit for review all rules deemed significant under the  executive order as well as rules that OST has indicated are to be considered  to be \u201csignificant\u201d under supplemental guidelines. These additional criteria  increase the number of rules for which agencies within DOT are expected  to complete regulatory analyses. For example, FAA published a significant  rule in April 2000 that limited the number of commercial air tours permitted  in the Grand Canyon. While the rule was not considered a significant  regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, and would not have been  significant under the statute, it was considered significant under the  Department\u2019s supplemental guidelines because the rulemaking had a  potentially substantial economic impact on Native American tribes.  Specifically, the rule was expected to have a significantly adverse impact  on the Hualapai Tribe\u2019s economic development and self-sufficiency, since  the trive relied on income from air tour operations and tourist dollars  brought to the reservation by the air tours.", "The additional analyses and reviews required for significant rules are  incorporated into the basic process that all federal agencies use for  rulemaking: developing a proposed rule, releasing the proposed rule for  public comment, and developing a final rule.", "Various offices within FAA conduct the required analyses and reviews of  rulemaking documents, as shown in table 1. In the early stages of  rulemaking, each rule is the responsibility of a program office with  technical expertise in a specific area. This office develops the initial  rulemaking documents, as indicated in table 1. Depending on the content of  the rule, the program office may be a staff office, like the Office of Chief  Counsel, that also has the additional responsibility of reviewing all  significant rules. Alternatively, it may be an office with responsibility for a  technical area, such as the Office of Civil Aviation Security Policy and  Planning. Each of these offices has managers who can become involved in  the rulemaking process by reviewing the work of its representatives on a  rulemaking team. Generally, FAA\u2019s rulemaking teams consist of  representatives from the program office, the Office of Rulemaking, the  Office of Aviation Policy and Plans, and the Office of the Chief Counsel. In  addition to significant and nonsignificant rulemaking, the staff in these  offices also work on other projects, including airworthiness directives,  airspace actions, and responses to petitions and exemptions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prior Studies of Federal Rulemaking Have Found Similar and Persistent Problems", "paragraphs": ["The ultimate goal of the federal rulemaking process is to develop and issue  a quality rule in a timely and efficient manner. Time is of particular  importance when safety is at stake or when the pace of technological  development exceeds the pace of rulemaking. Many of the problems  federal agencies face in developing and publishing rules are long-standing  and similar across agencies, and they have been cited in studies and  discussions of the process since at least the 1970s. For example, a Senate  study in July 1977 cited deficiencies in decisionmaking, planning, and  priority-setting by top management as causes of delay in federal  rulemaking. In July 2000, DOT\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (OIG)  reviewed the Department\u2019s rulemaking process and found that the  Department had taken as long as 12 years to issue significant rules. The  OIG attributed the lack of timeliness of the Department\u2019s rulemaking partly  to a lack of timely decisionmaking and prioritization.", "Studies specifically targeting the efficiency of FAA\u2019s rulemaking process  over almost 40 years have also identified similar problems.

Inconsistent and changing priorities among  FAA offices caused false starts, delays in the process, and wasted  resources. Inadequate or ill-timed involvement by FAA\u2019s senior  management hindered the agency\u2019s ability to make timely decisions. As a  result, rule drafters frequently worked without adequate direction or buy-in  from policymakers, causing extensive queuing, delays, and rework. The  reluctance of FAA\u2019s rulemaking management to delegate authority caused  problems in internal coordination and accountability and created extensive  layers of review that delayed the rulemaking process. Rulemaking projects  were also often delayed because no one was held accountable for keeping  projects on schedule. The lack of coordination resulted in \u201cfinger-pointing\u201d  as to why problems remained unsolved. FAA\u2019s 1997 study identified similar  concerns with the timeliness of rulemaking efforts by FAA\u2019s industry  advisory committee. For example, the committee had too many projects,  some of which were duplicative or overlapping. A lack of coordination and  accountability between FAA and the committee also impaired the  effectiveness of the advisory committee.", "In terms of process administration, FAA\u2019s 1997 study found that confusion  concerning the roles and responsibilities of rulemaking participants at FAA  created difficulties in determining who had responsibility for what actions,  led to breakdowns in coordination and communication, and resulted in  inadequate supervision. Multiple information systems also hampered  coordination and led to inaccurate tracking records and databases, as well  as to information that was hard to access (e.g., archives of decisions made).  Without reliable records, FAA often could not pinpoint where problems and  backlogs occurred. Moreover, even when it did identify weaknesses, it  lacked systems with which to evaluate and improve the process.", "In terms of human capital management, the 1997 study found that FAA had  not established systems for selecting and training personnel involved in  rulemaking. Rulemaking teams at FAA typically did not observe project  schedules, which they regarded as unrealistically optimistic. Measures of  timeliness were not consistently used to measure and evaluate the  performance of rulemaking participants.

We selected these agencies because they had developed  significant rules that were potentially technically complex and have an  impact on public safety (e.g., regulation of nuclear power, environmental  concerns, and food safety). We also compared FAA\u2019s time frames for  responding to public comment and finalizing significant rules with that of  other federal regulatory agencies by collecting data from the Federal  Register on the time spent processing significant rules by APHIS, EPA,  FDA, and NHTSA. To determine the extent to which FAA\u2019s rulemaking met  FAA\u2019s suggested time frames for steps in the process before and after the  reforms, we compiled information from our database of rulemaking actions  and applied it to the time frames suggested in FAA\u2019s rulemaking guidance.

After receiving NTSB\u2019s recommendation to require child  safety seats on aircraft, FAA studied the issue. It issued a related technical  order and rule but decided not to pursue rulemaking to require child safety  seats on aircraft. In part, its decision was based on a study it presented to  the Congress that concluded that if child safety seats were required on  aircraft, passenger diversion to other transportation modes could cause a  net increase in fatalities.

In doing so, FAA hoped to use available resources more  efficiently, improve team members\u2019 morale, and reduce delays.

They used a variety of ways to improve management involvement,  including the use of senior management councils and rulemaking  coordinators. For example, EPA told us they established a regulatory policy  council of senior management, as well as regulatory coordinators across  EPA to manage priorities and resources. Other approaches cited by  regulatory agencies we contacted included the use of agency ombudsmen  and \u201csenior champions.\u201d Officials at the FMCSA said a regulatory  ombudsman outside of agency program offices is responsible for moving  rules through the process and tracking rules against established  milestones. According to FMCSA officials, the ombudsman has the  authority to resolve disagreements affecting timely processing; ensure  sufficient staffing to meet statutory and internal deadlines; and represent  FMCSA in discussions about individual rulemakings with other  organizations, including OST, OMB, and other federal agencies.  Rulemaking officials at FDA told us they assign a \u201csenior champion\u201d from  the agency\u2019s program offices to be responsible for scheduling rulemaking  actions and ensuring that timely actions are taken. FDA officials said that  the senior champion concept improves accountability by establishing a  single point of responsibility. To reduce layers of internal review, other  federal agencies have taken steps to delegate authority by limiting the  amount of sequential review that takes place. For example, FDA officials  said they limit a program office\u2019s concurrence procedures and sign-off  requirements to include only necessary staff. Rulemaking officials of the  APHIS said that, in April 1999, they began limiting all staff organizations\u2019  reviews of regulatory packages to 2 weeks. Finally, senior managers at the  EPA said they provide flexibility to associate and regional administrators to  determine what procedures to follow on a rule-by-rule basis, allowing  managers more autonomy to tailor procedures to fit different needs.", "To better administer the rulemaking process, other federal agencies have  developed automated tracking systems to monitor the progress of  regulations under development, established evaluation systems for  learning about delays in the process, and initiated appropriate actions to  overcome internal delays. For example, FDA uses a tracking system to  monitor the progress of all regulatory documents, which helps expedite the  internal clearance process for regulations under development. FDA  officials said that the tracking system has saved FDA time in processing  regulations but had not estimated the amount of time saved.", "In the area of human capital management, other federal agencies cited a  number of initiatives for training and performance measurement and  evaluation. For example, to provide regulation writers with the training  necessary to adequately prepare draft regulations, officials from APHIS  encourage rulemaking staff to attend available courses and conferences or  advisory committee meetings on the relevant subjects. The officials also  encourage staff to seek technical support in drafting regulations and said  that agencies could encourage, through incentives, technical staff to  provide technical assistance to regulation writers. In addition, FDA  officials suggested using a mentor program for new staff or existing staff to  encourage them to consult with experienced regulation writers. Other  agencies have established quality standards for their rulemaking to  measure the performance of their rulemaking processes. For example, EPA  measures the quality of regulatory documents and holds senior managers  accountable for ensuring that regulatory actions meet the definition of a  quality action. When program offices at EPA are unable to demonstrate that  they can develop quality actions, fewer rulemaking actions will be assigned  to them. According to EPA regulatory officials, this is an incentive for  senior managers to develop quality rules. At FMCSA, officials said they had  a formal structure of accountability of rulemaking products and dates in  performance agreements that involve the head of the agency down to  division directors.

According to the Director of the Office of Rulemaking, the maximum  number of rulemaking projects that can be effectively managed is about 30  to 35 projects.

For example, new safety issues  may emerge whenever there is an aviation accident. In addition,  rulemaking efforts in progress that are related to issues such as safety  threats can be overtaken by new events that then drive the agency's  priorities. While the agency can monitor the effects of outside situations,  there is little it can do to control them. Figure 19 provides an illustration of  the impact of events on FAA's development of a proposed rule on aviation  security.", "Although FAA cannot prevent unexpected events from influencing its  rulemaking priorities, FAA's system for prioritizing rules established as  part of its 1998 reform lacks explicit criteria to guide rulemaking  management in establishing and ranking the priority of projects and  assigning available resources. While FAA's rulemaking manual describes  factors that must be considered in prioritizing rulemaking projects\u2014such  as the legislative time frames established by the Congress and projects  initiated in response to special commissions and the NTSB\u2014the policy  does not define how these criteria should be ranked in order of importance.", "Identifying and ranking the agency's top rulemaking priorities is important  because FAA's \u201cA\u201d list includes the Administrator's priorities as well as  other top priority rules sponsored by different offices. The FAA  Administrator's set of rulemaking priorities constitute about half of the \u201cA\u201d  list of projects that are actively worked on. For example, in July 2000, 21 of  the agency's 45 top priority rules were on the Administrator's list. Yet FAA's  policy for determining rulemaking priorities does not establish the relative  importance of the different factors that rulemaking managers must  consider in determining the priority of rules within the \u201cA\u201d list of top  priority projects. Without clear criteria for determining the rules' relative  ranking and consensus among all offices involved in rulemaking,  rulemaking managers may have difficulty in objectively determining, for  example, whether legislated time frames take precedence over the  Administrator's priorities or the safety recommendations of the NTSB.  Thus, a final ranking is de facto left to the steering committee, which is  made up of managers whose priorities are tied to the functions of their  individual offices. One result is that managers from different offices may be  more likely to allocate their staff resources on an ad-hoc, short-term basis,  rather than in a strategic fashion to complete the agency's highest priority  rules.", "During our review, the Office of Rulemaking suggested that one way of  allocating staff resources to ensure that top priority rules are completed is  to \u201cdedicate\u201d team members to work on rules until they are completed.  This approach was recommended in previous reviews of FAA's rulemaking  process and is used in FAA's acquisitions of air traffic control equipment.  According to the Office of Rulemaking, if this approach was put into place,  managers of offices involved in rulemaking activities, including the offices  involved in legal, technical, and economic analyses as well as the Office of  Rulemaking, would ensure that rulemaking team members worked only on  the highest priority rule by dedicating their staffs to that project. FAA  successfully used this approach to develop its \u201ccommuter rule\u201d in 1995, as  shown in figure 20.", "The Office of Rulemaking, which also cited changing priorities as an  ongoing problem, noted that a continuing lack of realism in prioritizing  fostered a sense of overload on the part of rulemaking staff. Our survey of  rulemaking staff showed that only about 17 percent agreed that the amount  of work was reasonable, allowing team members to produce high-quality  products and services.

However, only about 28 percent of the  rulemaking staff we surveyed agreed that senior management focused on  the prevention of problems rather than on the correction of problems, and  only 11 percent of the staff surveyed agreed that sequential processing does  not impact the timeliness of the rulemaking process.

The policy issues concern the waiving of  enforcement actions for violations discovered through FOQA data  voluntarily provided by airlines.

FAA rulemaking officials said that  they did not have the resources available to complete, correct, or update  records of rules that were not being actively worked on from the agency's  \u201cA\u201d list of rules, citing resource limitations.

FAA's technology plan called for an \u201cautomation  champion\u201d to lead the initiative across all of the affected offices. However,  according to the Office of Rulemaking, FAA had not designated a champion  or developed a plan or goals for an integrated system outside the Office of  Rulemaking.

Continuous improvement efforts are essential for identifying  problems in the rulemaking process. However, continuous improvement  and quality management teams established in FAA's reforms reported  problems in attempting to implement review systems.", "In the fall of 1999, members of the continuous improvement team  expressed concerns about the purpose and authority of the team related to  management's participation in establishing and supporting the evaluation  function. To improve the effectiveness of the system, FAA combined the  teams to include both staff and management. Despite the reorganization,  little substantive work had been done in the area of process improvement  at the time of our review. For example, project teams are to complete a  \u201clessons learned\u201d evaluation after publication of a proposed rule to  document practices and procedures that worked well, identify problem  areas, and determine opportunities to improve the entire rulemaking  process. However, since the process was reformed in January 1998 through  fiscal year 1999, we found that FAA had not documented any evaluations.", "The quality and continuous improvement teams were also expected to  review sample rulemaking documents during the progress of a selected  project, perform periodic quality assurance reviews with selected  rulemaking teams, and make recommendations to the management council  regarding their findings. However, none of these quality review functions  had been accomplished. No evaluations or recommendations had been  documented, and the rulemaking manual had not been updated since its  publication in December 1998. In discussing the issue at a steering  committee meeting, members of the management council attributed the  lack of implementation of process improvement efforts to an inadequate  level of organizational commitment to the reformed process. Rulemaking  officials said that, although the continuous improvement team met on a  regular basis to discuss lessons learned, the team had not documented the  results of their discussions. They said they planned to incorporate the  ability to document lessons learned in the next version of the management  information system and that they were updating the rulemaking manual.

Although FAA's reform effort included recommendations to  measure and evaluate team and individual team member performance and  to develop an associated rewards system, these human capital  management efforts were not implemented on a consistent, agencywide  basis. According to rulemaking officials, the staff resources needed to  develop and implement these initiatives were not available because  rulemaking staff and management were fully occupied with the day-to-day  management of the rulemaking process. As noted above, we found  evidence that some individual senior managers' performance evaluations  included rulemaking projects specific to their program areas. The  Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 requires agencies to  pursue performance-based management including results-oriented goal  setting and performance measurement. Although the act gives agencies the  impetus for tailoring their human capital systems to their specific missions  and objectives, it is up to agencies, like FAA, to follow through on the  opportunity. FAA implemented an agencywide effort to link performance  with rewards in April 2000. FAA's new core compensation plan provides for  pay increases tied to performance and individual contributions.

For example, less than one half of the respondents  (about 48 percent) agreed that senior management holds team members  accountable when teams do not meet milestones. Only 20 percent agreed  that senior management is held accountable when teams do not meet  milestones. Less than 20 percent agreed that rulemaking teams have  sufficient control over the rulemaking process to set realistic milestones.

Clarifying staff and management's roles in the  process and including performance expectations, measures, evaluations,  and rewards based on these roles is an essential step in establishing a  performance system for rulemaking that emphasizes accountability and  results. The system must hold staff and managers accountable for  producing timely, quality rules that are needed to improve aviation safety  and security. Equally essential are automated information systems to  monitor the performance of the individuals and offices in the process and  provide information to continually evaluate and improve rulemaking. A  performance management system is a key element of an effective human  capital strategy that is the best, and perhaps the only, means of obtaining  the needed level of commitment and support from FAA management and  staff. FAA's new Core Compensation Plan that provides for pay increases  tied to performance and individual contributions offers the agency an  opportunity to establish new systems for performance measurement,  evaluation, and rewards based on timeliness and quality in rulemaking for  all offices involved in the process.

One approach, suggested by the Office  of Rulemaking, is to prototype the use of dedicated rulemaking teams by  assigning staff for the duration of rulemaking projects. This approach  would give the teams the ability to focus their efforts and manage  projects to completion;  holding managers at the director and associate administrator level  accountable for making and supporting policy decisions as early as  possible in the rulemaking process; and   empowering team members by giving them the authority to coordinate  with their associate administrators so that they can represent the  associate administrator's policies, thus eliminating the need for the  separate step of associate administrator's review and approval;  empowering team members by permitting them to set their own  schedules and deadlines; and holding staff and management  accountable for ensuring that schedules are realistic.", "In addition, the Secretary of Transportation should direct the FAA  Administrator to take steps to improve administration of the rulemaking  process by   clearly communicating the roles and responsibilities of program and  support staff on rulemaking teams and holding team members and their  managers accountable for limiting their reviews to established criteria;  ensuring that information systems used for rulemaking tracking and  coordination contain current, complete, and accurate data on the status  of all significant rulemaking projects, including the time elapsed  between FAA's transmission of rules to OST and the receipt of OST's  comments or approval; and   implementing elements of its proposed continuous improvement  program and using the resulting information to identify problems in the  process and potential solutions.", "Finally, the Secretary of Transportation should direct the FAA  Administrator to take steps to improve human capital management of the  rulemaking process by establishing a human capital management strategy  for offices involved in rulemaking that includes   providing training and support to all participants that promotes use of  the agency's automated information system and collaborative, team- based decisionmaking skills, and assessing the skills of rulemaking staff  and developing targeted training to better enable them to fulfill their  rulemaking roles; and   establishing and implementing performance measures based on  expectations, evaluations, and incentives that promote timely, quality  rules.
