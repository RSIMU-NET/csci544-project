Thus, the helicopters\u2019 use of the wrong Mode I code should not have prevented the F-15s from receiving a response.", "In reaching his conclusion, the Board President relied on the evidence collected by the Board, which included the pilots\u2019 testimony as well as other information about the IFF system settings and how the system should perform. In its report, the Board cited three of four interrogation attempts about which the lead pilot had testified on April 23, 1994.

He said that if the F-15 pilots had involved the chain of command, the pace would have slowed down, ruining the pilots\u2019 chances for a shootdown.", "Further, CFAC officials stated that the Airspace Control Order was specifically designed to slow down a potential engagement to allow CFAC time to check things out.
