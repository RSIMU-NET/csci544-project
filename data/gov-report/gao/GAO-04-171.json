These objectives are to (1) reduce poverty among participants; (2) target the poor and very poor; (3) encourage women's participation; and (4) develop sustainable microfinance institutions (MFI). First, regarding reducing poverty--defined as alleviating its impacts or lifting and keeping a large number of people above the poverty line--GAO found that microfinance can help alleviate some impacts of poverty, incrementally improving borrowers' income levels and quality of life and offering an important coping mechanism to poor workers and their families. However, there is little evidence that it can lift and keep many over the poverty line. Second, microfinance generally has served the poor clustered around the poverty line but not the very poor. Third, USAID has successfully encouraged the participation of women, who have comprised about two-thirds of micro loan clients since 1997. Fourth, USAID has emphasized the importance of MFI sustainability. In fiscal 2001, of 294 USAID-supported MFIs that reported on sustainability, 38 percent reported achieving full sustainability--a percentage consistent since 1999. The basic data in USAID's Microenterprise Results Reporting (MRR) system are reliable, but certain methodological problems may affect the accuracy of some of the agency's reporting on key program objectives. Specifically, USAID may not be reporting accurately (1) the amounts it has obligated to microenterprise activities; (2) whether 50 percent of its resources went to the very poor, as required by Congress; and (3) the sustainability of USAID-supported institutions. Further, although the agency reports annually on the activities of institutions it supports, it does not show the percentage of those institutions' total funding that its contribution represents. USAID has identified and disseminated microenterprise best practices, providing information to its missions and implementing partners through policy guidance, training, and technical assistance.

Microfinance practitioners have demonstrated that  the poor will repay loans on time and that, despite high transaction costs,  micro loans can support financially viable lending institutions. Through  the 1990s, a wide variety of institutions operating in many countries have  used this model, adapting it to local conditions.", "By USAID\u2019s definition, a microenterprise consists of a poor owner- operator and nine or fewer workers. Microentrepreneurs\u2014typically small  shopkeepers, craftspeople, and vendors\u2014face a range of impediments to  improving their standard of living. Most rarely have sufficient collateral to  meet loan requirements at traditional banks; according to one report, only  2.5 percent of potential microenterprise operators have access to financial  services other than moneylenders.", "USAID\u2019s microenterprise development program focuses on three key  areas:    helping establish and fund MFIs to provide loans and other financial  services to the poor and very poor, funding business development services (BDS) to help improve the  business skills of microentrepreneurs and develop markets for  microenterprises, and   advocating for host government policy reforms to enhance  microenterprise development.", "USAID has been the leading bilateral donor of funds and technical  assistance to microenterprise development projects since 1988, when it  began formally tracking funding. USAID provides funding through  nongovernmental organizations, contractors, and, occasionally,  government organizations that implement the client-level activities. USAID  reported that it committed $158.7 million to microenterprise development  activities in fiscal year 2001, compared with $164.3 million in fiscal year  2000. Almost two-thirds of USAID\u2019s microenterprise development  obligations in fiscal year 2001 were directed to providing financial  services, principally for creating and strengthening existing credit and  savings institutions; the other third went to BDS and policy activities.  Figure 1 shows an overview of USAID\u2019s microenterprise program,  highlighting its microfinance component. In fiscal year 2001,  USAID-assisted institutions served more than 2.8 million loan clients and  more than 3.5 million savings clients. USAID-assisted institutions also  provided BDS to more than 800,000 microenterprise clients, including  market research, new product development and testing, technology  development, business counseling, and marketing assistance.", "USAID\u2019s microenterprise development program, which is highly  decentralized, funded projects in 52 countries in 2001. USAID\u2019s missions  design, implement, and monitor the microenterprise projects, obligating  about 80 percent of the program\u2019s funding. In Washington, D.C., the  Microenterprise Development Division provides policy guidance and  manages a number of grants and, along with other USAID offices, provides  about 20 percent of the agency\u2019s microenterprise funding. The division  also provides technical support for the missions and conducts research on  microenterprise issues.", "USAID takes a collaborative approach in its microenterprise development  program. For example, USAID policy is to identify, support, and  strengthen existing MFIs with established performance records to help  meet its microenterprise objectives. It also funds studies of the MFIs it has  supported, to assess impacts and to identify best practices for both USAID  and the entire microenterprise industry. One major USAID research  project, Assessing the Impact of Microenterprise Services (AIMS), was  initiated in 1995. Most of the AIMS studies focused on a single country or  activity. However, two recent AIMS studies examined USAID- and non- USAID-funded microenterprise activities in seven countries and  synthesized key findings from a number of other studies, respectively.", "USAID\u2019s microenterprise development program has targeted the poor and  the very poor (see fig. 2). The poor are those whose annual income is at or  below the poverty line as defined by the host country. The very poor are  those with an annual income 50 percent or more below the poverty line as  established by the government of the country. In addition, the vulnerable  nonpoor, who also receive microenterprise assistance, are those whose  annual income is just above the poverty line.", "Since 1994, USAID\u2019s policy has been to devote half of its microenterprise  development resources to activities targeting the very poor. In 2000, this  policy was established as law by the Microenterprise for Self-Reliance and  International Anti-Corruption Act of 2000, which required that 50 percent  of all microenterprise resources be targeted to very poor entrepreneurs.  From 1994 until the implementation of the 2000 legislation, USAID defined  loans to the very poor, or \u201cpoverty loans,\u201d as those with an average  balance of $300 or less per borrower (in 1994 dollars). The 2000 legislation  established the loan level at $1,000 or less for Europe and Eurasia, $400 or  less for Latin America, and $300 or less in the rest of the world.", "USAID annually collects data on its microenterprise program through the  MRR. (See app. IV for a discussion of the MRR methodology.) Data are  collected through surveys of USAID staff in headquarters, overseas  missions, and institutions that receive USAID funding.

The  broader academic studies of microfinance we reviewed, as well as the  experts we consulted, generally agreed that micro loans can help poor  individuals, workers, and their families cope with personal and economic  shocks, such as illness or death of family members, and manage risks  associated with living in poverty. In addition, USAID officials noted that  microfinance projects are demand driven, put money directly into the  hands of the borrowers, and generally have loan repayment rates close to  100 percent.

For example, the study in  Peru found that the program helped increase assets at the microenterprise  level; it also noted some positive effects at the household and individual  levels. According to the study, economic recession in Peru during 1997 and  1999 may have limited the effects of the small loans. A study in Egypt  found that a microfinance program offering group lending to poor women  helped its clients establish and expand their businesses. The loans also  enabled them to improve their standard of living by contributing to the  household budget, renovate their homes, and provide their children with a  better education through private tutors.

These experts also  emphasized that because the poverty line is a problematic and somewhat  artificial measure, most impact studies have not focused on estimating the  number of borrowers who cross and remain above it. The experts and  practitioners we interviewed and whose work we reviewed now generally  conclude that microfinance alone is not sufficient to lift large numbers of  people out of poverty. The challenges the poor face\u2014limited education,  few opportunities, legal and cultural barriers\u2014are difficult to overcome  with micro loans.

In Egypt, one of the largest  USAID-supported MFIs said that it has started a separate grant program to  reach the very poor. USAID officials in Bulgaria we visited said that the  poor were more able than the very poor to expand their enterprises and,  as a result, to hire the very poor. In addition, a USAID program official  stated that microfinance might not always be an appropriate intervention  for the very poor, since they often cannot use the loans productively.", "Some research also indicates that micro loans alone may not be an  appropriate assistance mechanism for people below a certain level of  poverty because they may increase their debt to unmanageable levels.

For example, a 2002  strategic evaluation of the Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest  (CGAP) stated that savings may be the most important financial service  for the very poor, since it provides a way to accumulate money without  risking debilitating indebtedness. In addition, the 2002 AIMS report and  other research indicated that, because of difficulties in reaching the very  poor with micro loans and the potential for indebtedness, there is a need  to expand the type of products or assistance targeted to this group. These  products can include savings, insurance, and money transfer services;  nonfinancial business development services; and reforms of key policies,  programs, institutions, and regulations that can affect the very poor.

In Bulgaria, officials with  USAID and its implementing partners, Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and  Opportunity International, said that imposing this requirement on  individual MFIs could create unsustainable institutions, because managing  a high percentage of small loans would increase costs associated with  servicing these loans.

Further, USAID requires annual financial reports of implementing  organizations.", "Promote MFI sustainability. This goal supports (1) sound financial  practices, (2) expanding and maintaining outreach, and (3) reducing  dependency on donor support.

USAID stated that our report does not address the full range and scope  of its microenterprise strategy and program. Our report focuses  primarily on microfinance, since this component of USAID\u2019s  microenterprise program has received, and continues to receive, the  bulk of the agency\u2019s funding. Microfinance has also been the principal  focus of long-term studies funded by USAID and others. We found no  long-term studies or evaluations that assessed the impact of USAID\u2019s  support for Business Development Services (BDS) or its policy work in  the area of microenterprise development. Our discussions with USAID  employees in Peru, Egypt, and Bulgaria regarding BDS and policy  initiatives yielded some information on these efforts, but we found that  no data on these efforts had been collected systematically.  2.  USAID said that it has long used loan size as a proxy for services to the  very poor, recognizing that it is imperfect but a statutory requirement.  Because of the limitation of loan size as a proxy, we analyzed impact  studies and evaluations funded by USAID and others that collected  information on borrowers\u2019 economic status to determine the extent to  which microfinance has reached the very poor. These studies, based  on in-depth research across multiple countries and settings, found that  the very poor are rarely reached with micro loans, for reasons outlined  in this report (see app. III for a summary of key studies on this topic).  To complement information contained in these studies, we discussed  this issue at two roundtable meetings with international experts; we  also interviewed USAID officials and nongovernmental organization   officials working with USAID-funded programs in the countries where  we conducted fieldwork. The consensus across the literature and  among the experts is that microfinance projects often have difficulty  reaching the very poor.  3.  USAID said that the MRR has used a single, clear definition of  sustainability in questionnaires to implementing partners. We disagree  with USAID on this point, and we have added information to this  section to clarify our concern regarding the agency\u2019s lack of a  standardized method for measuring microfinance institutions\u2019 (MFI)  sustainability. As noted in the report, 38 percent of MFIs that received  USAID funding in fiscal year 2001 reported that they had achieved  financial sustainability. In addition, the figures cited in USAID\u2019s  response combine data on operational and financial sustainability,  despite the fact that operational sustainability is defined in USAID\u2019s  policy guidance as an interim measure toward the goal of achieving full  financial sustainability.  4.  USAID stated that allocating the impact between USAID and other  donors would be impractical and methodologically questionable.  However, it also says that it plans to include language in its annual  report indicating that many of USAID\u2019s awardees receive support from  other sources as well, and that these sources deserve a share of the  credit for the awardees\u2019 impacts.  5.  See comment 2. USAID states that it made about 2 million loans in  fiscal year 2001 that met the statutory standard for service to the very  poor. The agency said that it also utilized other methods of reaching  this group. As noted in the report, Congress recognized the limitations  of loan size as an indicator for targeting and reaching the very poor  and directed USAID to develop more accurate methods to ensure that  this group is reached in the future.  6.  USAID said that the report suggests that loans to the very poor can  have negative consequences and may be a significant or widespread  problem. As noted in the report, the very poor can benefit from credit,  but some evidence suggests that microcredit should compliment, not  substitute, for investments in core services, such as health and  education.  7.  USAID states that their record of supporting MFIs and achieving  sustainability is strong. With regard to the issue of MFIs\u2019 achieving full  financial or operational sustainability, we note in the report that  USAID\u2019s policy establishes full financial sustainability as its goal; that  is, to develop fully financially sustainable MFIs, capable of providing  services indefinitely without USAID or other donor support. We did  not report data on operational sustainability because this measure is  defined in USAID\u2019s policy manual as a \u201cuseful interim standard of  financial performance.\u201d Accordingly, we focused on full sustainability,  a standard that, if widely attained, could ensure that these institutions  would be available to provide these services in the future. Also, see  comment 3.  8.  USAID said the report suggests that sustainability might not be  consistent with serving very poor clients. Our report does not state or  suggest that sustainability might not be consistent with serving very  poor clients. We agree with USAID that attaining full financial  sustainability may be more difficult for MFIs serving greater numbers  of very poor borrowers.  9.  USAID incorrectly attributed to us an audit conducted in Egypt; this  audit was conducted by the USAID Inspector General.  10.  USAID stated that its policy allows microenterprise funds to be  obligated for activities that do not meet the definition of  microenterprise development found in the MRR and that  microenterprise awardees do not have to solely serve micro-scale  enterprises. However, our report addresses the reporting of such  activities, not the policy. According to the 2001 MRR,  \u201cMicroenterprises are small, often informally organized businesses that  are owned and operated by poor and very poor entrepreneurs. USAID  defines a microenterprise as one that comprises 10 or fewer  employees, including unpaid family workers, in which the  owner/operator of the enterprise\u2026is considered poor. By limiting its  definition of microenterprises to those whose owners/operators are  poor, USAID ensures that the focus of its efforts remains on the most  vulnerable households in higher-risk environments.\u201d Despite this  definition, the annual MRR reports present data on a wide variety of  activities that do not meet this definition. This includes its policy work,  much of its BDS work, its obligations to small and medium businesses,  and loans to those that are not poor. As a result, it is uncertain how  much of USAID\u2019s funding is going to poor microenterpreneurs. We  believe that USAID should be more transparent in reporting these  results.", "In addition, despite USAID\u2019s statement that the MFIs and missions  report only activities that meet the definitions of microenterprise as  defined in the MRR, we found no evidence of this in our work in three  countries or our analysis of MRR data. As noted in this report, we  found numerous examples of the missions\u2019 and implementing partners\u2019  reporting activities to the MRR that did not meet the MRR definition.  Based on USAID\u2019s comments, we have modified this section of the  report to further clarify our position and the basis for these  observations. USAID also said it will include more explicit guidance on  its website to address the issue. This could potentially improve this  aspect of USAID\u2019s reporting.  11.  USAID stated that the report focused on a narrow definition of  program impacts. This report does not take a narrow view of the  impacts of USAID\u2019s microenterprise program. In addition to our  assessment of its impact on poverty alleviation and poverty reduction,  there are sections focused on reaching the poor and very poor and  other services these groups may need; outreach to women; the  sustainability of MFIs; the reliability of the MRR; best practices  identified by the microenterprise development industry; USAID\u2019s  efforts to identify and promote best practices; whether USAID  incorporates best practices in their projects; and a synopsis of 22 key  studies. In both the body of the report and appendix III, we include  considerable discussion of the extent to which microfinance can help  alleviate poverty by reducing risk and vulnerability.  12.  USAID states that microenterprise development can be a successful  intervention to shift from humanitarian to development assistance  following conflicts and natural disasters. The USAID policy manual  (section II.H.4.), titled \u201cAvoiding Poor Prospects for Microfinance  Development,\u201d states that microfinance should not be viewed as a  response to alleviate the large-scale human suffering created by wars  and civil conflict. It notes that such assistance will inevitably conflict  with the basic requirements of building sound financial institutions.  Despite this guidance, we found that USAID/Bulgaria used emergency  funds provided for the Danube River Initiative to respond to the  economic hardship resulting from the Kosovo crisis, providing funding  to MFIs that committed to work in this region. Officials of the  implementing partner told us that this humanitarian initiative, while  important from a social perspective, proved to be financially  unsustainable in light of the many challenges refugees faced.  Accordingly, the implementing partner terminated its programs in   these regions, according to USAID officials in Bulgaria."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the person listed above, Edward George, Jim Strus,   Martin De Alteriis, Mona Sehgal, David Dornisch, Yesook Merrill,   Valerie Caracelli, and Reid Lowe made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
