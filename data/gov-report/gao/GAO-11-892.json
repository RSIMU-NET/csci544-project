Over the last decade, reports from GAO, DOD, and Congress have raised issues about services acquisitions and have also highlighted the importance of acquisition training.

Several organizations have been tracking and managing the DAWIA workforce, but no DOD organization has systematically identified non-DAWIA personnel with acquisition-related responsibilities, the competencies they need to conduct their acquisition duties, or been designated responsibility for overseeing this group. DOD is not required to identify these personnel and has not established a process to do so. Identifying this population is challenging, partly because, as DOD officials noted, it is a transient one that is dispersed across many DOD organizations. Additionally, these people come from a variety of career fields and are often involved in acquisitions as a secondary duty. DOD has taken action to identify part of this population and provide them training--requirements personnel for major weapon systems--but has not done this for all non-DAWIA personnel with acquisition-related responsibilities. Most non-DAWIA personnel with acquisition-related responsibilities in GAO's sample received some acquisition training. The required training was varied and limited and applied largely to contracting officer's representatives (CORs) and not to other non-DAWIA personnel such as requirements officials, technical assistants, or multifunctional team members. For example, the Air Force required two Air Force-specific phases of training, while the Navy and Marine Corps policy did not specify what training was required. Demand for acquisition training courses by non-DAWIA personnel with acquisition-related responsibilities has been increasing in the past few years at the Defense Acquisition University, but DOD has limited information to gauge the current and future demand for training this population in the long term or the effectiveness of the current training that is available. DOD has taken short-term actions to require training and provide resources for some non-DAWIA personnel with acquisition-related responsibilities. For example, DOD recognized the importance of CORs in several memoranda requiring that they be properly trained and appointed before contract performance begins on services acquisitions. DOD has made some progress in implementing the recommendations of reports from the Panel on Contracting Integrity and GAO that related to management and training of the COR--a portion of non-DAWIA personnel with acquisition-related responsibilities. For example, for the four relevant GAO recommendations--which are related to training, assignment, and oversight of the CORs--DOD fully concurred with all of them, has fully implemented three, and is implementing a COR tracking system to address the remaining recommendation. The House Armed Services Committee and the Defense Science Board issued reports since 2009 that made recommendations that were relevant to this population but were made too recently for GAO to assess their implementation. For example, the House Armed Services Committee Panel on Defense Acquisition Reform report recommended DOD reform the services requirements process in order to address the different set of challenges services acquisitions pose compared to the procurement of goods. Among other things, GAO recommends that DOD establish criteria for identifying non-DAWIA personnel with acquisition-related responsibilities and assess the critical skills needed to perform their role in the acquisition process. DOD concurred with the recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2010, more than half of the $367 billion dollars the  Department of Defense (DOD) spent on contracts were spent on  acquiring or buying services. DOD services acquisitions can range from  aircraft maintenance or operations support for a missile range to grass  cutting, and many things in between. According to the Defense Science  Board, buying services is fundamentally different than buying weapon  systems because of the time it generally takes to move from the  identification of a requirement to contract. For example, the time,  discipline, and sophistication of a team developing a requirement for  repetitive building maintenance would be considerably less than a team  building the requirement for a weapon system such as a combat ship. Yet  most acquisition regulations, laws, policies, processes, standards,  training, education, and management structures remain largely structured  for acquiring weapon systems instead of services. Over the last decade,  our reports, as well as those from DOD and Congress, have raised issues  related to services acquisitions, including challenges in identifying  requirements and ineffective coordination between program and  contracting officials.

For example, in March 2010, the  House Armed Services Committee Panel on Defense Acquisition Reform  Report reported that DOD was not ensuring that personnel with  responsibilities for acquisition outcomes acquire the skills, training, and  experience needed to properly write, award, and oversee performance of  services acquisitions, which could pose a different set of challenges than  those associated with the procurement of goods. The report  recommended that the department reform the requirements process and  establish a clear career path for civilians in the defense acquisition  system.

They are involved in  defining requirements, shaping the acquisition decision-making process,  and overseeing services acquisitions. While identifying these individuals  is challenging, without a clear understanding of this population, DOD  does not have sufficient oversight or assurance that the right people with  the right skills are involved in the critical phases of services acquisitions  to ensure successful outcomes. Challenges in identifying non-DAWIA  personnel with acquisition-related responsibilities exist, in part, because  the personnel are dispersed throughout the department, come from a  variety of career fields, and are often involved in acquisitions as a  secondary duty. DOD\u2019s efforts to identify and provide acquisition training  to CORs, a portion of non-DAWIA personnel with acquisition-related  responsibilities, is a good foundation for building a strategic and  sustainable approach to develop the skills and competencies of other  non-DAWIA personnel with acquisition-related responsibilities.", "This diverse population, because of its differences from DAWIA  personnel, may require different ways to prepare its members for their  unique roles and responsibilities in supporting the services acquisition  process. Yet DOD does not have a deliberate approach to identifying  non-DAWIA personnel with acquisition-related responsibilities or ensuring  they have the skill sets, resources, and tools they need. Apart from the  new training for one of the non-DAWIA roles\u2014the CORs\u2014training for  non-DAWIA personnel is limited. DOD does not have a way of knowing  whether the training these people take is targeted to critical skills and  competencies related to carrying out their acquisition responsibilities.  Without a departmentwide focus and an organization within DOD with  designated responsibility for the population of non-DAWIA personnel with  acquisition-related responsibilities\u2014as the professional DAWIA workforce  has to provide leadership on training, identification, and development of  personnel\u2014it is unclear whether these personnel have the training they  need to help ensure that DOD obtains its desired acquisition outcomes. In  the area of weapon systems, DOD has taken steps to assure that non- DAWIA personnel are getting needed acquisition training. Specifically,  DOD has identified some requirements positions involved in major  weapon systems that should receive additional training and built a  curriculum designed for this group to obtain certification.

To accomplish this, we  assessed the extent to which (1) DOD knows the composition of the  population of non-DAWIA personnel with acquisition-related  responsibilities, (2) non-DAWIA personnel with acquisition-related  responsibilities are taking acquisition training, and (3) selected  recommendations related to non-DAWIA personnel with acquisition- related responsibilities from previous reviews have been implemented.", "Pub.

Through these steps, we found  FPDS-NG to be reliable for the purposes of this report.", "For this sample of contracts, we asked DOD contracting and program  officials associated with each contract to identify the personnel with roles  and responsibilities related to that acquisition, including pre- and  postaward responsibilities. We relied on DOD officials to specify whether  the personnel involved in each of the selected contracts were DAWIA- certified, and thus a member of the DAWIA workforce, or were non- DAWIA personnel with acquisition-related responsibilities. To gather more  specific information from each organization responsible for the contracts  in our selected sample, we also interviewed DOD officials, DAWIA  contracting personnel, requirements officials, and other personnel who  performed specific roles on the contracts from each of the services and  DLA. We obtained information about the involvement of non-DAWIA  personnel with acquisition-related responsibilities in the selected  contracts, the organizations\u2019 training policies when the contracts were  awarded, and how the individual organizations each tracked training for  CORs and other non-DAWIA personnel with acquisition-related  responsibilities. To help determine the roles and responsibilities of  acquisition personnel, we reviewed guidance to executive branch  agencies that defines the acquisition workforce, including those that may  be outside of DOD\u2019s DAWIA definition. However, we did not review  executive agencies\u2019 efforts to identify, develop, and train its acquisition  workforce. To understand DOD\u2019s ability to define, identify, and track non- DAWIA personnel with acquisition-related responsibilities, we interviewed  officials from the Defense Acquisition University (DAU), Defense  Procurement Acquisition Policy (DPAP), each of the services\u2019 Director of  Acquisition Career Management (DACM) offices, the Air Force Program  Executive Office for Combat and Mission Support (AFPEO/CM), the  Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Services, the Director for  Services Acquisition for the Navy, the Functional Integrated Process  Team for Program Management, the Department of Defense Inspector  General (DODIG), the Naval Audit Service, the Army Audit Agency, and  the Air Force Audit Agency.", "To identify the extent to which non-DAWIA personnel with acquisition- related responsibilities are taking acquisition training, we asked each  service and DLA to report any acquisition training that non-DAWIA  personnel with acquisition-related responsibilities associated with our  sample had taken and specific training auditors had taken from each  respective audit agency noted above. We also asked each audit agency  for aggregate counts of the number of their non-DAWIA auditors who  worked on contracting and acquisition who had received DAWIA- equivalent certification. In order to confirm training taken by the non- DAWIA personnel with acquisition-related responsibilities for the contracts  in our sample we requested DAU training records, training certificates,  and locally maintained training records. To identify the demand for DAU  acquisition training by non-DAWIA personnel over time, we requested  data on 15 classroom and Web-based courses from DAU for fiscal years  2008 through 2010 that were identified from DOD policy documents as  training for requirements officials or CORs. We made an effort to only  include designated non-DAWIA personnel to establish the amount of  training taken and additionally calculated the number of unique individuals  by removing duplicate names to provide a more accurate number to the  demand for training. However, we were not able to determine whether  individuals worked on major weapon systems, services acquisitions,  another type of contract, or did not work in acquisition at all. To identify  the individual courses that non-DAWIA personnel with acquisition-related  responsibilities took and the sources for training on the 29 contracts, we  compiled the training identified by DOD officials and cross-referenced  individuals listed with DAU\u2019s training database. However, these data  sources did not provide us enough information to completely verify the  training individuals identified as non-DAWIA personnel with acquisition- related responsibilities have taken. We did not assess the content or the  effectiveness of the required or available training. Despite some of the  limitations noted above, we found the data to be reliable for the purposes  of this report. To understand DOD\u2019s ability to strategically plan for the  training or development of non-DAWIA personnel with acquisition-related  responsibilities we interviewed officials from DAU, DPAP, and the  services\u2019 DACMs. We also interviewed contracting and requirement  officials with the Air Force, Army, Navy, and DLA to obtain acquisition  training and evidence of completed training. We reviewed relevant  legislation, acquisition policy, and service and agency-specific policies  and guidance, such as the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2010, the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and the Defense Federal  Acquisition Regulation Supplement in order to understand any training  requirement for non-DAWIA personnel with acquisition-related  responsibilities.", "To identify the extent to which recommendations addressing non-DAWIA  personnel with acquisition-related responsibilities from previous reviews  have been implemented, such as the Panel on Contracting Integrity  (Panel), we reviewed 2007-2010 annual updates prepared by DOD to  address the Panel\u2019s recommendations. Specifically, we compared the  recommended actions from the previous reports with each additional  report and conducted a comparative analysis of the Panel\u2019s status of  each recommendation with our own assessment. We provided our  analysis to DPAP officials to review and provide additional information  that we considered in making our final determination. We also reviewed  past GAO reports that made recommendations on non-DAWIA personnel  with acquisition-related responsibilities from 2005-2009 and provided an  update on the status of DOD\u2019s implementation or current work to  implement past recommendations.

Following is a list of categories of  roles, titles, and a description of the acquisition responsibilities for non- DAWIA personnel with acquisition-related responsibilities.      1.  Alternate/assistant contracting officer\u2019s representative  (ACOR)/technical assistant/task manager: Serves as support to the  COR in the administration of the contract but does not have the  authority to provide any technical direction or clarification to the  contractor.    2.  Contracting officer\u2019s representative (COR): Serves as the onsite  technical subject matter expert assessing contractor performance  against contract performance standards and recording and reporting  this information, including inspecting and accepting supplies and  services. The COR represents and is nominated by the requiring  organization and designated by the contracting officer. The personnel  responsible for developing the requirements may or may not be  assigned as the COR on services acquisitions. Regardless, DOD  guidance states that the COR should be identified early in the  acquisition cycle and included in preaward activities, such as  requirements definition/acquisition planning and contract formation  processes. In our selected contracts, CORs were sometimes DAWIA  personnel, but the majority of them were not. In 17 of 29 contracts,  there was more than one COR assigned.  3.  Requirements official: Represents an organization with a need for a  particular product or service. Requirements officials are responsible  for technical requirements, for prescribing contract quality  requirements, and for defining the requirement. According to agency  officials, acquisition planning activities generally begin when the  program office, along with requirements officials, identifies a need.  The program office is primarily responsible for conducting market  research, defining requirements in a document such as a statement of  work, developing cost estimates, and developing a written acquisition  plan, if required. In the 29 contracts we reviewed, there were non- DAWIA personnel with acquisition-related responsibilities identified as  requirements officials.  4.  Source selection board member: Evaluates contract proposals  against requirements and recommends contractors for award.   5.  Program/project manager: Serves as the principal technical expert  and is usually the most familiar with the requirement and best able to  identify potential technical trade-offs and determine whether the  requirement can be met by a commercial solution. In the absence of a  program office or program/project manager, requirements officials  from the customer organization serve in a similar role as the  program/project manager. In contrast to major weapon programs, for  services acquisitions, a program office is not usually established, so  the contracting organization works directly with the requirements  organization\u2014which typically consists of non-DAWIA personnel with  acquisition-related responsibilities in our selected contracts. In our  selected contracts, DOD does not require a program/project manager  to be appointed for services acquisitions, and there is no requirement  for those that are serving in this role for services acquisitions to be  DAWIA personnel. Of the contracts in our sample, 13 reported having  program/project managers and 16 did not. Some contracts had more  than one person serving in a role similar to that of a program/project  manager.   6.  Legal advisor: Ensures that terms and conditions contemplated are  consistent with the government\u2019s legal rights, duties, and  responsibilities. Reviews contracting documents and request for  proposals for legal sufficiency and advises on acquisition strategies  and contracts.  7.  Multifunctional team member: Plans and manages services  acquisitions throughout the life of the requirement. The functional  experts on the team maintain knowledge and provide continuity and  stability. The duties, expertise, and contributions of each team  member are important to the success of a services acquisition. Of the  29 contracts we reviewed, 24 used multifunctional teams or the  equivalent, and 5 did not.  8.  Functional commander: Directs or commands the requirements  organization responsible for the actual performance of a given  service. Identifies mission-essential services and develops,  implements, and assists in the execution of services acquisitions.  Some responsibilities may include developing acquisition strategy and  overseeing performance and monitoring the service throughout the life  of the acquisition, including reviewing contractor performance  documentation on a regular basis to ensure performance is  compatible with the contract and mission objectives. They are also  responsible for assigning primary and alternate CORs and assigning  functional experts to the multifunctional team. DOD officials in this role  are generally non-DAWIA personnel with acquisition-related  responsibilities.  9.  Auditor: Conducts acquisition and contract-related audits at any  phase in the services acquisition life cycle. Non-DAWIA auditors  include those in the Army Audit Agency, the Naval Audit Service, the  Air Force Audit Agency, and the DOD Inspector General. In our  selected contracts, non-DAWIA audit personnel do not have and are  not required to receive DAWIA certification.  10. Financial/budget officer: Serves as an advisor for fiscal and  budgetary issues.   11. Price analyst: Analyzes and evaluates financial and cost-based data  for reasonableness, completeness, accuracy, and affordability at  initiation or contract award phases of services acquisitions.   12. Small Business Administration advisor: Serves as the principal  advisor and advocate for small business issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Acquisition Training Resources Used by Non-DAWIA Personnel with Acquisition-related Responsibilities Identified on 29 Services Acquisition Contracts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Status of Selected Recommendations from 2007-2010 Panel on Contracting Integrity Reports", "paragraphs": ["To determine the extent to which training recommendations from the  Panel on Contracting Integrity (Panel) have been implemented, we  examined whether DOD had implemented the Panel\u2019s recommendations  in 2007, 2008, and 2009 by reviewing the 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010  reports. To assess the implementation of the 2010 recommendations,  DPAP provided information on the status of the recommendations.  Specifically, we compared the recommended actions from the 2007 report  with the reported action in the 2008 report. The same comparative  analysis was conducted using the recommended actions from 2008,  2009, and 2010 reports. We differentiated between recommendations that  specifically mention training from those that did not, as well as  recommendations in which training was involved in the implementation of  the recommendation.
