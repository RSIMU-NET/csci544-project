GAO was also required to report on the effect that provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act have on IG independence.

GAO relied primarily on responses to its survey received from 62 IGs established by the IG Act. GAO also obtained information from the President's fiscal year 2011 budget, the IGs' annual report to the President for fiscal year 2009, and the IGs' semiannual reports to the Congress.

With respect to independence, the IGs reported that (1) statutory provisions regarding IG compensation have been implemented where applicable, thereby maintaining the independence of their work and enhancing their relative stature within their agencies; (2) they had access to independent legal counsel who reports to an IG instead of an agency management official; (3) only one IG used a statutory provision for IGs to report particularly flagrant problems through the agency head to the Congress in 7 days because issues are generally resolved before the report is needed; and (4) of the affected 26 DFE IGs, 14 responded that their independence was enhanced by the Dodd-Frank Act provision that changed the designation of agency head from the chair to the entire board or commission, and 20 responded that their independence was enhanced by the provision requiring a two-thirds majority vote for IG removal. Also, the IGs' budgets were not always identified separately in the President's fiscal year 2011 budget submission as required by the Reform Act provision intended to enhance the IGs' budget independence through transparent reporting. The IG Council is currently reviewing the matter. The IGs reported various measures of effectiveness. The IGs reported potential savings of about $43.3 billion resulting from their fiscal year 2009 audits and investigations. Given the IGs' fiscal year 2009 budget authority of about $2.3 billion, these potential savings represent about an $18 return on every dollar invested in the IGs. The IGs also reported about 5,900 criminal actions, 1,100 civil actions, 4,400 suspensions and debarments, and 6,100 indictments as a result of their work. In addition, the IGs reported enhanced effectiveness through additional actions taken to help prevent fraud in their agencies. For example, in fiscal year 2009 the Recovery Act created a requirement for the IGs to provide oversight of the economic stimulus funds disbursed by their agencies, and established the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board of IG members to help carry out this oversight. As of June 2011, the IGs reported over 1,500 investigations opened, over 1,400 reviews completed, and over 2,000 training sessions provided to detect and prevent fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement in the use of Recovery Act funds. With respect to expertise, the IGs reported having backgrounds, academic degrees, and certifications in a range of areas related to their statutory responsibilities. The IGs reported backgrounds and academic degrees in accounting, auditing, financial analysis, law, management analysis, public administration, and investigations. In addition, the IGs, particularly the DFE IGs, reported numerous professional certifications related to their responsibilities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The statutory federal inspectors general (IG) are instrumental in  enhancing government accountability through the results of independent  audits, investigations, and other reports on federal government programs  and operations.

In 1988, the IG  Act was amended to establish additional IG offices located in 33 DFEs  defined by the act. (A listing of the DFEs with IGs is provided in app. II.)  Generally, the DFE IGs have the same authorities and responsibilities as  those IGs originally established by the IG Act, but with the distinction that  they are appointed and may be removed by their agency heads rather  than by the President and are not subject to Senate confirmation.  Although not in the scope of our review, there are 10 IGs established by  other statutes with provisions similar to those in the IG Act.

Among  other provisions, the Reform Act requires the rate of basic pay of the IGs  appointed by the President to be at a specified level, and for the DFE IGs,  at or above a majority of other senior-level executives at their entities.  The Reform Act also requires an IG to obtain legal advice from his or her  own counsel or to obtain counsel from another IG\u2019s office or from the  Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (IG  Council). The IG Act also provides protections to the independence of  the IGs while keeping both their agency heads and the Congress fully and  currently informed about particularly flagrant problems and deficiencies  within their agencies through a 7-day process specified by the act.", "In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act amended the IG Act with provisions to  enhance the independence of IGs in DFEs with boards or commissions.  Specifically, the Dodd-Frank Act changed who would be considered the  head of the DFE for purposes of IG appointment, general supervision,  and reporting under the IG Act. If the DFE has a board or commission the  amendments would now require each of these IGs to report  organizationally to the entire board or commission as the head of the DFE  rather than an individual chairman. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act  requires the written concurrence of a two-thirds majority of the board or  commission to remove an IG.

The fields in  which an IG can have experience are intended to be sufficiently diverse  so that many qualified people could be considered, but also limited to  areas relevant to the tasks considered necessary. The IG Act  Amendments of 1988 created DFE IGs but did not specify that these IG  appointments made by agency heads were to be without regard to  political affiliation and on the basis of demonstrated ability in specified  fields.
