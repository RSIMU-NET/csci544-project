Since the early 2000s, community banks have tended toward providing CRE loans more than other kinds of loans. Indicators of CRE market conditions and loan performance have been improving since 2011. At the same time, GAO's analyses of changes in CRE underwriting standards, property prices, and other data suggest that credit and concentration risks have increased in bank CRE lending. For example, the number of banks with relatively high CRE concentrations\u2014measured by the ratio of a bank's CRE loans to its total capital\u2014has been increasing. In addition, commercial property prices have been increasing rapidly, and property valuations also have risen in recent years. Similarly, GAO's predictive econometric models of CRE loan performance suggest that risk has increased, based largely on the simultaneous increase in bank CRE lending and CRE prices observed over the last several years, but is lower than the level associated with the 2007\u20132009 financial crisis.", "GAO found that federal banking regulators subjected banks with relatively high CRE concentrations to greater supervisory scrutiny based on its review of a nongeneralizable sample of 54 bank examinations covering 40 banks done by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency from 2013 through 2016. Of the 54 examinations that GAO reviewed, 41 of them covered banks with relatively high CRE concentrations. In all of these examinations, regulators examined whether the banks had adequate risk management practices and capital to manage their CRE concentration risk. In 26 of the 41 examinations, regulators did not find any risk management weaknesses. However, in 15 of the 41 examinations, regulators found the banks had weaknesses in one or more risk management areas, such as board and management oversight, management information systems, or underwriting. The regulators generally communicated their findings to the banks in the reports of examination and directed the banks to correct their risk management weaknesses."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Concentrations in commercial real estate (CRE) loans at U.S. banks have  been steadily increasing, raising safety and soundness concerns because  of the potential for such concentrations to make the banks more  susceptible to failure. As an asset class, CRE is prone to volatility and  cyclical behavior, as illustrated by the sharp downturn in the CRE market  generally following the 2007\u20132009 financial crisis. A bank\u2019s CRE  concentration can be measured by its ratio of CRE loans to its total  capital. Since the early 2000s, community banks have trended toward  providing CRE loans more than other kinds of loans. Following this trend,  the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), and Office  of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) jointly issued guidance in 2006  (hereafter referred to as the 2006 CRE guidance) that described their  expectations for sound risk management practices for banks with  concentrations in CRE loans. In December 2015, the federal banking  regulators jointly issued a public statement to remind banks of the 2006  CRE guidance. According to the statement, the regulators observed that  (1) many CRE asset and lending markets were experiencing substantial  growth; and (2) certain risk management practices at some banks were  causing concern, including a greater number of underwriting policy  exceptions and insufficient monitoring of market conditions to assess the  risks associated with these concentrations.", "In our prior work, federal banking regulators told us that they have taken  steps intended to improve their ability to identify and respond to emerging  risks based on lessons learned from past banking crises. Our review of  failed banks also found that regulators frequently identified weak  management practices at banks involved in higher-risk activities early on  in each crisis and before the banks began experiencing declines in  capital. However, regulators were not always effective in directing bank  management to address underlying problems before bank capital began  to decline, and it was often too late to avoid failure. We have incorporated  these and other regulatory lessons learned into a framework for  monitoring federal banking regulators\u2019 efforts to identify and respond to  emerging risks to the banking system. Through such monitoring, we  identified CRE for a targeted assessment of the federal banking  regulators\u2019 supervisory efforts.", "We prepared this report under the authority of the Comptroller General to  assist Congress with its oversight responsibilities. Given the federal  banking regulators\u2019 joint 2015 statement on CRE lending and our ongoing  monitoring of their efforts to identify and respond to emerging threats to  the banking system, this report examines  trends in the CRE lending markets, including changes in the level of  credit and concentration risk in the markets, and actions taken by federal banking regulators through their  examinations to help ensure that banks with CRE concentrations are  effectively managing the related risks.", "To address our objective on trends in the CRE lending markets, we  reviewed academic literature and prior GAO work, analyzed FDIC,  Federal Reserve, and other data on CRE markets and lending, and  interviewed officials from federal banking agencies and CRE data  providers. We evaluated trends in these data and used a subset of these  data to estimate several predictive models of aggregate losses on bank  CRE loans.

Using  such analysis, we selected a nongeneralizable sample of 40 banks that  underwent full-scope examinations from 2013 through 2016 based on  their CLD and total CRE concentrations, total assets, primary regulator,  and geographic location. More specifically, we selected 20 FDIC- supervised banks, 10 Federal Reserve-supervised banks, and 10 OCC- supervised banks.

For purposes of this report, we collectively refer to such issues  as supervisory concerns. Supervisory concerns may be designed to  correct practices that deviate from sound risk management principles or  noncompliance with laws and regulations. Supervisory concerns that  involve more significant issues are brought to the attention of a bank\u2019s  board of directors and senior management in the report of examination as matters requiring immediate attention (MRIA) or matters requiring  attention (MRA) under the Federal Reserve\u2019s policies, matters requiring  board attention (MRBA) under FDIC\u2019s policies, and MRAs under OCC\u2019s  policies.

Of these  504 banks, a total of 69 banks exceeded both the CLD criteria and the  total CRE criteria (including the growth component).", "In December 2015, federal banking regulators issued a joint statement to  remind banks of the 2006 regulatory guidance on prudent risk  management practices for CRE lending activity through economic cycles.  The regulators noted, among other trends, that many banks\u2019 CRE  concentration levels had been rising. According to the statement,  regulators would continue to pay special attention to potential risks  associated with CRE lending during 2016.

For example, The Federal Reserve has a National Risk Council and FDIC  and OCC have National Risk Committees that meet routinely to identify  and evaluate risks facing banks and are supported by a number of other  committees or other groups. FDIC officials told us that analysis done by  FDIC\u2019s Regional Risk Committees identified growth in CRE  concentrations in 2015 and brought the issue to the National Risk  Committee\u2019s attention.

OCC officials also stated  that CRE concentration risk has been a key risk issue for the agency\u2019s  National Risk Committee since early 2016. Federal Reserve officials told  us that the agency, including the Federal Reserve banks, began to  monitor bank CRE concentrations more closely around mid-2013 after  identifying an increase in CRE concentrations. According to FDIC,  Federal Reserve, and OCC officials, they met together in early 2015 to  discuss CRE lending growth and the rise in bank CRE loan  concentrations and held subsequent meetings throughout the year, in part  to discuss policy options for helping to ensure that banks were  appropriately managing their CRE concentration risks.

For  example, spending on CRE construction projects\u2014a source of demand  for bank financing\u2014has rebounded. Vacancy rates for apartments, office  buildings, and other CRE properties have declined. Similarly, as shown in  figure 2, delinquency and charge-off rates on bank CRE loans have fallen  from their post-crisis peaks and are at or below their lowest levels since  2002. Although these rates provide information on the current  performance of bank CRE loans, they provide little or no information  about potential future risks faced by banks. For example, high-risk loans  made to less creditworthy borrowers could perform well when property  markets and the economy are doing well but may perform poorly when  property markets or the economy begin to slow.", "At the same time, our analyses of other market, underwriting, and lending  data and forecasts from predictive econometric models we developed  suggest that banks\u2019 credit and concentration risks related to their CRE  lending have increased. As shown in figure 3, according to a Federal  Reserve survey, banks lowered their CRE loan underwriting standards\u2014 terms and conditions under which banks extend loans\u2014after the financial  crisis, but more banks began to tighten their underwriting standards since  late 2015. In general, tightening underwriting standards may indicate  that loan officers are reevaluating the degree of risk in CRE markets  served by banks. According to Federal Reserve data, a larger share of  banks has tightened underwriting standards on multifamily properties,  such as apartments.", "CRE property prices, particularly for multifamily properties, have  increased rapidly in recent years, and CRE property valuations have  similarly increased. For example, as shown in figure 4, capitalization rates  (the ratio of income generated by a property to the property\u2019s price) on  CRE properties have trended downward since around 2010\u2014indicating  that borrowers (i.e., property owners) may be earning less of a return on  their CRE properties. Capitalization rates can be indicative of expected  future price changes\u2014for example, low capitalization rates may reflect  expectations of future price increase, but can also be driven by investor  sentiment not associated with fundamental aspects of properties.", "In addition, as shown in figure 5, the number of banks with concentrated  portfolios in CLD or total CRE loans has been gradually increasing since  around 2014. Greater concentrations in a particular lending sector (e.g.,  commercial real estate, residential real estate, or business lending) leave  banks more vulnerable to a sectoral downturn, all else equal.", "To further assess risk in bank CRE lending, we developed and estimated  several predictive models of aggregate losses on bank CRE loans. The  models incorporate measures of CRE property prices, bank lending, and  underwriting standards. The models generally found that, historically,  higher future losses are predicted when CRE lending and prices are  simultaneously high relative to gross domestic product, and when banks  are tightening underwriting standards. Based largely on the simultaneous  increase in bank CRE lending and CRE prices observed over the last  several years, these models suggest that credit risk has increased,  though it remains lower than the level of risk associated with the 2007\u2013 2009 financial crisis. As we noted earlier, high property valuations and  substantial increases in lending can simultaneously weaken collateral  protections and indicate lower borrower quality, both of which can raise  the risk of losses should the economy or CRE sector weaken.

From  2013 through 2016, FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and OCC took formal  enforcement actions against banks for not adequately managing risks  related to their CRE concentrations, including those outlined in the jointly  issued 2006 CRE guidance.", "FDIC took 22 formal enforcement actions against banks for matters  related to their CRE concentrations during this period.", "The Federal Reserve took 2 formal enforcement actions against  banks for matters related to their risk management of CRE lending.", "OCC took 11 formal enforcement actions against banks for matters  related to their CRE concentrations during this same period.", "The majority of these formal enforcement actions discussed the 2006  CRE guidance and directed the banks to improve their practices for  managing their CRE concentration risk. For example, in a number of  formal enforcement actions, the regulators ordered the banks to revise  their written concentration risk management programs for identifying,  monitoring, and controlling risks associated with concentrations of credit,  consistent with the 2006 CRE guidance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and,  OCC for review and comment.

Specifically, we  interviewed officials at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  System (Federal Reserve), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to help  identify potential indicators of risk in CRE markets. To further inform our  assessment of risk, we reviewed prior GAO work on the lessons learned  from prior banking crises and the use of early warning models for  monitoring the financial system. We also reviewed academic research on  early warning models of banking and real estate-related crises.", "To report trends and assess risk, we reviewed and analyzed a range of  data that we considered to be reflective of various aspects of risk in CRE  lending markets. Specifically, we reviewed and analyzed commercial  property vacancy data from REIS (a private commercial real estate data  provider); commercial property construction data from the U.S. Census  Bureau; data on delinquencies and charge-offs on bank CRE loans from  the Federal Reserve; data on commercial property prices and  capitalization rates from Real Capital Analytics (a private commercial real  estate data provider); FDIC data on bank CRE lending; and Federal  Reserve data on underwriting standards. We evaluated trends in these  data and used a subset of these data to estimate several predictive  models of aggregate losses on bank CRE loans. (See app. II for more  information on our predictive models.)", "To examine actions taken by federal regulators to help ensure that banks  with high CRE concentrations are effectively managing the related risks,  we reviewed and analyzed their relevant guidance and regulations on  bank CRE lending, examination policies and procedures (e.g.,  examination manuals and modules), studies and other publications on  risks in the banking industry, and formal enforcement actions taken from  2013 through 2016 for CRE-related matters. In addition, we analyzed  Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income data from SNL Financial  for the period from 2011 through 2016 to calculate banks\u2019 construction  and land development (CLD) and CRE concentrations during the period.  Specifically, we used the concentration formulas in the 2006 CRE  concentration guidance (jointly issued by the federal banking regulators)  to calculate banks\u2019 CLD and CRE concentrations and identify banks  whose CRE concentrations exceeded, in full or in part, the guidance\u2019s  CRE concentration thresholds during part or all of the time frame.  Based  on whether the banks\u2019 CRE concentrations exceeded the thresholds and  other criteria discussed below, we selected a nongeneralizable sample of  40 banks overseen by FDIC, the Federal Reserve, or OCC. For the banks  in our sample, we requested from the regulators copies of the reports of  examination and, if available, related workpapers prepared by the  regulators based on their full-scope examinations of the banks done from  2013 through 2014, and from 2015 through 2016.", "In addition to using banks\u2019 CRE concentrations as a basis to select  examinations, we judgmentally selected a nonprobability sample of banks  based on the following criteria:", "Total asset size: We considered the size of the banks based on their  total assets and selected banks from each of the following three  ranges: (1) banks with $1 billion or more in total assets, (2) banks with  $100 million or more but less than $1 billion in total assets, and (3)  banks with less than $100 million in total assets.", "Primary regulator: We considered the primarily regulator of the  banks and selected a sample of 40 banks that resulted in a total of 20  examinations to review from each regulator.", "Geographic distribution: We selected banks to ensure that at least  one bank was from each of the four regions of the U.S. Census and  each of the nine divisions within those regions.", "Based on the 40 banks we selected, we reviewed and analyzed 54  reports of examination and, if available, the related workpapers. We  analyzed the examinations using criteria or other requirements specified  in the 2006 CRE guidance jointly issued by the regulators and their  examination policies and procedures. We did not review six examinations  of banks supervised by the Federal Reserve. We also interviewed  officials from FDIC, Federal Reserve, and OCC, and from a national  banking association about bank CRE lending and applicable CRE  guidance and requirements.", "For the data we analyzed under both of our objectives, we took a number  of steps to assess the reliability of the data, including interviewing data  providers; corroborating trends across multiple data sources; reviewing  related documentation; inspecting data for missing values, outliers, or  other errors; and reviewing relevant, prior GAO work. We determined that  these data were sufficiently reliable for our reporting objectives.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2017 to March 2018  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: GAO Predictive Models of Aggregate Losses on Bank Commercial Real Estate Loans", "paragraphs": ["We developed and estimated several models of aggregate losses on  bank commercial real estate (CRE) loans. These models attempt to  predict future aggregate charge-offs using contemporary indicators of  potential risks. We incorporated indicators of risk based on the cross- country research literature on early warning models of banking risk and  prior GAO work on identifying early warning models as tools that could  assist financial regulators in assessing risk. One study summarized the  overall intuition for models of this class in the following way: \u201cimbalances  manifest themselves in the coexistence of unusually rapid cumulative  growth in private sector credit and asset prices.\u201d Our results were  consistent with this concept and extend the aggregate early warning  model literature to a sectoral model. As such, our models incorporate  measures of CRE property prices, bank lending volumes, and bank loan  underwriting standards.", "The models predict charge-offs 2\u20133 years into the future (the dependent  variable is the average charge-off rate for 8 through 11 quarters into the  future), using commercial bank charge-off rates from the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), first quarter  1991 to second quarter 2017. (See below for an illustrative regression  equation for one of these models.)", "We began with two model variations, one based on the levels of key  variables and the other based on their growth rates, using the following  independent variables, respectively:  \u201cLevel\u201d model: Level of CRE prices to gross domestic product (GDP),  level of bank CRE lending to GDP, the interaction of the level of CRE  prices and lending, and the net percentage of banks tightening  underwriting standards on CRE loans.  \u201cGrowth\u201d model: Growth rate of CRE prices over the last year, growth  rate of bank CRE lending over the last year, interaction of price and  lending growth, and the net percentage of banks tightening  underwriting standards on CRE loans.", "By inspection, the model based on levels also captured key aspects of  the evolution of aggregate losses on bank CRE loans in recent  decades\u2014for example, low charge-offs prior to the crisis, the rapid  increase during crisis, and very low charge-offs in recent years. In this  model higher losses are predicted by tightening underwriting standards,  and the interaction of (i.e., simultaneous increase in) the level of CRE  prices and the level of CRE lending. The bulk of the explanatory power of  the model appears to come from the interaction of the level of CRE prices  and the level of CRE lending\u2014consistent with Borio and Drehmann\u2019s  view that the coexistence of rapidly increasing credit and prices is  associated with greater risk. These results are also consistent with a  more general theory, for example, that periods of economic stability  induce greater risk-taking over time, bidding up asset prices and  loosening underwriting standards until ultimately increased valuations  become unsustainable, prices fall, and borrowers begin to default.", "We estimated a number of additional models for robustness, to determine  if goodness-of-fit and forecasts could be improved markedly, and to  assess the degree of forecast uncertainty. For example we estimated a  model with a censored dependent variable and used information criteria  to select models that combined elements from our initially separate  models based on growth rates and levels as well as a model that includes  current charge-offs. In figure 7, we report the general trend in expected  future charge-offs as well as convey forecast uncertainty based on  differences in the forecasts of three of these models.", "In figure 8, we convey forecast uncertainty based on the 75 percent  confidence interval for a combined model that we selected based on  information criteria.", "Implicit in this exercise is the assumption that the data-generating  process is reasonably stable\u2014as a result, structural change associated  with new financial products, new risk management tools, and new legal  and regulatory frameworks could reduce the stability of the data- generating process. We interpret our results and forecasts in light of  these potential limitations. Specifically, we do not interpret model results  as concrete, precise predictions of aggregate commercial real estate  losses but rather as an additional, general indication of the degree of risk  in bank CRE lending.", "We mitigate risks associated with estimating this type of model with  appropriate diagnostics, out-of-sample testing, and by developing the  model in the context of the well-established early warning literature. That  said, some inevitable limitations remain, including the potential omission  of important risk factors and other approximations associated with our  specification (e.g., our choice of a linear functional form). In addition,  diagnostics for detecting nonstationary time series are imperfect,  especially with small sample sizes, which may inflate our measures of  statistical significance and traditional goodness-of-fit measures like r- squared. These biases may be present, however, in models that still  generate useful predictions. In this \u201csmall data\u201d context there is also risk  of fitting (or over-fitting) the model to predict a particular credit event\u2014 though, again, this risk is mitigated somewhat in the context of the broad  cross-country early warning literature and the use of out-of-sample  testing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Richard Tsuhara (Assistant  Director), Tarek Mahmassani (Analyst in Charge), Abigail Brown, Tarik  Carter, M\u2019Baye Diagne, Michael Hoffman, Risto Laboski, Marc Molino,  Jessica Sandler, Jennifer Schwartz, and Andrew Stavisky made  significant contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
