They were highly concentrated on the East and West Coasts, especially in California. Federally and state-regulated banks and independent mortgage lenders and brokers market AMPs, which have been used for years as a financial management tool by wealthy and financially sophisticated borrowers. In recent years, however, AMPs have been marketed as an \"affordability\" product to allow borrowers to purchase homes they otherwise might not be able to afford with a conventional fixed-rate mortgage. Because AMP borrowers can defer repayment of principal, and sometimes part of the interest, for several years, they may eventually face payment increases large enough to be described as \"payment shock.\" Mortgage statistics show that lenders offered AMPs to less creditworthy and less wealthy borrowers than in the past. Some of these recent borrowers may have more difficulty refinancing or selling their homes to avoid higher monthly payments, particularly if interest rates have risen or if the equity in their homes fell because they were making only minimum monthly payments or home values did not increase. As a result, delinquencies and defaults could rise. Officials from the federal banking regulators stated that most banks appeared to be managing their credit risk by diversifying their portfolios or through loan sales or securitizations. However, because the monthly payments for most AMPs originated between 2003 and 2005 have not reset to cover both interest and principal, it is too soon to tell to what extent payment shocks would result in increased delinquencies or foreclosures for borrowers and in losses for banks and other lenders. Regulators and others are concerned that borrowers may not be well-informed about the risks of AMPs, due to their complexity and because promotional materials by some lenders and brokers do not provide balanced information on AMPs benefits and risks. Although lenders and certain brokers are required to provide borrowers with written disclosures at loan application and closing, federal standards on these disclosures do not currently require specific information on AMPs that could better help borrowers understand key terms and risks. In December 2005, federal banking regulators issued draft interagency guidance on AMP lending that discussed prudent underwriting, portfolio and risk management, and consumer disclosure practices. Some lenders commented that the recommendations were too prescriptive and could limit consumer choices of mortgages. Consumer advocates expressed concerns about the enforceability of these recommendations because they are presented in guidance and not in regulation. State regulators GAO contacted generally relied on existing regulatory structure of licensing and examining independent mortgage lenders and brokers to oversee AMP lending."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, the residential real estate sector experienced sustained  In recent years, the residential real estate sector experienced sustained  growth in both volume and price.

The funding for mortgages can come from federally or state- chartered banks, mortgage lending subsidiaries of these banks or financial  holding companies, or independent mortgage lenders, which are neither  banks nor affiliates of banks. Mortgage brokers act as intermediaries  between lenders and borrowers, and for a fee, help connect borrowers  with various lenders who may provide a wider selection of mortgage  products. Mortgage lenders may keep the loans that they originated or  purchased from brokers in their portfolios or sell the loans in the  secondary mortgage market. Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs)  or investment banks pool many mortgage loans that lenders sell to the  secondary market, and these lenders or investment banks then sell claims  to these pools to investors as mortgage backed-securities (MBS).", "Lenders consider whether to accept or reject a borrower\u2019s loan application  in a process called underwriting. During underwriting, the lender analyzes  the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the debt. For example, lenders may  determine ability to repay debt by calculating a borrower\u2019s DTI ratio,  which consists of the borrowers\u2019 fixed monthly expenses divided by gross  monthly income. The higher the DTI ratio, the greater the risk the  borrower will have cash-flow problems and miss mortgage payments.  During the underwriting process, lenders usually require documentation of  borrowers\u2019 income and assets. Another important factor lenders consider  during underwriting is the amount of down payment the borrower makes,  which usually is expressed in terms of a LTV ratio (the larger the down  payment, the lower the LTV ratio). The LTV ratio is the loan amount  divided by the lesser of the selling price or appraised value. The lower the  LTV ratio, the smaller the chance that the borrower would default, and the  smaller the loss if the borrower were to default. Additionally, lenders  evaluate the borrowers\u2019 credit history using various measures. One of  these measures is the borrowers\u2019 credit score, which is a numerical  measure or score that is based on an individual\u2019s credit payment history  and outstanding debt. Mortgage loans could be made to prime and  subprime borrowers. Prime borrowers are those with good credit histories  that put them at low risk of default. In contrast, subprime borrowers have  poor or no credit histories, and therefore cannot meet the credit standards  for obtaining a prime loan.", "Chartering agencies oversee federally and state-chartered banks and their  mortgage lending subsidiaries.

As part of their examinations, for example, regulators review  mortgage lending practices, including underwriting, risk management, and  portfolio management practices.

Additionally, they said that other borrowers who  found AMPs suitable included borrowers with irregular earnings who  could take advantage of interest-only or minimum monthly payments  during periods of lower income and could pay down principal and any  deferred interest when they received an increase in income. However,  according to federal banking regulators and a range of industry  participants, as home prices increased rapidly in some areas of the  country, lenders began marketing interest-only and payment-option ARMs  widely as affordability products.

According to industry analysts, as interest rates continued to  rise, by the beginning of 2006, mortgages with adjustable rates no longer  offered the same cost-savings over fixed-rate mortgages, and borrowers  began to shift to fixed-rate products. These analysts reported that in  response to this trend, lenders have begun to market mortgages that are  less sensitive to interest rate increases. For example, interest-only fixed- rate mortgages (interest-only FRMs) offer borrowers interest-only  payments for up to 10 years but at a fixed interest rate over the life of the  loan. Another mortgage that has gained in popularity is the 40-year  mortgage. This product does not allow borrowers to defer interest or  principal, but offers borrowers lower monthly payments than conventional  mortgages. For example, some variations of the 40-year mortgage have a  standard 30-year loan term, but offer lower fixed monthly payments that  are based on a 40-year amortization schedule for part or all of the loan  term.

Specifically, borrowers with interest-only ARMs can make monthly  payments of just interest for the fixed introductory period. Borrowers with  payment-option ARMs typically have four payment options. The first two  options are fully amortizing payments that are based on either a 30-year or  15-year payment schedule. The third option is an interest-only payment,  and the fourth is a minimum payment, which we previously described, that  does not cover all of the interest. The interest that does not get paid gets  capitalized into the loan balance owed, resulting in negative amortization.", "The deferred payments associated with interest-only and payment-option  ARMs will eventually result in higher monthly payments after the  introductory period expires. For example, for interest-only mortgages,  payments will rise at the expiration of the fixed interest-only period to  include repayment of principal. Similarly, when the payment-option period  ends for a payment-option ARM, the monthly payments will adjust to  require an amount sufficient to fully amortize the outstanding loan  balance, including any deferred interest and principal, over the remaining  life or term. Depending on the particular loan product, a combination of  rising interest rates and deferred or negative amortization can raise  monthly payments twofold or more, causing payment shock for those  borrowers who cannot avoid and are not prepared for these larger  payments.", "For example, consider the borrower in the following example who took  out a $400,000 payment-option ARM in April 2004. The borrower\u2019s  payment options for the first year ranged from a minimum payment of  $1,287 to a fully amortizing payment of $2,039.

By year 2, the loan balance increased by $3,299. As interest rates rose, the  amount of deferred interest grew more quickly, reaching $33,446 by the  beginning of year 6. Because the start of year 6 marked the end of the 5- year payment-option period, the loan recast to require fully amortizing  monthly payments of $2,931. This payment represented a 70 percent  increase from the minimum monthly payment required a year earlier and a  128 percent increase from the initial minimum monthly payment in year 1.

This is because lenders have  marketed these products to borrowers who are not as wealthy or  financially sophisticated as previous borrowers, and because rising  interest rates, combined with constraints on the growth in minimum  payments imposed by low teaser rates, have increased the potential for  payment shock. FDIC officials expressed particular concern over  payment-option ARMs, as they are more complex than interest-only  products and have the potential for negative amortization and bigger  payment shocks.", "Mortgage statistics of recently securitized interest-only and payment- option ARMs show a relaxation of underwriting standards regarding credit  history, income, and available assets during the years these products  increased in popularity. According to one investment bank, interest-only  mortgages that were part of subprime securitizations were negligible in  2002, but rose to almost 29 percent of subprime securitizations in 2005.  Lenders also originated payment-option ARMs to borrowers with  increasingly lower credit scores (see table 1). In addition, besides  permitting lower credit scores, lenders increasingly qualified borrowers  with fewer financial resources. For example, lenders allowed higher DTI  ratios for some borrowers and began combining AMPs with \u201cpiggyback\u201d  mortgages\u2014that is, second mortgages that allow borrowers with limited  or no down payments to finance a down payment. As table 1 shows, by  June 2005, 25 percent of securitized payment-option ARMs included  piggyback mortgages\u2014up from zero percent 5 years earlier. Furthermore,  lenders increasingly have qualified borrowers for AMPs under \u201clow  documentation\u201d standards, which allow for less detailed proof of income  or assets than lenders traditionally required.", "Federal banking regulators cautioned that \u201crisk-layering\u201d, which results  from the combination of AMPs with one or more relaxed underwriting  practices could increase the likelihood that some borrowers might not  withstand payment shock and may go into default. In particular, federal  regulatory officials said that some recent AMP borrowers, particularly  those with low income and little equity, may have fewer financial reserves  against financial adversity, which could impact their ability to sustain  future higher monthly payments in the event that they cannot refinance  their mortgages or sell their homes. Although concerns about the effect of  risk-layering exist, OCC officials observed that while underwriting  characteristics for AMPs have trended downward over the past few years,  lenders generally attempt to mitigate the additional credit risk of AMPs  compared to traditional mortgages by having at least one underwriting  criteria (such as LTV ratio, DTI ratio, or loan size) tighter for AMPs than  for a traditional mortgage. In addition, both OCC and Federal Reserve  officials said that most lenders qualify payment-option ARM borrowers at  the fully-indexed rate, and not the teaser rate, suggesting that these  borrowers have the financial resources to either make more than the  minimum monthly payment or to manage any future rise in monthly  payments. However, Federal Reserve officials said that borrowers of  interest-only loans are qualified on the interest-only payment.", "For borrowers who intend to refinance their mortgages to avoid higher  monthly payments, FDIC officials expressed concern that some may face  prepayment penalties that could make refinancing expensive. In  particular, they said that borrowers with payment-option ARMs that  choose the minimum payment option could reach the negative  amortization cap well before the expiration of the five-year payment  option period, triggering a loan recast to fully amortizing payments, the  need to refinance the mortgage, and the imposition of prepayment  penalties.", "Some recent borrowers may find that they do not have sufficient equity in  their homes to refinance or even to sell, particularly if their loans have  negatively amortized or they have borrowed with little or no down  payment. Again, consider the borrower in figure 1. To avoid the increase in  monthly payments when the loan recasts at the end of year 5, the borrower  would either have to refinance the mortgage or sell the home. However,  because the borrower made only minimum payments, the $400,000 debt  would have increased to $433,446. To the extent that the home\u2019s value has  risen faster than the outstanding mortgage, or the borrower contributed a  substantial down payment, the borrower might have enough equity to  obtain refinancing or could sell the house and pay off the loan. However, if  the borrower has little or no equity and home prices remain flat or fall, the  borrower could easily have a mortgage that exceeds the value of his or her  home, thereby making the possibility of refinancing or home sale very  difficult. According to an investment bank, as of July 2006, about 75  percent of payment-option ARMs originated and securitized in 2004 and  2005 were negatively amortizing, meaning that borrowers were making  minimum monthly payments, and more than 70 percent had loan balances  that exceeded the original loan balances.", "Federal Reserve officials also said they are concerned that some recent  borrowers who used AMPs to purchase homes for investment purposes  may be less inclined to avoid defaulting on their loans when faced with  financial distress, on the basis that mortgage delinquency and default rates  are typically higher for these borrowers than for borrowers who use them  to purchase their primary residences. According to these officials,  borrowers who used AMPs for investment purposes may have less  incentive to try to find a way to make their mortgage payments if  confronted with payment shock or difficulties in refinancing or selling,  because they would not lose their primary residence in the event of a  default. According to FDIC officials, this is particularly acute during  instances where the borrower has made little or no down payment.  Although the majority of borrowers used AMPs to purchase their primary  residence, data on recent payment-option ARM securitizations indicate  that 14.4 percent of AMPs originated in 2005 were used by borrowers to  purchase homes for purposes other than use as a primary residence, up  from 5.3 percent in 2000.

Second, they said that most  banks appear to have diversified their assets sufficiently and maintained  adequate capital to manage the credit risk of AMPs held in their portfolios  or have reduced their risk through loan sales and securitizations.  Investment and mortgage banking officials told us that hedge funds, real  estate investment trusts, and foreign investors are among the largest  investors in the riskiest classes of these securities, and that these investors  largely would bear the credit risk from any AMP defaults.", "In addition, several regulatory officials noted borrowers who have turned  to interest-only FRMs are subject to less payment shock than interest-only  and payment-option ARM borrowers. As we previously discussed, interest- only FRMs are not sensitive to interest rate changes. For example, the  amount of the initial interest-only payment and the later fully amortizing  payment are known at the time of loan origination for an interest-only  FRM and do not vary. Furthermore, these products tend to feature a  longer period of introductory payments than did the interest-only and  payment-option ARMs sold earlier, thus giving the borrower more time to  prepare financially for the increase in monthly payments or plan to  refinance or sell.", "Federal regulatory officials and industry participants agree that it is too  soon to tell how many borrowers with AMPs will become delinquent or go  into foreclosure, thereby producing losses for banks that hold AMPs in  their portfolios. Most of the AMPs issued between 2003 and 2005 have not  recast; therefore, most of these borrowers have not yet experienced  payment shock or financial distress. As a result, lenders generally do not  yet have the performance data on delinquencies that would serve as an  indicator of future problems. Furthermore, the credit profile of recent  AMP borrowers is different from that of traditional AMP borrowers,  because it includes less creditworthy and less affluent borrowers.  Consequently, it would be difficult to use past performance data to predict  how many loans would be refinanced before payment shock sets in and  how many delinquencies and foreclosures could result for those  borrowers who cannot sustain larger monthly payments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Regulators and Others Are Concerned That Borrowers May Not Be Well-informed About the Risks of AMPs", "paragraphs": ["The information that borrowers receive about their loans through  advertisements and disclosures may not fully or effectively inform them  about the risk of AMPs.

As AMPs are more complex than conventional mortgage products and  advertisements may not provide borrowers with balanced information on  these products, it is important that written disclosures provide borrowers  with clear and comprehensive information about the key terms,  conditions, and costs of these mortgages to help them make an informed  decision. That information is conveyed both through content and  presentation, including writing style and design. With respect to content,  Regulation Z, which includes requirements for mortgage disclosures,  requires all creditors (lenders and those brokers that close loans in their  own name) to provide borrowers with information about their ARM  products. However, these requirements are not designed to address more  complex products such as AMPs. The Federal Reserve has recently  initiated a review of Regulation Z that will include reviewing the  disclosures required for all mortgage loans, including AMPs. For  presentation, current guidance available in the federal government  suggests good practices on developing disclosures that effectively  communicate key information on financial products. Most of the AMP  disclosures we reviewed did not always fully or effectively explain the  risks of payment shock or negative amortization for these products and  lacked information on some important loan features, both because  Regulation Z currently does not require lenders to tailor this information  to AMPs and because lenders do not always follow leading practices for  writing disclosures that are clear, concise, and user-friendly. According to  Federal Reserve officials, revising Regulation Z to require better  disclosures of the key terms and risks of AMPs could increase borrower  understanding of these complex mortgage products, particularly if a  broader effort were made to simplify and clarify mortgage disclosures  generally.

These concerns have been heightened as  advertisements by some lenders and brokers emphasize the benefits of  AMPs without explaining the associated risks. For example, one print  advertisement for a payment-option ARM product we obtained stated on  the first page that the loan \u201cstarted\u201d at an interest rate of 1.25 percent,  promised a reduction in the homeowner\u2019s monthly mortgage payment of  up to 45 percent, and offered three low monthly payment options.  However, the lender noted in much smaller print on the second page that  the 1.25 percent interest rate applied only to the first month of the loan  and could increase or decrease on a monthly basis thereafter. Federal  regulatory officials said that less financially sophisticated borrowers might  be drawn to the promise of initial low monthly payments and flexible  payment options and may not realize the potential for substantial  increases in monthly payments and loan balance later.", "Officials from three of the eight states we contacted reported similar  concerns with AMP advertising distributed by the nonbank lenders and  independent brokers under their supervision.

Regulatory officials in Alaska told us some  advertisements circulating in their state stated that consumers could save  money by using interest-only products, without disclosing that over time  these loans might cost more than a conventional product. In some cases,  the advertisements were potentially misleading. For example, New Jersey  officials provided us with a copy of an AMP advertisement that promised  potential borrowers low monthly payments by suggesting that the teaser  rate (termed \u201cpayment rate\u201d in the advertisement) on a payment-option  ARM product was the actual interest rate for the full term of the loan (see  figure 2). The officials also said that advertising a rate other than the  annual percentage rate (APR), without also including the APR (as seen in  the advertisement shown in fig. 2) is contrary to the requirements of  Regulation Z.", "Industry representatives also expressed concerns about AMP advertising.

The study was  based, in part, on data obtained from the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2001 Survey of  Consumer Finances, which included questions for consumers on the  terms of their ARMs. While most homeowners reported knowing their  broad mortgage terms reasonably well, some borrowers with ARMs,  particularly those from households with lower income and less education,  appeared to underestimate the amount by which their interest rates, and  thus their monthly payments, could change. The authors suggested that  this underestimation might be explained, in part, by borrower confusion  about the terms of their mortgages.

In addition, the Federal Reserve has  begun taking steps to consider revisions that would specifically address  AMPs. During the summer of 2006, the Federal Reserve held a series of  four hearings across the country on home-equity lending. Federal  Reserve officials said that a major focus of these hearings was on AMPs,  including the adequacy of consumer disclosures for these products, how  consumers shop for home-secured loans, and how to design more effective  disclosures. According to these officials, they are currently reviewing the  hearing transcripts and public comment letters as a first step in developing  plans and recommendations for revising Regulation Z.

As required by Regulation Z, all of the disclosures explained  that the product allowed for negative amortization and described how.  However, the disclosures we reviewed did not always clearly or  completely explain the harmful effects that could result from negative  amortization. In the example above, where the disclosure did link an  increased loan balance with payment shock, the effectiveness of the  statement is blunted because it does not tell the borrower early on how  the loan balance could rise.

First, when the mortgage product features  an adjustable rate, Regulation Z requires lenders to (1) include a payment  schedule and (2) assume that no changes occur in the underlying index  over the life of the loan.

Regulation Z only requires  lenders to remind borrowers in the transaction-specific disclosure that the  loan has an adjustable rate and refer them to previously provided  adjustable-rate disclosures (see fig. 4); therefore, borrowers might not  understand that the payment schedule is not representative of their  payments in a changing interest rate environment. Figure 4 shows the  payment schedule for a 5-year payment-option ARM originated in 2005.  The first 5 years show the minimum monthly payments increasing to  reflect the difference between the teaser rate and the initial fully-indexed  interest rate, but the amount of the increase is constrained each year by  the payment reset cap in effect for the loan.

The draft guidance also  notes increased risk to lenders associated with combining AMPs with risk- layering features, such as reduced documentation or the use of piggyback  loans. In such cases, the draft guidance recommends that lenders look for  off-setting factors, such as higher credit scores or lower LTV ratios to  mitigate the additional risk. Furthermore, the draft guidance recommends  that lenders avoid using loan terms and underwriting practices that may  cause borrowers to rely on the eventual sale or refinancing of their  mortgages once full amortization begins.", "To manage risk associated with AMP lending, the draft guidance  recommends lenders develop written policies and procedures that  describe AMP portfolio limits, mortgage sales and securitization practices,  and risk-management expectations. The policies and procedures also  should establish performance measures and management reporting  systems that provide early warning of portfolio deterioration and  increased risk.

Other  financial institutions said that the recommendations regarding borrower  qualification and general underwriting practices were too prescriptive and  would have the effect of reducing mortgage choice for consumers.", "Consumer advocates supported the need for additional consumer  protections relating to AMP products, but several questioned whether the  draft guidance would add needed protections. They also contended, as did  lenders, that since the draft guidance applies only to federally regulated  institutions, independent lenders and brokers would not be subject to  recommendations aimed at informing and protecting consumers. One  advocacy organization said that the proposed guidance is only a  recommendation by the agencies regulating some lenders, and that failure  to follow the guidance neither leads to any enforceable sanctions nor  provides a means of using guidance to obtain relief for a harmed  consumer. Although not in a comment letter, another advocate echoed  these concerns by saying the draft guidance would not expand consumer  protections because it neither requires revisions to mortgage disclosures,  nor allows consumers to enforce the application of guidance standards to  individual lenders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Officials Reinforced Their Messages by Publicizing Their Concerns, Highlighting AMP Risks, and Taking Other Actions", "paragraphs": ["Although the draft interagency guidance has not been finalized, officials  from the Federal Reserve, OCC, OTS, FDIC, and NCUA have reinforced  messages regarding AMP risks and appropriate lending practices by  publicizing their concerns in speeches, at conferences, and the media.

For instance, FDIC developed a review program to identify  high-risk lending areas, adjust supervision according to product risk levels,  and evaluate risk management and underwriting approaches. OTS staff has  performed a review of its 68 most active AMP lenders to assess and  respond to potential AMP lending risks while the Federal Reserve and  OCC have begun to conduct reviews of their lenders\u2019 AMP promotional  and marketing materials to assess how well they inform consumers. As  discussed earlier, the Federal Reserve has taken several steps to address  consumer protection issues associated with AMPs, including initiating a  review of Regulation Z that includes reviewing the disclosures required for  all mortgage loans and holding public hearings that in part explored the  adequacy and effectiveness of AMP disclosures. In addition, NCUA  officials told us they informally contacted the largest credit unions under  their supervision to assess the extent of AMP lending at these institutions.", "FTC also directed some attention to consumer protection issues related to  AMPs. In 2004, it charged a California mortgage broker with misleading  AMP consumers by making advertisements that contained allegedly false  promises of fixed interest rates and fixed payments for variable rate  payment option mortgages. As a result of FTC\u2019s actions, a U.S. district  court judge issued a preliminary injunction barring the broker\u2019s allegedly  illegal business practices. More recently in May 2006, FTC sponsored a  public workshop that explored consumer protection issues as a result of  AMP growth in the mortgage marketplace.

For example, many officials questioned (1) how well  consumers understood complex AMP loans, and therefore, how  susceptible consumers with AMPs therefore might be to payment shock  and (2) how likely consumers would then be to experience financial  difficulties in meeting their mortgage payments. Some state officials also  said that increased AMP borrowing heightened their concern about  mortgage default and foreclosure, and some officials expressed concern  about unscrupulous lender or broker operations and the extent to which  these entities met state licensing and operations requirements. In addition  to these general consumer protection concerns, some state officials spoke  about state-specific issues. For example, Ohio officials put AMP concerns  in the context of larger economic issues and said AMP mortgages were  part of wider economic challenges facing the state, including an already- high rate of mortgage foreclosures and the loss of manufacturing jobs that  hurt both Ohio\u2019s consumers and the overall economy. Officials from  another state, Nevada, said they worried that lenders and brokers  sometimes took advantage of senior citizens by offering them AMP loans  that they either did not need or could not afford.", "State banking and financial regulatory officials expressed concerns about  the extent to which consumers understood AMPs and that potential for  those who used them to experience monthly mortgage payment increases.  Some state officials said that current federal disclosures were  complicated, difficult to comprehend, and often did not provide  information that could help consumers.

Most of the state officials from our sample suggested they  primarily used their own state laws and regulations to license mortgage  lenders and brokers and to ensure that these entities met minimum  experience and operations standards. While these were not AMP-specific  actions, several state officials told us these actions help ensure that  lenders had the proper experience and other qualifications to operate  within the mortgage industry. Some officials told us that these  requirements also helped ensure that those with criminal records or  histories of unscrupulous mortgage behavior would not continue to harm  consumers. Some state officials said that they were particularly sensitive  to AMP lenders\u2019 records of behavior because of the higher risks these  products entailed for consumers.", "However, Alaska provided an exception. Alaska had not specifically  responded to AMP lending and Alaska officials noted that the state does  not have statutes or regulations that govern mortgage lending, nor are  mortgage lenders or brokers required to be licensed to make loans.", "Many of the state banking and financial regulatory officials we contacted  also told us that they periodically examine AMP lenders and brokers for  compliance with state licensing, mortgage lending, and general consumer  protection laws, including applicable fair advertising requirements.  Because state officials perform examinations for all licensed lenders and  brokers, these regulatory processes also are not AMP-specific. However,  some state officials said they were particularly aware of AMP risks to  consumers and had begun to pay more attention to potential lender,  broker, and consumer issues during their oversight reviews. For example,  because AMP lending heightens potential risks for consumers, several  state officials said they had taken extra care during their licensing and  examination reviews to review lender and broker qualifications and loan  files.", "A few states had worked outside of the existing licensing and examination  framework to identify AMP issues and protect consumers. Officials from  several states said that because they did not collect data on AMP loans and  borrowers, they did not fully understand the level and types of AMP  lending in their states. However, two states from our sample had begun to  gather AMP data to improve their information on AMP lending. New Jersey  conducted a mortgage lending survey among its state-chartered banks that  specifically collected data on interest-only and payment-option mortgages,  while Nevada implemented annual reporting requirements for lenders and  brokers on the types of loans they originate. New Jersey and Nevada  officials told us that these efforts would provide an overview of AMP  lending in each state and would serve to help identify emerging AMP  issues.", "Other states reacted by focusing on consumer protection or using  guidance for independent lenders and mortgage brokers. Ohio addressed  mortgage issues, including AMP concerns, by working to improve its  consumer protection law. This law originally did not cover mortgage  lenders and brokers, but was amended to include protections found in  other states. As of June 2006, officials drafted and passed legislation to  expand the law\u2019s provisions to cover these entities and require lenders and  brokers to meet fiduciary standards to offer loans that serve the interest of  potential borrowers. Officials from another state in our sample, New York,  said they planned to use guidance developed by the Conference of State  Bank Supervisors and American Association of Residential Mortgage  Regulators to address AMP lending concerns at the state level.

In recent years, federally and state-regulated  lenders and brokers widely marketed AMPs by touting their low initial  payments and flexible payment options, which helped borrowers to  purchase homes for which they might not have been able to qualify with a  conventional fixed-rate mortgage, particularly in some high-priced  markets. However, the growing use of these products, especially by less  informed, affluent, and creditworthy borrowers, raises concerns about  borrowers\u2019 ability to sustain their monthly mortgage payments, and  ultimately to keep their homes. When these mortgages recast and  payments increase, borrowers who cannot refinance their mortgages or  sell their homes could face substantially higher payments. If these  borrowers cannot make these payments, they could face financial distress;  delinquency; and possibly, foreclosure. Nevertheless, it is too soon to tell  the extent to which payment shock will produce financial distress for  borrowers and induce defaults that would affect banks that hold AMPs in  their portfolios.", "Federal banking regulators have taken steps to address the potential risks  of AMPs to lenders and borrowers. They have drafted guidance for lenders  to strengthen underwriting standards and improve disclosure of  information to borrowers. Because the key features and terms of AMPs  may continue to evolve, it is essential for the regulators to make an effort  to respond to AMP lending growth in ways that seek to balance market  innovation and profitability for lenders with timely information and  mortgage choices for borrowers. Furthermore, with the continued  popularity of AMPs, it is important that the federal banking regulators  finalize the draft guidance in a timely manner.", "The popularity and complexity of AMPs and lenders\u2019 marketing of these  products highlight the importance of mortgage disclosures in helping  borrowers make informed mortgage decisions. As lenders and brokers  increasingly market AMPs to a wider spectrum of borrowers, more  borrowers may struggle to fully understand the terms and risks of these  products. While Regulation Z requires that lenders provide certain  information on ARMs, currently lenders are not required to tailor the  mortgage disclosures to communicate to borrowers information on the  potential for payment shock and negative amortization specific to AMPs.  In particular, although they may be in compliance with Regulation Z  requirements, the disclosures we reviewed did not provide borrowers with  easily comprehensible information on the key features and risks of their  mortgage products. Furthermore, the readability and usability of these  documents were limited by the use of language that was too complex for  many adults and document designs that made the text difficult to read and  understand. As such, these documents were not consistent with leading  practices at the federal level for financial-product disclosures that are  predicated on investment firms\u2019 providing investors with important  product information clearly to further their informed decision making.  Although the draft interagency guidance by federal banking regulators  addressed some of the concerns with consumer disclosures, the draft  guidance focuses on promotional materials, not the written disclosures  required by Regulation Z at loan application and closing. In addition, the  guidance does not apply to nonbank lenders, whereas Regulation Z applies  to the entire industry. We recognize that the Federal Reserve has begun to  review disclosure requirements for all mortgage loans, including AMPs,  under Regulation Z and has used the recent HOEPA hearings to gather  public testimony on the effectiveness of current AMP disclosures.  Furthermore, we agree with regulators and industry participants\u2019 views  that revising Regulation Z to make federally required mortgage disclosures  more useful for borrowers that use complex products like AMPs is a good  first step to addressing a mortgage disclosure process that many view as  overwhelming and confusing for the average borrower.

In response to our recommendation to consider  improving the clarity and comprehensiveness of AMP disclosures, the  Federal Reserve noted that it plans to conduct consumer testing to  determine what information is important to consumers, what language and  formats work best, and how disclosures can be revised to reduce  complexity and information overload. To that end, the Federal Reserve  said that it will use design consultants to assist in developing model  disclosures that are most likely to be effective in communicating  information to consumers.

We  generally selected states that 1) exhibited high volumes of AMP lending, 2)  provided geographic diversity of state locations, and 3) provided diverse  regulatory records when responding to the challenges of a growing AMP  market. Because state-level data on AMP lending volumes were not  available, we determined which states had high volumes of AMP lending  by using data obtained from a Federal Reserve Bank on states that had  high levels of ARM growth and house price appreciation in 2005, factors  which this study suggested corresponded with high volumes of AMP  lending. Furthermore, we reviewed regulatory data showing that the  largest AMP lenders conducted most of their lending in these states. We  selected eight states and conducted in-person interviews with officials  from California, New Jersey, New York, and Ohio. We conducted  telephone interviews with officials from the remainder of the sample  states (Alaska, Florida, Nevada, and North Carolina).", "We also analyzed for content, readability, and usability a selected sample  of eight written disclosures that six federally regulated AMP lenders  provided to borrowers between 2004 and 2006.

The six lenders represented over 25 percent  of the interest-only and payment-option ARMs produced in the first 9  months of 2005. First, we assessed the extent to which the disclosures  described the key risks and loan features of interest-only and payment- option ARMs. Second, we conducted a readability assessment of these  disclosures using computer-facilitated formulas to predict the grade level  required to understand the materials. Readability formulas measure the  elements of writing that can be subjected to mathematical calculation,  such as the average number of syllables in words or number of words in  sentences in the text. We applied the following commercially available  formulas to the documents: Flesch Grade Level, Frequency of  Gobbledygook (FOG), and Simplified Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG).  Using these formulas, we measured the grade levels at which the  disclosure documents were written for selected sections. Third, we  conducted an evaluation that assessed how well these AMP disclosures  adhered to leading practices in the federal government for usability.

This difficulty was compounded by the use of fully  justified text\u2014that is, text where both the left and right edges are even\u2014in  half of the disclosure documents.
