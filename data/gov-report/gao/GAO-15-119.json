The Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) fraud estimates met several GAO Cost Guide best practices, such as documenting data sources and detailing calculations.

Best practices suggest that agencies assess the effects of assumptions and potential errors on estimates. Officials said they did not assess the estimates' level of uncertainty because of resource constraints and methodological challenges. Because making different assumptions could affect IDT fraud estimates by billions of dollars, a point estimate (as opposed to, for example, a range) could lead to different decisions about allocating IDT resources. Reporting the uncertainty that is already known from IRS analysis (and conducting further analyses when not cost prohibitive) might help IRS communicate IDT refund fraud's inherent complexity.", "While IRS's fraud estimates note the relevant cost assumptions used to develop estimates, they do not provide the rationale or analysis to support them.

IRS recently created a group aimed at centralizing several prior ad hoc efforts to authenticate taxpayers across its systems. IRS's planning documentation contains goals and short- and long-term priorities (including implementation plans). However, a commitment to cost, benefit and risk analysis is not documented in the group's short- and long-term priorities. The draft planning documentation makes no mention of where such analyses would be included in IRS's priorities. Office of Management and Budget guidance states that agencies should use cost-benefit analyses that consider alternatives to promote efficient resource allocation and that agencies should ensure that authentication processes provide the appropriate level of assurance by assessing risks. Without analysis of costs, benefits and risks, IRS and Congress will not have quantitative information that could inform decisions about whether and how much to invest in the various authentication options. Cost, benefit and risk estimates for authentication would have the additional benefit of allowing comparisons with other options for combating IDT refund fraud. IDT options could have significant costs for taxpayers and IRS, so more information about the tradeoffs would help inform IRS and congressional decision making."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends IRS improve its fraud estimates by (1) reporting the inherent imprecision and uncertainty of estimates, and (2) documenting the underlying analysis justifying cost-influencing assumptions.

IRS has enhanced its  authentication efforts to combat IDT refund fraud. For example, IRS  provides IP PINs to past IDT victims who have confirmed their identities  with IRS. IP PINs help prevent future IDT refund fraud because, once  issued, the IP PIN must accompany an electronically filed (e-file) tax  return. In addition, IRS conducts authentication checks on returns flagged by IDT and fraud filters. If flagged, IRS stops processing the  return and sends a letter asking the taxpayer to confirm his or her identity.  IRS then confirms the taxpayer\u2019s identity by asking for personal  information, such as the taxpayer\u2019s previous addresses, mortgage lender,  and family members.", "Taxpayer Alerts.

IRS also finds IDT refund fraud as part of  the Automated Underreporter (AUR) program, which matches tax return  data to information returns, such as the W-2. These information returns  are provided by third parties such as employers, financial institutions, and  others. In many cases, IRS does not receive the information returns until  well after the tax return and refund are processed (bottom of figure 1). In  these types of cases, the legitimate taxpayer may not be aware of a  stolen identity until after receiving a notice indicating that the income (or  payment information) IRS has on file does not match the information  reported on the tax return. We previously found that these post-refund  compliance checks can take a year or more to complete, which can be a  burden to taxpayers who receive a notice.
