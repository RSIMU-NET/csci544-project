Over the last decade, the number of IU beneficiaries and benefit costs have more than tripled. In 2005, about 220,000 veterans received an estimated $3.1 billion in IU benefits. In response to a congressional request, GAO assessed VA's management of IU benefits. This report (1) examines the added value of IU benefits for veterans of selected ages and disability ratings, (2) assesses the criteria, guidance, and procedures used for initial decision making, (3) assesses VA's ongoing eligibility enforcement procedures, and (4) compares VA's decision-making and enforcement procedures with those used by other disability programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Under VA's disability compensation program, VA can award IU benefits (that is, total disability compensation) to veterans of any age who cannot work because of service-connected disabilities even though VA did not rate their impairments at the total disability level. The added value of IU benefits over a veteran's lifetime depends upon the veteran's level of impairment at the time he or she begins receiving IU benefits and the length of time these benefits are received. To illustrate the potential amount of IU benefits that could be received, GAO estimated the lifetime present value of the added benefits in disability compensation for veterans with different impairment levels who began receipt of IU benefits in 2005 at different ages. GAO found that the lifetime present value of these benefits can range from about $300,000 to over $460,000 for veterans age 20 in 2005, and about $89,000 to about $142,000 for veterans age 75 in 2005. GAO also found that just under half (45.6 percent) of new IU beneficiaries was awarded IU benefits at the age of 60 or older, and 19.2 percent were age 75 or older. VA's criteria, guidance, and procedures for awarding IU benefits do not ensure that its IU decisions are well supported. VA regulations and guidelines lack key criteria and guidance that are needed to determine unemployability. VA guidelines also do not give rating specialists the procedures to obtain the employment history and vocational assessments needed to support IU decisions. As a result, some VA staff told us that IU benefits have been granted to some veterans with employment potential. In addition, VA's process for ensuring the ongoing eligibility of IU beneficiaries is inefficient and ineffective. This enforcement process relies on old data, outdated, time-consuming manual procedures, insufficient guidance, and weak eligibility criteria. Moreover, the agency does not track and review its enforcement activities to better ensure their effectiveness. VA is among the federal disability programs GAO has identified as high risk and in need of modernization, in part, because it is poorly positioned to provide meaningful and timely support to help veterans with disabilities return to work. Specifically, VA's compensation program does not reflect the current state of science, technology, medicine, and the labor market. VA's management of IU benefits exemplifies these problems because its practices lag behind those of other disability programs. Approaches from other disability programs demonstrate the importance of providing return-to-work services and using vocational expertise to assess the claimant's condition and provide the appropriate services. Incorporating return-to-work practices in IU decision making could help VA modernize its disability program to enable veterans to realize their full potential without jeopardizing the availability of benefits for veterans who cannot work."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) manages a range of benefit  programs that, among other things, compensate veterans for disabilities  incurred or aggravated during active military service. Military personnel in  combat are now surviving injuries that would have been fatal in past  conflicts, but along with this survival has come an increased rate of  disabilities. With the continuing deployment of our military forces to  armed conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and the use of military personnel  in other efforts involving fighting terrorism and national preparedness, the  effective and efficient management of VA\u2019s disability programs is of  paramount importance. The largest of these programs is the Disability  Compensation program, which as of September 2005, paid an estimated  $29 billion in benefits to 2.6 million veterans in compensation for lost  earning capacity due to service-connected disabilities. Through this  program, VA provides benefits to veterans in accordance with a Schedule  for Rating Disabilities that categorizes disabilities on a scale ranging from  0 percent to 100 percent (in increments of 10 percentage points), which is  intended to equate to the average loss in earning capacity resulting from  the service-connected disability. Under VA\u2019s regulations governing  Individual Unemployability (IU), VA can grant total disability  compensation benefits at the 100-percent level to veterans of any age  whose service-connected disabilities are rated at 60 percent or higher and  have caused them to be unemployable. Although disability compensation  benefits are provided to veterans regardless of their income, VA places an  earnings limit on the continued receipt of IU benefits. This limit applies  only to the veteran\u2019s earnings, and not to the veteran\u2019s unearned income or  household income. Managing IU benefits involves not only assessing initial  eligibility for benefits, but also ensuring beneficiaries\u2019 ongoing eligibility  by identifying those who are not in compliance with the earnings limit.", "VA has experienced a marked increase in IU beneficiaries and  expenditures at a time when advances in medicine and technology, along  with labor market changes, have provided greater opportunity for people  with disabilities to seek and maintain employment. This trend has caused  concern among Members of Congress about VA\u2019s management of IU  benefits. Our analysis of VA data shows that the number of IU  beneficiaries and payments has more than tripled since the mid-1990s.  From September 1996 to September 2005, the number of veterans  receiving IU benefits has increased from about 71,000 to about 220,000.  Moreover, we estimated that IU benefit payments from 1996 to 2005 have  grown from about $857 million to $3.1 billion. In September 2005, nearly  half of all veterans receiving disability compensation who were rated  between 60 percent and 90 percent received IU benefits. (See app. I for a  discussion of our estimation methods and figures showing IU beneficiaries  and expenditures over the last decade.)", "This report continues GAO\u2019s long-standing reviews of VA and other federal  disability programs. In January 2003, GAO determined that federal  disability programs, including those of VA, were in urgent need of  attention and transformation, and placed the modernization of federal  disability programs on its high-risk list. With regard to VA, we have  reported that the agency\u2019s Disability Compensation program has struggled  to make timely and accurate decisions and that the program does not  reflect the current state of science, technology, medicine, and the labor  market. Over the last 2 decades, GAO, the VA Inspector General, and the  United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, have raised a number  of concerns about VA\u2019s management of IU benefits, including problems  with both the decision-making process and enforcement procedures. Many  of these problems remain to be addressed. You asked us to examine the  criteria VA uses in determining initial eligibility for IU benefits and VA\u2019s  efforts to enforce ongoing eligibility. In response to your request, this  report (1) examines the potential added value of IU benefits over a lifetime  for veterans of selected ages and disability ratings, (2) assesses the extent  to which VA has the decision-making criteria, guidance, and procedures to  ensure its IU decisions are well supported, (3) assesses the extent to  which VA has efficient and effective enforcement procedures, and (4)  compares decision-making and enforcement procedures used by other  disability programs with VA\u2019s procedures.", "To examine the potential added value of IU benefits, we estimated lifetime  present value of IU benefits for veterans of various ages with disability  ratings between 60 percent and 90 percent. (See app. II for more  information on our methods.) To assess VA\u2019s IU decision-making criteria  and processes, we reviewed agency regulations and guidance, GAO  reports, Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims decisions, VA Inspector  General reports, and VA\u2019s 2001 proposal to revise the regulations  governing IU decision making. Additionally, we interviewed officials from  VA\u2019s Compensation and Pension Service central office, Vocational  Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) Service, and Veterans Health  Administration (VHA). We visited four VA regional offices, where we  interviewed officials and reviewed a small number of case files for  veterans who had been awarded IU benefits to improve our understanding  of the IU decision-making process. We also discussed the provision of IU  benefits with officials of several veterans service organizations. To assess  VA\u2019s procedures for the enforcement of the IU earnings limit, we reviewed  VA regulations and policies, and other agency documents. We also  performed work at the agency\u2019s Compensation and Pension Service  central office, Hines Information Technology Center, Pension Maintenance  Centers, and the four regional offices we visited. In addition, we  interviewed information technology staff from the Social Security  Administration (SSA) who were responsible for conducting the computer  match of VA records and SSA earnings data. To compare VA\u2019s procedures  with those of other disability programs, we reviewed disability programs  administered by SSA and private-sector long-term disability insurers. For  information on decision making in other programs, we relied primarily on  prior GAO reports, but also supplemented this information with interviews  with relevant officials to ensure our information was current. We also  interviewed SSA officials to gain more information about SSA\u2019s own  enforcement activities. In addition, because several agencies use the  National Directory of New Hires (NDNH) to enforce earnings limits in  their programs, we interviewed officials in the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS) regarding access to and the reliability of NDNH  data, which contains information on quarterly wages, new hires, and  unemployment insurance compensation.

Specifically, VA will consider a veteran for  IU benefits if the veteran has a single disability rated at least 60 percent or  multiple disabilities rated at least 70 percent (with at least one disability  rated at 40 percent or more) and there is some evidence that the veteran  cannot work. In some instances, veterans with lower ratings may also be  evaluated for and granted IU eligibility.", "As shown on table 1, veterans receiving an IU total disability  compensation rate may receive substantially greater benefits than they  would have received based on their schedular rating. IU benefits, like  other VA disability compensation benefits, are exempt from federal  taxation.", "VA created IU benefits in 1934. By statute, VA is required to adopt and  apply a schedule of ratings to compensate veterans for reductions in  average earning capacities resulting from service-connected medical  conditions. This statute calls for compensation benefits to be tied to a  schedule of ratings that is to be based, \u201cas far as practicable,\u201d upon the  average impairments of earning capacity resulting from such injuries in  civil occupations. The statute does not mention individual  unemployability as a basis for granting benefits. However, VA regulations  allow the agency to grant total (100 percent) disability compensation to a  veteran who is unemployable due to his or her service-connected  disabilities, but does not meet the requirements for a total disability using  the rating schedule. Veterans can receive IU benefits when their service- connected disabilities result in their inability to obtain or retain  \u201csubstantially gainful employment,\u201d which VA defines as employment that  is \u201cordinarily followed by  to earn their  livelihood with earnings common to the particular occupation in the  community where the veteran resides.\u201d"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "VA\u2019s Process for Making IU Decisions and Enforcing Compliance with Its Earnings Limit", "paragraphs": ["Staff at VA\u2019s 57 regional offices make virtually all eligibility decisions for  VA disability compensation benefits, including IU benefits. These regional  offices employ non-medical rating specialists to evaluate veterans\u2019  eligibility for these benefits. Upon receipt of an application for  compensation benefits, the rating specialist would typically refer the  veteran to a VA medical center or clinic for an examination. Based on the  medical examination and other available information, the rating specialist  must first determine which of the veteran\u2019s conditions are (or are not)  service-connected. For service-connected conditions, the rating specialist  compares the diagnosis with the rating schedule to assign a disability  rating. (App. III provides examples of selected impairments from VA\u2019s  disability rating schedule.) As figure 1 shows, the service-connected  impairments of IU beneficiaries include a wide range of medical  conditions. Multiple disabilities will result in a combined degree of  disability, which is expressed as a percentage and represents the overall  effect on a veteran of all his or her service-connected disabilities. (App. IV  explains VA\u2019s process for compiling combined ratings.) VA\u2019s IU  determinations are subject to appeal to the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals and  subsequently the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.", "VA rating specialists initiate IU evaluations when a veteran submits an  application for IU benefits or his or her application for compensation  benefits contains evidence of unemployability. In all cases, before  granting benefits, rating specialists must evaluate the impact that the  veteran\u2019s service-connected disability has had on his or her ability to  perform substantially gainful employment, which for decision-making  purposes is generally interpreted as employment that is more than  \u201cmarginal employment.\u201d VA generally defines marginal employment as  employment for which the worker\u2019s annual earned income is at or below  the poverty threshold for one person established by the U.S. Census  Bureau\u2014$10,160 for 2005. However, marginal employment may also be  held to exist, on a case by case basis, when a veteran maintaining  employment at a sheltered workshop or family business receives annual  earnings above the poverty threshold. VA rating specialists are to rely on  various sources of information for the evidence needed to support such a  determination, including an employment and earnings history furnished by  the claimant, basic employment information from the claimant\u2019s  employers (if any), and a medical exam report from VHA. If the claimant  had received vocational rehabilitation assistance from VA or disability  benefits from SSA, the rating specialist might also seek information on  these services or benefit decisions. Finally, under its regulations, VA  rating specialists are not to consider age as a factor in determining  eligibility for IU benefits; thus, veterans of any age may be determined  eligible for IU benefits.", "When we analyzed VA data to determine the ages of all veterans receiving  IU benefits as of October 2005, we found that the majority of veterans  receiving IU benefits were age 60 or older. Our analysis of VA data shows  that 219,725 veterans were receiving IU benefits in October 2005.

We found that VA did not require sufficient medical and  vocational evaluation of IU claimants to support award decisions. To  address this weakness, we recommended that, in cases involving IU  benefits, VA ensure that its (1) examining physicians provide observations  on how the service-connected medical condition impairs the veteran\u2019s  functional capabilities and (2) vocational counselors provide vocational  information, including an assessment of how the veteran\u2019s service- connected condition affects job skills and employment potential.  Furthermore, we identified potential overpayments to IU beneficiaries and  suggested that the Congress provide VA with access to Internal Revenue  Service (IRS) earnings information to monitor IU eligibility and help detect  and prevent overpayments. Since we made the recommendations, the  Congress provided the agency with access to IRS earnings data, which the  agency is using to monitor compliance with the ongoing earnings limit.  However, to date, VA has not implemented our recommendation that its  vocational counselors assess the veteran\u2019s job skills and employment  potential so that this information could be used in the IU decision-making  process.", "More recently, two studies highlighted the need for fundamental changes  to VA\u2019s disability decision making. In 2004, the VA Vocational  Rehabilitation and Employment Task Force study recommended that  vocational professionals from VA\u2019s VR&E should provide more complete  vocational assessments to assist in disability and vocational decisions.  More specifically, the task force recommended that VR&E perform a  functional capacity evaluation that would identify what work a veteran  could do in the paid economy despite his or her disabilities. Also, a 2005  VA Inspector General study pointed to the need for improved IU initial and  ongoing eligibility determinations. The VA Inspector General found that  some veterans receiving IU benefits may not have been entitled because  VA had not aggressively used IRS and SSA records and developed proper  controls to monitor their income through the verification process.", "In addition, the Veterans\u2019 Disability Benefits Commission was created by  the National Defense Authorization Act of 2004 (Pub. L. No. 108-136) to  independently evaluate compensation to veterans and their survivors for  disabilities and deaths attributable to military service.

In particular, awarding IU benefits  increases a veteran\u2019s monthly disability compensation. The increase in the  monthly compensation for IU beneficiaries is the difference between the  compensation at the veteran\u2019s schedular rate and the compensation at the  100-percent rate. For example, a schedular rating of 60 percent would  entitle a veteran to $839 per month in 2005. The veteran, however, would  be entitled to $2,299 per month if granted IU benefits\u2014a difference of  $1,460 per month or $17,520 per year. The lower the veteran\u2019s schedular  rating, the higher his or her increase in monthly disability compensation  when awarded IU benefits.", "When the present value of IU benefits is considered over a veteran\u2019s  lifetime, the value of these added benefits depends upon the veteran\u2019s  schedular rating at the time he or she begins receiving IU benefits and the  length of time these benefits are received. To illustrate the potential  amount of added benefits that could be received due to IU, we estimated  the lifetime present value of the increase in disability compensation  benefits for veterans with schedular disability ratings between 60 and 90  percent who began receipt of IU benefits in 2005 at different ages. To  calculate these lifetime present values, we used the SSA general  population mortality tables for males to estimate the lifespan of IU  beneficiaries. Because benefits awarded to younger veterans would be  expected to be received for a longer length of time in comparison with  older veterans, younger veterans are estimated to receive more in benefits  than older veterans who have the same schedular rating. Also, because the  lower the veteran\u2019s schedular rating, the greater the increase in monthly  disability compensation benefits when awarded IU benefits, veterans with  lower ratings were estimated to receive more in added IU benefits than  those of the same age with higher schedular ratings. For example, for  younger veterans, those at age 20 in 2005, the estimated lifetime present  value of these benefits can range from almost $300,000 to over $460,000.  Even for older veterans, the value of these benefits can be substantial. For  veterans awarded IU benefits at age 75 in 2005, the lifetime present value  of these benefits can range from about $89,000 to about $142,000. The  estimated lifetime present values of the added benefits for veterans  awarded IU benefits in 2005 at selected ages and schedular ratings is  shown in figure 3.", "When we analyzed VA data to determine the age at which veterans begin  receiving IU benefits, we found that just under half of new IU beneficiaries  were awarded IU benefits at the age of 60 or older. For example, we found  that 46 percent of veterans awarded IU benefits from October 2004 to  October 2005 were age 60 or older, and 19 percent were age 75 or older.  See figure 4 for the age distribution of new IU beneficiaries from October  2004 to October 2005. Data for the 2 prior year periods show a similar  pattern in the age distribution of new IU beneficiaries.", "In addition to disability compensation benefits, some IU beneficiaries are  also entitled to military disability retirement benefits or normal retirement  benefits based on years of military service. In general, however, an offset  provision restricts most veterans from receiving the full value of both  benefits, unless they have 20 or more years of service. Recent legislation  allows veterans with combat-related disabilities and 20 or more years of  service to receive the full value of both benefits. Also, recent legislation is  phasing out the offset for veterans who have 20 or more years of military  service and disability ratings of 50 percent or more. The phase out is  taking place between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2013, but IU  beneficiaries with 20 or more years of service will be eligible for full  concurrent receipt with no offset beginning October 1, 2009.

As part of the process of assessing whether a claimant can  perform his or her own occupation, insurers directly contact the claimant,  the treating physician, and the employer to collect medical and vocational  information and initiate return-to-work efforts, as needed. For example,  insurers consult medical staff and use other resources, such as medical  guidelines, which describe disabilities and their treatment and duration, to  evaluate whether the treating physician\u2019s diagnosis and the expected  duration of the disability are in line with the claimant\u2019s reported symptoms  and test results. Insurers\u2019 contacts with treating physicians may also be  aimed at ensuring that the claimant has an appropriate treatment plan  focused on timely recovery and return to work. Insurers may also use an  independent medical examination or tests of basic skills, interests, and  aptitudes to clarify the medical or vocational limitations and capabilities  of a claimant. In addition, they may use medical or vocational specialists  to identify possible accommodations for the claimant and may also  contact employers to encourage them to provide workplace  accommodations for a claimant who has the capacity to work. To  determine whether a claimant can go back to his current job, or if not,  engage in other work, insurers will identify a claimant\u2019s remaining skills  and abilities (i.e., transferable skills) by comparing the claimant\u2019s  capabilities and limitations with the demands of the claimant\u2019s own  occupation. Included in these assessment tools and methods are services  to help the claimant return to work, such as job placement, job  modification, and retraining.", "The definition of disability shifts after 2 years from being unable to  perform one\u2019s own occupation to being unable to perform any occupation.  This period provides an opportunity for claimants who have the potential  to work to recover medically and develop skills to return to work. During  this period, insurers may provide financial and other assistance to help  claimants with work potential make a successful transition. Insurers try to  develop the best strategies for managing each claim, which can include,  for example, helping to plan medical care or providing vocational services  to help claimants acquire new skills, adapt to assistive devices, or find new  positions.

These incentives  require the claimant to obtain appropriate medical treatment and can  result in a possible loss of benefits if the claimant does not participate in a  return-to-work program, if such a program would benefit the individual.  To support these requirements, these disability systems help the individual  obtain the appropriate medical care and provide financial incentives to  promote participation in rehabilitation, such as reimbursement for family  care costs. Insurers may provide additional financial benefits to those who  participate in a return-to-work plan. For example, one insurer told us that  claimants may receive an additional benefit equal to 10 percent of their  disability payment for participating in rehabilitation. To further encourage  rehabilitation and return to work, insurers may allow claimants who work  to supplement their disability benefit payments with earned income.  Conversely, insurers may reduce or terminate benefits for claimants who  could work, but do not.

If needed, SSA may also collect additional information from the applicant  about his or her pain, fatigue, and ability to perform common daily and  other specific activities, like meal preparation or ability to stand and sit, as  well as the use of accommodations.", "To assess claims for eligibility, SSA generally uses both a disability  examiner and a medical consultant. If needed, the medical consultant will  use the collected information to determine what an applicant can still do,  despite physical or mental limitations, referred to as the applicant\u2019s  residual functional capacity. The residual functional capacity will be used  by the decision makers, along with other vocational information in the  applicant\u2019s file, to determine if the applicant can perform his or her prior  job.

In 1997, we designated SSI a high-risk  program after several years of reporting on specific instances of abuse and  mismanagement, increasing overpayments, and poor recovery of  outstanding SSI overpayments. SSA\u2019s actions since then included  developing a major SSI legislative proposal with numerous overpayment  deterrence and recovery provisions. The ensuing enacted legislation  directly addressed a number of our prior recommendations and warranted  removal of the SSI program from our high-risk list in 2003. We have,  however, continued to monitor the program to ensure that improvements  have been sustained.", "To help ensure that applicants\u2019 and beneficiaries\u2019 earnings do not exceed  allowed levels, SSA has incorporated several procedures into its eligibility  assessments. In assessing eligibility, SSA must determine whether an  applicant is working and earning an amount that exceeds its established  thresholds. As part of this process, DI and SSI applicants must provide  SSA with information on their past work and any current work. If  applicants indicate that they are currently working or receiving earnings,  or SSA obtains other information that suggests that they may have  earnings, SSA requires additional information on their work and earnings.  SSA field staff generally must then verify the applicants\u2019 reported earnings  using another reliable source of information. SSA also uses its online  query system to access the NDNH database, which has recent earnings,  new hire, and unemployment information, to verify the earnings for DI and  SSI applicants it has designated as high risk, such as those whose stated  income does not appear to cover their expenses. SSA has found that online  access to NDNH data to verify earnings for the SSI program has a high  return on investment. For example, using a pilot evaluation, SSA estimated  that if it verified earnings online prior to benefit payment, it could annually  reduce overpayments by $30.8 million and have a 3.6 to 1 return-on- investment ratio.", "After benefits are granted, SSA performs frequent computer matches that  are intended to assess earnings for all its beneficiaries. These matches  compare earnings information from its beneficiary databases with two  federal earnings databases to detect and prevent overpayments. For its  computer matches, SSA uses both its own master earnings file with  earnings information from employers and the self-employed and the  NDNH database. SSA uses both databases because the SSA database has  more complete earnings information than the NDNH database, whereas  the NDNH database has more current earnings information in its quarterly  wage database, as well as other important employment data, according to  SSA officials. SSA performs periodic matches using its master earnings file  to detect and prevent beneficiary overpayments for all its SSI and DI  beneficiaries. In addition, SSA performs quarterly matches using NDNH  quarterly earnings to detect and prevent overpayments to all SSI  beneficiaries. SSA has also found that using NDNH data for the matches  can be very cost-effective. In evaluating fiscal year 2002 computer matches  using NDNH data, SSA estimated that it could annually realize $199 million  in benefits from collecting and preventing overpayments and expend $23  million for matching, following up on matches, and overpayment  collection, yielding an estimated 8.7-to-1 benefit-to-cost ratio. SSA also  plans to expand its use of the NDNH database to perform matches to  evaluate all DI beneficiary earnings.", "SSA has automated many features of its matching process and follow-up  verification and collection activities to help improve the efficiency and  effectiveness of its disability programs. SSA\u2019s computerized matching  process can not only detect potential unreported or underreported  earnings, but can also electronically forward matches to the field office  responsible for follow-up and provide workload statistics to each level of  management to help monitor the process. Field office staff can also use  SSA computer systems to view specific information on the match  (including the amount of earnings detected), document their follow-up,  and initiate collection activities, as needed. For example, the system will  send a letter to a current beneficiary who has received a benefit  overpayment with information about this debt, such as the amount owed,  and options for repayment. Through automation, the agency has increased  its ability to ensure that matches are followed up and more efficiently  initiate efforts to collect overpayments. SSA\u2019s systems also have built in  security features to help ensure that SSA meets legal requirements to  manage the privacy of the earnings and employment data.", "SSA uses various collection methods and other tools to manage the debt  owed by current and past beneficiaries who received disability benefit  overpayments. SSA will withhold monthly disability benefits to collect  overpayments from beneficiaries who are still on its rolls. In fiscal year  2005, SSA collected $2 billion in overpayments using this method. When  the person is no longer on SSA\u2019s benefit rolls, the agency uses its own  billing and follow-up system to collect overpayments. That system enables  SSA to send a series of progressively stronger notices requesting  repayment and to make telephone calls to negotiate repayment. The  agency collects several hundred million dollars a year using this approach.  In addition, SSA uses other more aggressive debt collection tools, such as  tax refund offsets and administrative wage garnishment, to collect debt  from prior benefit recipients who are no longer on its benefit rolls. When  unable to collect debts from current or prior beneficiaries, SSA will write  off the debts. In 2005, SSA reported debt collection of $2.4 billion, writing  off debt of $842 million, which left outstanding debt of $13.1 billion at year  end. Table 2 provides a list of the tools used by the agency to manage  overpayment debt.", "To help monitor its debt collection efforts and their effectiveness, SSA also  tracks and reports key debt management activities and performance  indicators. For example, SSA\u2019s annual performance and accountability  reports provide data on the quarterly cumulative totals for the debt  outstanding, collected, and written off, and the varying age of delinquent  debt. SSA also provides 5 years of trend data on the results and  effectiveness of its activities, such as the percentage of outstanding debt  that is delinquent or not expected to be collected and the average cost to  collect a dollar of debt, which was $0.09 for fiscal year 2005. Furthermore,  to help monitor its achievement of its strategic goals to improve debt  management, SSA measures and sets a goal for the percentage of debt in  collection for its Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance; and SSI  programs. The indicators compare debt that is scheduled for collection  through benefit withholding or installment payment with total outstanding  debt.

As  a result, the agency cannot assure that it is providing IU benefits only to  those who are unemployable due to their service-related disabilities. In  addition, due to limitations in the procedures to obtain evidence, VA rating  specialists may not have sufficient information for determining whether  claimants are unemployable. Without the procedures needed to collect  complete and corroborated employment and earnings histories, rating  specialists lack access to important indicators of future employability.

For example, VA could:    clarify in its regulations and guidelines how vocational factors, such as  education, skills, or prior work history, should be used to assess a  claimant\u2019s eligibility;    establish procedures for rating specialists to request VR&E to conduct  vocational assessments of IU claimants as appropriate; and    seek legislative authority to use earnings data from the National  Directory of New Hires.  2.

For  example, VA could:    update and automate its enforcement process, including using more  current earnings data and threshold amounts in its income verification  match;    clarify guidance on the review of IU beneficiary earnings following the    annually track and report on the results of matching process and  related enforcement activities.  3. To help modernize its IU decision-making process, VA should develop a  strategy to ensure that IU claimants with work potential receive  encouragement and assistance to return to work, while protecting benefits  for those unable to work. For example, VA could encourage claimants to  return to work by having vocational counselors from VR&E develop  return-to-work plans and provide assistance to claimants with work  potential."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to VA, SSA, and HHS for comment. VA  agreed with our conclusions and concurred with our recommendations,  and stated that it has implemented and plans to implement program  changes in areas that we identified as needing attention. The actions  described by VA should strengthen its management of IU benefits;  however, we believe that further steps are needed to fundamentally  transform IU benefits into a meaningful and timely way of supporting  unemployed veterans with service-connected disabilities.  For example,  VA seeks to improve decision making on initial and ongoing eligibility by  increasing its collection of employment and earnings data.  While these are  positive developments, our recommendations envision a more  comprehensive effort to restore the integrity of IU decision making  through a series of reforms that would seek to strengthen IU criteria,  guidance, and procedures for determining initial eligibility and enforcing  the earnings limit.", "VA also proposes to encourage IU claimants to consider employment by  including a motivational letter with the notice informing them that they  have been approved for IU benefits.  While we recognize VA\u2019s intent is  positive, providing such letters after veterans have been determined to be  unemployable does not provide them with the timely support needed to  return to work.  Our recommendation envisions that VA implement a  number of fundamental reforms that transform IU benefits from simply  providing compensation for unemployed veterans with service-connected  disabilities to incorporating a broad range of vocational rehabilitation  services and assistance that encourage and support such veterans to  realize their full productive capacity, while protecting benefits for veterans  unable to work.  VA will need to expand upon the initiatives outlined in its  comments to take full advantage of IU benefit decision making, not only as  a means to restore the lost incomes of veterans with service-connected  disabilities but, when appropriate, to restore their ability to pursue a  livelihood and take their place as fully productive members of society.", "VA\u2019s comments appear in app. V.

We chose the  ages of 20, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, and 75 to illustrate the added value of IU  benefits over a wide range of ages at which veterans could begin to receive  such benefits.", "For each age and disability rating combination, we calculated the present  value of the added increment due to IU that would be received over a  lifetime. Our present value analysis uses annuity factors that are based on  two key assumptions: the length of time benefits will be received, and the  rate at which future payments will be discounted (on the basis that a  dollar today is worth more than a dollar received a year from today). For  the first assumption about life span, we used Social Security  Administration general population mortality tables for males. For the  second assumption about the discount rate, we assumed that the rate of  interest absent inflation (the real interest rate) is 3 percent, and that  inflation is constant at 3 percent annually, resulting in an assumed nominal  interest rate (which is the sum of the real interest rate and inflation) of 6  percent. Because the yearly cost-of-living adjustment of VA compensation  rates is linked to the consumer price index, we assumed that this  adjustment is equal to the rate of inflation, resulting in a net discount rate  for our calculations of 3 percent a year. The present value of the additional  amount of disability compensation provided to veterans granted IU  benefits for selected ages and schedular ratings is provided in table 3."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Examples from VA\u2019s Rating Schedule for Selected Medical Conditions", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Example of Procedures to Calculate Combined Disability Ratings", "paragraphs": ["Veteran has 50% earning  capacity remaining.", "As a result of second  disability, the veteran has  lost an additional 20% of  earning capacity.", "As a result of both  disabilities the veteran has  lost 70% of earning capacity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgements", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgements", "paragraphs": ["Carol Dawn Petersen, Assistant Director; Joseph J.
