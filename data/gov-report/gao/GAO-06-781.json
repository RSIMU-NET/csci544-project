Trust status means the government holds title to the land in trust for tribes and individual Indians. Trust land is exempt from state and local taxes. The Secretary of the Interior has delegated primary responsibility for processing, reviewing, and deciding on applications to take land in trust to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). As part of this process, BIA must seek comments from affected state and local governments. Congress directed GAO to study BIA's processing of land in trust applications to determine the extent to which (1) BIA followed its regulations, (2) applications were processed in a timely manner, and to (3) identify any concerns raised by state and local governments about land in trust applications. GAO is also providing information on problems with BIA's data on the processing of land in trust applications."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["BIA generally followed its regulations for processing land in trust applications, although most of the criteria in the regulations are not specific and thus do not offer clear guidance for how BIA should apply them. For example, there are no guidelines on how to weigh the impact of lost tax revenues on local governments. As a result, the BIA decision maker has wide discretion. Generally, all of the 87 applications with decisions in fiscal year 2005 were approved, except for 1 denial and 6 that were closed because the applications were incomplete. BIA is considering revisions to the regulations that would clarify that applications will generally be approved unless there is clear evidence of significant negative impacts. These revisions would make BIA's decision-making process more transparent. Currently, BIA has no deadlines for making decisions on land in trust applications, but BIA is considering imposing about a 6-month time frame. In addition, there is also a 60-day time frame for BIA regional directors to rule on appeals. Based on these time frames, it appears that many land in trust applications have not been processed in a timely manner. First, the median processing time for the 87 applications with decisions in fiscal year 2005 was 1.2 years--ranging from 58 days to almost 19 years. Second, 28 complete off-reservation applications had been waiting an average of 1.4 years for a decision as of September 30, 2005. Third, 34 appeals had been waiting an average of about 3 years for resolution by a BIA regional director as of September 30, 2005. When opposing land in trust applications or appealing decisions, state and local governments principally cited concerns about lost tax revenues and jurisdictional issues. In commenting on applications prior to decisions made in fiscal year 2005, state and local governments opposed 12 of 87 applications, or about 14 percent. Also, as of September 30, 2005, 45 decisions were on administrative appeal to either a BIA regional director or Interior's Board of Indian Appeals, including 5 appealed decisions from fiscal year 2005. Although GAO found little opposition to applications with decisions in fiscal year 2005, some state and local governments we contacted said (1) they did not have access to sufficient information about the land in trust applications and (2) the 30-day comment period was not sufficient time in which to comment. GAO found the data in BIA's land in trust database, which was implemented in August 2004, were frequently incomplete and inaccurate. The database was hastily developed without defining user requirements and data fields. Specifically, (1) not all of the applications had been entered into the database and (2) the status of an application, as either approved or denied, was frequently incorrect. A properly designed and implemented database with accurate data would provide BIA with important information to help better manage the land in trust process. BIA has already recognized the shortcomings and initiated an effort to redesign the database as necessary."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 1980, the Department of the Interior (Interior) established a regulatory  process intended to provide a uniform approach for taking land in trust.   Trust status means that the federal government holds title to the land in  trust for tribes or individual Indians. Land taken in trust is no longer  subject to state and local property taxes and zoning ordinances. Many  Indians believe that having their land placed in trust status is fundamental  to safeguarding it against future loss and ensuring their sovereignty. While  some state and local governments support the federal government\u2019s taking  additional land in trust for tribes or individual Indians, others strongly  oppose it because of concerns about the impacts on their tax base and  jurisdictional control. Further, the growth of Indian gaming, its impacts on  local communities, and the possibility that newly acquired land taken in  trust could be used for gaming have led to heightened concerns about  Indian land acquisitions by some members of the public and some state and  local governments.", "Taking land in trust can be mandated by Congress through legislation or at  the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior. Under the regulations, tribes  or individual Indians who purchase or own property on which they pay  property taxes can submit a written request to the Secretary of the Interior  to have the land taken in trust. If approved, the ownership status of the  property would be converted from taxable status to nontaxable Indian trust  status. For requests made by tribes or individual Indians under Interior\u2019s  discretionary authority, the regulations establish criteria that the Secretary  of the Interior must consider in evaluating whether to approve or deny the  request. The criteria differ slightly for requests involving land located  within or contiguous to an existing Indian reservation\u2014referred to as on- reservation acquisitions\u2014and land located outside of and not contiguous  to an existing Indian reservation\u2014referred to as off-reservation  acquisitions. The on-reservation criteria require that the Secretary  consider, among other things, the impact on the state and its political  subdivisions resulting from removing the land from the tax rolls and  jurisdictional problems and potential conflicts surrounding land use that  could arise. As part of the process, state and local governments must be  notified of a request and allowed 30 days to provide written comments on  the potential impacts of regulatory jurisdiction, real property taxes, and  special assessments. For off-reservation requests, the regulations also  require the Secretary to, among other things, give greater scrutiny to the  tribe\u2019s justification of anticipated benefits from the acquisition as the  distance away from the reservation increases and give greater weight to  concerns raised by state and local governments.", "The Secretary of the Interior has delegated to the Assistant Secretary for  Indian Affairs, primarily through the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), the  day-to-day responsibility for processing, reviewing, and deciding on  applications to take land in trust. Written applications are submitted to BIA  regional offices and local agency offices across the country. In most cases,  the decision maker for on-reservation applications is the superintendent of  the local agency office. For off-reservation applications, the decision maker  is the applicable BIA regional director. However, under Interior\u2019s policy, the  Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs is to review all off-reservation  applications and provide input before the regional director issues a  decision. On- and off-reservation applications are generally processed by a  combination of BIA realty staff at BIA\u2019s Central Office in Washington, D.C.,  a BIA regional office, and a local agency office. Decisions by BIA  superintendents and regional directors are not Interior\u2019s final position until  the administrative appeals process has been exhausted. Decisions may be  appealed to the applicable BIA regional director or to Interior\u2019s Board of  Indian Appeals (IBIA), depending on who the decision maker was.  Ultimately, disputes over taking land in trust may be litigated in federal  court.", "To be able to provide agencywide data on the processing of land in trust  applications, BIA created a land in trust database in the summer of 2004.  Each BIA office is responsible for entering key dates and information about  the processing of their land in trust applications, such as the date  comments were requested and received from state and local governments  and the date of BIA\u2019s decision. By the end of fiscal year 2005, BIA officials  had entered information on over 1,000 applications into the database. The  applications cover tracts of land that are less than an acre to tracts that are  thousands of acres, located in both rural and urban areas. The database  shows most of the applications are pending. However, the information in  the database is not complete or accurate enough to use in describing the  status or condition of applications overall. Therefore, to provide such a  description for this report, we primarily relied upon applications with  decisions in fiscal year 2005, as we were able to verify the accuracy and  completeness of these applications by reviewing the actual documents in  select BIA offices across the country. In this manner we were able to  ensure that we had the complete population for applications with decisions  in fiscal year 2005. In fiscal year 2005, BIA superintendents and regional  directors issued decisions on 87 applications covering more than 5,800  acres for 31 tribes or their members in 12 states. Since 1934, the total  acreage held in trust by the federal government for the benefit of tribes and  their members has increased from about 49 million to about 54 million.", "The fiscal year 2006 House Appropriations Committee Report for Interior\u2019s  appropriation bill directed GAO to study BIA\u2019s procedures and practices in  implementing the land in trust regulations. In response to this direction  and subsequent discussions with congressional offices, we (1) assessed the  extent to which BIA\u2019s processing of land in trust applications followed its  regulations, (2) determined the extent to which applications were  processed in a timely manner, and (3) identified any state and local  government concerns about land in trust applications and how they were  addressed in BIA\u2019s decision-making process. In addition, we are providing  information on the problems we encountered with the data BIA collects on  the processing of land in trust applications. We also agreed to review the  Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management\u2019s process for  issuing allotments of land to individual Indians out of the public domain.  We will report on that issue separately because it involves a different  agency and different legislative authority.", "In conducting our work, we reviewed applicable laws, regulations, and land  in trust applications. We reviewed applications and interviewed BIA realty  staff at six regional offices\u2014Eastern, Midwest, Northwest, Pacific,  Southern Plains, and Southwest\u2014and eight agency offices\u2014Blackfeet  (Browning, Montana), Chickasaw (Ada, Oklahoma), Great Lakes (Ashland,  Wisconsin), Horton (Horton, Kansas), Minnesota (Bemidji, Minnesota),  Siletz (Siletz, Oregon), Warm Springs (Warm Springs, Oregon), and Wind  River (Fort Washakie, Wyoming). We visited all of the BIA offices with 10 or  more land in trust applications decided in fiscal year 2005. From the offices  we visited, we collected 67 of the 87 discretionary nongaming land in trust  applications decided in fiscal year 2005, or 77 percent. BIA staff from the  locations we did not visit made copies of an additional 18 applications and  mailed them to us. We obtained the remaining two applications from the  IBIA. We analyzed these applications in the following ways:  To determine how BIA processed land in trust applications, we reviewed  the 87 applications with decisions in fiscal year 2005, and we compared  how the applications were processed with the requirements in the  regulations.", "To determine whether applications were processed in a timely manner,  we compared the processing times for (1) 87 applications with decisions  in fiscal year 2005 and (2) 28 complete off-reservation applications  awaiting comments from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Indian  Affairs to 120 business days, or about 6 months, the time frame BIA is  considering imposing for making decisions on on- and off-reservation  land in trust applications. In addition, we compared the length of time  that 34 appealed decisions had been awaiting resolution by BIA regional  directors with the current 60-day time frame set forth in the regulations  on appeals. We also interviewed BIA officials and tribal representatives  involved in the process to obtain their views on the time taken for  processing applications.", "To determine whether state and local governments had any concerns  about land in trust applications, we analyzed the content of comments  made by these governments for the 87 applications with decisions in  fiscal year 2005. We also reviewed the issues raised by state and local  governments in all 45 appeals pending as of September 30, 2005\u201434  appeals pending before BIA regional directors and 11 appeals pending  before the IBIA. In addition, we obtained the perspectives of  representatives of the National Governors Association and the National  Association of Counties.", "To determine the accuracy and reliability of BIA\u2019s land in trust database,  we compared the information in the database with other data sources:   spreadsheets used by a number of the BIA offices we visited to track  land in trust applications, BIA realty reports prepared under the  Government Performance and Results Act, and BIA annual acreage  reports. We also discussed the development of the current database and  the proposed redesign of the database with staff in the Office of the  Chief Information Officer within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for  Indian Affairs.", "A more detailed description of our objectives, scope and methodology can  be found in appendix I.

Real estate services staff are under the  line authority of regional directors and agency superintendents.", "In 1980, Interior established a regulatory process intended to provide a  uniform approach for taking land in trust. For on-reservation applications  under the Secretary\u2019s discretionary authority, the deciding official must  consider   the statutory authority to take land into trust;  the need for the land;   the purpose of acquiring the land;   for individual Indians, the amount of land already held in trust and the  individual\u2019s need for assistance in handling business matters;   the implications for state and local governments of removing land from   the potential jurisdictional concerns of state and local governments;   BIA\u2019s ability to discharge its duties on the newly acquired land; and   environmental compliance, particularly with the National  Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).", "For off-reservation applications under the Secretary\u2019s discretionary  authority, BIA must also place greater weight on the concerns of state and  local governments as the distance of the land from the tribe\u2019s reservation  increases and review a business plan if the land is to be acquired for  business purposes. Once these steps have been completed, BIA provides a  decision to the applicant and affected parties. Several additional steps  follow, including publication of the decision in the Federal Register or a  local newspaper, and possible administrative appeals and litigation.", "In 1988, about 8 years after the regulations for taking land in trust were  issued, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act was enacted. The act provided  the statutory basis for the operation and regulation of certain gaming  activities on Indian lands. It generally prohibits gaming activities on Indian  trust lands acquired by the Secretary after October 17, 1988, the date the  act was signed into law. However, the act does provide several exceptions  that allow gaming on lands acquired in trust after its enactment. For fiscal  year 2005, gaming revenues from Indian gaming facilities totaled $22.6  billion.", "On applications for land in trust, applicants must declare the anticipated  use of the property, particularly whether the property will be for gaming or  nongaming purposes. Applications to take land in trust for gaming  purposes are handled by the Office of Indian Gaming Management within  the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs. In September 2005,  Interior\u2019s Office of the Inspector General reported on the processing of  applications for land in trust for gaming purposes. The Inspector General  reported that while the review and approval process for gaming  applications was \u201csufficient,\u201d the process took an average of 17 months\u2014 or about 1.4 years\u2014from the time BIA received the application until its  final action. Furthermore, the Inspector General reported 10 instances  where tribes had converted lands acquired for nongaming purposes to  gaming without first getting the necessary approvals pursuant to the Indian  Gaming Regulatory Act. Interior subsequently determined that five of these  conversions were eligible for gaming under the Indian Gaming Regulatory  Act, one was not, and four were still under review at the time of the  Inspector General\u2019s report. The gaming facility on the one ineligible  conversion was later closed.", "Our report focuses on discretionary nongaming land in trust applications,  which fall into three categories\u2014on-reservation, off-reservation, and  \u201cgaming related\u201d applications. The gaming related category was added in  2001, and it refers to applications involving support facilities for gaming  establishments, such as parking lots and maintenance buildings, but not the  actual gaming activity itself. By directive of the Assistant Secretary for  Indian Affairs, each category of applications is processed slightly  differently or by a different office. In most cases, the decision maker for on- reservation applications is the superintendent of the local BIA agency  office. For the remaining on-reservation applications and for the off- reservation applications, the decision maker is the applicable BIA regional  director. Off-reservation applications are processed using the criteria in 25  C.F.R. \u00a7151.11 and the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs is to review the  draft decision and supporting materials and provide input before the  regional director issues a decision. On- and off-reservation applications are  generally processed by a combination of BIA realty staff at BIA\u2019s Central  Office in Washington, D.C.; a BIA regional office; or a local BIA agency  office.

Administrative  appeals can be filed with the applicable BIA regional director or the IBIA,  depending on who the BIA deciding official was. First, if a superintendent  was the deciding official, parties can appeal the decision to a regional  director. The regional director then reviews the application\u2019s administrative  record and any other available information and renders a ruling. The  regulations governing appeals state that a regional director must make a  ruling within 60 days after all times for pleadings, including extensions,  have expired. The regional director\u2019s ruling can then be further appealed  to the IBIA, the administrative review body at Interior. The IBIA\u2019s ruling is  the final position for Interior.

The  appellants generally asserted that BIA did not adequately consider tax and  jurisdictional impacts. While these most recent appeals were pending at the  end of the fiscal year 2005, some other appeals of decisions from fiscal year  2004 are illustrative in demonstrating how the appeal process works. For  example, the local government of Union Township, in the state of Michigan,  appealed three land in trust applications to the Midwest Regional Director,  asserting that BIA had not addressed, among other things, the township\u2019s  jurisdictional and land use concerns in its decision.

However, the criterion does not  indicate a threshold for what might constitute an unacceptable level of lost  tax revenue and, therefore, a denial of an application. Furthermore, BIA  does not provide guidance on how to evaluate lost tax revenue, such as  comparing lost revenue with a county\u2019s total budget or evaluating the lost  revenue\u2019s impact on particular tax-based services, such as police and fire  services. In addition, the criterion does not require deciding officials to  consider the cumulative impact of tax losses resulting from multiple  parcels taken in trust over time\u2014a practice some state and local  governments would like to see instituted.

For example, according to BIA files, the  Pacific Region application that took almost 19 years to process was  submitted in 1986 by an individual tribal member to place 5.42 acres of land  in trust. BIA found that the application lacked required documents and,  therefore, could not process the application until it received these  documents. The applicant did not provide the necessary documents until  1991. While the application was deemed complete in 1991, according to our  file review, the regional office did not issue a notice to interested parties of  the proposed trust acquisition until 2002. However, in the same year, the  BIA Pacific Regional Director ordered processing stopped on the  application because the applicant\u2019s tribal affiliation was uncertain. BIA and  the applicant worked to resolve this issue, and BIA approved the  application on February 25, 2005, almost 19 years after its submission.  While the BIA file stated clearly that processing on the file was halted  initially due to inaction on the part of the applicant, it did not provide an  explanation regarding why the application was not acted upon by the BIA  from 1991 to 2002. In other cases processed at the Horton Agency Office in  Kansas, our file review showed several applications were closed by the  agency in 2005 because of inaction on the part of the tribe; one of these  applications had been submitted in 1991.

In  2002, the state of Kansas appealed a decision by the Horton Agency  Superintendent to allow 7.85 acres in trust on the Sac & Fox reservation.  The state argued that BIA\u2019s decision (1) reduces the tax rolls by $492; (2)  violates the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, since states surrendered  many powers to the federal government but retained residual sovereignty;  and (3) violates the Act for Admission of Kansas into the United States  because it would compel the state to relinquish its sovereign jurisdiction  over the land. The tribe stated that (1) Brown County, the recipient of the  $492 per year in taxes, did not file an appeal and the amount is  insubstantial; (2) the Regional Director, like the IBIA, lacked jurisdiction to  declare federal statutes unconstitutional, and this issue has been addressed  in several other appeals to the IBIA; and (3) Kansas had accepted  admission into the United States on the condition that the federal  government retained its power to regulate Indian affairs; therefore, BIA did  not infringe on the state\u2019s sovereignty. The Southern Plains Regional  Director was still considering the appeal as of June 8, 2006.", "Similar arguments about loss of tax revenues and jurisdictional issues have  been made in appeals before the IBIA.

The land was to be  used for residential housing, women\u2019s services programs, and a tribal  health office. The county and the city said the loss of the land would have a  negative impact on the tax rolls and that the land might not be within the  reservation boundaries; consequently, the applications would be subject to  additional criteria. When the matter was appealed to the Regional Director,  he concluded that the tax loss of about $5,000 annually was not significant  and that the tribe\u2019s services to the entire community, including non-Indians,  reduced the financial burden on local governments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State and Local Governments Want More Information about Applications as Early as Possible and More Time to Comment", "paragraphs": ["Some state and local government officials want more information about  applications early in the process, and they want more time to comment. In  a July 2005 paper, the National Governors Association stated that any new  regulations should include, among other things, a requirement that states  and local governments be able to review tribal submissions and evidence,  just as tribes are able to review state submissions. The governors also  said that language in the regulations should ensure that states have the  right to provide data challenging assertions made in the proposals to take  land in trust. According to some state and county officials, the current  process does not work well in providing them with information and an  opportunity to comment. During a meeting with staff of various state  governors, arranged by the National Governors Association, an attorney  with the South Dakota Office of the Attorney General told us that while the  governor\u2019s office receives notification of land in trust applications, the state  does not have access to a tribe\u2019s application except through a Freedom of  Information Act request, which often takes too long.

As a result, the data are of  questionable value to Interior and BIA management, and we did not rely on  it. BIA has already recognized some shortcomings and initiated an effort to  re-evaluate and redesign the database, as necessary. The database was  hastily developed and deployed without defining and documenting user  requirements throughout the agency and clearly defining data fields. Staff  with Interior\u2019s Office of Information Development said a contractor  developed the database in about a month to address the information needs  of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs in the summer of 2004.  In a June 2005 memo, almost a year after the system was put in place, BIA\u2019s  Deputy Director for Trust Services noted that only 4 of the possible 11  regions had entered any data into the database, and the memo directed  each BIA regional and agency office to enter all of its land in trust  applications into the database within 5 days.

Specifically, we found  the following issues:   Not all of the applications had been entered into the database.  Twenty- nine of the 87 applications with decisions in fiscal year 2005, or 33  percent, were not in the database. About half of these applications not in  the database, 13, were from the Eastern Oklahoma Region\u2019s Chickasaw  Agency. No one at the office had access to the database when we  initially inquired and, therefore, they could not enter information. Also 9  applications at the Pacific Region were not in the database, and no one  there had access when we inquired. We also found instances at the  Midwest and Southwest Regions where some pending applications had  not been entered into the database. The high rate of applications that  had not been entered into the database is one of the factors that led us  to conclude that database information was unreliable.", "Status of applications was frequently incorrect. During the course of  our review, we found that 30 of the 41 applications identified as denied  in the database were miscoded, an error rate of almost 75 percent. Most  of the remaining \u201cdenied\u201d applications were applications that were  closed by realty staff with the Southern Plains Region\u2019s Horton Agency  because the tribal applicants had not responded for more than a year to  BIA\u2019s requests for the additional information needed to process the  applications. The applications were not processed and denied based on  the criteria in the regulations; rather, they were closed due to inactivity.  However, as currently designed, there is no category in the database to  show this type of resolution other than denied. In addition, we found  that some offices interpreted \u201capproved\u201d differently. For example, two  agency offices in BIA\u2019s Rocky Mountain Region used an application form  that required the agency superintendent to approve the application for  filing and processing. As defined by these offices, some applications  being processed had been \u201capproved,\u201d but they were actually pending  applications.  Other BIA offices considered an application approved  when the superintendent actually approved taking the land in trust.  While some of the problems we encountered with the status of the  applications in the database were simply data entry errors, others were  the result of systematic problems, such as the lack of common  definitions for key terms.", "Furthermore, at the time of our review, regional and agency realty staff did  not use the new database as the primary tool for managing their  applications. According to BIA regional and agency realty staff, they do not  use or do not like to use the database because it is cumbersome, slow, and  does not meet their needs. They continue to use their office-specific  spreadsheets to manage and track their applications. These office  spreadsheets were one of the tools we used to try and verify the  information in the database. However, trying to reconcile the office  spreadsheets with the database was difficult because the office  spreadsheets usually identified applications only by parcel name, whereas  the database identified applications with different unique identification  numbers by region, agency, and tribe.", "We believe that data need to be accurate, valid, complete, consistent, and  timely enough to document performance, support decision making, and  respond to the needs of internal and external stakeholders. According to  Interior officials, the database has been used to respond to questions about  the program from various levels of management and from Congress.  Further, data quality depends on how readily users can access data, aided  by clear data definitions and user-friendly software. When significant data  limitations exist, it is important to make stakeholders and Congress aware  of the limitations so they can judge the credibility of the data for their use.  During the course of our review, BIA recognized that the database has  limitations, and it asked Interior\u2019s Office of Information Development to  improve the database. In April 2006, the Deputy Director for Information  Development conducted a 3-day workshop for program managers on BIA\u2019s  land in trust database. The session served as a basis for making  improvements and, in May 2006, the office was preparing a plan to (1)  involve regional and headquarters officials in changing the database, (2)  better define terms and fields, and (3) increase the number of fields in the  database.

Clearly documenting each decision and providing  that information to state and local governments is a critical component of  having an open and transparent process.  However, contrary to BIA policy  and admonishments from the IBIA, we found one BIA office that did not  document its consideration of the criteria in the regulations. While this  office only accounted for 2 of the 87 decisions in fiscal year 2005, it omitted  documentation of the most important part of the process.

The six participants were from the  California State Association of Counties; Kitsap County, Washington;  Madison County, New York; Navajo County, Arizona; Seneca County, New  York; and Ziebach County, South Dakota.", "For discussions with tribal leaders, we used a nonprobability sample to  select tribes that submitted applications in recent years to BIA locations we  visited. We met with representatives of the 13 tribes listed in table 6.", "In addition, we obtained Interior\u2019s and Indians\u2019 views on the land in trust  process by participating in a panel session on the subject at the Self- Governance Tribes\u2019 Fall Conference in 2005.", "For each of the objectives we took the following specific actions:  To determine how BIA processed land in trust applications, we reviewed  the 87 applications with decisions in fiscal year 2005 and compared how  the applications were processed with the requirements in the  regulations and departmental guidance. In addition, we interviewed  Interior\u2019s field solicitors in Minnesota and Oregon to obtain their  perspectives on how BIA followed procedures during their reviews of  applications.", "To determine whether applications were processed in a timely manner,  we compared the processing times for (1) 87 applications with decisions  in fiscal year 2005 and (2) 28 complete off-reservation applications  awaiting comments from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Indian  Affairs to the 120-business days, or about 6 months, time frame BIA is  considering imposing for making decisions on on- and off-reservation  land in trust applications. The reported minimum, median, and  maximum processing times are for fiscal year 2005 only and might not  be indicative of other years. For each of the applications with decisions  in fiscal year 2005, we tried to use the date of the application as the  initial point to calculate the processing time. For the few applications  where we could not determine the date of the application, we used  either the date of the tribal resolution requesting that the land be placed  in trust or the date BIA notified state and local governments about an  application. We used the decision date as the end date for calculating the  processing time of these applications. For off-reservation applications,  we calculated the time from the date of the draft decision to the end of  fiscal year 2005. In addition, we compared the length of time that 34  appealed decisions had been awaiting resolution by BIA regional  directors with the current 60-day time frame set forth in the regulations  on appeals. For the appealed decisions, we calculated the time from the  date of the decision to the end of fiscal year 2005. We also interviewed  BIA officials and tribal representatives involved in the process to obtain  their views on the time taken for processing applications.", "To determine whether state and local governments had concerns, we  analyzed the content of comments made by these governments for the  87 applications with decisions in fiscal year 2005 and 45 appeals pending  at the end of fiscal year 2005. Moreover, we reviewed the National  Governors Association 2005 position paper on revisions to the  regulations for processing land in trust, and we obtained draft revisions  to the regulations from a Counselor to the Assistant Secretary for Indian  Affairs at Interior.", "As described above, we decided that the BIA database was not reliable  for our purposes. To determine the accuracy and reliability of the  database, we compared the information in the database with other data  sources, including spreadsheets used by a number of the BIA offices we  visited to track land in trust applications, BIA realty reports under the  Government Performance and Results Act, and BIA annual acreage  reports. We also discussed the development of the current database and  the proposed redesign of the database with staff in the Office of the  Chief Information Officer within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for  Indian Affairs.", "We performed our work between August 2005 and June 2006 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BIA\u2019s Process for Placing Land in Trust", "paragraphs": ["Remnd In the case of a denial by the superintendent and no appeal, the process would end here."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Processing Times for 87 Land in Trust Applications with Decisions in Fiscal Year 2005", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Processing Times for 28 Off-Reservation Land in Trust Applications Awaiting Consideration by BIA Central Office", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Processing Times for 34 Appealed Land in Trust Decisions Awaiting Resolution by a BIA Regional Director", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of the Interior", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Jeffery D.
