Ginnie Mae MBS financed more than 90 percent of new FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed loans in fiscal year 2004, and the agency appears to face relatively little competition in this market. Ginnie Mae's total volume has declined in recent years, however, and its share of the overall MBS market has fallen from 42 percent of new securities in 1985 to 7 percent in 2004. This drop is largely the result of the decline in the market share of the FHA and VA loan programs and the concurrent rise in the securitization of non-government-backed mortgages. Further declines in Ginnie Mae's volume could potentially have implications for borrowers, the liquidity of its securities, and federal revenues. For example, Ginnie Mae's securities could become less liquid, although it is unclear at what levels of volume this would occur. In addition, Ginnie Mae's program revenues could decline if its volume decreased. In fiscal year 2004, program revenues exceeded expenses by $295 million, which helped reduce the federal budget deficit. Ginnie Mae faces a number of challenges in responding to changes in the marketplace, meeting stakeholders' needs, and managing its operations, and the agency has been taking steps to address these challenges. For example, it has expanded its product mix to reach more borrowers and has begun disclosing more information on loans underlying its securities to help investors better predict risk. GAO and others have identified opportunities for improvement in Ginnie Mae's data integrity and internal controls. The agency has begun addressing these issues, but it contracts out most of its operations, so ensuring that it has sufficient staff capabilities to plan, monitor, and manage its contracts is essential."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Government National Mortgage Association, commonly known as  Ginnie Mae, plays an important role in supporting federal housing  initiatives by increasing liquidity in the secondary mortgage market.

Partly because of that lack of  flexibility, Ginnie Mae faces a number of challenges in responding to  changes in the marketplace and in managing its operations efficiently and  effectively.

In turn, purchasers of  mortgage loans in the secondary markets either hold the loans in their own  portfolios or, most often, pool together a group of loans to back MBS that  are sold to investors or held in the originator\u2019s portfolio. Secondary loan  markets benefit lenders, borrowers, and investors in a number of ways.  First, they allow lenders to manage their liquidity needs, reduce interest  rate risk, and generate funds for additional lending. Second, they increase  the amount of credit available to borrowers and help lower interest rates by  fostering competition among lenders. Finally, they allow investors to  further diversify their risks and to sell their interests on active secondary  markets to other willing investors.", "Ginnie Mae was created in 1968 through an amendment to the National  Housing Act. Organizationally, Ginnie Mae operates as a unit of HUD, and  its administrative, staffing, and budgetary decisions are coordinated with  HUD\u2019s. Ginnie Mae defines its mission as expanding affordable housing in  America by linking capital markets to the nation\u2019s housing markets, largely  by serving as the dominant secondary market vehicle for government-  backed loan programs. These programs, which insure or guarantee  mortgage loans that are originated in the private sector, are administered  by a variety of federal agencies, including FHA, VA, RHS, and PIH.  The  government backing provided by these programs expands opportunities for  homeownership to borrowers who may have difficulty obtaining a  conventional mortgage.", "Ginnie Mae does not buy or sell loans or issue mortgage-backed securities.  Rather, it provides guarantees backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S.  government that investors will receive timely payments of principal and  interest on securities supported by pools of government-backed loans,  regardless of whether the borrower makes the underlying mortgage  payment or the issuer makes timely payments on the MBS. Figure 1 shows  the process of Ginnie Mae securitization. All mortgages in the Ginnie Mae  pool must be insured or guaranteed by a government agency and have  eligible interest rates and maturities.", "Ginnie Mae has several different products. Ginnie Mae\u2019s original MBS  program, Ginnie Mae I, requires that all pools contain similar types of  mortgages (e.g., single family) with similar maturities and the same interest  rates. The Ginnie Mae II MBS program, which was introduced in 1983,  permits pools to contain loans with more heterogeneous loans. For  example, the underlying mortgages in a pool can have varying interest rates  and a pool can be created using adjustable rate mortgages (ARM). Ginnie  Mae\u2019s Multiclass Securities Program, introduced in 1994, includes, among  other things, Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits (REMIC) and  Ginnie Mae Platinum Securities.  REMICs are designed to tailor the  prepayment and interest rate risks associated with MBS to investors with  varying investment goals. These products direct principal and interest  payments from underlying MBS to classes, or tranches, with different  principal balances, interest rates, and other characteristics. Ginnie Mae  Platinum Securities allow investors to aggregate MBS with relatively small  remaining principal balances and similar characteristics into new, more  liquid securities.", "Investors in Ginnie Mae MBS face prepayment risk\u2014that is, the possibility  that borrowers will pay off their mortgages early, reducing the amount of  interest earned. However, investors do not face credit risk\u2014the possibility  of loss from unpaid mortgages\u2014because the underlying mortgages backing  the pools are federally insured or guaranteed and Ginnie Mae guarantees  timely payment of principal and interest. FHA\u2019s single-family loan program  and PIH\u2019s loan guarantee programs insure nearly 100 percent of the loan  amount. VA guarantees the lender against losses, subject to a cap equal to  25 percent to 50 percent of the loan amount based on the size of the loan;  RHS guarantees up to 90 percent of the loan value. Issuers are responsible  for delinquent loans in pools. When a Ginnie Mae issuer defaults in making  timely payments of principal and interest to investors, Ginnie Mae makes  the payments and takes over the issuer\u2019s entire portfolio of government-  backed loans that stand behind the securities that Ginnie Mae has  guaranteed.", "Ginnie Mae charges issuers a guarantee fee for providing its guarantee of  timely payment. The fee varies depending on the product and is six basis  points for securities backed by single-family loans, which represent the  majority of Ginnie Mae MBS. Issuers also pay a commitment fee that gives  them the authority to pool mortgages into Ginnie Mae MBS. Issuers of  Ginnie Mae securities may also collect a fee to cover the cost of servicing  the underlying mortgages (generally 44 basis points for Ginnie Mae I  products and 19 to 69 basis points for the Ginnie Mae II).

Ginnie Mae issued its first MBS in  1970, and since that time it has guaranteed a cumulative total of more than  $2 trillion of MBS. According to Ginnie Mae, its securities historically have  represented roughly 90 percent of the market for FHA and VA loans. For  example, between fiscal years 1998 and 2004 Ginnie Mae securities  financed between about 84 percent and 96 percent of FHA-insured  single-family loans (see fig. 2). In fiscal year 2004, Ginnie Mae issued a total  of $149.1 billion in MBS. These MBS financed 91 percent of all eligible loans  insured or guaranteed by FHA and VA.

Federally insured and  guaranteed loans can be expected to appeal to conventional securitizers  because these loans carry little to no credit risk. However, Ginnie Mae has  consistently captured 90 percent or more of the market for FHA and VA  loans. Market participants told us that Ginnie Mae captured most of the  market because of the difficulty of competing with the government  guarantee of timely payment. This guarantee helps Ginnie Mae securities command a higher price and, correspondingly, offer a lower yield than  other MBS of government-backed loans.", "We spoke with a number of secondary market participants that have or  could become active in the market for government-backed loans, including  the Federal Home Loan Banks, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, state and local  government agencies, and private label issuers. In general, they have had  limited or no involvement in Ginnie Mae\u2019s market. Moreover, for a variety  of reasons, they do not appear to have plans to encroach on Ginnie Mae\u2019s  market to any substantial degree, as the following examples illustrate:  The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBank) have mortgage programs  under which they purchase pools of conventional and federally insured  or guaranteed mortgage loans from member banks. First authorized in  1998, the programs go by the names of the Mortgage Partnership  Finance\u00ae program and the Mortgage Purchase Program. The programs  were attractive to lenders in part because lenders could use them to sell  their mortgages without paying guarantee fees. In 2000, FHLBanks took  over a significant amount of Ginnie Mae\u2019s market share and purchased  $12.7 billion in FHA and VA loans, representing about 11 percent of the  combined market for those loans. However, the Federal Housing  Finance Board, which oversees the FHLBanks, became concerned  because the program was intended to focus on conventional rather than  FHA loans. The board took measures to encourage the FHLBanks to  limit their purchase of FHA loans to no more than one-third of their  mortgage purchase program portfolio. After 2000, FHLBanks greatly  reduced their purchases of FHA loans. From 2001 to 2003, they  purchased loans representing about 4 percent to 5 percent of the FHA  market, which then declined further to about 2 percent in 2004.", "In fiscal year 2004, Fannie Mae purchased 4 percent of all FHA and VA  originations. Its share of FHA and VA originations has varied over time,  ranging from 1 percent to 6 percent between 1990 and 2004, or just 0.3  percent to 3 percent of Fannie Mae\u2019s total purchase activity. According  to Fannie Mae officials, these purchases of government loans consist  largely of repurchases of delinquent loans. A Fannie Mae official told us  the company did not systematically purchase FHA loans and in its  normal course of business did not consider itself a competitor with  Ginnie Mae. Fannie Mae does not receive credit from HUD toward its  affordable housing goals by purchasing government-backed loans.", "Freddie Mac has purchased less than 1 percent of the market of FHA  and VA loans each year since 1990.  Freddie Mac officials said that its  competition with Ginnie Mae is largely indirect, by encouraging  conventional lending to the most creditworthy low- and moderate-  income borrowers who might otherwise receive a mortgage through  FHA or VA. Freddie Mac officials also said they do not compete with  Ginnie Mae in the secondary market directly because it is hard to  compete with Ginnie Mae\u2019s government guarantee. In addition, as with  Fannie Mae, government-backed loans do not count toward Freddie  Mac\u2019s required affordable housing goals. Freddie Mac does purchase  some mortgage revenue bonds that are collateralized by FHA and VA  loans and directly purchases some FHA and VA loans that Ginnie Mae  does not securitize.", "State and local government entities, including housing finance agencies,  issue mortgage revenue bonds to raise funds in the capital markets for  mortgage lending. Because these bonds are tax exempt, investors are  willing to accept a lower interest rate for them. This interest savings is  passed on through lenders to lower-income families in the form of loans  with interest rates below the market average. These bonds often finance  government-backed mortgages. As of 2003, 71 percent of the mortgages  that revenue bonds financed were insured or guaranteed by a federal  program\u201458 percent by FHA, 10 percent by RHS, and 3 percent by VA.   The overall volume of mortgage revenue bonds issued was $10.7 billion  in 2003.", "Private label issuers purchased an estimated 3 percent of FHA and VA  loans in 2004. These issuers account for an increasingly large share of  the overall MBS market, but most of their market consists of loans not  offered by FHA and VA programs, such as jumbo nonconforming loans  and home equity lines of credit. According to RHS officials, private  label issuers do currently securitize the majority of Section 538  multifamily loans guaranteed by RHS, but these loans account for less  than 1 percent of Ginnie Mae\u2019s portfolio.", "Most of the competition for Ginnie Mae\u2019s market share does not come  directly\u2014that is, secondary market participants are not seeking to  purchase or securitize significant numbers of government-backed loans.  Rather, lenders compete with Ginnie Mae indirectly by seeking greater  market share at the origination level by making conventional loans to  borrowers who might otherwise use FHA and VA loan programs. Fannie  Mae and Freddie Mac have an incentive to serve this market because  lower-income borrowers who might otherwise turn to a government-  backed loan program can help them meet their housing goals established  by HUD. In addition, subprime mortgage originations have grown dramatically in recent years, as many lenders market to less creditworthy  borrowers who in the past may have received a government-backed loan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ginnie Mae\u2019s Share of the Total MBS Market Has Declined", "paragraphs": ["Although Ginnie Mae continues to finance the bulk of government-backed  loans, its share of the overall MBS market has declined substantially over  the past 20 years. As shown in figure 4, Ginnie Mae securities represented  42 percent of all new MBS issued in 1985, but only 7 percent in 2004. This  drop in market share of new issuance is due not to a significant decline in  Ginnie Mae\u2019s MBS issuance, but rather to rapid growth in the rest of the  market\u2014Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and private label issuers, which we  refer to as the \u201cconventional\u201d market for MBS. In 1985, Ginnie Mae MBS  issuance was $46 billion, while the conventional market issued $64 billion.  By 2004, Ginnie Mae issuance had grown to $127 billion, but issuance of  conventional MBS had grown to $1.8 trillion. MBS issuance has risen  among all segments of the conventional market. The rise in private label  MBS issuance has been particularly steep in the last few years, rising from  $136 billion in 2000 to $864 billion in 2004.", "Two factors have spurred the growth of the conventional MBS market: the  increasing number of conventional mortgage originations and the growing  proportion of these mortgages that are securitized. Mortgage lending in the  conventional market has grown much more rapidly over the last 20 years  than lending through FHA and VA programs. Conventional mortgage  originations rose from an estimated $243 billion in 1985 to an estimated  $2.8 trillion in 2004. In contrast, originations of FHA and VA loans rose from  $42 billion to $129 billion during that period. In addition, the rate of  securitization of conventional mortgages has risen rapidly over the last 20  years; by the end of 2004, almost half of outstanding mortgage debt was  financed through securitization, according to the Bond Market Association.", "Ginnie Mae\u2019s market share of outstanding MBS has also declined  significantly over the last 20 years, falling from 54 percent in 1985 to 10  percent in 2004.  Since 2000, Ginnie Mae\u2019s volume of MBS outstanding has  fallen from $612 billion to $453 billion in 2004, a drop of approximately 26  percent. The primary factor contributing to this decline has been the  increase in borrowers who have refinanced out of FHA and VA loan  programs into conventional loans. Falling interest rates and rising home  prices have led to a boom in refinancing over the last 10 years, particularly  from 1997 to 1999 and 2001 to 2004. At the peak of the refinancing boom in  2003, refinancings represented about 65 percent of mortgage originations.  As some borrowers with mortgages insured by FHA and guaranteed by VA  have built up equity in their homes, they have been able to refinance out of  these programs into conventional loans that may offer more favorable and  flexible terms and interest rates. This trend may have been facilitated to  some extent by the increased availability of loans to borrowers who are  less creditworthy. This has allowed some borrowers who would not  otherwise have been able to borrow in the conventional market to do so  rather than using FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed mortgage programs. The  decline in the outstanding volume of FHA and VA loans has led to a  corresponding decline in the outstanding volume of Ginnie Mae securities,  which are mostly composed of those loans.", "To a lesser extent, lender repurchases of delinquent FHA-insured and  VA-guaranteed loans in Ginnie Mae pools have also contributed to the  decline in Ginnie Mae\u2019s volume of outstanding MBS. Ginnie Mae\u2019s policy  prior to 2003 allowed lenders and servicers to repurchase loans that were  in their Ginnie Mae pools if the borrower missed just one payment that  remained unpaid for 4 consecutive months. According to Ginnie Mae, these  loans often had a low risk of default; the loan may have had only one  missed payment followed by resumption of loan servicing by the borrower.  However, lenders were able to profit by repurchasing these loans for the  remaining balance because, during an era of falling interest rates, the  market value of the loans was more than the remaining balance. Data  obtained from Ginnie Mae officials show that these repurchases of  delinquent loans reached a peak in 2002, when they totaled $22 billion, and  that they contributed to the decline in Ginnie Mae\u2019s outstanding volume. To  address this problem, Ginnie Mae announced a revision to its loan  repurchase policy in November 2002. Under the new policy, for pools  issued on or after January 1, 2003, servicers can repurchase delinquent  loans only when no payment has been made for 3 consecutive months.  Ginnie Mae officials as well as issuers we talked with said that these new  policies appear to have curtailed repurchase activity."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Changes in Ginnie Mae\u2019s Share and Volume Could Have Implications for Borrowers, the Liquidity of Its Securities, and Federal Revenue", "paragraphs": ["Ginnie Mae\u2019s share of the government-backed mortgage market has been  fairly constant. If other secondary market players substantially increased  their market share of government-backed mortgages, borrowers would be  unlikely to see higher interest rates or tighter credit immediately, because  such players would need to offer products that were competitive with  Ginnie Mae\u2019s. However, a decline in the proportion of high-quality  mortgages included in Ginnie Mae\u2019s MBS could lower their overall credit  quality, potentially raising the cost of servicing the underlying mortgages  and thus interest rates paid by borrowers. In addition, any decline in the  volume of Ginnie Mae\u2019s MBS could potentially reduce their liquidity,  although it is unclear whether reduced liquidity is likely to be a significant  concern in the foreseeable future. Finally, declines in Ginnie Mae\u2019s  outstanding volume would reduce its fee revenue from its MBS programs.

In such a scenario, interest rates would probably not rise or  credit tighten for borrowers because such players would need to offer  products that were competitive with Ginnie Mae\u2019s, thus benefiting  borrowers to a similar degree.

However, those FHA and VA borrowers who are able to take  advantage of refinancing options are generally the most creditworthy of the  programs\u2019 borrowers. The result has been a decline in the overall credit  quality of FHA and VA loans in recent years indicated by increased default  and foreclosure rates in government mortgage insurance and guarantee  programs. As a result, the loan quality underlying Ginnie Mae\u2019s securities  has declined. Thus far, investors have not been directly affected by this  development because of the government guarantee.", "However, the cost of servicing the government-backed loans in Ginnie  Mae\u2019s pools could rise in such a scenario, since managing delinquencies  and the foreclosure process is the most costly component of servicing.  According to Ginnie Mae, the servicing fees issuers are allowed to charge  are sufficient to cover any significant increase in servicing costs resulting  from declines in credit quality. However, increased servicing costs could  result in smaller profits for Ginnie Mae issuers, potentially reducing  lenders\u2019 willingness to make government-backed loans and increasing  borrowers\u2019 interest rates.

Among the significant market changes over the last  20 years have been the growing availability of private mortgage insurance  and subprime loans, rapid development of the conventional secondary  mortgage market, alterations in the volume and characteristics of  government-backed loan programs, and the proliferation of new mortgage  loan products, such as hybrid ARMs. Ginnie Mae recently completed or has  under way several initiatives that are likely to help respond to the needs of  its stakeholders in a changing marketplace, although additional efforts may  be needed in some areas. Among the steps Ginnie Mae has taken are the  following:  As part of its Business Improvement Initiative, in October 2004 Ginnie  Mae began a formal process of soliciting recommendations from  business partners and other stakeholders to improve its MBS and  Multiclass Securities programs. In March 2005, the agency publicly  released the suggestions it had received, including, among others,  changing technological processes and developing new securitization  products. Ginnie Mae officials say they are currently in the process of  evaluating the suggestions.", "Ginnie Mae played a role in developing FHA\u2019s hybrid ARM products.", "Ginnie Mae and FHA officials say that they worked together to  encourage Congress to permit FHA to insure hybrid ARMs, in large part  because the agency wanted to remain competitive with conventional  markets, in which such products had become increasingly popular.  Ginnie Mae developed a securitization program, as Ginnie Mae II  securities, for these products, and in 2004 FHA began offering 3-, 5-, 7-,  and 10-year hybrid ARM products in addition to its standard 1-year ARM.", "In February 2005, Ginnie Mae began guaranteeing securities backed by  RHS multifamily loans, which support affordable multifamily housing in  rural areas. RHS officials told us that this created the first consistent  secondary market for these loans and that Ginnie Mae\u2019s involvement  would increase access to these loans and would lower borrower costs  by increasing lenders\u2019 liquidity. The officials also noted that Ginnie Mae  had actively supported RHS by ensuring that the multifamily loan  program could be securitized as Ginnie Mae I securities.", "The Ginnie Mae II Program was created to provide issuers and investors  with more flexibility in pooling different kinds of loans\u2014such as  adjustable rate mortgages\u2014into Ginnie Mae securities. By their nature,  Ginnie Mae II securities are less homogeneous than Ginnie Mae I  securities. As a result, they are considered less predictable and investors  demand a higher yield from these securities. In 2003, the Ginnie Mae II  product was restructured to make it more competitive. Among other  changes, the agency narrowed the spread on the note rates that could be  included in the pools, so that the loans backing the securities would be  more homogenous.  In addition, the range of servicing fees that issuers  could charge was widened to provide more flexibility. As a result, Ginnie  Mae says there is now a smaller gap in pricing between Ginnie Mae I and  Ginnie Mae II securities. But one broker-dealer we spoke with  complained that to ensure sufficient loan volume for a Ginnie Mae II  pool, issuers sometimes must include mortgages that would otherwise  qualify for a Ginnie Mae I.", "In July 2004, Ginnie Mae expanded its Targeted Lending Initiative, which  was created to provide financial incentives for lenders to increase loan  volumes and raise homeownership levels in underserved areas. Under  the program, which began in 1996, Ginnie Mae reduced its guarantee fee  by up to 50 percent for approved issuers that originate or purchase  eligible loans in designated communities and place them in Ginnie Mae  pools. The expansion brought additional areas into the program,  including \u201ccolonias\u201d along the Southwest border region and additional  Renewal Communities and Urban Enterprise Zones designated by  HUD. In September 2005, Ginnie Mae announced it was temporarily  expanding the Targeted Lending Initiative further to include counties in  the states of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi that were declared  federal disaster areas as a result of Hurricane Katrina.", "Ginnie Mae still faces certain barriers to financing government-backed loan  programs. For example, VA and Ginnie Mae officials have expressed  concern that recently enacted changes in the law authorizing certain hybrid  ARM products in VA\u2019s loan guarantee program did not address a limitation  that has made these products difficult to securitize. Although the Veterans  Benefits Act of 2004 made certain modifications to the program\u2019s  provisions for adjusting interest rates for VA\u2019s 5-, 7-, and 10-year hybrid  ARM products, the act continued a restriction on annual rate adjustments  (those made after the initial rate adjustment) to a maximum increase or  decrease of 1 percentage point. While this restriction may benefit  borrowers by limiting interest rate increases, Ginnie Mae and VA officials  said that a 1 percentage point annual cap was inadequate to attract interest  from investors who purchased such products. Further, the terms of VA\u2019s  hybrid ARM products are no longer the same as the corresponding hybrid  ARMs offered by FHA, bifurcating the market and making securities  containing these types of loans less liquid. According to Ginnie Mae, this  lack of liquidity results in higher interest rates for veterans and  nonveterans alike. VA officials said that the capital markets and Ginnie Mae  may not have been sufficiently consulted on this adjustment during the  legislative process to ensure that provisions in the VA hybrid ARM program  were consistent with the requirements of Ginnie Mae and conventional  secondary markets.", "A similar situation occurred with respect to an FHA single-family insured  ARM product. The fiscal year 2002 VA/HUD appropriations bill limited  annual interest rate adjustments on FHA\u2019s hybrid ARMs to 1 percentage  point if the initial interest rate term was fixed for 5 years or less and  imposed a lifetime cap of 5 percentage points. These caps were intended  to assist FHA borrowers, but lenders and capital market participants  expressed concern that Ginnie Mae securities backed by these ARMs  would be unattractive to investors\u2014and thus lenders\u2014since equivalent  products in the conventional market typically included annual caps of 2  percent and lifetime caps of 6 percent. In response, an amendment to the  authorizing legislation, enacted in December 2003, made the annual cap  applicable only to loans having a fixed term for the first three or fewer  years\u2014a change that FHA said was needed to meet the needs of home  buyers, lenders, and the secondary mortgage market. Following the 2003  amendment, FHA issued an interim final rule in March 2005 that raised the  cap on adjustments to annual interest rates for 5-year ARMs from 1 to 2  percentage points and raised the lifetime cap on interest rate adjustments  for those loans to 6 percentage points. Ginnie Mae officials noted that  these problems could have been avoided had Congress initially consulted  more closely with capital market participants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ginnie Mae Is in the Process of Expanding Disclosure on Loan Information to Help Investors Better Predict Prepayment", "paragraphs": ["Investors in Ginnie Mae securities do not face credit risk, since the  mortgages underlying these securities are federally insured or guaranteed  and because Ginnie Mae guarantees timely payment of principal and  interest. However, MBS investors do face prepayment risk, because they  are purchasing cash flows that can stop when borrowers pay their loans in  full early. Mortgage loans are prepaid for several reasons, most commonly  when the house is refinanced, sold, or destroyed, or when the borrower  goes into foreclosure. Prepayment rates tend to increase in periods of  declining interest rates, when borrowers have the opportunity to lower  their interest payments by refinancing. When mortgages are prepaid,  voluntarily or involuntarily, investors receive their principal, but not further  interest payments. In an environment of declining interest rates,  prepayments may force investors to reinvest prematurely at a lower  interest rate and to incur transaction costs.", "Historically, the rate of prepayment for Ginnie Mae securities has been  lower than for other MBS because borrowers of government-backed  mortgages are generally first-time or low- to moderate-income home buyers  who are less likely to be able to incur the cost of refinancing or relocating.   According to research by securities trading firms, between 1980 and 1990  Ginnie Mae securities consistently prepaid at lower rates than their  conventional counterparts. However, since that time, prepayment rates for  conventional MBS have changed relative to those for Ginnie Mae MBS.  Since 1990, Ginnie Mae\u2019s prepayment rates have been slower than those of  their conventional equivalents in the initial 18 months to 2 years after loan  origination. But after this initial period, as the loans seasoned, Ginnie Mae\u2019s  prepayment rates have generally risen compared with conventional MBS.  Ginnie Mae securities backed by seasoned loans are currently prepaying at  a much faster rate than did similar securities during the 1990s.", "Three factors in particular seem to have influenced the increase in Ginnie  Mae\u2019s rate of prepayment\u2014refinancings, delinquencies, and repurchases.  As explained earlier, expanded access to credit, rising home prices, and  falling interest rates have allowed more FHA and VA borrowers to  refinance into conventional loans. With the added equity built up in their  homes, borrowers have been able to reduce their monthly costs by  refinancing without paying the federal programs\u2019 insurance premiums. In  addition, delinquency and default rates for FHA and VA loans\u2014which have  traditionally been higher than those for conventional loans\u2014have been  steadily increasing in recent years. The delinquency rate on all FHA  mortgages increased from 6.7 percent in 1990 to 12.2 percent in 2004. By  contrast, the delinquency rate for conventional mortgages has remained  relatively stable and stood at 1.6 percent in 2003. Finally, as noted earlier,  before July 2003 Ginnie Mae\u2019s policy allowed loan servicers to repurchase  loans from Ginnie Mae\u2019s pools if a borrower missed only one payment and  left it unpaid for 4 months. These repurchases, which peaked in 2002,  caused a temporary acceleration in the prepayment rates of Ginnie Mae\u2019s  MBS.", "Market participants we met with expressed concerns about the accelerated  rate of prepayment on Ginnie Mae securities in recent years. Institutional  investors often employ complex models\u2014which rely in part on detailed  information about the underlying loan pools\u2014to forecast prepayment rates  and help price MBS. Investors we spoke with noted that predicting  prepayment risk on Ginnie Mae securities had become increasingly difficult  because of rapid shifts in the marketplace, such as the expansion in the  availability of conventional credit and increases in FHA and VA  delinquencies, and uncertainty about future developments.", "In the past, the securities industry has also expressed concerns that  developing models to predict prepayment of Ginnie Mae MBS has been  particularly difficult because Ginnie Mae has not always provided the same  degree of detail on its loans as conventional securitizers. In written  comments to Ginnie Mae, the Bond Market Association\u2014a trade  association representing securities dealers\u2014said that while Ginnie Mae  had begun providing more information than ever before about the  mortgages backing its securities, there was still \u201csignificant room for  improvement.\u201d One broker-dealer noted to us that information was  particularly lacking on hybrid ARM products in Ginnie Mae pools. A second  broker-dealer said that additional information on geography and occupancy  rates for multifamily loans would help better estimate the risk of  delinquency\u2014and thus prepayment\u2014of securities backing those loans.  Market participants also noted that having information on borrower credit  scores would be useful.", "To address concerns about its disclosures, in January 2004 Ginnie Mae  began its MBS Disclosure Initiative, which was designed to provide  investors with additional information that would allow them to better  forecast prepayment rates. Prior to the initiative, Ginnie Mae\u2019s disclosures  on the loans underlying its securities included such things as the weighted  average age of the loan, the number of loans in the pool, the unpaid  principal balance, and the average original loan size. With the initiative, the  agency began providing expanded disclosures\u2014at issuance\u2014of loan data  that it was already collecting and began disclosing new data items about  FHA and VA single-family loan pools, including original loan-to-value ratios,  loan purpose, property type, average original loan size, and year of  origination. In addition, in September 2004 Ginnie Mae began updating its  MBS disclosures every month instead of quarterly. Ginnie Mae said that in  December 2005 it would begin disclosing additional details on the reasons  for prepayments of the loans backing Ginnie Mae MBS, including the  number of loans that were paid off in full by borrowers, repurchased by  issuers because of delinquency, and liquidated due to foreclosure. Ginnie  Mae officials told us that the recent changes made disclosures on Ginnie  Mae securities comparable with those for Fannie Mae\u2019s and Freddie Mac\u2019s."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Caps on Ginnie Mae\u2019s Commitment Authority Have Created Potential Constraints", "paragraphs": ["In developing its annual budget, Ginnie Mae officials told us they must  estimate the amount of the agency\u2019s commitment authority\u2014the limit on  the total dollar volume of securities that the agency can guarantee. The  Office of Management and Budget reviews Ginnie Mae\u2019s commitment  authority estimates before they are finalized and included in the President\u2019s  budget request to Congress. Ginnie Mae estimates the amount of the  commitment authority it will need for future years based on the actual  authority used by the federal guarantee programs it served in the previous  year. The agency also considers commitment authority allocations it  actually made to issuers in the previous year and includes them as part of  the estimate, adding an additional percentage to that estimate to cover  unanticipated events in the marketplace. The Secretary of HUD is required  by statute to notify Congress when Ginnie Mae has utilized 75 percent of its  commitment authority and when HUD estimates that the agency will  exhaust this authority before the end of a fiscal year. If Ginnie Mae  exhausts the limit placed on its commitment authority, it must suspend  issuance of new MBS until Congress provides additional authority. Under  these circumstances, an issuer may either have its request returned or  leave it with Ginnie Mae to be processed on a first-come, first-served basis  after additional commitment authority is restored.", "In 1999, fearing it would reach the limit before the end of the year, Ginnie  Mae instituted procedures to ration its commitment authority. It  temporarily limited the approval of commitment requests to the amount  estimated to cover issuer needs for no more than a 60-day period.  According to industry participants we spoke with, this step was disruptive  to lenders and issuers and caused concern that Ginnie Mae would not have  the authority it needed to honor commitments it had already made. One  trade association told us that that this situation had resulted in some loss of  credibility for Ginnie Mae.", "According to Ginnie Mae, the agency had not adequately estimated the  demand for its guarantee in 1999, in part because of unexpectedly high  levels of new construction and mortgage refinancing activity that year.  Since that time, the agency has taken steps to help ensure that it is no  longer in danger of reaching the limit of its commitment authority. Since  2002, the commitment authority Ginnie Mae has received as part of HUD\u2019s  annual appropriations is available for 2 years. Congress annually provides  commitment authority but the authority is available for two years. This  means Ginnie Mae can use \u201ccarryover\u201d authority from the prior year to  make current year commitments. According to agency officials, this change  from a 1- to a 2-year cycle has given Ginnie Mae more flexibility in planning  how to use its commitment authority and should reduce the need to ration  it again in the future. In addition, the actual commitment authority  available to Ginnie Mae at any given time may be above the additional  amount authorized annually, because since fiscal year 2002, the agency has  carried over unused authority from the prior year. Thus, as shown in figure  6, although Ginnie Mae\u2019s new commitment authority limit has been $200  billion each year since fiscal year 1999, the actual authority available for  Ginnie Mae to use has been higher beginning in 2002. In fact, in fiscal year  2003, Ginnie Mae was able to meet program demands. Having the ability to  rely on unused authority carried over from prior years has meant that the  agency has not had to ration or suspend issuer commitments since 1999.  Thus, if Ginnie Mae exceeds its annual commitment limit, for a particular  year, it has the authority to do so but only to the extent of its carryover  authority. However, given uncertainty of demand in the marketplace,  carryover authority still may not be enough.", "Federal agencies often face difficulties estimating potential demand for  loan guarantees, in part because the budget process requires them to  forecast demand nearly 2 years in advance. Our 2005 report on the FHA and  RHS loan guarantee programs discussed options that Congress could  consider to prevent suspensions of those programs related to exhaustion of  their commitment authority. Some of the options discussed in that report  could be applicable to Ginnie Mae. For example, Congress could establish a  higher limit on Ginnie Mae\u2019s commitment authority, although such a step  could increase the government\u2019s exposure to risk. Congress could also  require Ginnie Mae to provide more frequent updates on the amount of  commitment authority it has used. This would involve little additional  administrative burden and would provide additional and timelier  information for determining whether to provide supplemental commitment  authority before the end of a fiscal year. Because both of these options  could have various implications, their specific impacts would depend on  how the changes were structured and implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ginnie Mae Has Taken Steps to Improve Its Data Integrity, but Improvements Are Not Yet Complete", "paragraphs": ["In November 2002, officials of First Beneficial Mortgage Corporation, one  of Ginnie Mae\u2019s approved issuers, were convicted of engaging in fraudulent  pooling practices. According to information from HUD\u2019s Office of the  Inspector General (OIG) the company used forged documents to pool loans  that were collateralized with nonexistent properties and that were not  insured or guaranteed by a federal agency, as required of Ginnie Mae  securities. Ginnie Mae declared First Beneficial in default and incurred a  loss of approximately $20 million. HUD\u2019s OIG, among others, investigated  the First Beneficial case and subsequently audited Ginnie Mae\u2019s internal  controls, completing its report in March 2003. The investigation and audit  identified inconsistencies and inaccuracies in Ginnie Mae\u2019s data systems  and other internal control weaknesses. Most notably, the OIG found that  Ginnie Mae, its issuers, and the agencies it serves did not all use a single  common and unique case number as the primary management control for  identifying and tracking loans in the MBS pools. Instead, each entity  assigned its own tracking number, making comparisons of loan data  difficult and hindering efforts to ensure that the loans in Ginnie Mae\u2019s pools  were federally insured or guaranteed. The OIG\u2019s report also found that  Ginnie Mae did not have adequate controls in place to ensure the reliability  of its data\u2014for example, it could not ensure the accuracy of its data entry  procedures, had not sufficiently verified all loans to ensure they were  federally insured or guaranteed, and did not make sure that all issuers were  in fact eligible to issue Ginnie Mae securities. As a result, Ginnie Mae  potentially could not identify ineligible loans in its pools.", "Ginnie Mae has taken several measures to address many of the internal  control and data weaknesses identified in the HUD OIG\u2019s reports.

Further, 99 percent of Ginnie  Mae\u2019s portfolio is made up of loans backed by FHA and VA, and the agency  now matches the loans in its data systems against those in FHA\u2019s and VA\u2019s  databases. However, Ginnie Mae, FHA, and VA still do not use the same  case numbers, which would eliminate the need for time-consuming  matching.

For example, Ginnie Mae was initially unable to provide us with a  breakdown of loans in its portfolio\u2014that is, percentages of FHA, VA, RHS,  and PIH loans. This basic data could not be provided, the agency said,  because a programming error had resulted in the underreporting of FHA  loans and the overreporting of VA loans.

Our 1993 review of Ginnie Mae\u2019s staffing found that the  agency was not adequately monitoring its contractors\u2019 activities. At that  time, the largest contractor told us the agency did not have the resources to  adequately review its contractors\u2019 work, and Ginnie Mae itself  acknowledged that it did not. Similarly, in a 1997 review of HUD\u2019s  contracting activity, HUD\u2019s OIG found that Ginnie Mae was not in  compliance with contracting and procurement procedures. The review  found that in some instances Ginnie Mae contractors were performing  tasks that were inherently governmental functions and that aspects of the  bidding process hindered competition. At that time, Ginnie Mae had its  own contracting officer; however, as of January 1999, Ginnie Mae began  using HUD\u2019s contracting officer and its staff to award contracts.", "Internal control issues continue to be a potential concern at Ginnie Mae, as  evidenced by losses due to fraud in the First Beneficial case, the HUD OIG\u2019s  2003 report, and our own findings of problems with some aspects of the  agency\u2019s management information systems.

We tested  the reliability of these data by comparing them within the two data systems  and with data from the 2005 Mortgage Market Statistical Annual and the  Bond Market Association\u2014sources used widely in the industry to analyze  MBS activity. We also compared loan data provided by Ginnie Mae with  data maintained by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Rural Housing  Service (RHS), and the Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH) within  the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).", "Our initial comparisons showed significant discrepancies between Ginnie  Mae\u2019s source data and that of industry sources. Because Ginnie Mae\u2019s MBS  issuance and agency loan endorsement do not occur simultaneously, a lag  exists between the date that the loan is endorsed and the date Ginnie Mae  is recorded as guaranteeing its securitization. Thus, to provide accurate  information on Ginnie Mae\u2019s market share and volume for a given point in  time, individual loans must be matched to the Ginnie Mae MBS in which  they were pooled. When we began our review, no data for VA, RHS, or PIH  loans had been matched with their pool, and data for Federal Housing  Administration (FHA) loans had been matched only since 2001. At our  request, Ginnie Mae completed the matching of FHA data from 1998 to  2004.", "Our initial comparison of the portion of Ginnie Mae\u2019s MBS portfolio  collateralized by each loan program\u2014that is, by FHA, VA, RHS, and PIH\u2014 showed discrepancies as well. As previously discussed, Ginnie Mae could  provide us only with estimated percentages because a programming error  in the system resulted in the underreporting of FHA loans and the  overreporting of VA loans. Because of our request, Ginnie Mae noticed the  error and corrected it, and we were able to obtain accurate data on the  percentage of loans from each program that were used to collateralize  Ginnie Mae MBS. With the corrections Ginnie Mae made, we found the data  to be reliable for our purposes.", "To address all of the objectives, we spoke with and gathered relevant  documents from secondary market participants, including five Ginnie Mae- approved issuers and five dealers/institutional investors in Ginnie Mae  securities. Among other things, we discussed with them their perceptions  of Ginnie Mae and its products and their reasons for investing in or issuing  Ginnie Mae securities rather than other MBS products. The issuers were  judgmentally selected and represented more than 46 percent of the MBS  Ginnie Mae issued in 2003. Three of the issuers focused on single-family  FHA loans and the remaining two on multifamily and VA loans.  Dealers/institutional investors were also judgmentally selected; among  them were the largest broker-dealers of Ginnie Mae MBS, Real Estate  Mortgage Investment Conduits, and Platinum securities. We also  interviewed and obtained documentation from representatives of  secondary market participants that may compete with Ginnie Mae,  including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the National Council for State Housing  Finance Agencies, and the Federal Home Loan Banks of Chicago and  Seattle. We also interviewed representatives of and reviewed documents  from Ginnie Mae, HUD\u2019s FHA and PIH programs and its Office of the  Inspector General (OIG), VA, RHS, and the Federal Housing Finance Board.  In addition, we spoke with relevant trade associations, including the Bond  Market Association, National Association of Home Builders, Mortgage  Bankers Association, and National Association of Realtors. We conducted a  literature search and reviewed Ginnie Mae\u2019s legislative history, relevant  laws, regulations, budget documents, performance, and annual reports and  guidance, and studies and reports by HUD\u2019s OIG and others. We conducted  our work in Washington, D.C., and Boston from October 2004 through  September 2005 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of Housing and Urban Development", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Jason Bromberg, Assistant  Director; Heather Atkins; Daniel Blair; Christine Bonham; Diane Brooks;  Emily Chalmers; William Chatlos; Carlos Diz; Austin J.
