According to Census enumerations  of migrants in three affected jurisdictions\u2014Guam, Hawaii, and the  CNMI\u2014the total number of compact migrants in those jurisdictions  increased from about 21,000, estimated in the 2003 enumeration, to  about 35,000, estimated in the 2013 enumeration (see fig. 4). In 2011,  Census estimated that roughly 56,000 compact migrants\u2014nearly a  quarter of all FAS citizens\u2014were living in U.S. areas in 2005 to 2009.  About 58 percent of compact migrants lived in Hawaii, Guam, and the  CNMI at that time. Nine mainland U.S. states\u2014California, Washington,  Oregon, Utah, Oklahoma, Florida, Arkansas, Missouri, and Arizona\u2014 each had an estimated compact migrant population of more than 1,000.

In fiscal years 2004  through 2016, Interior distributed a portion of the $30 million annual  appropriation that was authorized and appropriated in the amended  compacts\u2019 enabling legislation to each affected jurisdiction according to  the size of its compact migrant population. Since fiscal year 2012, as  authorized by the amended compacts\u2019 enabling legislation, Interior has  also provided compact impact grants to affected jurisdictions from annual  appropriations, which it has also divided according to the size of their  migrant populations. Table 2 shows the compact impact grants that  Guam, Hawaii, and the CNMI received in fiscal years 2004 through 2016.", "The affected jurisdictions have continued to report to Interior that their  cost impacts from compact migrants greatly exceed the amount of the  compact impact grants. In 2003 through 2014, Guam reported $825  million in costs, Hawaii reported $1.2 billion, and the CNMI reported $89  million. (Fig. 5 shows the affected jurisdictions\u2019 reported annual costs of  services to compact migrants.) These affected jurisdictions reported costs  for the services identified in the amended compacts\u2019 enabling legislation:  educational, health, public safety, and social services. Education costs  accounted for the largest share of reported expenses in all three  jurisdictions, and health care costs accounted for the second largest  share. Officials in Guam and Hawaii also cited compact migrants\u2019 limited  eligibility for a number of federal programs, particularly Medicaid, as a key  contributor to the cost of compact migration borne by the affected  jurisdictions.", "We have previously found that the three affected jurisdictions\u2019 cost  estimates contained a number of limitations with regard to accuracy,  adequate documentation, and comprehensiveness. These limitations  affect the reported costs\u2019 credibility and prevent a precise calculation of  total compact cost impact on the affected jurisdictions. For example,  some jurisdictions did not accurately define compact migrants according  to the criteria in the amended compacts\u2019 enabling legislation, account for  federal funding that supplemented local expenditures, or include revenue  received from compact migrants. Many local government agencies did not  include capital costs in their impact reporting, which may have led to an  understatement of costs. We recommended that the Secretary of the  Interior disseminate guidelines to the affected jurisdictions that  adequately address concepts essential to producing reliable impact  estimates and that the Secretary call for their use in developing compact  impact reports. In a February 2015 report to Congress on the  Governors\u2019 compact impact reports, Interior noted that it had concerns  about the uniformity of compact impact reports, including the use of  different data gathering and formats by Guam and Hawaii. Interior  reiterated those concerns in its January 2016 report to Congress. While  Interior developed a draft of compact impact reporting guidelines in 2014,  it has not disseminated them to affected jurisdictions. In March 2016,  Interior stated that OIA, in consultation with the leaders from the affected  jurisdictions, would develop guidelines for measuring compact impact and  that the guidelines would be completed in December 2016.", "Since we reported on compact migration impacts in 2001, the three  affected jurisdictions have continued to express concerns that they do not  receive adequate compensation for the growing cost of providing  government services to compact migrants. For example, in his 2015  State of the Island address, the Governor of Guam noted that compact  impact reimbursement had been a topic of disagreement for decades and  criticized \u201cthe federal government\u2019s inability to live up to its promise\u201d to  help provide services to the compact migrant population. Similarly, in  Hawaii\u2019s August 2015 cost impact report to Interior, the Governor of  Hawaii noted that Hawaii had consistently advocated for an increase in  compact impact assistance to the affected jurisdictions and that providing  for direct federal assistance in programs such as Medicaid, Temporary  Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Supplemental Nutrition  Assistance Program (SNAP), and other means-tested public assistance  not currently available to compact migrants would significantly reduce  Hawaii\u2019s impact costs. The Governor further suggested that the  governments of the FAS be encouraged to utilize the financial support  they receive directly from the United States to contract services in the  United States for their citizens who choose to reside in the United States.", "In our 2011 report, we recommended that the Secretary of the Interior  work with the U.S.\u2013FSM and U.S.\u2013RMI joint management committees to  consider uses of sector grants that would address the concerns of FSM  and Marshallese migrants and the affected jurisdictions. While Interior  took initial steps to implement this recommendation and discuss compact  impact at the joint management committee meetings, the discussions  have not been continued. In March 2016, Interior OIA stated that the  concerns of FSM and RMI migrants and affected jurisdictions will be  discussed at future meetings of the joint management committees. In a  January 2016 letter accompanying its Report to the Congress: 2015  Compact Impact Analysis, OIA stated that increased oversight and  accountability are needed in the use of compact sector grants by the  FAS\u2014particularly for infrastructure grants for health and education\u2014and  that improving the quality of life for FAS citizens may help address the  migration from the FAS to the United States.", "Chairwoman Murkowski, Ranking Member Cantwell, and Members of the  Committee, this concludes my statement.
