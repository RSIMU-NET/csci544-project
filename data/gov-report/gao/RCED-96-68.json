For example, students in rural areas of Iowa are being taught Russian, music, and calculus by teachers in distant urban centers through two-way video communications. North Carolina has begun to link rural and urban hospitals to provide rural sites with access to medical specialists via video. A telephone company in Nebraska has created jobs in a small rural town by establishing a nationwide telemarketing business. Modern telecommunications can thus be used both to improve the delivery of services and to promote economic development.", "In figure 1.1, a technician at a hospital in Des Moines is transmitting an echocardiogram to be read by a specialist at the University of Iowa hospitals in Iowa City, Iowa\u2014100 miles away. Using advanced telecommunications instead of sending a tape by a 2-hour courier trip results in a quicker diagnosis and more timely treatment for the patient.", "While services such as two-way video are offered in some places in the United States today, they are not widely available because the current telecommunications infrastructure, notably the telephone system, was not designed to provide them. Billions of dollars worth of infrastructure improvements would be needed in order to quickly transmit data and high-quality video images throughout the nation. Some state governments are currently looking for ways to accelerate this investment and ensure that services will be affordable and widely available to their residents. The experiences of the states that have begun this process can provide critical information to federal policymakers and to other states as they revise their telecommunications policies and seek to develop a modern telecommunications infrastructure."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Competition Is Expected to Encourage Private Investment and Development of Modern Infrastructure", "paragraphs": ["Historically, private investors have financed the building of the United States\u2019 telephone system, the most widely available form of telecommunications infrastructure.

As of 1994, about 94 percent of American households had access to basic telephone services.", "Telephone companies are already improving their infrastructure to be able to provide advanced telecommunications services. This investment is occurring mainly in business districts and more densely populated residential areas. Profit incentives are not high for companies to provide such service in rural areas, where there are fewer businesses and the cost of delivering services is usually higher, unless financial support is available or cost averaging is applied. It is likely that private investment in advanced telecommunications will be slower in rural areas as well. Recent studies by the Department of Commerce and Office of Technology Assessment found that the use of telecommunications can be particularly beneficial to rural areas, where the population density is low. However, the distances between people in rural areas also increase the cost of providing these services. Some industry observers expect increased competition to lead to lower prices and more choices in telephone service. Others point out, however, that competition is less likely to develop in rural areas and that customers in these areas may be faced with higher prices because without subsidies or cost averaging, the prices for telecommunications services will likely reflect the higher cost of providing service there."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Infrastructure Upgrades Can Allow the Delivery of Advanced Services", "paragraphs": ["Advanced telecommunications services can be provided, in part, by upgrading the current telephone system\u2019s infrastructure to increase the capacity, or \u201cbandwidth\u201d of the telephone lines and switches. These upgrades include powerful new computer switches, complex software, and fiber optic cables that combine to form a high capacity, \u201cbroadband\u201d telecommunications infrastructure. The technologies that can be used for upgrades are diverse. For instance, replacing existing copper telephone lines with new fiber optic lines can dramatically increase capacity, enabling the lines to carry many thousands of times more data. In addition to telephone lines, other kinds of technologies\u2014including satellites, cellular telephones, and cable television systems\u2014can transmit information as part of the telecommunications infrastructure.", "Besides the infrastructure needed to move information over distances, advanced telecommunications depend on two other elements\u2014on-site equipment and switches that have been upgraded to handle larger amounts of information.

To answer the first two objectives, we used a case-study approach that included interviews with state and private-sector officials and reviews of state planning documents, audit reports, and network operation figures, as well as pertinent economic and demographic data for the states and the nation. To answer the second objective, we also examined the extent to which high schools in rural and urban areas have access to the states\u2019 networks.

At the time Iowa tried this strategy, uncertainties about the profitability of providing advanced services discouraged the telephone companies from accepting the risks of investing in the statewide network needed to provide these services. However, by the time Nebraska and North Carolina began their projects, the telephone companies had already begun to upgrade their facilities, by, for example, using more fiber optic lines.

According to state officials, the request had several technical flaws in it, and telephone company representatives were uncertain whether they would be able to recover the costs of building the system. Despite these uncertainties, the state received three bids to build the network. After reviewing these, the state announced its intent to award the contract to one of the companies. However, a challenge was filed and the intended award was overturned in March 1989.", "State officials ascribe the state telephone companies\u2019 lack of interest in the project to several factors. These include doubts about the profitability of the network, a belief that it would be too expensive, and hesitancy to make investments in a long-term project that might not allow them to recover their investment in an acceptable time frame. These officials also told us that they believe that the state\u2019s telephone companies were not prepared to make the internal policy decisions needed to make long-term lease agreements or ready to make infrastructure improvements as quickly as the state required.

Under Part III, Iowa is required by statute to lease fiber optic cable facilities from qualified private telecommunications providers. Thus, to connect the remaining sites, the state is contracting with private companies to provide the local connections.

For example, as a result of a meeting with several state telephone companies, Nebraska\u2019s Division of Communications has entered into 5-year agreements to buy frame-relay services at wholesale prices. At the same time, costs are reduced for the telephone companies because the state is performing functions, such as billing, that the company performs for other customers.", "North Carolina used a similar anchor-tenant arrangement to attract private investment. After deciding it wanted to make advanced telecommunications services available statewide, the State Controller\u2019s Office asked the local telephone companies to help develop the technical specifications required for this network. It then struck formal agreements with three major local telephone companies and a long-distance company to build the infrastructure needed for its applications. In return, the state agreed to pay rates based on estimates of a certain level of use, which were derived from the original projections of the number of sites to be connected and their levels of connection time. These rates are reviewed every 2 years and can be adjusted to reflect the actual usage if the state and the companies agree. By basing their rates on projected usage and allowing for changes based on actual usage, the telephone companies could plan to recover their costs in a time period they thought was reasonable.", "According to participants in the projects in Nebraska and North Carolina, these long-term agreements between the states and the telephone companies benefited the companies in the following ways: Investment risk was reduced by ensuring a stream of revenues to help recover the costs of installing the hardware.", "The infrastructure that was upgraded is owned by the companies, and any capacity not committed to the state could be sold to other customers.

For example, it has created a School Technology Fund from funds available from a planned program to winterize the schools and proceeds from the state lottery. Grants from this fund will be used to help schools with small budgets pay to prepare rooms and connect with the frame-relay network. Also, the state\u2019s Public Service Commission allowed telephone companies to use a tax windfall to help schools connect to the Internet instead of returning these funds directly to consumers.

This strategy makes network use more affordable for local sites, allowing them to purchase network time at prices 25-30 percent lower than those available on the open market. The Nebraska state government is also purchasing large amounts of capacity and reselling it to regional educational facilities at prices that state officials said were lower than the facilities could negotiate by themselves. As a large customer, the state has also obtained discounts of approximately 50 percent from telephone companies for schools that are using the network.", "All three states have also used direct subsidies to make the services more affordable. Iowa currently subsidizes school sites, paying $35 of the $40 an hour that schools are charged for using the network. A raise in this rate resulted in a dramatic decrease in video usage, and the $5 rate was reinstated after school officials indicated that they were unwilling or unable to pay more. In order to encourage participation in the frame-relay network, Nebraska paid the usage charges for all of the regional educational facilities connected to this system during the first year of the network\u2019s operation. In North Carolina, the legislature originally allowed state funds to be used for either site equipment or network costs. For the current fiscal year, the legislature approved funds averaging $2,800 per month for each site to subsidize network costs for those sites already connected to the network."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Sites Are Connected Already, but Even More Remain Unconnected", "paragraphs": ["Although the three states are still in the early stages of developing their networks, each has made progress in making advanced telecommunications services widely available to its citizens through organizations such as schools, hospitals, and government agencies. Iowa has completed two of the three parts of its project. As of October 31, 1995, it had connected 157 sites, and it plans to connect 474 more sites by 2000. Nebraska had connected over 400 schools (kindergarten through 12th grade) as of February 1996 and is working with a number of communities to help them develop demand for new applications. North Carolina has connected over 100 sites of the 800 sites the Governor\u2019s Office estimated that the state would connect by the end of 1999. However, in 1995 the legislature prohibited the use of state funds to connect additional sites without further legislative approval.", "Despite this progress, much remains to be done to make affordable advanced telecommunications services widely available. For example, despite each state\u2019s emphasis on improving and equalizing education, none of the three states had succeeded in connecting half of its high schools by November 1995. Nebraska had made the most progress, connecting 140 of its 300 high schools. More of the states\u2019 unconnected schools are located in rural counties, where students may be distant from urban centers.These counties also contain more of the states\u2019 high schools (see fig. 3.2).", "In Iowa and Nebraska, the connected high schools are spread fairly evenly throughout the states. In North Carolina, however, a larger number of counties do not have even one high school with access to its advanced telecommunications network. Figures 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5 show the geographic distribution of the connected high schools in each state by county. For all three states, maps showing the connected high schools relative to the total number of high schools in each county are presented in appendix I."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Lessons Offered by the Experiences of Three States", "paragraphs": ["The three states we studied recognized that planning and building an effective statewide advanced telecommunications network is an expensive undertaking that can require years to complete. Their experiences illustrate the importance of building and maintaining consensus among those parties that will be involved in constructing, financing, and using the network\u2014the telecommunications companies, anticipated users, state legislators, and state executive branch officials. Addressing the concerns of these parties can help prevent the construction delays and increased costs that result from disagreements and financial constraints. These lessons can be used by other state policymakers as they begin or expand their own advanced telecommunications projects, as well as by federal policymakers who are considering what role the federal government should play in developing a national information infrastructure."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Telecommunications Companies Need to See Return on Investment", "paragraphs": ["Securing the involvement of the telecommunications companies, whose existing telephone and cable television systems can form the basis of an advanced telecommunications network, is a key step, participants told us. Without cooperation from these companies, a state can build its own network, as Iowa did, but it will incur substantial construction and maintenance costs. Company representatives stressed that a company will only invest in upgrading its infrastructure if it expects to recover its investment in a reasonable amount of time. Such investment did not occur in Iowa, where, according to state and private-sector officials, the companies viewed the project as risky and had doubts about the profitability of building the network. Several factors contributed to this assessment, including the perceived technological risk and uncertainty about whether other customers would pay for such services.", "Conversely, Nebraska and North Carolina were able to encourage private investment because they worked with the companies to ensure that their proposals made \u201cbusiness sense.\u201d Both states involved the companies in decisions about the network\u2019s design so they would know how much investment was needed to provide the anticipated services. In Nebraska, this process resulted in adopting a system using well-known technology, thus reducing both the initial investment and ongoing usage costs. In North Carolina, the companies agreed to provide the state with a system based on state-of-the-art technology that was more expensive to install and use but could have a longer useful life. In both cases, the states and the companies agreed on a system that they believed was technically feasible as well as cost-effective. Both also entered into long-term agreements with customers (namely, the state) to guarantee a stream of revenue that the companies could use to repay their initial investments and thereby reduce their risks. Also, by working with the state, the companies could prevent the introduction of a potential competitor by heading off the construction of a state-owned network like the one built by Iowa. Finally, the companies recognized that they could benefit from the networks by selling advanced services to private customers and by using the network to attract new customers and retain existing ones."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agreeing With Potential Users on What the System Will Be Used for Is Important", "paragraphs": ["Involving the potential users, including local educators and medical professionals, state agencies, and businesses and trade organizations such as chambers of commerce, is also important to ensure general agreement about what services the network should provide. If the system does not meet the needs of the anticipated users, deployment can be slowed, thereby increasing costs for those who are using the system. For example, while North Carolina involved potential users during the planning for its network, the project has experienced slower-than-anticipated acceptance by some users because of the high cost of using the system. One reason for this lower acceptance is that the system was designed to carry two-way video to multiple sites. However, some of the schools that the state anticipated would use the network wanted to buy only access to the Internet at higher speeds than were available over conventional telephone lines, which is a less expensive service to provide. As a result, some users were unwilling to pay for the capacity to send and receive video images, when they would rather have had less expensive data connections. Since the rates the state pays the telephone companies were based on estimates of use that have not been met, these rates, and ultimately the rates charged to users, could go up to allow the telephone companies to recover their investment, further discouraging use of the statewide network.", "In Iowa, the development of the network was delayed by a disagreement over what services to offer. While the network was always intended to provide video communications for the state\u2019s schools, disagreement arose about whether it should carry telephone calls. Iowa\u2019s state auditor found that this lack of agreement caused several design changes, which slowed the progress of the network."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Local User Connections Often Depend on Funds That May Not Be Available in the Future", "paragraphs": ["As discussed in chapter 3, paying for equipment to connect to the network and paying the ongoing usage charges can represent a substantial investment by local users. The states expected local users to pay the costs associated with connecting to and using their networks. However, each state currently offers some type of financial assistance to help pay some of these costs. Only one of three states, though, has approved enough funding to connect all the users it planned for. In Nebraska, the state plans to connect all elementary and high schools to the Internet by 2000. The state legislature has approved $13 million for this purpose from a fund originally created to winterize the schools. According to a state education official, this amount should be sufficient to pay for connecting all of the state\u2019s schools to the Internet. Iowa enacted a plan to connect 474 sites to its network by 2000 but initially appropriated funds to pay for about 100 sites through fiscal year 1996. North Carolina has also approved state funds to assist users through 1996 but has not approved funds to assist current users in future years or to connect additional users. If the states do not commit additional funding, there is no guarantee that the sites that want to participate later will get the same assistance that the current sites are getting. As a result, some local sites may be less likely to connect to the networks if they have to pay more of the costs themselves.", "Some local organizations have also used grants from federal agencies to help pay for connection equipment. However, under recent proposals, some of the programs that provided these funds may be eliminated. For example, there are proposals pending in the Congress to eliminate funds for the Department of Education\u2019s Star Schools program, which helped pay for classroom equipment in Iowa. In addition, NTIA\u2019s information infrastructure grant program, which serves mainly rural and disadvantaged urban areas and provided grants in Nebraska and North Carolina, has been proposed for elimination.

In Iowa and North Carolina, where state funding was planned as a major source of resources for the project, it was necessary to request funding approval from the state legislature several times. Since both projects based their plans on future appropriations, they experienced delays when they did not receive the level of funds they anticipated. In Iowa, the legislature originally approved about $50 million over 5 years to construct that state\u2019s network. However, a series of reductions and redirections reduced that amount by over 50 percent to $23 million. In a report, the state auditor found that these shortfalls could impede the progress of the project. North Carolina\u2019s legislature approved $4.1 million for the project as requested in fiscal year 1993. In fiscal year 1994, the governor requested an additional $5.3 million for the project, but the legislature rescinded the original appropriation and approved $7 million. A report by the state auditor concluded that this uncertainty about funding left potential users in a quandary in trying to plan for participation in the network. More recently the legislature appropriated $2.5 million for use through June 1996\u2014again less than requested by the governor. In addition to providing less funding than requested, the legislature explicitly prohibited the use of state funds to connect additional sites to the network without further legislative approval. As a result, North Carolina has been able to connect far fewer sites than it had planned.", "Although Nebraska also planned a multiyear project, it did not rely on appropriated state funds.

According to those we spoke with, having someone who could serve as an advocate for the program despite changes in political leadership was helpful to maintaining the government\u2019s support for the project. For example, in Nebraska, the director of the Division of Communications, has worked on the project from its inception, through the governor\u2019s two terms of office. Despite changes in legislative support, North Carolina\u2019s project kept progressing, in part because of the efforts of the governor\u2019s technology advisor, who had been involved in the design of the project since its inception. In Iowa, the governor has been in a position to advocate the state\u2019s program for nearly 10 years as a result of being reelected to several consecutive terms in office.", "While an advocate can provide the vision that keeps the project on track, a lack of consistent and coordinated management can limit the effectiveness of the project. According to a report by Iowa\u2019s state auditor, the lack of a consistent management structure was one of the problems that hindered the implementation of the state\u2019s project. Responsibility for the project was initially split between the public television agency and the Division of General Services, which had three different administrators during the first 3 years of the project. It was not until 1994\u20143 years after network construction began\u2014that the legislature enacted a formal management structure, the Iowa Telecommunications and Technology Commission, to oversee the network\u2019s operations.", "Similarly, in North Carolina a 1992 performance audit report found that the state needed to restructure its governance of information technology and that it had not performed adequate planning for information technology. In response, the state formed the Information Resources Management Commission, which is responsible for setting state policy on information technology projects, including the statewide network. However, a 1995 report by the state auditor found that while progress had been made, the number of agencies and other organizations involved with the network raised the potential for problems due to a lack of coordination. The report recommended that the state\u2019s technology-related functions be further consolidated.

The officials also pointed out that the state legislature is currently considering a proposal to provide $150 million in educational technology funds.
