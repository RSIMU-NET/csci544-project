From fiscal years 2008 through 2014, annual grant rates for affirmative asylum applications (those filed with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) at the initiative of the individual and referred to an EOIR immigration judge) ranged from 21 to 44 percent. In the same period, grant rates for defensive asylum applications (those initiated before an immigration judge) ranged from 15 to 26 percent. Further, EOIR data indicate that asylum grant rates varied by immigration court. For example, from May 2007 through fiscal year 2014, the grant rate was 66 percent (affirmative) and 52 percent (defensive) in the New York, New York, immigration court and less than 5 percent (affirmative and defensive) in the Omaha, Nebraska, and Atlanta, Georgia, immigration courts.", "GAO found that certain case and judge-related factors are associated with variation in the outcomes of asylum applications. For example, applicants who were represented by legal counsel were granted asylum at a rate 3.1 (affirmative) and 1.8 (defensive) times higher than applicants who were not represented. After statistically controlling for certain factors, such as judge experience and whether or not the applicant had dependents, GAO found variation remained in the outcomes of completed asylum applications across immigration courts and judges. For example, from May 2007 through fiscal year 2014, GAO estimated that the affirmative and defensive asylum grant rates would vary by 29 and 38 percentage points, respectively, for a representative applicant with the same average characteristics we measured, whose case was heard in different immigration courts. In addition, GAO estimated that the affirmative and defensive asylum grant rates would vary by 47 and 57 percentage points, respectively, for the same representative applicant whose case was heard by different immigration judges. GAO could not control for the underlying facts and merits of individual asylum applications because EOIR's case management system was designed to track and manage workloads and does not collect data on all of the details of individual proceedings. Nonetheless, the data available allowed GAO to hold constant certain factors of each asylum application, enabling GAO to compare outcomes across immigration courts and judges.", "EOIR provides legal resources to targeted populations, including asylum applicants, through the Legal Orientation Program (LOP) and Legal Orientation Program for Custodians of Unaccompanied Alien Children (LOPC). EOIR and its contractor use LOP and LOPC site visits, monthly conference calls, and quarterly reports to monitor these programs. However, EOIR has not established performance measures, consistent with principles outlined in the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, to determine whether these programs are having a measurable impact in meeting program objectives.

Decisions on asylum applications can carry  serious consequences\u2014granting asylum to an applicant with a genuine  claim protects the asylee from being returned to a country where he or  she has been or could in the future be persecuted, but granting asylum to  an ineligible  individual jeopardizes the integrity of the asylum system.", "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) within the Department  of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Executive Office for Immigration  Review (EOIR) within the Department of Justice (DOJ) share  responsibility for the U.S. asylum system. USCIS asylum officers  adjudicate affirmative asylum claims\u2014that is, claims made at the initiative  of the individual who files an application for asylum with USCIS. If the  asylum officer does not grant asylum to an applicant who lacks lawful  status in the United States, his or her application is to be referred to EOIR  for adjudication during removal proceedings in immigration court. EOIR\u2019s  immigration judges adjudicate defensive claims, which are those claims  first raised during removal proceedings in immigration court as a defense  to removal from the United States, as well as affirmative asylum claims  referred by USCIS. According to EOIR, from fiscal years 2011 through  2015, EOIR\u2019s immigration judges completed more than 181,000 total  asylum applications in 58 immigration courts throughout the United  States.", "In 2008, we reported on our analysis of EOIR data from fiscal years 1995  through April 2007 on the outcomes of asylum applications across  immigration courts and judges. Specifically, we reported that there was  significant variation in such outcomes during that time period. For  example, we found that the grant rate for affirmative asylum applications  ranged from 6 percent in the immigration court in Atlanta, Georgia, to 54  percent in New York, New York; the grant rate for defensive asylum  applications ranged from 7 percent in Atlanta, Georgia, to 35 percent in  San Francisco, California, and New York, New York. On the basis of our  multivariate statistical analysis, we also reported that grant rates for  affirmative and defensive asylum applications were more than three times  higher for individuals who were represented by legal counsel. As a result,  we recommended, among other things, that EOIR address disparities in  asylum outcomes that may be unwarranted and identify immigration  judges who may benefit from supplemental efforts to improve their  performance. EOIR implemented this recommendation by providing  training to all immigration judges and conducting analyses comparing  asylum grant rates for judges before and after the training. We also  reported that EOIR expanded access to legal resources and information  for individuals in removal proceedings in immigration court. In addition,  since 2008, EOIR has also expanded its training program for new  immigration judges (see app. I for more information on EOIR\u2019s training for  immigration judges). In addition, we recommended that EOIR develop a  plan for supervisory immigration judges, including an assessment of the  resources and guidance needed to ensure that immigration judges  receive effective supervision. In response, EOIR analyzed the duties and  tasks performed by EOIR\u2019s Assistant Chief Immigration Judges (ACIJ),  who oversee EOIR\u2019s immigration judges. Among other things, in 2010,  EOIR published the ACIJ Handbook to assist ACIJs in carrying out their  roles as supervisors in immigration court.", "The Senate Appropriations Committee Report that accompanied the DHS  Appropriations Act, 2015, includes a provision for us to update our 2008  report.

Our  analysis included all completed asylum applications between October 1,  1994, and September 30, 2014, the most current data available at the  time of our analysis, that involved asylum applicants from (1) countries  with a minimum of 800 affirmative and 800 defensive completed asylum  applications during the time period; (2) immigration courts with a minimum  of 800 affirmative and 800 defensive completed asylum applications  during the time period; and (3) judges with a minimum of 50 affirmative  and 50 defensive completed asylum applications in their primary court  during the time period. This combination yielded a total of 740,922  individuals with asylum applications that were completed between fiscal  years 1995 and 2014 included in our sample. Of those, 595,795 (or 80  percent) were included in our analysis of asylum application completions  and asylum grant rates. We used data from EOIR\u2019s case management  system to identify immigration court proceedings where an immigration  judge had made a decision on an applicant\u2019s asylum application. We  assessed the reliability of the data used in our analyses through  electronic testing, analyzing related database documentation, and  working with agency officials to reconcile discrepancies between the data  and documentation that we received. We determined that the data on  completions of asylum applications were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our reporting objectives.", "To discuss the factors associated with variability in the outcomes of  completed asylum applications, we used multivariate statistical methods  to estimate an expected asylum grant rate for a representative applicant,  holding constant various characteristics of individual  cases, judges, and  courts. The scope of our analysis included the outcomes of all completed  asylum applications that met the screening criteria discussed above\u2014 specifically, we created an indicator for each application that reflected  whether the applicant received asylum. This allowed us to calculate  asylum grant rates as a proportion of all completed asylum applications.  Our analysis used a mixed logistic regression model to attribute the  unique contribution of certain factors in each completed asylum  application to variation in asylum grant rates. For a complete list of the  factors used in our analysis, see table 7 in appendix II. We modeled the  data separately by affirmative and defensive applications and time period.  Each applicant was associated with a judge, court, country of nationality,  and language. The results of our analysis allowed us to estimate the  range of expected affirmative and defensive asylum grant rates for a  representative applicant with the same average characteristics we  measured whose case was heard in different courts or by different  judges. EOIR\u2019s case management system was designed to track and  manage cases and does not collect data on all of the details of individual  proceedings. As a result, our analysis could not hold constant the  underlying facts and merits of individual asylum applications because  EOIR\u2019s case management system does not collect that information.

In particular,  we focused our review on the Legal Orientation Program (LOP) and the  Legal Orientation Program for Custodians of Unaccompanied Alien  Children (LOPC) because these are among EOIR\u2019s longest-standing legal  access programs, they have received more funding than EOIR\u2019s Office of  Legal Access Program\u2019s (OLAP) other programs, and they have served  tens of thousands of individuals at immigration courts throughout the  United States. Regarding LOP and LOPC, we examined documentation  outlining program objectives and deliverables, quarterly and annual  reports, site visit reports and evaluation reports. In addition, we analyzed  data on the number of individuals served by LOP (fiscal years 2008  through 2015) and LOPC (fiscal years 2011 through 2015). We also  interviewed EOIR officials responsible for overseeing the program. We  analyzed all of this information in light of principles outlined in the  Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993, as updated  by the GPRA Modernization Act (GPRAMA)  of 2010, to assess EOIR\u2019s  efforts to measure progress and results against performance measures.", "To address all three objectives, we reviewed EOIR documents describing  EOIR asylum applications statistics; policies and procedures related to  immigration court proceedings; manuals and documents describing EOIR\u2019s case management system; guidance and training provided to  judges for adjudicating asylum applications; and documentation on  EOIR\u2019s programs aimed at providing legal resources to individual  in  proceedings in immigration court. We also interviewed EOIR  headquarters officials responsible for overseeing immigration court  proceedings, EOIR\u2019s case management system, and immigration judge  training and guidance and legal access programs. We visited 10  immigration courts in Tacoma, Washington; Seattle, Washington; New  York, New York; Newark, New Jersey; Elizabeth, New Jersey; Los  Angeles, California; Adelanto, California; Miami, Florida; Krome, Florida;  and, Arlington, Virginia. At these locations, we interviewed supervisory  immigration judges, immigration judges, court administrators and  observed removal proceedings for individuals applying for asylum. We  interviewed supervisory immigration judges, immigration judges and court  administrators by telephone at two additional immigration courts in El  Paso, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia. We selected these sites based on a  variety of factors, including number of asylum cases adjudicated, courts  with dockets of individuals who are being detained by DHS throughout the  course of their immigration court proceedings, as well as courts with  dockets of individuals who are not detained, and a range of grant rates,  and circuit court jurisdiction. We also interviewed DHS attorneys  responsible for representing the U.S. government in removal proceedings  in immigration court and staff from pro bono/advocacy organizations  proximate to each immigration court to gain their perspectives on (1)  potential factors associated with changes in asylum applications  outcomes over time and (2) immigration court efforts to facilitate access  to legal resources for asylum seekers. The results from our site visits  cannot be generalized more broadly to all immigration courts or  immigration judges.

Immigration judges are to assess whether an applicant has  credibly demonstrated that he or she is eligible to be granted asylum, and  whether a grant of asylum is warranted as a matter of discretion. An  applicant is eligible for asylum if he or she (1) applies from within the  United States; (2) suffered past persecution, or has a well-founded fear of  future persecution, based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a  particular social group, or political opinion; and (3) is not statutorily barred  from applying for or being granted asylum. When making a credibility  determination, the immigration judge is to consider the totality of the  circumstances and all relevant factors. EOIR follows the same  procedures for defensive asylum applications and affirmative asylum  referrals from USCIS. For affirmative asylum referrals, the immigration  judge reviews the case de novo, meaning that the judge evaluates the  applicant\u2019s affirmative asylum application anew and is not bound by the  USCIS asylum officer\u2019s previous determination. As shown in Figure 1, in  conducting removal proceedings and adjudicating cases before them,  judges in immigration courts conduct an initial master calendar hearing to,  among other things, ensure the applicant understands the immigration court proceedings and schedule the merits hearing, during which the  judge hears claims for immigration relief, such as asylum.", "An individual in removal proceedings in immigration court may request  multiple types of relief before an immigration judge, and, if deemed  removable, the judge makes a decision as to whether the individual  satisfies the applicable eligibility requirements of any requested relief.  During the merits hearing, judges hear testimony from the respondent  and any other witnesses, oversee cross-examinations by DHS\u2019s U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) trial attorneys, and review  relevant evidence, including evidence related to claims for asylum or  other relief. Additionally,  the immigration judge may question the applicant  or other witnesses. Judges render oral or written decisions at the end of  immigration court proceedings. As a general matter, immigration judges  have discretion in rendering decisions under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.10(b), which  states that \u201cn deciding the individual case before them, and subject to  the applicable governing standards, immigration judges shall exercise  their independent judgment and discretion and may take any action  consistent with their authorities under the Act and regulations that is  appropriate and necessary for the disposition of such cases.\u201d In addition,  asylum is a discretionary form of relief under U.S. immigration law, in  contrast to a mandatory type of immigration relief or protection, such as  withholding of removal. With respect to asylum, section 208(a) of the  Immigration and Nationality  Act (INA) provides that the Attorney General  or the Secretary of Homeland Security may grant asylum to an applicant  who meets the definition of a refugee under INA  \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Outcomes of Asylum Applications in Immigration Court", "paragraphs": ["There are five possible outcomes of an asylum application\u2014grant, denial,  withdrawal, abandonment, or other.

LOP and LOPC  provide legal information through group and individual orientations, as  well as self-help workshops and pro bono legal referrals to those in  removal proceedings in immigration court. According to DOJ and EOIR,  LOP and LOPC are key efforts to, among other things, increase the  efficiency of immigration court proceedings and improve access to basic  legal services for individuals in such proceedings. For example, DOJ\u2019s  Congressional Budget Submission for Fiscal Year 2016 reported that  LOP is designed to assist detained individuals in making better informed  decisions earlier in their immigration court proceedings, thereby improving  access to basic legal services, especially for low income individuals, while  increasing the efficiency of the court hearing and detention process.  Regarding LOPC, in February 2016, EOIR\u2019s Director testified that LOPC  \u201chelps the immigration court process function more efficiently and  effectively by providing valuable information to the custodians of children  who arrive in the United States without a parent or guardian.\u201d", "Since 2005, EOIR has contracted with the Vera Institute of Justice (Vera),  which subcontracts with non-profit organizations, to administer LOP and  LOPC.

Regarding LOP, EOIR  officials stated that they have used many of the findings and  recommendations from a one-time evaluation of the program in 2008 as a  guide for monitoring LOP performance. The evaluation, conducted by  Vera at the request of EOIR, found that LOP participants moved faster  through immigration courts, received fewer in absentia removal orders  and that LOP could effectively prepare individuals to represent  themselves in immigration courts, among other things. In the 2008 LOP  evaluation, Vera also concluded that immigration judges stated that LOP  increased immigration court efficiency and detention facility staff stated  that LOP improved detention conditions.

Because of its ongoing  nature, performance measurement can serve as an early warning system  to management and as a vehicle for improving accountability to the  public.", "EOIR headquarters officials stated that they have not established  performance measures for LOP and LOPC because of the variation in  how providers operate these programs at detention facilities and non- detained immigration courts, which results in the inability to have a \u201cone- size fits all\u201d approach. Rather, EOIR headquarters officials explained that  program managers at headquarters regularly assess LOP and LOPC  sites on an individual basis to (1) identify the number of individuals served  by each full time staff position with the local subcontracted organization  and (2) determine whether demand for services has increased or  decreased. Based on this information, headquarters officials make  necessary adjustments, such as closing a site with decreased demand for  services and opening a new site with new demand. EOIR officials stated  that this process provides flexibility  to make changes at LOP and LOPC  sites as needed in response to differing conditions at each location.  However, EOIR has not established baselines for these data it collects  from Vera and therefore does not have adequate performance  measurements against which to compare the data to determine whether  the programs are achieving stated goals. Solely tracking increases or  decreases in program data, such as changes in the number of individuals  served in detention facilities, does not allow EOIR to fully evaluate its  LOP and LOPC programs as such changes in the data may not be an  indicator of program success or increased efficacy.

We focused  our review on the LOP and LOPC because these are among EOIR\u2019s  longest-standing legal access programs, they have received more funding  than EOIR\u2019s Office of Legal Access Programs\u2019 (OLAP) other programs,  and they have served tens of thousands of individuals since 2003 at  immigration courts throughout the United States.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2015 to October 2016  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Variation in asylum grant rates could arise from the facts and  circumstances of each case, and researchers have found that variation is  not unexpected given the institutional conditions under which judges  operate, including the particular requirements of the law, the standard  under which a judge may request corroborating evidence, and the  dif\ufb01culty of assessing credibility. We sought to hold constant relevant  variables at the case, judge, and court levels, to estimate the amount of  residual variation that remained across immigration judges and courts.", "Variation in asylum grant rates across immigration judges and courts  could reflect various other factors that are statistically correlated with  them. For example, if immigration courts tended to receive applications  from asylum-seekers of the same country of nationality, asylum grant  rates could potentially vary systematically based on nationality rather than  on the unique nature of the judge or court. Similarly, the quality and  accessibility of legal representation across the United States could  potentially affect the outcomes of asylum applications. Since immigration  judges\u2019 decisions on asylum applications may incorporate many factors,  such as credibility and the facts underlying the claims, simple univariate  comparisons of asylum grant rates across judges and courts cannot  distinguish among these various potential sources of variation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Design and Modeling Methods", "paragraphs": ["The data available from the Executive Office for Immigration Review\u2019s  (EOIR) case management system have a multilevel structure. Multiple  applications for asylum are clustered within the same judges, courts,  languages, and nationalities. These groups can be clustered among  themselves, with or without nesting. Our data processing, discussed  above, assigned one court to each judge, so that each judge was nested  within the court in which they adjudicated the most cases. The remaining  groups\u2014courts, languages, and countries of nationality\u2014were not  necessarily nested. Each language could have been associated with  multiple nationalities and vice versa. Each court could have been  associated with multiple languages and countries of nationality;  however,  in practice, courts could have heard cases from a predominate  combination of languages and nationalities, such as Chinese nationals  who speak Mandarin and apply for asylum in New York.", "The scope of our analysis included all completed asylum applications that  met the screening criteria discussed in appendix II  and that ended in  outcomes of grant, deny, withdrawal, abandonment, or \u201cother.\u201d However,  we dichotomized the outcome of interest to reflect whether the applicant  was granted asylum or the application ended with any of the other  outcomes. Expanding the scope of our sample to include all completed  asylum applications rather than only applications that were granted or  denied allowed us to analyze the outcomes of all completed asylum  applications. Dichotomizing the outcome produced asylum grant rates as  a proportion of applications originally filed that meet our screening criteria,  which prevented bias from potentially  changing withdrawal practices over  time.", "The data and outcome of interest suggested that a hierarchical or mixed  logistic regression model would adequately reflect the data generation  process. Accordingly, we developed a mixed model that represented the  grouping variables\u2014judge, court, country of nationality, and language,  respectively\u2014with random intercepts. Random effects allowed asylum  grant rates to be correlated within and across groups, which  parameterized our hypothesis that rates may systematically vary across  groups, all else being equal on the factors we analyzed. Random effects  made the model parsimonious because we could use the group variance  parameters to concisely describe variation across groups with many  levels. In contrast, modeling group variation with fixed effects would have  required estimating several hundred explicit parameters, one for each  group level, which would have consumed degrees of freedom and  complicated model interpretation.", "Substantively, random effects accurately represented the random  assignment of judges to cases, which EOIR generally uses as an  administrative policy. Random assignment of countries of nationality,  languages, and courts has less of a direct substantive interpretation, but  would be consistent with an underlying data generation process where  the sample of asylum cases heard in any particular time period would be  drawn from an underlying population distribution of immigration courts  and applicant nationalities and languages.", "We held constant case, judge, and court characteristics using covariates  with fixed parameters. The smaller number of parameters associated with  these covariates made a fixed effects approach easier to apply and  interpret. We assumed that the covariate effects did not vary across  groups, so that only the model\u2019s intercept varies randomly. We had no  prior expectation that specific covariate effects should have varied across  groups. Moreover, increasing the number of random effects would have  increased the complexity of the model and could have made it hard to  estimate computationally.", "We modeled the data separately by asylum type (affirmative and  defensive) and time period. This allowed all model parameters to vary  between asylum types and over time. The alternative approach, pooling  the data, potentially would have obscured important differences in the  affirmative and defensive asylum processes and important changes in the  processes over the 20 years that our data spanned. Specifically, we  modeled Yi, a dichotomous variable indicating whether applicant i in the  affirmative or defensive processes was granted asylum. Each applicant  was associated with a judge j, court c, nation n, and language l.  Consistent with a hierarchical logistic model, we assumed that  x denoted a vector of covariates with fixed coefficients \u03b2. \u03b1 (.) denoted  the group random effects, each of which was normally distributed and  centered on zero. \u03b1 was the population average intercept, with intercepts  for each group given by \u03b1 + \u03b1 (.).

However, we excluded several covariates that were unassociated with  outcome in that report and that were labor-intensive to measure. For  example, measuring a judge\u2019s prior work experience for our prior report  involved biographical research on each judge. Specifically, the covariate  vector x included the following: whether the applicant had one or more dependents (indicator); whether the applicant sought asylum within one year of entry into the United States (indicator); whether an applicant was represented by counsel recognized to practice in immigration court (indicator); whether the applicant was ever detained (indicator for being currently detained or having been detained and released, compared to never having been detained; defensive cases only);", "Presidential administration under which judges were appointed (vector of indicators, with the subsample mode set as the omitted level); judge years of experience (linear); judge gender (indicator); judge asylum caseload since October 1, 1994, the earliest date in our data, and in the 90 days prior to the completion of the asylum application, respectively (linear);", "Circuit court (vector of indicators, with the subsample mode set as the omitted level); and", "Court asylum caseload since October 1, 1994, the earliest date in our data, and in the 90 days prior to the decision, respectively (linear).", "For each subsample defined by asylum type (affirmative or defensive)  and period, we rescaled the continuous covariates such that the vector of  sample means equaled 0 and the vector of variances equaled 1.
