The fiscal year 2013 estimate was attributable to 84 programs spread among 18 agencies. The specific programs included in the government-wide estimate may change from year to year. For example, with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval, an agency can obtain relief from estimating improper payments if the agency has reported improper payments under a certain threshold for at least 2 consecutive years. A net of 10 additional programs were added to the government-wide estimate by OMB in fiscal year 2013 when compared to fiscal year 2012.", "For fiscal year 2013, GAO identified the federal government's inability to determine the full extent to which improper payments occur and reasonably assure that appropriate actions are taken to reduce them as a material weakness in internal control. In addition, existing internal control weaknesses at the agency level continued to increase the risk of improper payments occurring. In fiscal year 2013, four agencies did not report estimates for four risk-susceptible programs, including the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. HHS cited a statutory barrier that prevents it from requiring states to estimate improper payments for TANF. Estimates reported for two programs were also not included in the government-wide total because their estimation methodologies were not approved by OMB. Further, inspectors general reported deficiencies related to compliance with criteria listed in the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 for fiscal year 2013, such as the use of estimation methodologies that were not statistically valid.", "As GAO has previously found, a number of strategies across government, some of which are currently under way, could help to reduce improper payments. For example", "Analysis of the root causes of improper payments can help agencies target effective corrective actions. Some agencies reported root causes of improper payments using three error categories required by OMB (documentation and administrative, authentication and medical necessity, and verification). However, because the three categories are general, more detailed analysis to understand the root causes could help agencies identify and implement more effective corrective actions.", "Designing and implementing strong preventive controls can help defend against improper payments, increasing public confidence and avoiding the difficult \u201cpay and chase\u201d aspects of recovering improper payments. Preventive controls involve activities such as up-front validation of eligibility through data sharing, predictive analytic tests, and training programs.", "Implementing effective detection techniques to quickly identify and recover improper payments after they have been made is also important to a successful reduction strategy. Detection activities include data mining and recovery audits. Another area for further exploration is the broader use of incentives to encourage and support states in efforts to implement effective preventive and detective controls in state-administered programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to be here today to discuss the issue of  improper payments in federal programs and activities, including efforts by  federal agencies to identify and reduce improper payments.

The decrease in the fiscal year 2013 estimate  is attributed primarily to a decrease in program outlays for the Department  of Labor\u2019s (DOL) Unemployment Insurance program and decreases in  reported error rates for fiscal year 2013 for the Department of Health and  Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Medicaid and Medicare Advantage (Part C)  programs. The $105.8 billion in estimated federal improper payments  reported for fiscal year 2013 was attributable to 84 programs spread  among 18 agencies. Five of these 84 programs account for most of the  $105.8 billion of reported improper payments. Specifically, these five  programs accounted for about $82.9 billion or 78 percent of the total  estimated improper payments agencies reported for fiscal year 2013.

When excluding the DFAS Commercial Pay program,  the reported government-wide error rate was 4.0 percent of program  outlays in fiscal year 2013 compared to the revised 4.3 percent reported  in fiscal year 2012. In May 2013, we reported on major deficiencies in  DOD\u2019s process for estimating fiscal year 2012 improper payments in the  DFAS Commercial Pay program and recommended that DOD (1) develop  key quality assurance procedures to ensure the completeness and  accuracy of sampled populations and (2) revise its sampling procedures  to meet OMB guidance and generally accepted statistical standards and  produce a statistically valid error rate and dollar estimate with appropriate  confidence intervals. According to its fiscal year 2013 AFR, DOD is  reevaluating its sampling methodology for fiscal year 2014 for the DFAS  Commercial Pay program based on our recommendations. Consequently,  the fiscal year 2013 improper payment estimate for the DFAS  Commercial Pay program may not be reliable.", "Additionally, in fiscal year 2013, federal agencies reported improper  payment error rates for seven risk-susceptible programs\u2014accounting for  more than 50 percent of the government-wide improper payment  estimate\u2014that exceeded 10 percent. As shown in table 2, the seven  programs with error rates exceeding 10 percent ranged from 10.1 percent  to 25.3 percent.

Federal agencies have also  identified programs or activities that they have determined to no longer be  risk susceptible and therefore did not report improper payment estimates  for these programs. For example, with OMB approval an agency can  obtain relief from estimating improper payments if the agency has  reported improper payments under the threshold for significant improper  payments at least 2 consecutive years.
