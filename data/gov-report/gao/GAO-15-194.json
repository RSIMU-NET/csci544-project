From 1992 until 2012, State had a contract with a single insurer to supply all State's contractors working overseas with DBA insurance. In July 2012, State's single insurer program ended after State unsuccessfully sought to solicit a new DBA single insurer agreement and State transitioned to a system requiring its contractors to obtain DBA insurance on the open market.

Leading practices emphasize adequately documenting market research, allowing enough time to complete a solicitation, and collecting and analyzing data to select among alternatives, but State took limited measures to document the market research it performed and had little time to complete its 2012 solicitation. State included provisions in the solicitation to which insurers strongly objected, received no offers, and had to cancel the solicitation 3 days before its existing single insurer contract was to expire. As a result, State had to quickly transition to an open market system without weighing the relative costs and benefits to determine which insurance system best served its needs. Until State conducts such an evaluation, it cannot be assured that the open market system is the better alternative, and unless State incorporates leading practices into any future single insurer solicitations, it risks a similar outcome.", "GAO found that State contractors' DBA premiums increased following the transition, but the increases were in a range similar to those likely to have occurred if State had continued its single insurer program. For example, median DBA premium rates increased by $1.98 per $100 of payroll. GAO analysis also shows that the increase in DBA premium rates after the transition was in a range comparable to the increase in DBA premium rates requested by State's single DBA insurer, which said it had lost money under the prior contract.", "Existing data do not show a clear effect on small businesses resulting from State's transition to an open market system, but insurers and contractors have expressed concern that the change has had or could have an adverse effect. GAO analysis of federal procurement data from fiscal years 2009 through 2013 found a decrease in the percentage of contracts awarded to small businesses, but GAO could not link this to State's transition. Information GAO gathered from insurance industry officials and contractors shows that there is a potential for adverse effects, for example, denial of coverage and higher effective premium rates. State's policy is to maximize opportunities for small businesses, but it has not assessed whether its transition to an open market DBA system is affecting those opportunities. Without such an assessment, State cannot be assured that it is meeting its policy goal of maximizing opportunities for small businesses."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["State should (1) determine whether an open market system best suits its needs, (2) incorporate leading practices into any future single insurer solicitation, and (3) assess the effects of its transition on small businesses.

According to a September 2009  Department of Defense (DOD) report, with the increase in U.S. military  and civilian engagement throughout the world, the cost to the U.S.  government for DBA insurance premiums sharply increased during the  past decade; total premiums paid to the four largest DBA insurance  providers increased from approximately $18 million in 2002 to  approximately $400 million in 2007. Although more recent and  comprehensive data on the total cost for DBA premiums are not available,  data on the cost of DBA claims to the insurance industry suggest that  DBA premium costs have continued to rise.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) made a similar  transition from a single insurer program to an open market system in  October 2013, and we compared how State and USACE managed their  transitions to an open market system.", "To determine the extent to which State\u2019s transition affected DBA premium  rates paid by State contractors, we obtained data on DBA premiums and  premium rates from a random sample of 71 State contractors who  obtained contracts through State\u2019s Office of Acquisitions Management  and who performed work throughout State\u2019s transition to the open market  (fiscal years 2012 to 2013) in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Thailand, and  South Africa. We identified the set of countries by analyzing country  summary reports of contract actions for State and USAID in federal  procurement data for fiscal years 2010 through 2013, identifying the top  10 countries for each agency in terms of number of contract actions, and  choosing the countries that appeared in the top 10 list for both agencies.", "Results from analyzing this sample are generalizable to the population of  164 contractors that meet these selection criteria. We also conducted  interviews with insurers, brokers, contractors, and small businesses. We  compared the open market premium rates paid by the contractors in our  sample with rates that would have been charged by a single insurer in  two hypothetical scenarios under which State might have continued its  single insurer program. The hypothetical scenarios were calculated from  pricing information contained in State\u2019s most recent single insurer  contract, signed in July 2008, as well as official documents and  correspondence between State and its single insurer during the course of  that contract.

The cost of DBA insurance  premiums, if allocable and reasonable, is generally reimbursable under  government contracts. Under the War Hazards Compensation Act, the  government also reimburses insurers for DBA benefits paid if the injury or  death is caused by a \u201cwar-risk hazard,\u201d provided that the insurer did not  charge its customer a war-risk hazard premium. In addition to disability  and death payments, war-risk hazard benefits include funeral and burial  expenses, medical expenses, and reasonable costs necessary to process  the claims.", "In providing for DBA coverage, agencies mainly use one of two  approaches: a single insurer program or an open market system. For  instance, USAID has a single insurer program. DOD has generally  employed an open market system. USACE, however, had a single insurer  program from 2005 to 2013, and then transitioned to an open market  system. State adopted a single insurer program in response to a 1991  report by its OIG, which among other things, estimated that State could  save approximately 40 percent of its DBA cost by moving to a single  insurer program.", "Under a single insurer program such as the one implemented by State,  an agency selects one insurer to provide DBA insurance through a  competitively selected multiyear agreement. The resulting agreement sets  premium rates for the agency\u2019s contractors. The agreement may stipulate  that rates will remain fixed during the entire term of the agreement, or that  the rates may be adjusted up or down by mutual consent of the agency  and the single insurer. To obtain DBA insurance, the agency\u2019s contractors  contact a broker specified by the single insurer. The broker obtains the  contractor\u2019s statement of work, assigns the contractor to a service  category (for example, security), and collects premiums based on the  contractor\u2019s payroll and the premium rates for the service category. Under  State\u2019s single insurer program, DBA insurance was listed as a separate  line item on the agency\u2019s contract with each contractor.", "Under an open market system, contractors must independently obtain  DBA insurance coverage from an insurer licensed by DOL to underwrite  DBA insurance, and they usually do this through a broker. In this system,  agencies do not play a role in setting premium rates. Each contractor\u2019s  selected insurer issues a DBA insurance policy that fixes premium rates  generally for 1 year; after that, the rates and corresponding premiums can  move up or down based in part on the insurer\u2019s assessment of the  contractor\u2019s risk. The initial premium rate can vary by contractor based on  the insurer\u2019s assessment of the contractor\u2019s risk. Contractors with a  history of few or no claims can see a reduction in their premiums when  renewing their DBA insurance, while contractors with a history of many  claims can see an increase. To reduce the likelihood of claims,  contractors can sometimes participate in a risk assessment and reduction  program sponsored by their DBA insurer. According to State guidance  issued in August 2012, it is no longer required that DBA insurance be  identified as a separate line item on the agency\u2019s contract with each  contractor. Depending on the type of contract, a contracting officer may  include the cost of DBA insurance separately.

In 2008, State signed a similar contract  with the same single insurer, this one a 5-year contract consisting of a  base year and 4 option years. The premium rates for the base year, or  year 1, were fixed, but the contract allowed for adjustments in the rates by  mutual agreement for years 2, 3, 4, and 5, with any adjustments to be  based on cumulative losses sustained by State\u2019s single insurer since the  start of the contract.

In October 2012, it  prepared a decision paper to justify its  transition to the open market. It also prepared  a business case assessment weighing the  advantages and disadvantages of an open  market system.

During  the solicitation process, insurers asked State to withdraw this  provision. State acknowledged that insurers wanted this provision  withdrawn, but during the solicitation process State did not agree to  the insurers\u2019 request. State officials told us this provision was included  as a result of information, obtained through the request for information  and other sources, indicating that some contractors could save money  by purchasing insurance on the open market, and that it would allow  contractors dissatisfied with the performance of the designated insurer  to seek competitive alternatives if available.", "A \u201cblanket coverage\u201d provision required the single insurer to provide  coverage to all subcontractors, regardless of whether they were  explicitly identified or not in State\u2019s contract with the prime contractor.  State officials said they included this provision to ease the work of  contracting officers, who would otherwise have to obtain proof of DBA  coverage from individual subcontractors. In contrast, insurers  expressed two concerns. One expressed concern that the provision  contradicted applicable DOL regulations, making it harder for DOL to  process claims. Authorized DBA insurers are required to report to  DOL the names of every employer to which they have issued a DBA  insurance policy. According to one insurer, if a covered employee is  injured and reports the injury to DOL, DOL must identify the insurer  that is required to provide benefits to the employee; however, this is  difficult or impossible to do in the absence of information about which  contractors and subcontractors are covered under the DBA policy.

We did not find a larger increase in effective rates for small  businesses compared with rates for larger contractors; this may be  explained in part by differences in the type of work performed by small  versus large contractors. For example, security contractors had a larger  increase in effective rates compared with rates for services and  construction contractors, and, as we discuss below, most of the security  contractors in our sample were larger contractors.

Four of the  small businesses reported experiencing no adverse effects. One small  business was able to retain its previous single insurer premium rate in the  open market system. Another small business told us that State\u2019s  transition had no impact on it because the increase in its premium rate  was minor.

Because the FPDS-NG does not indicate which contracts or contractors  are required to obtain DBA insurance, we imposed the following limits to  obtain relevant data for analysis. We (1) considered only new awards, (2)  considered only U.S. firms, (3) did not consider awards for work  performed in the United States, (4) distinguished between countries  where DBA applies and where DBA does not apply, and (5) distinguished  between contracts valued above and below $25,000. We performed a  number of other analyses, including subsets of contractors who  performed contracts valued above $25,000 in countries with a DBA  requirement, but the results were similarly inconclusive. There are  limitations on the data we used. For example, it is not possible to identify  which contracts contain a DBA requirement without examining the  individual contracts themselves. There is no requirement that agencies  include DBA-related data in their mandatory procurement data reporting  to the FPDS-NG, and State has not established a mechanism for  collecting data on DBA costs in an open market system. It is therefore not  possible to identify exactly which State contractors are affected, if at all,  by State\u2019s transition. Moreover, a limited amount of time has passed since  the transition, so the window is small for observing effects.

We limited our sample to  contractors that: were required to obtain DBA coverage for work performed overseas;  signed contracts with State both before and after State\u2019s transition to  an open market system; performed work for State overseas in countries affected by the  transition to an open market system;represented a range of contract dollar values and type of work  performed (i.e., construction, security, or services); and were certified as small businesses by the Small Business  Administration.", "We excluded contracts that were valued less than $25,000 in some of our  analyses because we judged those to be less likely to include a DBA  requirement because of the nature of the work performed. Because the  most recent FPDS-NG data are from fiscal year 2013, we developed a list  of contractors who were newly awarded State contracts in fiscal year  2013 and then searched FPDS-NG data from fiscal years 2010 through  2013 to determine whether they matched the criteria above. From the  resulting narrow pool of contractors, we judgmentally selected 8 small  businesses to interview. Since DBA premium rates varied in State\u2019s single  insurer program according to one of four rate categories, we selected  contractors in different rate categories to approximate the representation  of service types and contract sizes among all State contractors.we intended to use these interviews to better understand the complexity   Because  and details of how small businesses experienced the transition and to  uncover any details potentially not revealed in our analysis of federal  procurement data\u2014not to draw generalizable conclusions about all of the  small businesses that contracted with State\u2014we determined that eight  interviews would be sufficient. To gain an additional perspective and  supplement the testimony of the 8 small businesses, we interviewed 2  large contractors that work regularly with small subcontractors. We  selected these 2, who meet the first 4 criteria listed above, because their  responses to our request for premium rate data indicated they had insight  into how the transition may have affected small businesses. The  interviews, which took place in person or by telephone conference, used  a standard set of questions, containing both open- and close-ended  questions that allowed contractors to share details of their experiences  both before and after State\u2019s transition and allowed us to compare their  testimony. In all 10 interviews, we spoke with a representative whose job  duties required knowledge of DBA insurance requirements (for example,  a chief operating officer, accountant, or contract manager). Because this  is a nongeneralizable sample, results cannot be used to make inferences  about the entire population of small businesses that contracted with State  during the period covered by our review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Technical Appendix for Analysis of Department of State Contractors\u2019 Defense Base Act Insurance Premium Rates", "paragraphs": ["To examine our second objective, the impact of the Department of State\u2019s  (State) transition to the open market system on premiums paid by State\u2019s  contractors, we collected data on contractors\u2019 Defense Base Act (DBA)  insurance premiums, rates, and payroll during State\u2019s single insurer  program and in the open market. Data on premiums, rates, and payroll  were collected from a simple random sample of contractors in  Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, South Africa, and Thailand. We identified the  set of countries by analyzing country summary reports of contract actions  for State and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in  the Federal Procurement Database System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG)  for fiscal years 2010 through 2013, identifying the top 10 countries for  each agency in terms of number of contract actions and choosing the  countries that appeared in the top 10 list for both agencies. We identified  the population of contractors in each country by obtaining from State a full  list of State contractors whose principal place of performance was outside  the United States. We also requested data on the contractors\u2019 country of  location, the contracting officers\u2019 determination of whether the business  was classified as a small business, and the contractors\u2019 contact  information. We restricted our analysis to contracts that were procured  through State\u2019s Office of Acquisitions Management. We chose a random  sample of contractors in the 5 countries identified above and inquired  about the DBA premiums, payroll, and premium rates during the single  insurer program and in the open market system. When the task order was  from an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract and the contractor  submitted DBA information for the overall indefinite delivery/indefinite  quantity contract, we applied the DBA data to the contractor in that  country. To assess the reliability of the FPDS-NG data, we interviewed  knowledgeable officials and reviewed publicly available documentation  regarding the collection and use of the data. We determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. Contractor data  on DBA premiums, premium rates, and payroll were self-reported;  however, we reviewed the data provided, performed logical tests on them,  conducted some follow-up with the contractors and determined the data  were sufficiently reliable for our analysis."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Summary Statistics", "paragraphs": ["In total, 46 contractors reported their total payrolls and total premiums in  the single insurer program, and 57 contractors reported their payrolls and  premiums in the open market system. 36 out of 81 contractors reported  paying premiums and payroll in both the single insurer program and the  open market system; 10 contractors reported paying premiums and  payroll in the single insurer program only.

The histograms in figures 6  through 9 show that the distribution of premiums in both the single insurer  program and the open market are skewed toward higher values on the  right. As a result, we supplemented our analysis in the second findings  section of the report with statistical methods that are less sensitive to  skewed data. For example, we conducted two different tests for statistical  significance: (1) sign tests, which test for differences in medians and (2)  Wilcoxon signed ranks tests, which test for differences in overall  distributions and calculated confidence intervals for the median effective  rates.

We also  compared open market DBA rates to rates that would have prevailed in  two hypothetical scenarios in which State continued the single insurer  program. The two hypothetical scenarios are computed as follows:  1.  In the highest contract rates scenario, State and the single insurer  continue the single insurer program, with the insurance carrier  charging all contractors the highest rates allowable in the 2008  contract along with a lump sum amount to compensate the insurance  carrier for historical excess losses. This lump sum amount, which is  the same for all contractors, represents a retroactive adjustment of  approximately $27 million (divided equally amongst overseas  contractors), paid to the single insurer as compensation for performing  the second option year of the 2008 DBA contract at the lowest tier of  prices when, according to the insurer, the highest tier of rates should  have been charged.  2.  In the renegotiated rates scenario, State and the single insurer  continue the single insurer program, but renegotiate premium rates.  The single insurance provider charges security contractors the higher,  renegotiated security rate. The new rate is the average of the higher  rate requested by the single insurer, and a rate proposed by State as  its original negotiating position. All other contractors pay the same  rate they were paying in the third option year. All contractors,  regardless of contractor category, pay a lump sum to compensate the  insurance carrier for historical excess losses. The lump sum  represents the retroactive adjustment described in the scenario  above.", "To determine whether premium rates in the hypothetical scenarios  described in the report differed from open market premium rates, we  conducted statistical tests of the difference between open market and  hypothetical rates, by contractor category. We conducted two different  tests: (1) sign tests, which test for differences in medians, and (2)  Wilcoxon signed ranks tests, which test for differences in overall  distributions. In table 8, we report results and p-values for each test. With  the exception of rates for security contractors, we were unable to detect a  robust, statistically significant difference between open market effective  DBA rates and effective rates under the hypothetical scenarios.", "Figure 10 shows confidence intervals for the median effective DBA  premium rates that State contractors reported having paid in the open  market and the median effective rates we calculated they would have  paid under two hypothetical scenarios. A confidence interval is a measure  of the reliability of an estimate. To calculate the confidence intervals  shown in figure 10, we ran quantile (median) regressions of effective  rates for subsamples of the data versus a constant term; the confidence  interval on the constant term represents the confidence interval for the  median effective rate. For services and construction contractors, our  analysis did not reveal a statistically significant difference between the  median effective rate paid by contractors in the open market and the  median effective rate that they were likely to have paid if State had  continued the single insurer program. For security contractors, our  analysis showed that open market effective rates were significantly lower  than effective rates under the hypothetical scenarios, which is reflected in  the complete separation of the confidence intervals for this contractor  category in figure 10. Open market premium rates for security contractors  in our sample could have been lower than the rates calculated for them  under the hypothetical scenarios in part because insurers in the open  market may choose to insure only security contractors with a good loss  history; in other words, contractors in our sample may have benefited  from the open market to an extent that may not hold across all security  contractors. Brokers told us that the open market allowed insurers to be  selective about the customers they choose to insure. Additionally, the  security contractors in our sample were larger contractors that may have  been able to pool the risk of security contracting alongside work with  lower risk exposure to reduce their DBA premiums: only 1 of the 8  security contractors in our sample was a small business, and 1 security  contractor told us that its payroll incorporated both security and clerical  employees.

We found that for State  contractors active from fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2013, State  contractors\u2019 effective DBA premium rates were generally higher than  those of contractors for USACE and USAID (see table 9). According to  agency officials and industry experts, the difference in premiums reflects  various factors, such as risk exposure, nature of work, and size of risk  pool. Over the same time period, the growth rate of State contractors\u2019  DBA premium rates was higher than those of contractors for other U.S.  agencies, as USAID\u2019s DBA rates remained fixed according to the terms of  its single insurer contract, and USACE\u2019s DBA rates decreased for  services and construction contractors, and remained constant for aviation  and security contractors.
