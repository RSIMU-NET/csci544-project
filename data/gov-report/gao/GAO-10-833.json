In comparing the data in the federal procurement data system to the information in contract files, we found that about 18 percent of the contracts sampled were coded incorrectly--as either not competed when they had been, or as competed with one offer received when they had not been competed at all. Agencies used a variety of exceptions to competition for the contracts and orders in our sample, with the two most common being \"only one responsible source\" and sole-source awards under the Small Business Administration's 8(a) business development program. For services supporting DOD weapons programs, the government's lack of access to proprietary technical data and decades-long reliance on specific contractors for expertise limit--or even preclude the possibility of--competition. In other cases, program offices may press for contracts to be awarded to the incumbent contractor without competition, largely due to their relationship and the contractor's understanding of program requirements. For competitive procurements where only one offer is received, factors include a strong incumbent, sometimes coupled with overly restrictive government requirements, or vendors forming large teams to submit one offer for broader government requirements, whereas previously several vendors may have competed. Contracting approaches for nine contracts reviewed did not reflect sound procurement practices and in some instances sound management practices, in some cases not leveraging the effectiveness of the market place. These approaches included ambiguously written justifications for noncompetitive contracts, very limited documentation of the reasonableness of contractors' proposed prices, instances where the contract's cost grew significantly or where labor categories were improperly authorized, and undefinitized contract actions that did not meet definitization requirements. Agencies have much discretion regarding where in the organization the competition advocates should be placed, who should be appointed to this position, and how they should carry out their responsibilities. As a result, agencies have taken a range of approaches regarding the placement of the competition advocates, their skills and expertise, and the methods they use to carry out their responsibilities. Some advocates cited their experience in program offices as helping them to question requirements that may be overly restrictive, while others had been contracting officers or procurement policy officials before assuming the position. Some agency officials said that regulations are vague regarding the role of the competition advocate, and that given the Office of Federal Procurement Policy's (OFPP) recent emphasis on competition, they would like to see more guidance on competition advocate roles and methods of implementing their duties."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that OFPP take actions regarding assessment of the reasons only one offer is received and issue guidance on competition advocate roles, including their direct involvement with program offices to seek opportunities for competition.

While federal statute and acquisition  regulations generally require that contracts be awarded on the basis of full  and open competition, they also permit federal agencies to award  noncompetitive contracts in certain circumstances, for example, when  only one vendor can supply the requirements or when a sole source award  is made under specified small business programs.

Multiple award IDIQ contracts are awarded to multiple  contractors through one solicitation. The number of contract holders  depends on the number of contractors receiving the award, which could  be from two contractors to thousands. Agencies are required to compete  orders on multiple award contracts among all contract holders; however,  agencies can award noncompetitive orders\u2014through a process called an  exception to a fair opportunity to compete\u2014for reasons similar to those  used for awarding contracts without full and open competition, such as  only one contractor being capable of providing the supplies or services  needed, or an urgent requirement.

Another 5 of the 9 miscoded noncompeted  contracts were actually orders under single-award IDIQ contracts that  were competed, but the orders were coded as not competed. For  example, three orders at Interior coded as noncompeted in FPDS-NG  turned out to have actually been competed, since their base contracts  were competed. When a single-award IDIQ contract is competed, the  orders under that contract are considered competed. This type of error  appears to have stemmed from a lack of understanding on the part of the  person entering the data, as some agency officials we spoke with admitted  that there was confusion among contracting officials about how to code  these orders. In April 2008, the Department of the Interior issued guidance  clarifying that orders awarded under single-award indefinite delivery  contracts that were awarded under full and open competition should be  coded as competed. However, to address the issue more widely, on  October 31, 2009, systemwide changes were made to FPDS-NG.

Two of the 4 were  sole source contracts awarded on the basis of only one responsible  contractor that could perform the work; one was a sole source contract  award through the 8(a) program; and one was a sole source contract  award on the basis of an international agreement with a foreign  government. For the other 6 contracts and orders miscoded as competed  with one offer received, documentation in the contract file indicated that  they were actually competed with more than one offer received.

For example, the National Weather Service\u2014through an  interagency contract awarded by Interior\u2014turned to the original provider  of weather radios to obtain compatible spare parts. In another example at  ICE, only one contractor could provide specified communications  equipment, supplies and services being used in the field at the time.  According to an ICE contracting official, this contractor essentially owns  the market, and until other vendors or products are available, ICE is  bound by the limited availability of items.", "The second most frequently used exception to competition\u2014for 20 of the  74 noncompetitive contracts in our sample, or 27 percent\u2014was the  authority to award sole source contracts to qualified firms in SBA\u2019s 8(a)  business development program.

First, when awarding a sole source contract  through the 8(a) program, a justification for awarding a sole source  contract is generally not required. Second, the agency need only identify  a qualified 8(a) firm and obtain approval from SBA to award it a contract.  For example, a Secret Service contract estimated at $3 million for  information technology services included a description in the contract file  of the market research that had been conducted, which simply stated that  the program office provided the source. In another example from Interior,  a program staff person at the National Institutes of Health suggested a  contractor for building repair services to the Interior contracting officer.", "The program staff informed us that although other contractors were  available, he was most comfortable with the vendor he suggested, and  therefore requested\u2014and received\u2014a noncompetitive award through the  8(a) program for approximately $3.5 million.", "SBA officials told us that agencies\u2019 procurement activities are encouraged  to direct all work to small businesses as long as they do not run afoul of  the Small Business Act or federal acquisition regulations. The SBA takes  the general position that a procuring agency does not need to document in  a contract file any other prospective sources if the agency selects an 8(a)  participant to perform the requirement, offers it to SBA, and SBA accepts  the requirement into the 8(a) program. SBA officials note that it is the  procuring agency\u2019s responsibility to conduct market research to determine  whether the requirements of the Small Business Act can be met, and then  to determine the appropriate contracting vehicle to use. However, SBA  considers market research requirements to be satisfied when a participant  in the 8(a) program self-markets its abilities to a procuring agency and is  subsequently offered a sole source 8(a) requirement. When we discussed  this issue with procurement policy officials at DHS, they said that, while  these activities may meet the regulatory requirements, in practice they like  to see additional market research so that the offer to the 8(a) firm has a  more solid basis."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agencies Used a Number of Other Exceptions and Processes to Award Noncompetitive Contracts and Orders", "paragraphs": ["Agencies in our review used a number of other exceptions under FAR Part  6.3 (\u201cOther than Full and Open Competition\u201d) to award noncompetitive  contracts, which includes orders issued under noncompetitively awarded  IDIQ contracts.

Although the contracting officer at Interior identified four FFRDCs that  could do the work, the National Institutes of Health staff determined that  this particular firm best met their needs because this work was a  continuation of research that it was performing for them.", "Agencies also used different procedures under the FAR to issue  noncompetitive orders under competitively awarded IDIQ contracts. Four  of the orders at two different agencies were issued under GSA schedules  contracts, using procedures under FAR 8.405-6. Agencies justified not  competing the orders because the work was a follow-on to another  requirement that the company performed, or because there was only one  source that could perform the specific work. In one case, a requiring office  at the Department of the Interior that provides financial services to other  federal agencies (or \u201cfederal customers\u201d) needed a contractor to help with  the integration and execution of the financial services provided. The  Interior contracting officer suggested a minicompetition among GSA  schedule contractors; however, the limited sources justification noted that  this procurement was a logical follow-on because this particular company  had partnered with the requiring office to perform these same integration  services with six different federal customers and that, because this  company was already familiar with the customer, it was in the best  position to provide these services.", "In two other cases from our sample, orders were awarded through a  process called \u201cexceptions to the fair opportunity process\u201d under FAR  16.505(b)(2). These exceptions allow noncompetitive orders exceeding  $3,000 issued under multiple award contracts using one of four reasons:  (1) only one contractor is capable, (2) urgency, (3) the work is a logical  follow-on to another task, or (4) there is a need to place an order with a  particular contractor to satisfy a minimum guarantee. For example, an  order was awarded for engineering support to redesign the B-1 aircraft  main landing gear wheel and brake assembly because the contractor had  previously worked on this airplane and had the expertise. The program  official explained that when a new type of plane comes in for repair,  requirements are typically competed between the two contractors on the  multiple award contract, but once a contractor has built up expertise on  that airplane\u2019s system, it is logical to have the same contractor perform  additional work on that system."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Key Factors Affecting Competition Include Reliance on Contractor Expertise and Proprietary Data and Preference for Incumbent", "paragraphs": ["A variety of factors affect competition, including reliance on contractor  expertise and decisions made by officials in program and contracting  offices.

Even for some procurements using competitive  procedures, a strong incumbent coupled with overly restrictively written  requirements can lead to only one offer\u2014from the incumbent\u2014being  received.

For  example, a $46 million contract at the Navy for engineering services in the  DOD\u2019s Prowler/Growler aircraft programs could not be competitively  awarded because the government had not procured the technical data  package and only the original contractor, who was one of the developers  of the system, has over 20 years experience and expertise to perform the  work. Several officials pointed out that the situation the government is  currently experiencing is a result of decisions made years ago, when first  acquiring a weapon system, to not purchase critical technical data  packages for reasons that include budgetary constraints or a push toward  streamlined contracting processes by purchasing commercial items. For a  couple of the contracts in our sample, the government had purchased  some of the technical data, but, for budgetary reasons, has not kept those  data packages current over time. Hence, only the original equipment  manufacturer has the technical data needed for follow-on maintenance  and engineering support contracts.", "Some contracting and program officials have inquired about the cost of  obtaining the technical data, only to discover that the package is not for  sale or purchase of it would be cost-prohibitive, especially the systems and  equipment that have been contracted out for decades. In one instance, the  Air Force requested an estimate of the cost to the government to purchase  the technical data package for an aircraft program, and the contractor\u2014 the original equipment manufacturer that had been working on the system  for over 30 years\u2014replied that while it was not for sale, if they were to sell  it, the estimated cost was $1 billon. On a $4.8 billion contract for  sustainment and support for another Air Force program, the contractor  estimated the cost to purchase the data rights to be more than $1.3 billion.  However, the market research report noted that the contractor refused to  sell the data, and because commercial contracting procedures under FAR  Part 12 were used in this procurement, the contractor was able to retain  strict control over data rights and the government did not have insight into  the work performed by the major subcontractors. In yet another case, a  contractor for an Army missile program informed the program office that  they would charge approximately $30,000 just to put together a cost  estimate for the technical data package, which the contractor later stated  would be $31 million for selected technical data elements of the missile  program, but excluding rights to critical contractor-specific software. The  contractor was the original equipment manufacturer and sole producer of  the missiles since the early 1960s. DOD procurement policy officials told  us they view this issue as a long-standing problem and that any significant  turnaround will need to occur with new programs. They also said they see  refusal to share or sell technical data as a larger problem under  commercial acquisitions, where the government lacks leverage.", "Recently, Congress has taken steps to address the lack of access to  technical data. For example, the John Warner National Defense  Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2007 required DOD program managers for  major weapons systems to assess the long-term technical data needs and  establish corresponding acquisition strategies that provide for the  technical data rights needed to sustain such systems over their life cycle.  Further, Congress enacted legislation in May of 2009 that requires DOD to  include in the acquisition strategy for each major defense acquisition  program measures to ensure competition\u2014or the option of competition\u2014 at both the prime contract level and subcontract level throughout the life- cycle of the program. This includes considering the acquisition of  complete technical data packages, among other things. For almost a  decade, we have reported on the limitations to competition when DOD  does not purchase technical data rights for sustainment of weapon  systems and the increased costs as a result. In 2001 and 2002, we  reported that DOD had often failed to put adequate emphasis on obtaining  needed technical data during the acquisition process, and noted officials\u2019  concerns on the potential negative impact on competition and potential  increase in costs. In 2004, we found that not obtaining technical data  limited DOD\u2019s flexibility to perform work in house or support alternate  source development if necessary. In another report, in 2006, we noted that  as a result of the limitations of not having technical data rights, the  military services had to alter their plans for developing new sources of  supply to increase production or to obtain competitive offers for the  acquisition of spare parts and components to reduce sustainment costs. In  that report, we also found that DOD\u2019s acquisition policies did not  specifically address long term needs for technical data rights and  recommended that DOD require program managers to assess long-term  technical data needs and establish corresponding acquisition strategies  that provide for technical data rights needed to sustain weapons systems  over their life cycles.", "Even when technical data are not an issue, the government may have little  choice other than to rely on the contractors that were the original  equipment manufacturers, and who, in some cases, designed and  developed the weapon system. A few contracting and program officials we  spoke with noted that for some DOD programs, the government is so  reliant on the contractor that it is difficult for the government to even  make decisions or set requirements anymore. Our prior work has noted  the government\u2019s increasing reliance on contractors and pointed to the  challenges of this increasing reliance, such as identifying and  distinguishing roles and responsibilities and ensuring appropriate  oversight. Most noncompetitive DOD contracts in our sample indicated  that the contractor was the only source of the expertise for the system,  having developed that expertise and the infrastructure over time. For  example:    An engineering contract for the Army\u2019s Hellfire missile program has  current obligations at almost $72 million. According to the justification in  the contract file, the technical data package has been developed, but since  1994, the contractor has been acquiring unique expertise that is not  contained in any documentation.", "The contractor for the Army\u2019s Patriot Missile program has been designing  the missile since 1972. The contract for engineering and other support of  the program was worth an estimated $122 million. The contractor that  designed the program was the only contractor capable of performing the  support work because the contractor also developed and manufactured  the system. Over time, the contractor developed the technical expertise,  experience, and the facilities needed for the contract.", "The Army awarded a $1.7 billion contract for engineering support and  maintenance for the Chinook and Apache Helicopter Programs. The  contractor for these two helicopters\u2014since 1961 and 1984 respectively\u2014is  the only contractor with the needed skills, technical and engineering  expertise, and the technical data to provide the full range of services  needed. This contract was one of several billion-dollar sole-source Army  contracts we reviewed that had been awarded to large prime contractors  for depot maintenance requirements that had been previously performed  by many small businesses. A business case analysis was performed,  showing that these contracts were burdensome to manage and left the  government without one entity to hold accountable. The contracts were  bundled into one requirement (with the appropriate justifications and  approvals) and the prime contractors\u2019 subcontracting plans emphasized  the need to compete among small businesses at that level.", "The Air Force awarded a contract for engineering support and software  maintenance for satellite communication systems with an estimated value  of $404.7 million. The contractor, in place since 1982, has 20 years of  knowledge and experience with extensive hardware, software, and test  facilities needed to support the system.", "Further, the cost, including time and money, of changing contractors can  be relatively high. For instance, the sole-source justification for an almost  $1 billion contract awarded in June 2008 for the overhaul and  recapitalization of the Army\u2019s Blackhawk helicopter included a $50 million  estimate as the minimum investment needed to bring on another  contractor and a lead time of 24 to 36 months. The justification further  stated that the current contractor\u2019s knowledge could not be easily  duplicated, even with significant investment and that it was unlikely that  the government would be able to recover the investment cost through  competition. In another example, the sole source justification of an Air  Force contract, estimated at $50 million, for general engineering support  for Military Satellite Communication programs, included an estimate of $5  million for developing another contractor\u2019s knowledge and skill, including  the time to gain familiarity with the software tools and technical  requirements. However, the justification also described that any delays  would result in a cost increase of hundreds of millions of dollars for the  program and any unplanned schedule delays would adversely affect the  warfighter."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Officials\u2019 Preference for Incumbents and Inadequate Acquisition Planning Can Influence Extent of Competition", "paragraphs": ["Program officials play a significant role in the contracting process\u2014 developing requirements, performing market research, and interfacing  with contractors. In their 2009 competition reports to OMB, several  agencies in our review recognized the pressure that program offices place  on the contracting process to award new contracts to a specific vendor  without competition. Many contracting officials we spoke with recognized  that program staff sometimes prefer a specific vendor, in some cases  because a relationship had developed between the program office and the  contractor, who understands the program requirements. We also heard  this echoed in discussions with program staff. Program officials from two  program offices at the National Institutes of Health, for example,  described their comfort with certain contractors because of their level of  understanding of requirements and because they could be relied on to  complete the work. A Navy program official stated that, when one  contractor has been performing a requirement for many years, it is easier  to go back to the contractor personnel who understand the requirement  rather than taking the time to find a new vendor. One contracting official  described how, in his former role as a program manager, he did not want  to change contractors for products and services once he found ones he  liked.", "Program offices can also influence levels of competition through their  roles in the acquisition planning process, in particular by having sufficient  knowledge of the contract award process and providing contracting  officials with enough time to compete requirements. However in their  competition reports, some agencies in our review pointed to a lack of  acquisition planning, and the role that the program office plays in it, as a  barrier to competition. Further, several contracting officials from  different agencies expressed concern about the fact that they receive short  notices from program offices for acquisitions. Others noted that program  offices sometimes do not allow them enough time to execute a sufficiently  robust acquisition planning process that could increase opportunities for  competition. They told us that program offices are insufficiently aware of  the amount of time needed to properly define requirements or conduct  adequate market research. According to an official at ICE, in one instance,  he only had a couple of days to complete certain procurements, which he  managed to do, but he believed that the customer would have received a  better product if he had had enough time to obtain more high-quality  proposals from the marketplace. Several contracting officials also pointed  to the experience levels and staffing shortfalls of both the contracting staff  and program staff as affecting the quality of the procurement processes,  and, in turn, the extent of competition. For example, DHS contracting  officials stated that high workloads for limited numbers of staff and  inexperienced staff can hinder the acquisition planning, timing of the  procurements, and market research.", "Some agency officials recognize that training on the acquisition process  for program staff may help address some of these issues, but we found  that training on competition issues is often directed to contracting officers  and not necessarily the program staff. For example, DOD has developed  formal training on enhancing competition awareness, but it is required  only for contracting staff and just recommended for others in the  acquisition community. The Navy, however, has made this training  mandatory for Navy personnel engaged in the acquisition process,  including program managers, program executive officers and logistics  personnel. ICE contracting officials said that they regularly reach out to  the program offices\u2014through meetings and supervisor trainings and by  making guidance available\u2014to provide information on the acquisition  process with the goal of increasing competition. They noted, however, that  ICE program offices still struggle to understand the acquisition process.  Other contracting officials, for instance at the location we visited at the  Department of the Interior, stated that they train program staff about the  benefits of competition during regular, informal interactions or do so only  on issues pertaining to a specific procurement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overly-Restrictive Government Requirements Can Limit The Number of Offers Received", "paragraphs": ["From a practical standpoint, for contracts awarded using competitive  solicitation procedures where only one offer is received, the government  does not have the benefit of evaluating more than one competing proposal.

Some contracting officials noted the challenge of  questioning program office requirements that are written so restrictively  that they are geared towards the incumbent. These contracting officials  informed us that their technical backgrounds and having the assistance of  technical staff in evaluating the requirements can help them determine  whether the requirements can be broadened. They noted that if they lack  technical expertise in the specific area of requirements, it is more difficult  to question whether a statement of work is too restrictive.", "The FAR does not require actions to be taken in circumstances where only  one offer is received in response to a competitive solicitation, such as  performing additional market research or determining if the requirements  were overly restrictive. However, contracting officials at two of the  locations we visited noted that they have a local requirement to document  in the contract file the circumstances that may have led to only one offer  being received and actions that will be taken to obtain more competition if  there is a follow-on procurement.

The contractors we spoke with told us that they consider a  wide variety of factors before submitting a proposal in response to a  solicitation, such as  the cost of developing proposals;  their ability to provide the services, including key personnel;  their knowledge and history of the requirement;  rapport with the government personnel;    ability to partner with small businesses to meet small business  subcontracting requirements; and  the potential financial gain from the procurement.", "There are also certain strategies that companies take when deciding  whether to submit a proposal.  For example, companies may submit a  proposal to test the water or get their name recognized as a potential  contractor for a particular requirement, then bid more aggressively for the  follow-on procurement.  Contractors may also intentionally not submit an  offer on a certain procurement to retain their status as a small business\u2014 and thus remain eligible for procurements designated for small businesses.", "A predominant factor that contractors consider when deciding whether to  compete for a contract is the performance of the incumbents. Contracting  officers and contractor representatives explained that when an incumbent  is known, contractors may not compete if the incumbent has historically  provided the requirement and is identified as well-performing. The  solicitations for all of the 11 orders we reviewed under the Navy\u2019s Seaport- e Multiple Award Schedule and the Army\u2019s Express Multiple Award  Schedule listed previous contractors\u2019 names and contract numbers, and  only one offer was received for 9 out of the 11 solicitations. In talking to us  about another contract in our sample, an Army program official said she  believed that vendors other than the incumbent could have competed for a  certain contract, but that a short time frame combined with the  incumbent\u2019s history on the contract caused many vendors to be  disinclined to compete. Ultimately, the Army received only one offer in  response to its solicitation. An Army contracting official also noted that  when evaluation factors in the solicitations are based mostly on  experience with the system and technical skills, other competitors may  not submit offers because the cost of developing a proposal is too high to  outweigh the risk of not winning the award.", "Furthermore, several contracting officials and contractors told us that  some contractors find it necessary to team up with other contractors in  order to fulfill certain government needs, which can also contribute to  only one offer being received. For example, a Navy requirement for  submarine engineering services was being performed by a large business.  The Navy decided to set aside the follow-on contract, estimated at $34  million, for small businesses. Only one small business submitted a  proposal, which included 10 subcontractors\u20141 of which was the large- business incumbent, and another of which was a small business that was  originally identified as a possible competitor for the procurement. In  another example, one order under the Army\u2019s Express program, estimated  at $122 million, was awarded to a small business after one offer was  received, helping the Army meet its small business goals. Under a teaming  arrangement involving a number of subcontractors, the small business  prime contractor was going to perform only 7 percent of the work while  one subcontractor was going to perform 87 percent of the work. Under  another Express order, a small business was the prime contractor and a  large business, which had been the prime contractor under a predecessor  contract for the same requirement, was a subcontractor performing the  bulk of the work. Under the Express program, the Army claims full small  business credit for all obligations under these types of arrangements. In  one contractor proposal we reviewed, submitted in response to an  Express program solicitation, the small business prime contractor pointed  out this benefit. According to SBA officials, as long as the procurement  was awarded using full and open competition, the percentage of the work  performed by the small business prime contractor is not relevant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Agencies Are Seeking Opportunities to Enhance Competition", "paragraphs": ["Some agencies actively seek out opportunities to compete requirements  and contracts that were originally awarded noncompetitively, such as by  breaking out components of the requirement that can be awarded  competitively. We encountered several contracting and program officials  who told us that they broke out pieces of requirements from past sole- source procurements in order to compete them. For example, Coast Guard  contracting officials informed us that they broke one requirement for  aircraft maintenance and repair into one contract and three separate  orders, which they believe will save the government approximately $13  million. In another case, a Navy contracting official informed us that  certain requirements for submarine components had been separated from  a sole-source procurement and are currently in second or third cycles of  competition. We also found one noncompetitive contract at the Navy  where the follow-on requirement was competed. The contract, for  operations and maintenance support and engineering services, was a sole- source award to an ANC 8(a) firm, but the contracting officer who  inherited the contract decided to compete the follow-on contract in the  8(a) program.", "In some cases, the government actively sought additional vendors for  certain requirements. For instance, Air Force officials informed us that  they encouraged a second vendor to compete against the incumbent  contractor for production of aluminum pallets. These officials noted that  at the threat of competition, the incumbent\u2014who ultimately won the  contract\u2014\u201dsharpened his pencil,\u201d resulting in savings for the government  through a lower price and improved delivery schedules. In another  example, the Army\u2019s Tube-launched, Optically-tracked, Wire-guided  (TOW) missile has been with one contractor since its inception in the early  1960s. The Army recently made a business case for breaking out a portion  of the requirement and competing it as a separate procurement because it  had identified another capable contractor: one of the subcontractors with  a long history with the program. But other officials noted that it is not  always the best business decision to invest time and money into finding  other vendors; each situation has to be evaluated on its own merits and  future procurements or production lines must be sufficient to warrant the  government\u2019s investment in a second source. The C-130J engine has also  been broken out of the overall Lockheed Martin contract, with a separate  sole source contract to Rolls Royce. According to program and contracting  officials, this decision was made to save money.", "Some contracting officials we spoke with recognized the importance of  thorough market research for identifying possible vendors even when it  appears that only one contractor is capable of doing the work. For  example, during the market research phase for the awarding of two  contracts for engineering services for military satellite communications at  the Los Angeles Air Force base, the contracting officers requested that  potential contractors provide information on their abilities to meet the  government\u2019s requirements in an attempt to identify other qualified  contractors. Ultimately, however, the two contracts were awarded using a  sole source justification that only one responsible contractor was capable  of doing the work. The director of contracting at this location informed us  that they typically reach out to the open market when they are not familiar  with a requirement or when a requirement has been procured on a sole  source basis for many years and they wish to test the marketplace to  determine if it has changed over time. He also noted that there have been  instances in which new contractors have expressed interest, but usually  no new contractors come forward. In another case, ICE contracting  officials informed us that the program office wanted a specific vendor for  a requirement for rifle cases. The contracting officer pushed back against  the program\u2019s specific request, competed the requirement, and received  numerous offers.

In addition, our sample contained undefinitized  contract actions (UCA) that did not clearly follow UCA policies or did not  meet the definitization requirements, which puts the government at risk  because contractors lack incentives to control costs during this period.  Finally, during our file review, we found an example of a noncompetitive  contract awarded in an urgent situation that failed to follow sound  procurement practices in several ways, such as drastic increases in ceiling  prices, improper modifications to the contract, inappropriate  communications between the program staff and the contractor, and a  program official serving as the contracting officer\u2019s technical  representative (COTR) without the required training.

In the first situation, at ICE, the justification to use  a particular company\u2019s online language learning services cited the wrong  section of the FAR in two different ways. First, the order was placed under  the firm\u2019s GSA schedule contract (pursuant to FAR 8.4) and thus should  have been justified under one of the exceptions in FAR 8.405-6, yet the  FAR citation was to one of the exceptions to full and open competition  under FAR 6.302. Orders placed under GSA schedule contracts are exempt  from the requirements in FAR Part 6. Second, the justification itself was  not even clear as to the circumstances warranting a noncompetitive order.

While planning the procurement, the contract specialist  pointed out to the program staff that there were 31 GSA vendors that  could offer these services and recommended that they try to obtain  proposals from at least two other vendors. The contracting officers we  spoke with explained that the program office was insistent on the use of  this contractor for these services. The program office stated that the order  was placed solely with this contractor primarily because DHS had  undertaken a successful pilot program for these services with this  contractor, and they were under time pressure to award the contract  quickly.", "In the second example, at the Department of the Interior, the justification  for a noncompetitive order on a GSA schedule contract to lease  information technology licenses was similarly ambiguous because the  citation used was FAR 8.405-6(b)(3), for urgent and compelling  requirements, but the supporting narrative stated that this vendor was the  only distributor that could offer all of the required products and services,  i.e., a certain brand name of licenses.

In the period following the  terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Interior initially issued an order in  our sample, on behalf of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), under  a $50 million contract to an 8(a) ANC firm; the contract value subsequently  grew to $100 million. This order was improperly transferred by the Interior  contracting officer to a second contract\u2014the ceiling price of which  tripled, from $100 million to $300 million\u2014with the same vendor. A  modification in the file stated that \u201cthis task order is hereby transferred\u201d  from the first contract to the second contract after the ceiling on the first  contract was reached. The contracting officer subsequently noted that  some requirements under the order were not incorporated into the second  contract, and took steps to modify the second contract. In addition, the  work under the first contract included commercial-off-the-shelf  information technology and telecommunication hardware and software  and support services for civilian and DOD agencies; modifications to the  contract added commercial and institutional building construction. The  work under the second contract included information analysis and  technical assistance support to provide a turnkey solution for operational  support for services to the Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force,  including quick reaction support for assessment planning and analysis and  \u201cother special requirements.\u201d Additional labor categories\u2014such as counter  terrorism operations specialists\u2014were later added. Interior contracting  officials and FBI program officials acknowledged that the FBI\u2019s  requirements had changed significantly from a basic information  technology support project to running a 24-hour program to track terrorist  activities. The FBI officials noted that they were responding to a  presidential directive to establish a terrorist watch list within a matter of  months and that there was intense pressure to have this call center up and  running quickly. Also, according to contract file documentation, the  government accepted and paid for an invoice submitted by the contractor  for a service\u2014security guards\u2014that was not within the scope of the first  contract. The Interior contracting officer, in later scrutinizing the  contractor\u2019s invoices, noticed this out-of-scope issue and obtained  reimbursement from the contractor. In another instance, the contracting  officer noticed more improper billing, including an unauthorized expense  for a hotel bar tab, and deducted the costs from the invoices. When the  second contract was about to reach its ceiling price, Interior put in place a  third contract with the same 8(a) ANC firm with an estimated ceiling price  of $1 billion, with the contracting officer noting that after that award they  would no \u201clonger have to worry about contract ceilings\u201d with this vendor.  Finally, the FBI program official designated as the COTR did not have the  necessary training to fulfill this position; the Interior contracting officer  subsequently removed the official from the position.", "Apart from the issues with procurement practices discussed above, the  administration of this contract lacked appropriate management controls\u2014 also referred to as internal controls. Examples follow.", "We found little evidence in the contract file that the contractor\u2019s proposed  prices had been analyzed for price reasonableness at various points during  the life of the order. For example, the FBI program official\u2019s analysis of the  contractor\u2019s proposed price for the order under the initial contract was a  statement in an email that she had reviewed the price and found it  reasonable, with no further documentation supporting the statement.  Further, during preparations to award an option year on this order, an FBI  program official again approved the contractor\u2019s revised price proposal  with a simple \u201cyes\u201d response when asked by the Interior contracting  officer, and also explained to the contracting officer that the independent  estimate\u2014presumably for this option year\u2014was different from the  contractor\u2019s proposed prices in part because the contractor included  additional labor categories that the FBI did not require, but that they  \u201cagreed with.\u201d", "Communications between the FBI and Interior were problematic.", "Specifically, the program office was communicating directly with the  contractor about the growth in the requirements but not involving the  contracting officers. For example, the contractor informed the Interior  contracting officer that it had been directed by the program office, due to  a change in requirements, to establish an increased level of continuity and  retention within the terrorist screening center\u2014 particularly for the  second and third shifts. The contractor proposed additional compensation  for these shifts and told the contracting officer that approval to apply  these shift differentials would be approved by the program office . The  contracting officer told us the program office should have informed her  first of the need for shift differential compensation and that the direction  to the contractor should have come from her rather than from the program  office. Interior contracting officials expressed dismay at the program  office\u2019s lack of communication with them and told us that sometimes they  did not know what was going on with their own contract. Further, when  Interior was preparing to award the second contract to the ANC firm, an  FBI program official told the contracting officer that she understood  delays in the award may be due to Interior\u2019s legal review process; the FBI  official, in an effort to expedite the process, then asked for the legal  representative\u2019s contact information to \u201cmove this along smoothly.\u201d", "Interior officials told us that after several years of dealing with this  contract, their office had undergone a culture change whereby they were  starting to push back on customer demands instead of simply doing what  the program offices wanted. Eventually, after a dispute about the  interagency contracting fees the FBI was paying to Interior and Interior\u2019s  desire to not award another sole-source contract to the same vendor, the  FBI officials told us that they pulled the requirement in-house and, under  their own contract, awarded the requirement noncompetitively to another  ANC 8(a) firm.

In general, the  agencies in our review have organized their competition advocates into  the required department- and procuring activity levels. For example, the  Department of the Interior has a department-level competition advocate  and competition advocates at the bureaus, including the National Business  Center, which houses the Acquisition Services Directorate. DOD has a  competition advocate at the department level, and additional competition  advocates are in place at the Army, Air Force, and Navy and local  contracting activities. The advocates are to carry out a number of broad  responsibilities, including    promoting full and open competition and challenging barriers to  competition,  reporting to the agency\u2019s senior procurement executive and chief  acquisition officer on opportunities and actions taken to achieve  competition, as well as conditions or actions that unnecessarily restrict it,  such as unnecessarily detailed specifications or restrictive statements of  work, and  recommending to the senior procurement executive and chief acquisition  officer a \u201csystem of personal and organizational accountability\u201d for  competition, which may include recognition and awards to program  managers, contracting officers, or others.", "Competition advocates are also responsible for approving justifications for  other than full and open competition within certain dollar limits, as  depicted in table 3.", "Apart from these duties, agencies are left with much discretion regarding  where in the organization the competition advocates should be placed,  who should be appointed to this position, and how they should carry out  their responsibilities. Some agency officials we spoke with said that,  because the FAR is vague in this regard, and especially given the current  emphasis on competition, more guidance related to this position could be  helpful. For the agencies in our review, we found a range of approaches to  the competition advocate position and placement, skills and expertise, and  methods of implementing their responsibilities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Competition Advocate Placement in the Organization", "paragraphs": ["Officials at the agencies we reviewed generally agreed that placement of  the competition advocate at a high level within agencies is important, as  the person in this role should have the clout to make difficult decisions  regarding proposed sole-source awards and support procuring activity  contracting officers who attempt to do so. A competition advocate who  can exercise this level of leadership at a senior level can be more effective  in the role and, by emphasizing the importance of competition to program  office staff as well as contracting officers, has the potential to affect  competition results. The Air Force competition advocate told us, for  example, that he sees value in being highly placed within the organization;  if people must come to him to explain why a particular procurement needs  to be sole source, they are more likely to do things the right way and less  likely to take short cuts.", "At the agencies in our review, competition advocates are in various  positions and placements within the organization. Some are senior leaders  in the acquisition arena. For example, the DOD competition advocate is  the Director of Defense Procurement, Acquisition Policy, and Strategic  Sourcing, and the DHS competition advocate is the Director of Oversight  and Strategic Support within the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer.  We found that the duties of competition advocate can be automatically  tied to the person\u2019s position within the agency. For example, Air Force,  Navy, and Army acquisition regulations designate a specific deputy  assistant secretary position to be the advocate. Agency officials told us  that the ICE Deputy Assistant Secretary for Management is automatically  designated as the competition advocate, and within the Secret Service, it is  the Deputy Assistant Director. Also within DHS, the head of contracting  activity was the competition advocate for the Coast Guard, but because  this person was uncomfortable signing sole source justifications in two  different capacities, she told us that she delegated her role as competition  advocate to another senior official\u2014the Deputy Assistant Commandant for  Acquisition\u2014within the acquisition directorate. Within Interior, the  department competition advocate is a senior procurement analyst who  reports to the senior procurement executive. The competition advocates at  the bureaus, components, or procuring activities included in our review  were, for example, acquisition policy chiefs or senior contracting officers.", "We found one situation, at ICE, where the competition advocate is higher  in the organization than the head of contracting activity. Given the  approval thresholds stipulated in the FAR, this means that the head of  contracting approves justifications at a higher dollar threshold than the  competition advocate, but in practice reports to the competition advocate.  The competition advocate explained that ICE does not administer many  high-dollar acquisitions, and therefore, having the competition advocate in  a management position above the head of contracting brings greater  visibility to noncompetitive requirements at lower-dollar thresholds.", "Expertise and Background  Agencies can appoint any individual, other than the senior procurement  executive, as a competition advocate as long as the individual\u2019s broader  functions and duties do not conflict with the responsibilities of a  competition advocate as outlined in statute. Agency officials told us that  a competition advocate should have the right skill set, which may include  a background that enables them to recognize and question overly  restrictive requirements which could lead to an unnecessary sole-source  outcome, and the personality to ask tough questions. In general, we found  that no specific qualifications were required for this role, but the Air  Force\u2019s Competition and Commercial Advocacy Program does call for its  competition advocates to have \u201cextensive qualifications and knowledge of  the types of acquisitions\u201d the procuring activity engages in.", "The department- and component-level competition advocates we spoke  with had a variety of backgrounds. Several of them had been contracting  officers and program managers, while one was involved in the operations  side of the agency, and another served as an attorney to the agency. Some  competition advocates offered examples of how their background and  expertise influence how they approach their job of promoting competition.", "Interior\u2019s competition advocate informed us that her experience as a  contracting officer and bureau competition advocate influences how she  reviews urgent and compelling requirements. During the Army\u2019s  deployment in Bosnia, she was a contingency contracting officer and  processed wartime requirements. She said that because she worked with  urgent and compelling requirements during the deployment, she is more  likely to challenge sole source emergency requirements in her capacity as  the competition advocate. In addition to her experience as a contingency  contracting officer, she also served as the competition advocate for the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service during Hurricane Katrina, service that  required her to balance the needs of emergency response with her  responsibility as a competition advocate to promote competition. She  believes that her past experience leads her to have a different attitude  toward her role as a competition advocate in comparison to other  advocates who may be less likely to challenge emergency requirements.", "The Coast Guard\u2019s competition advocate explained that his experience as  a program manager allows him to ask questions that a contracting officer  may not think to ask about a requirement. Over 25 years ago, he began  working in structural design and subsequently served in several  supervisory and program manager capacities in the Navy. His experience  in program, fiscal, and technical management influences how he  approaches his role as competition advocate. He reviews contract  documentation strictly from the perspective of promoting competition. He  stated that when a program office tries to solicit a requirement in a way  that precludes certain vendors, his technical background of working with  various platforms leads him to question these restrictive requirements.", "The competition advocate at one of the Air Force contracting activities we  visited pointed to her experience as a program manager and her  contracting background as an asset to her current position as competition  advocate. She also noted that the support that she receives and  relationships she has with the command-level and Air Force competition  advocate has helped her challenge sole source requirements when  program managers are pushing for a certain vendor.", "At one Navy location, the advocate pointed to her experience and  familiarity with the program offices\u2019 requirements as a plus in enabling her  to question planned sole-source procurements.", "The Secret Service\u2019s competition advocate has years of experience in  operations but no experience as a contracting officer or a program  manager. He told us he began working as a criminal investigator and  worked in other positions, such as on the president\u2019s protection detail and  in congressional affairs. After over 20 years of working in operations for  the agency, he told us he is learning about contracting operations and that  he believes more agents who work in operations should hold the position  of competition advocate.

The Army\u2019s competition advocate said that one trigger for potentially  rejecting a justification for a sole-source procurement is when the  evaluation of the market is cursory. For example, a justification for a sole- source award to an 8(a) ANC firm was turned back for additional detail on  market research and further review of the feedback from other potential  offerors, although the same firm ended up with the follow-on contract.", "As noted above, competition advocates are required to recommend to the  senior procurement executive and the chief acquisition officer a \u201csystem  of personal and organizational accountability\u201d for competition. The Navy  competition advocate and his staff told us that, as part of their review of  high dollar value justifications prior to the senior procurement executive\u2019s  review, they look to see whether program offices have made strides in  improving competition in their programs if a prior justification had made  this claim. Holding the program offices accountable is part of their overall  plan for improving competition, an attitude that is also strongly held by the  Navy\u2019s senior procurement executive. Other competition advocates also  pointed out that strong leadership, from the senior procurement executive  and the competition advocate, can engender results. The DHS competition  advocate, for example, noted that without this level of continued  leadership and the will to enforce accountability, there could be a slip  back to less competition.", "Other methods we found that competition advocates are using include:    DOD officials told us that the DOD competition advocate holds quarterly  meetings with competition advocates from the military services and other  DOD agencies to review the progress toward meeting competition  procurement goals and to challenge the barriers they identify as inhibiting  competition.", "The Navy competition advocate told us that he holds quarterly contracting  council meetings with senior contracting staff for each of the systems  commands (some of whom are also competition advocates), discussing  various topics including competition.  Interior and DHS do not hold regular meetings with the competition  advocates of bureaus or components, but, according to agency officials,  they have other meetings with procurement staff where competition goals  are discussed.", "The DHS competition advocate recently completed an investigation of  noncompetitive contract awards at DHS and found that some contract files  lacked required justifications for sole source procurements. Other  contract files included justifications that did not adequately describe why  only one source could perform the work. The competition advocate  subsequently approved a memorandum signed by the Chief Procurement  Officer that emphasized the need to include the justification in the  contract file and provided examples of inadequate rationale for use of a  noncompetitive contract.", "Competition advocates can also offer recognition and awards\u2014including  to program managers\u2014for efforts to increase competition. Some  advocates indicated that their agencies or procuring activities have  competition awards programs that recognize the work of individuals or  teams who increase competition. For example, since July 2007, DHS has  instituted the DHS Competition and Acquisition Excellence Awards  Program \u201cas a means of renewing and increasing acquisition workforce  interest in competition and related innovative procurement practices.\u201d The  Army competition advocate also said the Army was going to add  competition as a metric to the Secretary of the Army\u2019s award program,  awarding contracting activities that raised and exceeded their competition  goals.", "For their part, local competition advocates told us that they try to get  involved in acquisitions as early as possible to have a greater impact on  decisions related to competition. For example, the advocate at the Naval  Air Warfare Center Weapons Division said that, for service contracts, she  reviews acquisition strategies before she reviews justifications. If she  identifies a potential issue related to competition in the acquisition  strategy stage, she can have the program make appropriate changes before  the justification is ever developed. The Warner Robins Air Logistics Center  competition advocate and her staff also try to engage program offices  early in the process and, if the procurement must be noncompetitive, the  approval process is faster because they are already familiar with the  support for the justification. The Air Force competition advocate noted  that it is his responsibility to ensure that competition advocates in the field  have a certain level of independence to allow them to push back,  especially with regards to the requirements side, and to make sure there is  a process that allows them to raise issues up the chain when warranted."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Some degree of noncompetitive contracting is unavoidable, such as when  only one responsible source can perform the work; and in some cases  competition is impractical due to the government\u2019s reliance on contractors  stemming from decisions that were made long ago. Recent congressional  actions to strengthen competition opportunities in major defense  programs may take some time to demonstrate results. Further, OMB\u2019s  efforts to reduce agencies\u2019 use of high risk contract types may help  agencies refocus and reenergize efforts to improve competition. Despite  these actions, other targets of opportunity still exist, but to take full  advantage of them, it will be necessary to challenge conventional thinking  to some extent. Key among these are establishing an effective, adequately  trained team of contracting and program staff working together, starting  early in the acquisition process. Competition opportunities should be  considered when requirements are initially developed, and as complex  programs mature and the government gains more knowledge about what it  needs. Because program officials have an essential role in the acquisition  process, as do contracting officers, it is just as important for them to  advance competition whenever possible. Given the nation\u2019s fiscal  constraints, it is not acceptable to keep an incumbent contractor in place  without competition simply because the contractor is doing a good job, or  to resist legitimate suggestions that competition be imposed even though it  may take longer. As discussed in this report, some agencies have  implemented the leadership and accountability to make progress in this  area, such as breaking out requirements to facilitate competition.  However, there is no requirement to assess the circumstances under  which competitive solicitations receive only one offer to potentially bring  about a greater response from the market place. The competition  advocates, in their unique role and in the context of OFPP\u2019s call to  reinvigorate their role, have the potential to implement changes to practice  and to culture.

The Administrator noted that there is still  much work ahead and that OMB will periodically meet with agencies to  review progress against their risk reduction goals.  He stated that these  efforts will include a push to achieve greater collaboration between  contracting, program, finance, and other key stakeholder offices in the  acquisition process.

Finally, the  Administrator highlighted OFPP\u2019s October 2009 memorandum, which  stated that a spend analysis might be useful for identifying and analyzing  competitions where only one offer is received, by comparing levels of  competition achieved by different organizations within the agency or those  similarly situated in other agencies to determine if more successful  practices may exist for more competition for a given spending category.", "DOD also provided oral comments via email.

For these agencies, the  percentage of noncompetitive obligations ranged from 45.2 percent (Navy)  to 25.2 percent (DHS). We performed additional analysis of NASA and  DOD obligations, focusing on the types of services and products  represented by the noncompetitive obligations, and found that the  products were largely what is generally considered to be specialized  equipment. To focus our review on services, for DOD and NASA we  limited our analysis to the \u201cR\u201d codes in FPDS-NG, which reflect  professional, administrative, and management support services. Each of  the DOD agencies and NASA had a significant percentage of  noncompetitive contracts for these services. After discussion with our  congressional requesters, we eliminated NASA from our scope of work  and focused on the DOD agencies, DHS, and the Department of the  Interior.", "To identify the components, or specific procuring activities, within each of  these agencies for our contract file reviews, we focused on those whose  percentage of fiscal year 2008 obligations under noncompetitive contracts  exceeded that of the agency (Army, Navy, Air Force, DHS, and Interior) as  a whole. We also focused on those components with $100 million or more  in contract obligations in 2008 and those with higher-dollar procurements,  in order to avoid selecting low-dollar procurements. We then considered  other factors, such as travel expenses, the locations\u2019 percentage of  obligations under noncompetitive contracts, and the locations\u2019 percentage  of obligations under contracts with only one offer received, into account  in making our final selection. Following is more specific criteria applicable  to the agencies in our review.", "For the Army, Air Force, and Navy, our analysis of fiscal year 2008  noncompetitive obligations was limited to obligations for professional,  administrative, and management support services.", "For DHS: the Coast Guard, the Secret Service, Immigration and Customs  Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection, the Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the Transportation and  Security Administration met our initial selection criteria. We removed the  Coast Guard and FEMA from the scope of our review due to our continued  audits of the Coast Guard\u2019s Deepwater program, and FEMA because it had  also been the subject of many recent audits. (However, we did speak with  the Coast Guard\u2019s competition advocate and head of contracting activity  as part of our fifth objective, as discussed below.) Further, after discussion  with the DHS Inspector General, we also removed the Customs and Border  Protection and Transportation and Security Administration from our  scope to avoid duplication of effort, as the Inspector General had  completed or had current work underway on noncompetitive contracts at  those locations. Therefore, we focused on the Secret Service and ICE.", "At Interior, two components\u2014the Acquisition Services Directorate and  Bureau of Indian Affairs\u2014met our initial selection criteria.

Table 4 shows the specific locations we visited,  along with the number and type of contracts reviewed.", "To identify the extent to which agencies have reported obligations under  noncompetitive contracts, we analyzed FPDS-NG data from fiscal years  2005 through 2009 using the fields \u201cnot competed,\u201d \u201cnot available for  competition,\u201d and \u201cfollow on to competed action.\u201d We determined that a  contract or order was miscoded in FPDS-NG if it was coded as not  competed, but our analysis of the contract file documentation showed that  the contract or order was competed. Similarly, if a contract or order was  coded as competed with one offer received, we determined that it was  miscoded if the contract documentation showed that the requirement was  not competed, or that it was competed and received more than one offer.  We did not make a determination whether the \u201creason not competed\u201d field  in FPDS-NG was coded correctly. We also analyzed reported obligations  under competed contracts where only one offer had been reported for the  same time period. DOD\u2019s total obligations in fiscal year 2009 reflect an  approximately $13.9 billion downward adjustment made by DOD to  correct an administrative error made in fiscal year 2008. As this  adjustment significantly affected DOD\u2019s reported obligations in fiscal years  2008 and 2009, the figures we report reflects what DOD\u2019s total obligations  would have been had the error not occurred. We also analyzed FPDS-NG  data by quarter for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 to identify trends in  obligations under existing and newly awarded noncompetitive contracts.  In reviewing the contract files in our sample, we compared the reported  competition data in FPDS-NG to the actual data in the contract file to  determine if discrepancies existed in the way competition had been coded.  As discussed in the first objective in this report, we found that about 18  percent of the contracts or orders had been miscoded as either competed  or not competed. We found the FPDS-NG data to be adequately reliable for  overall trend analysis on extent of competition and for selection of  locations for our file reviews.", "To determine the exceptions to competition that were used, the factors  affecting competition, and the extent to which certain contracting  approaches reflected sound procurement or management practices, we  reviewed documentation in the contract files such as the written  justification, acquisition plan, statement of work, price negotiation  memorandums, records of market research, and other key documents.  Where our sample involved orders under IDIQ contracts, we reviewed the  base contract file as well. We reviewed pertinent legislation, such as the  Competition in Contracting Act, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act,  National Defense Authorization Acts, and the Weapon Systems Acquisition  Reform Act. We also reviewed relevant provisions in the Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR), specifically Parts 6, 8, 16, and 19, Small  Business Administration regulations, and pertinent agency guidance and  supplements to the FAR. We also reviewed GAO and Inspector General  audit reports dealing with competition. At the locations we visited, we  interviewed the contracting officer and contract specialist responsible for  the files we reviewed (when available) and, for many of the contracts, also  interviewed cognizant program officials to obtain their views. In addition  to discussing the specific issues related to the contracts in our sample, we  also discussed general topics with these officials, such as their views on  barriers to competition and how, if at all, they interact with the agency or  local-level competition advocate. We also interviewed procurement policy  officials at the department and local levels and a limited number of  contractor representatives.", "To determine how agencies are instituting the role of the competition  advocate, we reviewed statutory and FAR provisions, Office of  Management and Budget and Office of Federal Procurement Policy  memorandums (such as the May 2007 memorandum on reinvigorating the  role of the competition advocate), pertinent agency regulations and  guidance, and the annual competition reports for fiscal years 2008 and  2009 for the agencies in our review. We interviewed the competition  advocates at DOD, the Army, Navy, and Air Force, the Department of the  Interior, and DHS, as well as the advocates at the components included in  our review. We discussed the competition advocates\u2019 placement within  their organizations, their backgrounds and areas of expertise, their  strategies for promoting competition, and factors they identified as  barriers to competition.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2009 to July 2010, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of the Interior", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Michele Mackin, Assistant  Director; Tatiana Winger; Julia Kennon; Anh Nguyen; Kenneth Patton;  Jared Sippel; Sylvia Schatz; Kristin VanWychen; and Keo Vongvanith made  key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
