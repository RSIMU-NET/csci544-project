Six review teams comprised of 70 personnel in all evaluated the designs to ensure the technical solutions, development approach, and readiness of test facilities were adequate. DOD and its contractor are now implementing the simplified architecture, developing new software, and testing elements critical to the integration and test of systems. DOD is also improving its program oversight and better managing the SBIRS development, by acting on the recommendations of an Independent Program Assessment; addressing weaknesses in management responsibility, accountability and organizational structure; and establishing a central execution team. DOD has estimated that the SBIRS program will be delayed by 15 months and cost $414 million in funding to resolve the flight software problems, but these estimates appear optimistic. For example, confidence levels--based on the program's ability to develop, integrate, and test software in time to meet the schedule goal--have been assessed as low. Further, the review teams who approved the designs to start coding software report that the program's aggressive schedule is a major challenge because it allows \"little margin for error.\" DOD has also introduced risk by granting waivers to streamline the software development processes to meet the aggressive schedule. These allow the program to deviate from disciplined processes in order to compress the schedule and meet the goal. In addition, some software elements are behind schedule, and thousands of software activities and deliverables remain to be integrated.

For example, in 2002, the program faced serious  problems with software and hardware design progress and, in the  Conference Report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 2002, conferees recommended cutting advance  procurement funding due to concerns about program developments and  the unclear status of the SBIRS program. At that time, the first satellite  launch slipped from 2002 to 2006.

The testing failure of the flight software is further proof that  sophisticated technology and inherent complexities related to software  continue to be underestimated. To its credit, DOD has instilled greater  discipline by involving outside experts, regaining control of development  activities, and dealing with the poor relationships that had existed for  some time. To ensure that such steps can lead to success, adherence to  disciplined software practices should be made a priority over steps or  measures taken to compress the schedule for the sake of meeting the self- imposed launch goal. Prioritizing such disciplines will improve efforts to  acquire a better product, increase executability of the program, and  reduce program risk.

Rather, as we noted, software experts, independent reviewers, as well as  the government officials we interviewed expressed concern over the  aggressive schedule and questionable schedule margin, which the Defense  Contract Management Agency believes is insufficient. Moreover, as we  previously reported and noted in this report, the expenditure of  management reserves has been particularly problematic because these  funds were being rapidly spent. Further, while OSD\u2019s plan to assess  software and its willingness to revise the cost and schedule goals appear  plausible, we believe this approach falls well short of a more reasonable  approach to increase the confidence of success for the reasons we cited.
