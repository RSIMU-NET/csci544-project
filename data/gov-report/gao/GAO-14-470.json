GCSS-Army is intended to integrate  approximately 40,000 local supply and logistics databases into a single,  enterprise-wide system. In December 2012, the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics granted full  deployment decision approval for GCSS-Army to be deployed to all  remaining locations beyond the limited fielding locations of the life-cycle  acquisition process.

The methodology is a compilation of characteristics and  associated best practices that federal cost estimating organizations and  industry use to develop and maintain reliable cost estimates throughout  the life of an acquisition program.", "In May 2012, we issued an exposure draft of the Schedule Guide as a  companion to the Cost Guide. A consistent methodology for developing,  managing, and evaluating capital program cost estimates includes the  concept of scheduling the necessary work to a timeline, as discussed in  the Cost Guide. Simply put, schedule variances are usually followed by  cost variances. Because some program costs, such as labor, supervision,  rented equipment, and facilities, cost more if the program takes longer, a  reliable schedule can contribute to an understanding of the cost impact if  the program does not finish on time. In addition, management tends to  respond to schedule delays by adding more resources or authorizing  overtime. Further, a schedule risk analysis allows for program  management to account for the cost effects of schedule slippage when  developing the life-cycle cost estimate.

Appendix I  contains our detailed analysis of the GCSS-Army schedule estimate. The  success of any program depends on having a reliable schedule of the  program\u2019s work activities that will occur, how long they will take, and how  the activities are related to one another. As such, the schedule not only  provides a road map for systematic execution of a program, but also  provides the means by which to gauge progress, identify and address  potential problems, and promote accountability.", "Comprehensive. A schedule should reflect all activities as defined in the  program\u2019s work breakdown structure, including activities to be performed  by the government and the contractor; the resources (e.g., labor,  materials, and overhead) needed to complete each activity; and how long  each activity will take.", "We found that the GCSS-Army schedule partially met the comprehensive  characteristic. The schedule used to support the full deployment decision  reflected all activities to be performed by both the government and  contractor for the program. However, resources were not loaded into the  schedule software and were not assigned to specific activities in the  schedule. GCSS-Army program management officials told us that the  contractor used a separate system outside the schedule to manage the  resources needed for the program. Information on resource needs and  availability in each work period assists the program office in forecasting  the likelihood that activities will be completed as scheduled. If the current  schedule does not allow insight into the current or projected allocation of  resources, the risk of the program\u2019s schedule slipping is significantly  increased. Our analysis also determined that activity durations were not  manageable and reasonably estimated in the schedule. We found that 30  percent of the remaining activities in the schedule exceeded the standard  best practice for activity duration, which should be shorter than  approximately 44 working days, or 2 working months. For example, audit  support activities had durations over 100 working days. Durations should  be as short as possible to facilitate the objective measurement of  accomplished effort. If activities are too long, the schedule may not have  enough detail for effective progress measurement and reporting.", "Well-constructed. A schedule should be planned so that critical project  dates can be met. To meet this objective, all activities should be logically  sequenced\u2014that is, listed in the order in which they are to be carried out.  In particular, activities that must finish prior to the start of other activities  (i.e., predecessor activities), as well as activities that cannot begin until  other activities are completed (i.e., successor activities), should be  identified and their relationships established. The schedule should identify  the project\u2019s critical path. Establishing a valid critical path is necessary  for examining the effects of any activity slipping along this path. The  calculation of a critical path determines which activities drive the project\u2019s  earliest completion date. The schedule should also identify total float so  that the schedule\u2019s flexibility can be accurately determined.", "We found that the GCSS-Army schedule was partially well-constructed.  The majority of logic used to sequence the activities within the schedule  was generally error free, clearly indicating to program management the  order of activities that must be accomplished. However, the schedule\u2019s  critical path was not valid because it included level of effort activities and  date constraints. Level of effort activities, such as program  management, should not define the critical path because they are  nondiscrete support activities that do not produce a definite end product;  therefore, level of effort activities cannot determine the length of the  project. In addition, date constraints prevent the critical path from being a  continuous sequence of events from the current to finish dates of the  project. Rather than relying on such constraints, the schedule should use  logic and durations in order to reflect realistic start and completion dates  for activities. Successfully identifying the critical path relies on several  factors, such as capturing all activities; properly sequencing activities; and  assigning resources, which, as noted earlier, had not been completely  done. Without a valid critical path, management cannot focus on activities  that will have detrimental effects on the key project milestones and  deliverables if they slip. Further, our analysis found that 28 percent of  remaining schedule activities had more than 100 working days of total  float, meaning that those activities could slip almost 5 working months  and not affect the estimated finish date of the program. Based on the  remaining duration of the program, 100 working days of float would not  appear to be reasonable. The GCSS-Army Program Management Office  stated that total float was not reliable at the time of the full deployment  decision because the schedule was being updated to reflect a  modification to the system. Without accurate values of total float for a  program activity, management cannot determine the flexibility of tasks  and therefore cannot properly reallocate resources from tasks that can  safely slip to tasks that cannot slip without adversely affecting the  estimated program completion date.", "Credible. A schedule should be horizontally and vertically integrated. A  horizontally integrated schedule links products and outcomes with other  associated sequenced activities, which helps verify that activities are  arranged in the right order to achieve aggregated products or outcomes.  A vertically integrated schedule ensures that the start and completion  dates for activities are aligned with such dates on subsidiary schedules  supporting tasks and subtasks. A schedule risk analysis should also be  performed using statistical techniques to predict the level of confidence in  meeting a program\u2019s completion date.", "We found that the GCSS-Army schedule was substantially credible. The  schedule was substantially horizontally integrated, which means that  outcomes were aligned with sequenced activities. The schedule was also  substantially vertically integrated; we were able to trace varying levels of  activities and supporting subactivities. Such mapping or alignment among  subsidiary schedules enables different groups\u2014such as government  teams and contractors\u2014to work to the same master schedule, and  provides assurance that the representation of the schedule to different  audiences is consistent and accurate. However, our analysis found that a  schedule risk analysis had not been fully conducted. GCSS-Army  program management officials provided documentation for a schedule  risk analysis, but we noted that risk analyses were not performed for all  supporting activities because program management officials stated that  the program fielding schedule was not finalized at the time of the full  deployment decision. If a schedule risk analysis is not conducted,  program management cannot determine (1) the likelihood that the project  completion date will occur, (2) how much schedule risk contingency is  needed to provide an acceptable level of certainty for completion by a  specific date, (3) risks most likely to delay the project, (4) how much  contingency reserve each risk requires, and (5) the activities that are  most likely to delay the project.", "Controlled. A schedule should be continually updated using logic,  durations, and actual progress to realistically forecast dates for program  activities. A schedule narrative should accompany the updated schedule  to provide decision makers and auditors a log of changes and their effect,  if any, on the schedule time frame. The schedule should be analyzed  continually for variances to determine when forecasted completion dates  differ from planned dates. This analysis is especially important for those  variations that affect activities identified as being in a program\u2019s critical  path and that can affect a scheduled completion date. A baseline  schedule should be used to manage the program scope, the time period  for accomplishing it, and the required resources.", "We found that the GCSS-Army schedule was substantially controlled.  GCSS-Army program management officials stated that they met weekly  to discuss proposed schedule changes and update the schedule\u2019s  progress, and management also prepared a schedule narrative document  that contained a list of custom fields and assumptions. In addition, we  found no anomalies throughout the schedule (e.g., activities with planned  start dates scheduled to occur in the past and activities with actual finish  dates scheduled to occur in the future). However, we found that there was  not a documented baseline schedule to measure program performance  against, which would allow management to monitor any schedule  variances that affect the completion of work. Without a formally  established baseline schedule to measure performance against,  management cannot identify or mitigate the effect of unfavorable  performance.", "In our October 2010 report, we recommended that the Army develop an  integrated master schedule that fully incorporated best practices, such as  capturing all activities, sequencing all activities, integrating activities  horizontally and vertically, establishing the critical path for all activities,  and conducting a schedule risk analysis. The Army\u2019s December 2012  GCSS-Army schedule used to support the full deployment decision  addressed several of the best practices that were an issue in our prior  report, including capturing all activities, sequencing all activities, and  integrating activities horizontally and vertically. However, as discussed,  we continued to identify several best practices that were not yet fully  addressed and also identified several new areas where the 2012  schedule did not incorporate best practices, such as activity durations and  baseline schedule. Although GCSS-Army is in full deployment, without  fully addressing best practices for scheduling, program managers will not  have the best information available to make decisions related to issues  such as the sequencing of activities and the flexibility of the schedule  according to available resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Cost Estimate Did Not Fully Meet Best Practices", "paragraphs": ["We found that the GCSS-Army program fully met one, substantially met  two, and partially met one of the characteristics of a reliable cost estimate  and therefore did not provide the information needed to support the full  deployment decision, as shown in table 2.

Such an estimate provides the basis  for informed investment decision making, realistic budget formulation and  program resourcing, meaningful progress measurement, proactive course  correction when warranted, and accountability for results.", "Comprehensive. A cost estimate should include costs of the program over  its full life cycle, provide a level of detail appropriate to ensure that cost  elements are neither omitted nor double-counted, and document all cost- influencing ground rules and assumptions.

The cost estimate included both government and  contractor costs of the program over its life cycle\u2014from the inception of  the program through design, development, deployment, and operation  and maintenance.

The  documentation should capture such things as the source data used, the  calculations performed, the results of the calculations, the estimating  methodology used to derive each work breakdown structure element\u2019s  cost, and evidence that the estimate was approved by management. The  documentation should discuss the technical baseline description, and the  data in the technical baseline should be consistent with the cost estimate.", "We found that the cost estimate for GCSS-Army was substantially well- documented. The cost estimate captured such things as the calculations  performed to derive each element\u2019s cost and the results of the  calculations. The documentation also included a technical baseline  description that provided data consistent with the cost estimate. Further,  the GCSS-Army Program Management Office presented evidence of  receiving approval of the estimate through briefings to management.  Although program management officials did not provide us with written  documentation of the source data, the Office of the Deputy Assistant  Secretary of the Army for Cost and Economics (DASA-CE) did provide us  with a full deployment decision briefing, which showed each major cost  element and listed the methodology and sources of the data. However,  the briefing documents included a limited amount of the actual source  data, and we could not determine their reliability. Without sufficient  background information about the source data and reliability of the data,  the GCSS-Army cost estimator cannot know with any confidence whether  the data collected can be used directly or need to be modified before use  in the cost estimate.", "Accurate. A cost estimate should provide for results that are unbiased,  are not overly conservative or optimistic, and contain no major mistakes.  A cost estimate should be based on an assessment of most likely costs  (adjusted properly for inflation), updated to reflect significant changes and  grounded in a historical record of cost estimating and actual experiences  on other comparable programs. In addition, variances between planned  and actual costs should be documented, explained, and reviewed, and  estimating techniques for each cost element should be used  appropriately.", "We found that the cost estimate for GCSS-Army was substantially  accurate. The GCSS-Army cost model detailed the inflation indexes and  properly applied the indexes to each relevant cost element and included  time phasing of the costs. The GCSS-Army cost model did not include  any major mistakes, and all its cost elements summed up properly and  were consistent with the cost estimate. In addition, the estimating  techniques (i.e., engineering build-up) used to create the estimate were  used appropriately. The cost model documentation did not explain  whether the cost estimate was updated to reflect changes in technical or  program assumptions. The program management officials provided  documentation that reflected the technical changes for the major  deployment decisions, but the documentation did not include details on  how the costs were updated. Unless such documentation is available to  verify that the cost estimate is properly updated on a regular basis,  management will not have reasonable assurance that the cost estimate  provides accurate information to make informed decisions about the  program.", "Credible. A cost estimate should discuss any limitations of the analysis  because of uncertainty or biases surrounding data or assumptions. The  cost estimate should include a sensitivity analysis that identifies a range  of possible costs based on varying major assumptions and data. A risk  and uncertainty analysis should be conducted to determine the level of  risk associated with the cost estimate and identify the effects of changing  key cost driver assumptions and factors. In addition, the estimate\u2019s results  should be cross-checked and reconciled to an independent cost estimate  to determine whether other estimating methods produce similar results.", "We found that the cost estimate was partially credible. The Army Cost  Review Board developed an independent cost estimate that was  reconciled to the program management officials\u2019 cost estimate. The  program management officials\u2019 cost estimate mentioned results of a risk  analysis; however the risk and uncertainty analysis was not documented.  Further, since the cost estimate that was provided discussed risk only at a  summary level, it is unclear how management considered risk related to  the program. Without a fully documented risk and uncertainty analysis,  the estimate will lose credibility and management\u2019s decision-making  ability will be impaired because it will not know the level of confidence  associated with achieving the cost estimate. In addition, program  management officials provided a cost estimate that identified major cost  drivers, including system deployment and training. The cost estimate  documentation contained a reference that a sensitivity analysis was  completed on these cost drivers, but results of this analysis were not  documented. As a result, the GCSS-Army cost estimator will not have a  clear understanding of how each major cost driver is affected by a change  in a single assumption and thus which cost driver most affects the cost  estimate. Further, GCSS-Army program officials provided us with one  example of evidence that indicated that some cross-checking was  performed using cost models; however, the results of this cross-checking  were not documented. The purpose of cross-checking is to determine  whether alternative methods would produce similar results, which would  increase the credibility of the estimate.", "In our October 2010 report, we recommended that the Army update the  GCSS-Army cost estimate by using actual costs and preparing a  sensitivity analysis.
