DOD cannot estimate the size of its backlog of overdue reinvestigations that have not been submitted for renewal, but prior estimates of this portion of the backlog suggest it was sizeable. Using September 2003 data from DSS, OPM, and nine adjudication facilities, GAO calculated the size of investigative and adjudicative portions of the backlog at roughly 270,000 and 90,000 cases, respectively. Because these estimates were made using time-based goals that varied from agency to agency, the actual backlog size is uncertain. Several impediments hinder DOD's ability to eliminate--and accurately estimate the size of--its clearance backlog. Four major impediments slowing the elimination of the backlog are (1) the large numbers of new clearance requests; (2) the insufficient investigator and adjudicator workforces; (3) the size of the existing backlog; and (4) the lack of a strategic plan for overcoming problems in gaining access to state, local, and overseas information needed to complete investigations. Two other factors have hampered DOD's ability to develop accurate estimates of the backlog size. DOD has failed to provide adequate oversight of its clearance program, including developing DOD-wide backlog definitions and measures and using the measures to assess the backlog regularly. In addition, delays in implementing its Joint Personnel Adjudication System have limited DOD's ability to monitor backlog size and track when periodic reinvestigations are due. DOD's failure to eliminate and accurately assess the size of the backlog may have adverse effects. Delays in updating overdue clearances for command, agency, and industry personnel who are doing classified work may increase risks to national security. Slowness in issuing new clearances can increase the costs of doing classified government work. Finally, DOD's inability to accurately define and measure the backlog and project future clearance requests that it expects to receive can adversely affect its ability to develop accurate budgetary and staffing plans. In December 2003, advisors to OPM's Director recommended that the authorized transfer of DOD's investigative functions and personnel to OPM should not occur for at least the rest of fiscal year 2004. That recommendation was based on uncertainties over financial risks that OPM might incur. An alternative plan being discussed by DOD and OPM calls for leaving investigative staff in DSS and giving them training for, and access to, OPM's case management system. A DOD official estimated that using the OPM system, instead of DOD's current system, would avoid about $100 million in update and maintenance costs during the next 5 years. Also, as of December 16, 2003, the Secretary of Defense had not provided Congress with certifications required prior to any transfer."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Recent events, such as the terrorist attacks on the United States on  September 11, 2001, and several high-profile espionage cases have  heightened national security concerns and underscored the need for a  timely, high-quality personnel security clearance process. Each year, the  Department of Defense (DOD) processes hundreds of thousands of  security clearance requests for service members, government employees,  and industry personnel who are conducting classified work for the  department and other government agencies. These requests include  (1) periodic reinvestigations for individuals who already hold security  clearances or initial investigations for individuals who have not held  security clearances in the past and (2) adjudications to determine whether  or not individuals are eligible for clearances, based on information  collected during the investigations and reinvestigations.", "Historically, DOD\u2019s Defense Security Service (DSS) had conducted almost  all of the department\u2019s security clearance investigations. In 1999, however,  DOD contracted with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and  later with private-sector investigative firms, to process large numbers of  new investigations and reinvestigations. Using information from the  investigations, DOD\u2019s 10 central adjudication facilities provide the  eligibility-for-clearance determinations.", "Since at least the late 1990s, the timeliness of DOD\u2019s personnel security  clearance process has been at issue. In our October 1999 report, for  example, we identified serious problems with the adequacy of DOD\u2019s  investigations; this work prompted the department to declare its  investigative function a systemic weakness under the Federal Managers\u2019  Financial Integrity Act of 1982. In our August 2000 report, we noted  that DOD estimated it had a backlog of more than 500,000 overdue  reinvestigations that had not yet been submitted for renewal and found  that DOD had no established method for monitoring or estimating the total  number of periodic reinvestigations that were overdue but not submitted.  Moreover, in our 2001 report, we found that DOD\u2019s adjudicators did not  consistently document adverse security conditions, and we identified  other factors that hindered the effectiveness of the adjudication process.  Along with our reviews, several reports issued in 2000 and 2001 by the  DOD Office of the Inspector General have also documented problems with  various aspects of the security clearance process. In agency comments to  GAO and DOD Office of Inspector General recommendations (see app. I  for recommendations), DOD identified many actions it had taken or  planned to take to address problems in its investigative and adjudicative  processes. For example, in response to a recommendation in our August  2000 report, DOD noted that the Joint Personnel Adjudication System  (JPAS) would be implemented in fiscal year 2001 and would provide an  automated means of tracking and counting overdue but-not-submitted  requests for reinvestigation.", "More recently, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004  authorized the transfer of DOD\u2019s personnel security investigative functions  and 1,855 investigative employees to OPM. Under the Act, a transfer of  functions can only be made after the Secretary of Defense certifies that  certain conditions can be met and that the Director of OPM concurs with  the authorized transfer. Among the conditions requiring Secretary of  Defense certification are \u201chat the Office of Personnel Management is  fully capable of carrying out high-priority investigations required by the  Secretary of Defense within a timeframe set by the Secretary of Defense\u201d  and \u201chat the Office of Personnel Management has undertaken necessary  and satisfactory steps to ensure that investigations performed on  Department of Defense contract personnel will be conducted in an  expeditious manner sufficient to ensure that those contract personnel are  available to the Department of Defense within the timeframe set by the  Secretary of Defense.\u201d", "You asked us to conduct a follow-up review of DOD\u2019s personnel security  process.

The time frames for reinvestigation are every   5 years for top secret, 10 years for secret, and 15 years for confidential.", "DOD\u2019s personnel security clearance process has three stages:  preinvestigation, which includes determining if a requirement for access  exists and submitting an investigation request; the actual personnel  security investigation; and adjudication, a determination of eligibility for  access to classified information (see fig. 1). Since 1997, all federal agencies   have been subject to a common set of personnel security investigative  standards and adjudicative guidelines for determining whether service  members, government employees, industry personnel, and others are  eligible to receive a security clearance. In 1998, DOD formally  incorporated these standards and guidelines into its regulations governing  access to classified information.", "The security officer begins the preinvestigation stage of the clearance  process by determining whether a position requires access to classified  information. If so, the current or future job incumbent completes a  personnel security questionnaire that asks for detailed information  about a wide range of issues. The impetus for an investigation request  could be a need to (1) appoint, enlist, or induct an individual into the  military; (2) staff a new program or contract with an individual who has  a clearance; (3) replace a cleared job incumbent with someone else;  (4) raise an existing clearance to a higher level; or (5) reinvestigate  a previously cleared job incumbent whose clearance is due for  reinvestigation.", "In the investigation stage, investigative staff members seek information  pertaining to the subject\u2019s loyalty, character, reliability, trustworthiness,  honesty, and financial responsibility. The level of clearance is the primary  determinant of the types and sources of information gathered. For  example, an investigation for a top secret clearance requires much more  information than does the type of investigation required to determine  eligibility for either a secret or confidential clearance. The types or  sources of information might include an interview with the subject of  the investigation, national agency checks (e.g., Federal Bureau of  Investigations and immigration records), local agency checks (e.g.,  municipal police and court records), financial checks, birth date and place,  citizenship, education, employment, public records for information such  as bankruptcy or divorce, and interviews with references.", "In the adjudication stage of the security clearance process, government  employees in 10 DOD central adjudication facilities use the information  gathered at the investigation stage to approve, deny, or revoke eligibility to  access classified information.

Our 2000 report also noted that the 500,000-case backlog  estimate was of questionable reliability because of the ad hoc methods  used to derive it. Between 2000 and 2002, DOD took a number of steps to  reduce this backlog, including mandating the submission of requests and  requiring senior service officials to provide monthly submission progress  reports. On February 22, 2002, DOD concluded this backlog reduction  effort by issuing an OASD (C3I) memorandum directing that \u201cy  September 30, 2002, if a clearance is not based upon a current or pending  investigation, or if the position does not support a requirement for a  clearance, the clearance must be administratively terminated or  downgraded without prejudice to the individual.\u201d DOD is unable to show  that the overdue but-not-submitted reinvestigations backlog was  eliminated by these actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Roughly 270,000 Submitted Requests for Investigations Overdue for Completion", "paragraphs": ["At the end of September 2003, the investigative portion of the backlog  consisted of roughly 270,000 submitted requests for either reinvestigation  or initial investigation that had not been completed within a prescribed  amount of time.

After we recommended  that DOD adjudication facility officials grant clearances only when all  essential investigative work has been done, DSS monitored the cases  returned from the adjudication facilities and identified reasons for the  returns. Overall, about 10 percent of the 283,480 DOD cases fully closed by  OPM in fiscal year 2002 were initially delivered to central adjudication  facilities as closed pending cases.

Applying the backlog criteria  of one central adjudication facility to the completed investigations  waiting adjudication at another facility could increase or decrease the  estimated size of the DOD-wide adjudicative backlog. For instance,  the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office\u2019s goals for completing  adjudications are 3 days for initial investigations and 30 days for periodic  reinvestigations, and any cases exceeding these amounts are considered a  backlog. In contrast, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\u2019 goal is to  maintain a steady workload of adjudicating 2,150 cases per month within  30 days of receipt, and it considers a backlog to exist when the number of  cases on hand exceeds its normal workload.

In  fiscal year 2003, the Secretary of Defense annual report to the President  and Congress noted that defense organizations annually request more than  1 million security checks. These checks include investigations that are part  of the personnel security clearance process as well as other investigations  such as those used to screen some new recruits entering the military.  Other federal agencies are also requesting a growing number of  background investigations according to OPM. In our November 2003  report on aviation security, we noted that OPM had stated that  (1) it received an unprecedented number of requests for background  investigations governmentwide since September 2001 and (2) the large  number of requests was the primary reason for delayed clearance  processing.", "Historically, almost all of DOD\u2019s requests for investigations were  submitted to DSS. Starting in 1999, DOD contracted with OPM to complete  a large number of requests for investigations as part of DOD\u2019s effort to  expand its investigative capacity and decrease its investigative  backlog. OUSD (I) estimated that DOD spent over $450 million for the  investigations submitted to DSS and OPM in fiscal year 2003. As table 2  shows, OUSD (I) reported that the actual number of requests submitted  for investigations were approximately 700,000 in fiscal year 2001, more  than 850,000 in fiscal year 2002, and more than 775,000 in fiscal year 2003.  In fiscal year 2003, DSS had responsibility for a larger percentage of the  total DOD investigations workload than it had in the prior 2 fiscal years.  DSS supplemented its federal workforce with contracts to three private- sector investigations firms. As table 2 also indicates, the number of  targeted submissions versus the actual number of submissions that DOD  received varied considerably from year to year. In fiscal year 2001, DOD  received fewer requests than it had expected (82 percent), and in fiscal  years 2002 and 2003, it received more requests than projected (119 and  113 percent, respectively).", "DOD personnel, investigations contractors, and industry officials told us  that the large number of requests for investigations could be attributed to  many factors. For example, they ascribed the large number of requests to  heightened security concerns that resulted from the September 11, 2001,  terrorist attacks. They also attributed the large number of investigations to  an increase in the operations and deployments of military personnel and  to the increasingly sensitive technology that military personnel,  government employees, and contractors come in contact with as a part of  their job. While having a large number of cleared personnel can give the  military services, agencies, and industry a large amount of flexibility  when assigning personnel, the investigative and adjudicative workloads  that are required to provide the clearances further tax DOD\u2019s already  overburdened personnel security clearance program.", "A change in the level of clearance being requested also increases the  investigative and adjudicative workloads. A growing percentage of all  DOD requests for clearances is at the top secret level. For example, in  fiscal years 1995 and 2003, 17 percent and 27 percent, respectively, of the  clearance requests for industry personnel were at the top secret level. This  increase of 10 percentage points in the proportion of investigations at the  top secret level is important because top secret clearances must be  renewed twice as often as secret clearances (i.e., every 5 years versus  every 10 years). According to OUSD (I), top secret clearances take eight  times the investigative effort needed to complete a secret clearance and  three times the adjudicative effort to review. The doubling of frequency  along with the increased effort to investigate and adjudicate each top  secret reinvestigation adds costs and workload for DOD.", "Cost. In fiscal year 2003, the costs of investigations that DOD obtained  through DSS were $2,640 for an initial investigation for a top secret  clearance, $1,591 for a periodic reinvestigation of a top secret  clearance, and $328 for the most commonly used investigation for a  secret clearance. The cost of getting and maintaining a top secret  clearance for 10 years is approximately 13 times greater than the cost  for a secret clearance. For example, an individual getting a top secret  clearance for the first time and keeping the clearance for 10 years  would cost DOD a total of $4,231 in current year dollars ($2,640 for the  initial investigation and $1,591 for the reinvestigation after the first  5 years). In contrast, an individual receiving a secret clearance and  maintaining it for 10 years would cost a total of $328 ($328 for the  initial clearance that is good for 10 years).", "Time/Workload. The workload is also affected by the scope of  coverage in the various types of investigations. Much of the  information for a secret clearance is gathered through electronic files.  The investigation for a top secret clearance, on the other hand, requires  the information needed for the secret clearance as well as data  gathered through time-consuming tasks such as interviews with the  subject of the investigation request, references in the workplace, and  neighbors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inadequate Investigative and Adjudicative Workforces Hinder Efforts to Eliminate Backlog", "paragraphs": ["Another impediment to eliminating the large security clearance backlog  is the inadequate size of the federal and private-sector investigative  workforces relative to the large workloads that they face.

In addition, DSS has  the equivalent of 625 full-time investigative staff, based on 2,500 mostly  part-time investigators, from its three contractors. DSS equates four of the  part-time investigators to one full-time investigator.

OPM reported that its primary  contractor is adding about 100 investigators per month, but turnover is  about 70 employees per month.", "We believe that DSS\u2019s estimate of the number of full-time-equivalent  investigators working for its contractors is imprecise because (1) an  investigator may work part-time for more than one contractor and  (2) the amount of time devoted to conducting investigations can vary  substantially. These part-time investigators work different amounts of time  each month, according to both their own preference and the number of  assignments they receive from investigation contractor(s). Sometimes they  are unavailable to work for one contractor because they are conducting  investigations for another contractor. Officials from DSS\u2019s investigations  contractors told us that they intend to continue relying largely on staff  employed on an as-needed basis. Some of the private-sector officials  stated that they would incur additional financial risks if they were to use  full-time investigators.", "Inadequate adjudicator staffing also causes delays in issuing eligibility-for- clearance decisions. Since we issued our report on DOD adjudications in  2001, the number of eligibility-for-clearance decisions has risen for  reasons such as an increase in the number of completed investigations  stemming from DOD\u2019s contract with OPM and the improved operation of  DSS\u2019s Case Control Management System.", "Central adjudication facilities with adjudicative backlogs have taken  various actions to eliminate their backlog.

The Navy\u2019s central  adjudication facility contracted with three companies to provide support  and hired an additional 27 full-time-equivalent civilian and military  adjudicators, which helped the Navy eliminate much of its adjudicative  backlog that had grown to approximately 60,000 cases by December 2002.  Because the DOD Office of Inspector General is examining whether the  Navy adjudicative contracts led the contractor\u2019s staff to perform an  inherently governmental function\u2014adjudication\u2014it is unclear whether the  Army and Air Force central adjudication facilities will be able to use  similar contracting to eliminate their backlogs.", "The 10 DOD central adjudication facilities are funded by different agencies  and operate independently of one another.

In our April 2001 report on DOD  adjudications, we noted that studies issued by the Defense Personnel  Security Research Center, the Joint Security Commission, and the DOD  Office of the Inspector General between 1991 and 1998 had concluded  that the decentralized structure of DOD\u2019s adjudication facilities had  drawbacks. Two of the studies had recommended that DOD consolidate  its adjudication facilities (with the exception of the National Security  Agency because of the sensitive nature of its work) into a single entity.

This point can be illustrated by examining the results of  miscommunications between OASD (C3I) and DSS regarding assigning  priorities to investigations between March 2002 and March 2003. During  that period, DSS placed a higher priority on completing new\u2014versus old\u2014 requests. From March through September 2002, DSS averaged 97 days to  open and complete initial investigation requests for top secret clearances;  100 days, for top secret reinvestigation; 43 days, for secret; and 44 days, for  confidential.

This problem of accessibility to state and  local information was identified in an October 2002 House Committee on  Government Reform report. The report recommended that the Secretary  of Defense and the Attorney General jointly develop a system that allows  DSS and OPM investigators access to state and local criminal history  information records. In addition, representatives from one investigations  contractor noted that the Security Clearance Information Act gives only  certain federal agencies access to state and local criminal records, and  therefore private-sector investigators are put at a disadvantage relative to  federal investigators.", "Another barrier to the timely closure of an investigation is a limited  investigative capacity overseas, which causes delays in obtaining  information from overseas investigative sources. DSS, OPM, and private- sector investigations contractors do not maintain staffs overseas to  investigate individuals who are currently or were formerly stationed  overseas, who have traveled or lived overseas, or who have relatives living  in foreign countries. Officials at DSS and the central adjudication facilities  told us that they typically ask overseas-based DOD criminal investigations  personnel or State Department and Central Intelligence Agency employees  to supply this type of investigative information as a collateral duty.", "DOD has no strategic plan for overcoming access to information problems  and the delays that result, but DOD has made efforts to address selective  aspects of the access problem. For example, DOD supplied us with draft  legislation proposing to provide access to a central repository for driver  licensing records. DOD proposed that this information be used in  personnel security investigations and determinations as well as personnel  investigations with regard to federal employment security checks.

Knowing the accurate size of the backlog is an  important step towards effectively managing and eventually eliminating  the backlog. When we asked for all investigative backlog reports produced  since 2000, OUSD (I) supplied January 2000 estimates as its most recent  report, and the report included only reinvestigations. This finding  regarding the infrequency of reporting contradicts DOD\u2019s concurrence  with our October 1999 recommendation for OASD (C3I) to improve its  oversight of the investigations program and our August 2000  recommendation to design routine reports to show the full extent of  overdue reinvestigations.

In early December 2003, an OUSD  (I) official said current plans are to have JPAS fully operational by January  2004.

In 1999, the Joint Security Commission reported  that delays in initiating reinvestigations create risks to national security  because the longer individuals hold clearances the more likely they are to  be working with critical information systems.", "Delays in completing initial security clearances may have an economic  impact on the cost of performing classified work within or for the  U.S. government.

More  than a decade later, the Joint Security Commission report noted that the  costs directly attributable to investigative delays in fiscal year 1994 could  be as high as several billion dollars because workers were unable to  perform their jobs while awaiting a clearance. While newer overall cost  estimates are not available, the underlying reasons\u2014the backlog and  clearance delays that prevent the employment\u2014for the costs still exist  within DOD.

Representatives from one company with $1 billion per year in sales stated  that their company offers a $10,000 bonus to its employees for each person  recruited who already has a security clearance. Such operating costs are  then passed on to government customers in the form of higher bids for  contracts. In turn, the recruit\u2019s former company may need to back-fill a  position, as well as possibly settle for a lower level of contract  performance while a new employee is found, obtains a clearance, and  learns the former employee\u2019s job. Also, industry representatives discussed  instances where their companies gave hiring preference to personnel who  could do the job but were less qualified than others who did not possess a  clearance. The chair of the interagency Personnel Security Working Group  noted that a company might hire an employee and begin paying that  individual, but not assign any work to the individual until a clearance is  obtained.

Other  impediments to eliminating the backlog are formidable, but more  tractable. Shortages of investigative and adjudicative staff prevent DOD  from quickly completing cases in the existing backlog as well as the  hundreds of thousands of new clearance requests that have been  submitted during each of the last 3 years. Using the rough estimates  provided by an OPM official, the shortage of over 3,500 full-time-equivalent  investigative staff illustrates one area in the clearance process where  supply of personnel is inadequate to meet the demand for services. DOD  has not developed a strategic plan for overcoming problems in accessing  information locally, at the state level, and overseas during investigations;  and this lack of a strategy hinders DOD efforts to quickly complete cases  and efficiently eliminate the clearance backlog.", "Basic to designing an efficient means for overcoming the impediments is  obtaining and using accurate information regarding the backlog.

Our  General Counsel\u2019s office supplied additional context for evaluating  potential impediments through its review of items such as the Security  Clearance Information Act and Executive Order 12968, Access to  Classified Information.", "To identify the potential adverse effects of the impediments to eliminating  the backlog and accurately estimating its size, we reviewed prior GAO and  Joint Security Commission reports. We supplemented this information  with recent data from DSS and OPM regarding the number of days that it  took to complete various types of investigations. Also, an interview with  the Chair of the Personnel Security Working Group of the National  Security Council provided a governmentwide perspective on the effects of  delays and backlogs. Industry representatives cited above provided other  perspectives on the economic costs of delays in obtaining eligibility-for- clearance determinations.", "For our update on the status of the authorized transfer of DSS\u2019s  investigative functions and staff to OPM, we reviewed the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 and GAO reports on DSS  and OPM operations. In addition, we reviewed planning documents such  as those describing the various transfer-related action teams that OPM and  DOD created; these teams included one that sought to reconcile  differences in the procedures used to conduct personnel security  investigations. We also conducted interviews in December with DOD and  OPM to determine up-to-date perspectives regarding the authorized  transfer from officials representing both agencies.", "We conducted our review from February 2003 through December 2003 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["DOD Personnel: More Consistency Needed in Determining Eligibility for  Top Secret Clearances.
