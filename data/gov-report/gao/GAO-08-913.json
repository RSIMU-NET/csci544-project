In response, Congress granted the states a wide range of disaster relief, including billions of dollars of grants and tax incentives to revitalize the Gulf Coast. Specifically, the Gulf Opportunity (GO) Zone Act of 2005 (Pub. L. No. 109-135) provided tax incentives to individuals and businesses in certain presidentially declared disaster areas. Congress mandated that GAO review how state and local governments allocated and used federal tax incentives in the act and subsequent legislation. This report (1) identifies tax incentives in the GO Zone Act of 2005 and subsequent legislation for which state and local governments have allocation and oversight responsibilities, (2) describes the procedures state governments use in allocating the tax incentives, including how they plan to monitor compliance with federal laws, and (3) describes how tax incentives have been allocated and for what purposes. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed key documentation from GO Zone states and interviewed state officials, selected local officials, and representatives from private and nonprofit entities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["States with GO Zones are responsible for allocating and overseeing the use of four tax incentives in the GO Zone Act of 2005. Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi received allocation authority for all four provisions. Florida and Texas each received $3.5 million in GO Zone low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) authority, but did not receive allocations under the other incentives. With some process variations, the three eligible states with GO Zones generally allocated bond authority on a first-come, first-served basis without consistently targeting the allocations to assist recovery in the most damaged areas. Officials in Louisiana and Mississippi acknowledged that the first-come, first-served approach led to allocating bond authority to less-damaged areas at the start of the program. The five eligible state housing finance agencies used existing processes to award GO Zone LIHTCs, but differed in how they targeted these credits. For all three bond provisions, state officials and bond issuers said the borrower's bond counsel is generally responsible for ensuring that the bonds are compliant with applicable laws when issued. State housing finance agencies plan to use existing procedures to monitor compliance once units are placed in service. As of mid-June 2008, eligible states had allocated 87 percent of the GO Zone private activity bond authority, but bonds issued amount to about 50 percent of the total awarded allocation authority. The bonds issued will be used to finance a wide range of facilities, including manufacturing facilities, utilities, housing, retail facilities, and hotels. State housing finance authorities have awarded 95 percent of the GO Zone LIHTCs. Although few housing units are currently in service, state housing finance agency officials said planned units will be in service by the mandated deadline. GO Zone LIHTC-funded units will address about 17 and 45 percent of the rental housing units with major or severe damage in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi, respectively. The three eligible states with GO Zones used the tax credit bonds and additional advance refundings to varying degrees to provide debt relief. State officials said current economic conditions pose challenges for using both GO Zone bond and LIHTC financing."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2005, Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma devastated areas along the  Gulf Coast in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. The  hurricanes destroyed wide swaths of housing, infrastructure, and  businesses, leaving more than 1,500 people dead and hundreds of  thousands displaced without shelter or employment. The size and scope of  the devastation caused by the Gulf Coast hurricanes presents the nation  with unprecedented rebuilding challenges. For perspective on the  magnitude, some estimates put capital losses at a range of $70 billion to  more than $150 billion. Currently, nearly 3 years after the 2005 Gulf Coast  hurricanes, the Gulf Coast and the nation continue to face the challenge of  rebuilding.", "Current rebuilding activities, including the bulk of federal rebuilding  assistance, are directed primarily toward restoring the region\u2019s stock of  livable housing and essential infrastructure.

Major decisions will need to be made  regarding a wide range of issues including coastal restoration, levee  protection, infrastructure, land use, and economic recovery. All levels of  government, together with the private and nonprofit sectors will need to  play a critical role in this process. Agreeing on what rebuilding will be  done, where, how, and\u2014particularly important\u2014who will bear the costs,  will be key to moving forward with the rebuilding process.", "In response to the Gulf Coast devastation, the federal government  committed a historically high level of resources through an array of grants,  loans, subsidies, and federal tax incentives. The bulk of federal rebuilding  assistance from 2005 through 2008 came from two key programs\u2014the  Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA) Public Assistance  program ($10.4 billion as of April 2008) and the Department of Housing  and Urban Development\u2019s (HUD) Community Development Block Grant  (CDBG) program ($19.7 billion as of May 2008). Federal recovery and  rebuilding assistance also includes payouts from the National Flood  Insurance Program as well as funds for levee restoration and repair. Also  to assist with recovery from the Gulf Coast hurricanes, the Gulf  Opportunity (GO) Zone Act of 2005 provided a range of tax relief and  incentives for individuals and businesses in the GO Zones.", "Whereas some GO Zone tax incentives flow directly to taxpayers making  certain qualified investments, the act authorized the states to allocate  certain tax incentives such as additional low-income housing tax credits  (LIHTC) and tax-exempt bond financing. For these two provisions,  existing tax incentives were extended, granting additional authority to GO  Zone areas in addition to regular, annual allocations available to the  affected states. Each eligible state was responsible for setting up an  application process and selecting which qualified projects are to receive  allocations up to each state\u2019s GO Zone allocation authority under the GO  Zone act.", "The Small Business and Work Opportunity Tax Act, part of the U.S. Troop  Readiness, Veterans\u2019 Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability  Appropriations Act, 2007, mandated that we study state and local  practices in allocating and utilizing tax incentives in the GO Zone Act of  2005 and subsequent, amending legislation and report to Congress.

In addition, we interviewed officials from the Internal  Revenue Service (IRS) and HUD.", "To identify the processes used by state governments to allocate federal GO  Zone tax incentives and efforts to monitor compliance with federal laws,  we obtained documentation, such as allocation plans for LIHTCs, bond  commission meeting transcripts, bond commission meeting status  updates, and state auditors\u2019 reports, from state officials in Alabama,  Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, the five states with GO Zones  eligible to use the tax incentives, and we interviewed officials and bond  issuers in these states.", "To determine how much of the GO Zone tax incentives were used and for  what purposes, we (1) obtained and analyzed documentation from the  relevant state governments, including GO Zone bond applications, official  bond documents made available to investors at the time the bonds are  sold, program status reports, and descriptions of planned low-income  housing developments; (2) interviewed state and selected local officials,  including selected bond issuers; and (3) held discussions with selected  private sector participants and nonprofit organizations. We obtained data  on the total GO Zone bond allocations as of mid-June 2008 and LIHTC  awards as of April 2008. We reviewed information on all bonds issued by  each state as of mid-June 2008, including summary information provided  by the states describing how bonds were used. Due to differences in the  way the bond type data were reported across the three eligible states, we  did not attempt to quantify aggregate use by categories across the states.  For LIHTCs, we reviewed the number of projects, units funded, and units  in service as of April 2008. During our visits to Louisiana and Mississippi,  the two states most directly affected by the Gulf Coast hurricanes, we  toured several low-income housing projects funded with GO Zone tax  credits. To provide perspective on the extent to which units have been  developed with GO Zone LIHTCs, we compared the number of planned  units to the number of units in service for each of the 5 states as of April  2008. Where data were available for selected parishes and counties in  Louisiana and Mississippi, we compared planned and in-service GO Zone  LIHTC units to rental housing units with major or severe damage by parish  or county; comparable data were not available for every GO Zone parish  and county in those two states or for Alabama, Florida, or Texas.", "We assessed the reliability of the state level bond and housing data by,  when possible, comparing the data the states provided to official  documentation and interviewing state officials with knowledge of the data.

Some of the tax  incentives in the act are extensions of existing federal tax incentives (e.g.,  tax-exempt private activity bonds, new markets tax credits, low-income  housing tax credits, etc.). In some cases, the GO Zone Act liberalizes the  rules that taxpayers must follow to be eligible to claim the incentives. JCT  estimates indicate that these tax incentives will reduce federal revenue by  about $9 billion over the 10-year period from 2006 to 2015.", "The act defined the GO Zones as those counties and parishes in the  presidentially-declared disaster areas that warranted additional, long-term  federal assistance. Rather than making the incentives available statewide  in the five states affected by the 2005 hurricanes, the act defined a  separate GO Zone for the three major 2005 hurricanes\u2014Katrina, Rita, and  Wilma. Both Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita affected certain areas  in Louisiana, so those GO Zones overlap in Louisiana. Figure 1 illustrates  the GO Zone areas in each of the five affected states. Tax provisions to  assist recovery vary by GO Zone, with the most assistance provided to  areas damaged by Hurricane Katrina, particularly in Louisiana and  Mississippi.", "The GO Zone Act was broadly similar to legislation that created the New  York Liberty Zone following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in  New York City. The Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002  contained various tax incentives designed for response and recovery for  the area of lower Manhattan designated as the New York Liberty Zone.", "Similar to those in the Liberty Zone, individuals and businesses may claim  the GO Zone tax incentives as long as they meet specified federal  requirements. In these cases, the tax incentives essentially function as  open-ended entitlement programs that any eligible taxpayer may claim.  For GO Zone tax incentives such as claiming accelerated depreciation on  certain assets or partial expensing for certain clean-up costs, the full cost  to the federal government depends on how many taxpayers claim the  provision on their tax returns.", "For certain tax incentives in the GO Zone Act of 2005, state governments  in states with GO Zones were authorized to establish processes and select  which qualified projects are to receive tax incentive allocations up to each  state\u2019s allocation authority limit. As mandated by law, this report discusses  those tax incentives in the GO Zone Act of 2005 that state and local  governments play a role in allocating and overseeing.", "Because the states are responsible for selecting which entities receive the  tax benefit up to the allocation authority provided by law, these GO Zone  tax incentives appear similar to traditional grant programs where  governments provide funds directly to grant recipients. For example, Gulf  Coast states have processes for allocating funds through FEMA\u2019s Public  Assistance program and the CDBG program. In contrast with grant  programs, where funds come directly from the government, investors in  projects that have received GO Zone incentives are allowed to either claim  a credit against their tax liability, as in the case of the LIHTC program, or  exclude certain portions of the return on their investment, such as interest  earned, in GO Zone projects from their taxable income, as is the case for  tax-exempt bonds. Unlike traditional grant programs, the projects  receiving these tax incentives are financed with bonds that must be repaid  or equity provided by private investors, meaning developers, investors,  insurers and other participants have an additional incentive to ensure that  projects are financially viable and will remain compliant with applicable  laws.", "Since the 2005 hurricanes, we are conducting ongoing work and have  completed a number of studies evaluating disaster relief and recovery  efforts along the Gulf Coast, including how states with GO Zones have  made use of federal resources.

Beginning in May 2006, Louisiana SBC staff provided status updates to  Louisiana SBC members on the amount of remaining and used GO Zone  bond authority for the 13 most-damaged parishes and the remaining  parishes at monthly Louisiana SBC meetings. By the end of June 2007, the  Louisiana SBC had granted final approval for almost $4.6 billion, or nearly  60 percent, of the state\u2019s GO Zone bond allocation authority, and  preliminary approval to projects worth an additional $3.0 billion, leaving  roughly $300 million in allocation authority. The allocations approved  included projects exceeding the $250 million cap with two large projects  for $1 billion each.", "According to bond commission meeting transcripts, some bond  commission members expressed concerns that the allocations had not  been effectively targeted to areas and businesses with the greatest need.  While the 13 most-damaged parishes in aggregate had received more than  50 percent of the final allocations, some of the most severely damaged  areas around New Orleans had received relatively little as of June 2007.  For example, as of June 2007, Orleans parish had only received about 2  percent of the GO Zone bond allocation authority that had been granted  final approval. According to Louisiana SBC officials, this was in large part  due to a lack of applications for potential GO Zone bond projects in the  most severely damaged areas. Around that time, the Governor\u2019s office  declined to issue final allocation letters pending review of the state\u2019s GO  Zone bond process, and the Louisiana SBC temporarily stopped awarding  final approval for GO Zone bonds. In September 2007, the Louisiana  Attorney General ruled that the Governor did not have the authority to  issue final approval letters for GO Zone private activity bonds because the  federal act specified that the state bond commission has final approval.", "In September 2007, the Louisiana SBC, in conjunction with the Governor\u2019s  Office and the LDED, revised the GO Zone allocation process and  established two pools of allocation authority\u2014a \u201cdesignated pool\u201d for the  13 most-damaged parishes and a \u201ccompetitive pool\u201d for the rest of the GO  Zone parishes. While the designated pool resembled the SBC\u2019s original  concept, the list of the 13 parishes targeted for GO Zone bond allocations  was updated based in part on FEMA data on businesses and infrastructure  damage and HUD data on major and severe housing damage. Each pool  was to receive half of the remaining GO Zone bond authority, or about $1.7  billion per pool. Further, each of the 13 parishes in the designated pool  was to receive GO Zone bond allocation authority in proportion to the  degree of damage sustained. In addition, projects that had received  preliminary approval earlier were put on hold and had to qualify for final  approval by satisfying certain criteria relating to the number of jobs  created and overall economic effect.", "The Louisiana SBC announced allocation awards in October 2007,  awarding allocations for all remaining authority in the competitive pool  with about $900 million of allocation authority remaining in the designated  pool. From October 2007 to April 2008, GO Zone bond projects faced  difficulty obtaining credit due in part to changing market conditions  nationwide, and some GO Zone projects requested additional time to  complete their issuance. However, some bond commissioners expressed  concern that repeatedly extending the period to issue GO Zone bonds  allowed less viable projects to retain their allocations while other  applications were waiting for consideration.", "On the basis of its March 2008 review of Louisiana\u2019s GO Zone bond  process requested by the newly elected Governor, the LDED  acknowledged that the Louisiana GO Zone bond process lacked effective  prioritization mechanisms and lacked mechanisms to ensure selected  projects would be viable, and that the changing rules had led to  disappointment and confusion among some stakeholders. Therefore, the  LDED recommended that the Louisiana SBC revise its rules for allocating  the remaining private activity bond authority. In April 2008, the Louisiana  SBC adopted the LDED\u2019s recommendations and, among other  recommendations, took the following actions:    Award authority in the competitive pool to applicants that applied before  November 2007 on a first-come, first-served basis. After making awards to  those existing applicants, future awards from the competitive pool will be  prioritized based on whether the LDED determines that the proposed  project is consistent with Louisiana\u2019s longer-term economic development  strategy. However, even if the LDED does not designate a project as  consistent with Louisiana\u2019s longer-term economic development strategy,  the projects are considered by the SBC on a first-come, first-served basis,  and, at the SBC\u2019s discretion, may or may not be awarded an allocation.", "Limit the amount of authority that any single developer can receive to $100  million going forward.", "Allow local jurisdictions in the designated pool to recommend projects to  the Louisiana SBC for approval, and local jurisdictions may recommend  projects exceeding the $100 million limit, as long as the local jurisdiction is  located in a designated pool parish that has allocation authority remaining  and the parish approves the allocation.  Impose a 240-day period to issue bonds after receiving allocations.", "Require, in addition to the regular application fee, that applicants must  submit a refundable deposit totaling 0.5 percent of the proposed allocation  with their application. This change also applied to the applicants that had  received allocations but had not yet issued bonds as a condition for them  to receive the full 240-day extension of their allocation time limit.", "In May 2008, the Louisiana SBC awarded GO Zone bond authority to  applicants in the competitive pool pending before November 2007 as well  as to all other pending applications on the basis of the prioritization policy  described above, effectively exhausting the competitive pool allocation  authority on a first-come, first-served basis. As of June 2008, parishes in  the designated pool have bond authority remaining to allocate. According  to Louisiana officials, if the designated pool parishes have not issued  bonds for all of their authority by the beginning of 2010, the remaining  authority will be available to both the competitive and designated pools  during 2010."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "States Used Existing Procedures to Award GO Zone LIHTCs and Will Use Existing Procedures to Monitor Compliance with Applicable Federal Laws", "paragraphs": ["The HFAs from the five eligible states used their existing procedures to  announce the availability of credits, process applications, and award GO  Zone LIHTCs. Three of the five states announced the availability of GO  Zone LIHTCs in their qualified allocation plans (QAP), which HFAs use to  announce the availability of credits, eligibility criteria, and information on  ranking applications. The Florida HFA had already finalized its QAP in  2006 (before the state received the extra GO Zone allocation), so the  availability of these funds was not announced in the QAP, but was  advertised at the beginning of the 2006 funding cycle. Similarly, the Texas  HFA announced the availability of GO Zone LIHTCs through a separate  policy because its QAP had already been published. Officials from each  state HFA stated that they used their existing procedures to process GO  Zone LIHTC applications and to award the credits. These processes  generally include scoring and ranking applications, reviewing market  studies and environmental assessments, underwriting, and making funding  recommendations to the boards.", "States generally announced funding priorities for each funding cycle  through their QAPs. According to the 2006 through 2008 QAPs and HFA  officials, in some funding cycles the HFAs for Louisiana, Mississippi, and  Texas gave priority to projects that were to be developed in the GO Zone  counties with the most hurricane-related damage. For example, according  to the 2007/2008 QAP for Louisiana, at least 75 percent of the 2007 and  2008 GO Zone credits were reserved for parishes with significant numbers  of rental housing with damage from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. While 13  specific parishes were targeted in Louisiana for GO Zone bonds, the QAP  targeted 8 parishes for GO Zone LIHTCs. The QAPs for Alabama and  Florida did not give any priority to projects in the most-damaged GO Zone  counties. According to the addendum to Alabama\u2019s 2006 QAP, the HFA\u2019s  priority was to balance the distribution of credits throughout the state in  terms of geographical regions, counties, and urban and rural areas.  Officials from the Florida HFA stated that the need to prioritize the GO  Zone counties with the most damage was mitigated by an agency policy to  prioritize the counties that were hardest hit by 2004 and 2005 hurricanes,  which already included some of the GO Zone counties.", "HFAs are required to annually monitor LIHTC-funded projects for  compliance with the Internal Revenue Code once projects are complete  and in service, and report any instances of noncompliance to the IRS after  giving the owner time to correct the problem. As a part of this annual  monitoring process, officials review documentation to ensure that the  properties meet one of two tests that restrict both the amount of rent that  is assessed to tenants and the income of eligible tenants. In addition, at  least once every 3 years, HFAs must conduct on-site inspections of all  buildings in a project and, for at least 20 percent of the project\u2019s low- income units, inspect the units and review income and rent records. For  example, the Alabama HFA\u2019s compliance manual states that its staff will  perform annual file reviews, including site visits as needed, to ensure that  the owner is operating the project in compliance. Similarly, according to  the Louisiana HFA compliance manual, staff will annually review  compliance monitoring reports, which all project owners are required to  submit, and periodically conduct on-site visits.

Officials in  Louisiana and Mississippi said that smaller projects, such as those issuing  bonds for less than about $2 or $3 million, may have a more difficult time  using the GO Zone private activity bond provision because the issuance  costs, including fees for legal and financial advisors, begin to account for a  larger percentage of bond proceeds for smaller bonds than for larger  bonds.", "Some GO Zone parishes and counties contained multiple projects that  received GO Zone bond allocations, with total amounts in the counties and  parishes ranging from less than $1 million to over $1 billion.
