To fulfill this role, DLA employs about 28,000 civilian and military workers, located at about 500 sites in all 50 states and in 28 countries. It also manages about 4 million supply items and processes about 30 million annual supply distribution actions. In fiscal year 2000, DLA reported that these operations resulted in sales to the military services of about $13 billion. DLA relies on software-intensive systems to support this work. An important determinant of the quality of software-intensive systems, and thus DLA\u2019s mission performance, is the quality of the processes used to acquire these systems.", "This report is one in a series of products to satisfy our mandate under the fiscal year 2001 Defense Authorization Act. The act directed that we review DLA\u2019s efficiency and effectiveness in meeting requirements, its application of best business practices, and opportunities for improving its operations. As agreed with your offices, the objectives of this review of DLA\u2019s information technology (IT) management were to determine (1) whether DLA has the effective software acquisition processes that are necessary to modernize and maintain systems and (2) what actions DLA has planned or in place to improve these processes.", "Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Software Engineering Institute (SEI), recognized for its expertise in software processes, has developed models and methods that define and determine organizations\u2019 software process maturity. Together, these models and methods provide (1) a logical framework for baselining an organization\u2019s current process capabilities (i.e., determining what practices are effectively implemented , not effectively implemented , or contain mixed or inconclusive evidence ) and (2) a structured plan for incremental process improvement. These models and methods are generally recognized as best business practices.", "Using SEI\u2019s Software Acquisition Capability Maturity ModelSM (SA-CMM\u00ae)and SEI\u2019s software capability evaluation method, our staff (trained at SEI) evaluated DLA\u2019s software acquisition maturity in six of seven key process areas that are necessary to attain a \u201crepeatable\u201d level of process maturity.The repeatable level of process maturity is level 2 on SEI\u2019s five-level scale. An organization at the repeatable level of process maturity has the necessary process discipline in place to repeat earlier successes on similar projects. Organizations that do not satisfy the requirements for the repeatable level are by default judged to be at level 1, the \u201cinitial\u201d level of maturity. This means that their processes are immature, ad hoc, and sometimes even chaotic, with few of the processes defined and success dependent mainly on the heroic efforts of individuals. We also evaluated DLA on one level-3, or \u201cdefined\u201d level, process\u2014acquisition risk management. We included acquisition risk management because many software experts consider it to be one of the most important process areas.", "Our evaluation included DLA\u2019s only ongoing software/system acquisitions: the Business Systems Modernization (BSM) and the Fuels Automated System (FAS).

In addition to this primary function, which DLA refers to as either \u201cmateriel management\u201d or \u201csupply-chain management,\u201d DLA performs five other major business functions: distributing materiel ordered from its inventory; purchasing fuels for DOD and the U.S. government; storing strategic materiel; marketing surplus DOD materiel for reuse and disposal; and providing numerous information services, such as item cataloging, for DOD, the United States, and selected foreign governments. DLA consists of a central command authority supported by a number of field commands that manage the agency\u2019s six business functions.", "Until about 1997, DLA generally developed its systems in-house. Since then, the agency has begun to acquire systems, relying on contractors for system development and managing the acquisition of these systems. Currently, DLA is in the process of acquiring two systems: Business Systems Modernization (BSM) and Fuels Automated System (FAS).", "BSM is intended to modernize DLA\u2019s materiel management business function, changing the agency from being solely a provider and manager of physical inventory to being a manager of supply chains. In this role, DLA would link customers with appropriate suppliers and track physical and financial business practices. It is planning to replace two large legacy systems, as well as several supporting programs, that are more than 30 years old and are not integrated. BSM is based on commercially available software products. DLA plans to acquire and deploy its BSM system solution through a series of four system releases/increments. First, it plans to demonstrate successful application of its new concept of doing business for selected commodities\u2014namely, earth-moving equipment, medical/pharmaceutical supplies, and F/A-18 engine components\u2014at the three Defense Supply Centers. If this first release is successfully demonstrated, DLA plans to expand the system solution to other commodities in three additional increments. DLA plans to invest approximately $658 million to acquire and implement BSM from fiscal years 2000 through 2005.", "FAS is intended to help the Defense Energy Support Center manage about $5 billion in contracts with petroleum suppliers each year. FAS is to be a multifunctional system that provides for, among other things, point-of-sale data collection inventory control, finance and accounting, procurement, and facilities management. FAS, which relies on a commercially available software package, is being fielded incrementally. Increment 1 is the base- level operational module that is currently being deployed to base-level sites worldwide. The second increment is the enterprise-level system, which is to be deployed to its direct delivery commodity business unit. DLA plans to invest $293 million in FAS from fiscal year 1995 through 2002.", "SEI\u2019s SA-CMM is used to measure an organization\u2019s capability to manage the acquisition of software. SEI\u2019s expertise in, and model and methods for, determining software process assessment are recognized and accepted throughout the software industry. The model defines five levels of software acquisition maturity. Each level of maturity (except level 1) indicates process capability in relation to key process areas. For a maturity level to be achieved, all key process areas related to that level must be implemented effectively.", "The second level of process maturity, level 2 (referred to as the repeatable level), demonstrates that basic management processes are established to track performance, cost, and schedule, and the necessary discipline is in place to repeat earlier successes on similar projects. Organizations that do not effectively implement all key process areas for the repeatable level are, by default, at level 1, the initial level of maturity. Level-1 processes can be described as immature, ad hoc, and sometimes chaotic; success in software acquisition for these organizations depends on the ability and commitment of the staff involved. Figure 1 further explains the five-level software acquisition model.", "We evaluated DLA against six of the seven level-2 (repeatable) key process areas in the SA-CMM. We did not evaluate DLA on the seventh key process area\u2014transition to support\u2014because the contractors who are implementing BSM and FAS will support these systems when they are operational, rendering transition to support irrelevant for these acquisitions. We evaluated DLA against one level-3 (defined) key process area\u2014acquisition risk management\u2014because many software acquisition experts consider it to be one of the most important key process areas. These key process areas are described in table 1.", "As established by the model, each key process area contains five common features\u2014commitment to perform, ability to perform, activities to be performed, measurement and analysis of activities, and verification of activities\u2019 implementation. These five features collectively provide a framework for the implementation and institutionalization of the key process areas. The common feature definitions are as follows:   Commitment to perform: This feature describes the actions that the organization takes to establish the process and ensure that it can endure. Key practices typically involve establishing organizational policies and sponsorship.", "Ability to perform: This feature describes the preconditions that must exist in the project or organization to implement the software acquisition process competently. Key practices typically include assigning responsibility and providing training.", "Activities to be performed: This feature describes the roles and procedures necessary to implement a key process area. Key practices typically involve establishing plans and procedures, performing the work, tracking it, and taking appropriate management actions.", "Measurement and analysis of activities: This feature describes the steps necessary to measure progress and analyze the measurements. Key practices typically involve defining the measurements to be taken and the analyses to be conducted to determine the status and effectiveness of the activities performed.", "Verification of activities\u2019 implementation: This feature describes the steps the organization must take to ensure that project activities are performed in accordance with established processes. Key practices typically involve regular reviews by management.", "Each common feature consists of a number of key practices\u2014specific actions such as developing an organizational policy for software acquisition, developing various plans for software acquisition activities, and tracking a contractor\u2019s progress.

According to BSM officials, satisfying the criteria for the key process areas is attributable to the following factors: allocating adequate resources; following good program management practices, as defined in DOD Directive 5000; and working closely with relevant oversight groups. To address those few weaknesses that we identified, project officials told us that they have initiated corrective action.", "BSM satisfied all key practices in   software acquisition planning, such as (1) having a written software acquisition policy, (2) having adequate resources for software acquisition planning activities, (3) developing and documenting the software acquisition strategy and plan, and (4) making and using measurements to determine the status of software acquisition planning activities.   project management, including (1) designating responsibility for project management, (2) having a written policy for the management of the software project, (3) having adequate resources for the duration of the software acquisition project, and (4) tracking the risks associated with cost, schedule, resources, and the technical aspects of the project.   contract tracking and oversight, including (1) designating responsibility for contract tracking and oversight, (2) including contract specialists in the project team, and (3) having a documented plan for contract tracking and oversight.   acquisition risk management, such as (1) having a risk management plan, (2) having a written policy for the management of software acquisition risk, and (3) measuring and reporting on the status of acquisition risk management activities to management.", "BSM also satisfied all but one key practice in solicitation. Strengths included (1) designating responsibility for the software portion of the solicitation, (2) preparing cost and schedule estimates for the software products and services being acquired, and (3) having an independent review of cost and schedule estimates for the software products and services being acquired. BSM\u2019s one weakness in this key process area was in not having a written policy for the software portion of the solicitation. This is significant because, according to the SEI, an institutional policy provides for establishing an enduring process.", "BSM also satisfied all but three key practices in requirements development and management. Strengths included (1) having a written policy for managing the software-related contractual requirements, (2) having a group that is responsible for performing requirements development and management activities, and (3) measuring and reporting to management on the status of requirements development and management activities. One of the three weaknesses was the lack of a documented requirements development and management plan. Such a plan provides a roadmap for completing important requirements development and management activities. Without it, projects risk either not performing important tasks or not performing them effectively. The other two weaknesses involved the project office\u2019s appraisal of system requirements changes. Specifically, BSM did not appraise (1) requests to change system requirements for their impact on the software being acquired or (2) all changes to the requirements for impact on performance and contract schedule and cost. These activities are critical to making informed, risk-based decisions about whether to approve requirements changes.", "Last, BSM satisfied all but one key practice in evaluation, and we do not view that practice as significant.

Weaknesses included (1) not having adequate resources for software-acquisition\u2013planning activities and (2) not measuring the status of the software-acquisition\u2013planning activities and resultant products.

Strengths included, among other things, (1) designating responsibility for contract tracking and oversight, (2) including contract specialists on the project team, and (3) ensuring that individuals performing contract tracking and oversight activities had experience or received training. Examples of weaknesses included (1) not having a documented plan for contract tracking and oversight and (2) not comparing the actual cost and schedule of the contractor\u2019s software engineering effort with planned schedules and budgets. Because of these weaknesses, FAS contractor tracking and oversight activities are undisciplined and unstructured, thereby increasing the chances of FAS software acquisitions being late, costing more than expected, and not performing as intended.", "In the evaluation key process area, FAS had nine strengths, two weaknesses, two observations, and two areas that were not rated.
