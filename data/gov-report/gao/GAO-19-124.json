In addition, we held structured interviews with 35 State,  Commerce, and USDA officials overseas conducting export promotion  activities and reached out to an additional 10 officials to ask about  activities associated with the solicitation of gifts and attendance at  corporate social responsibility events. These officials were located across  11 posts and in 9 countries. We interviewed officials in Cambodia,  Croatia, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Indonesia, Philippines, South  Africa, Thailand, and Vietnam. Because multiple officials from one agency  attended a meeting in some cases, we are reporting their combined  responses as one \u201coffice\u201d response. Thus, we are reporting the results  from the 24 offices we interviewed\u20149 State, 8 Commerce, and 7 USDA  offices. We selected this non-generalizable sample of countries based  on criteria that included the countries\u2019 large or increasing amounts of U.S.  tobacco imports, relatively high tobacco smoking prevalence rates, and  geographic dispersion. The information obtained from these interviews is  neither generalizable nor reflects the experiences of all State, Commerce,  and USDA officials serving at posts overseas, but it does provide insights  into officials\u2019 experiences at post and illustrative examples across our  sample on the topics discussed.", "To address our third objective, we interviewed officials in headquarters  from State, Commerce, and USDA about post officials\u2019 implementation of  guidance regarding the promotion of tobacco exports, the types of  questions they receive from post officials about the funding restrictions  and guidance, and the additional advice they provide to post officials  overseas. We asked post officials about the clarity of guidance, whether  they attended events sponsored or attended by representatives of U.S.  tobacco companies, and whether they discussed tobacco-related issues  with host country government officials during our structured interviews  with the 24 State, Commerce, and USDA offices overseas.", "We also analyzed a Commerce database, agency emails, and State  cables and conducted a literature search. Commerce documents all the  fee-based services it provides to companies in a database. We obtained  a list of approximately 30,000 fee-based services Commerce provided in  fiscal years 2013 through 2017, which included the name of the  companies to which Commerce provided these services. We then  downloaded a list of 763 U.S. tobacco companies from Nexus using  criteria such as industry classification codes related to tobacco and  tobacco products and the location of company headquarters. We limited  the list of U.S. tobacco companies to those with revenues greater than $5  million. We then compared the two lists to determine if Commerce  provided any fee-based services to U.S. tobacco companies. To assess  the reliability of the Commerce fee-based services data, we reviewed  relevant documentation and interviewed knowledgeable officials about  system controls. We determined that Commerce\u2019s fee-based services  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives.", "In addition, we requested State, Commerce, and USDA email  communications concerning tobacco-related issues sent between  January 2015 and February 2018 from post officials to headquarters.  State was only able to provide one such email. USDA provided several  emails, but the emails were not from USDA post officials to USDA officials  in headquarters. Commerce provided us 21 emails that matched our  request and an additional 20 emails from officials working throughout the  United States. We analyzed the Commerce email communications to  identify commonly asked questions or concerns about the existing  guidance and actions the agencies should take to support U.S. tobacco  companies or the tobacco industry. We also requested State cables from  the eight countries in our sample sent between January 2013 and  December 2017 that referenced at least 1 of the 10 U.S. tobacco  companies with the highest revenues. We received and reviewed cables  from six of these countries. We also conducted a literature search to  identify instances in which U.S. government officials may have conducted  activities addressed by the interagency tobacco guidance cable. To  identify relevant articles, such as trade or industry articles, we searched  various databases, including ProQuest and Nexus. From these sources,  we identified one article relevant to our research objective. We performed  these searches in December 2017 and searched for articles published  from January 2013 to December 2017.", "We also interviewed representatives of the tobacco control community  and business associations to obtain their perspectives concerning U.S.  government support for tobacco exports and U.S. government  interactions with U.S. tobacco companies. Specifically, we interviewed the  World Health Organization (WHO), four global or regional tobacco control  nongovernmental organizations, and several local nongovernmental  organizations in two countries in our scope. In addition, we interviewed  officials from the local American Chamber of Commerce and the U.S.- Association of Southeast Asian Nations Business Council in two  countries. The information obtained from these interviews is neither  generalizable nor reflects the experiences of all tobacco control  organizations or business associations, but it does provide insights into  these officials\u2019 experiences.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2017 to December  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Trends in U.S. Tobacco Exports", "paragraphs": ["The United States exported over $2.1 billion in tobacco and tobacco  products in 2017.
