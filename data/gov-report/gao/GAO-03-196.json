GAO was asked to examine how pharmacy benefits managers participating in the federal program affect health plans, enrollees, and pharmacies. GAO examined the use of PBMs by three plans representing about 55 percent of the 8.3 million people covered by FEHBP plans. For example, GAO surveyed 36 retail pharmacies on prices that a customer without third party coverage would pay for 18 high-volume or high-expenditure drugs and compared these prices to prices paid by the plans and PBMs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The PBMs reviewed produced savings for health plans participating in FEHBP by obtaining drug price discounts from retail pharmacies and dispensing drugs at lower costs through mail-order pharmacies, passing on certain manufacturer rebates to the plans, and operating drug utilization control programs. For example, the average price PBMs obtained from retail pharmacies for 14 brand name drugs was about 18 percent below the average price paid by customers without third-party coverage. Enrollees in the plans reviewed had wide access to retail pharmacies, coverage of most drugs, and benefited from cost savings generated by the PBMs. Enrollees typically paid lower out-of-pocket costs for prescriptions filled through mail-order pharmacies and benefited from other savings that reduced plans' costs and therefore helped to lessen rising premiums. Most retail pharmacies participate in the FEHBP plans' networks in order to obtain business from the large number of enrollees covered. Pharmacy associations report that the PBMs' large market shares leave some retail pharmacies with little leverage in negotiating with PBMs. Retail pharmacies must accept discounted reimbursements from PBMs they contract with and perform additional administrative tasks associated with claims processing. OPM generally concurred with GAO's findings. The plans and PBMs reviewed provided technical comments, and two independent reviewers stated the report was fair and balanced. One pharmacy association expressed strong concerns, including that the report did not more broadly address economic relationships in the PBM industry. GAO examined relationships between the PBMs and manufacturers and pharmacies specific to their FEHBP business. However, relationships between PBMs and other entities for other plans were beyond the report's scope."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The increasing cost of prescription drugs has been a key component of  rising employer health care costs in recent years. In 2001, total employer  health benefit costs rose 11 percent, while prescription drug costs rose 17  percent. Many employer-sponsored health plans and insurers contract  with pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) to help manage their prescription  drug benefits. PBMs negotiate drug prices with pharmacies and drug  manufacturers on behalf of health plans and, in addition to other  administrative, clinical, and cost containment services, process drug  claims for the health plans. In 2001, nearly 200 million Americans had their  prescription drug benefits managed by a PBM. Most federal employees,  retirees, and their dependents participating in the Federal Employees  Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), the largest employer-sponsored health  insurance program in the United States, are enrolled in plans that contract  with PBMs to manage their prescription drug benefits.", "Because PBMs play a critical role in managing prescription drug benefits,  you asked us to examine PBMs\u2019 role within the FEHBP program. In  particular, we addressed the following questions:  1.  Do PBMs achieve savings, and, if so, how?  2.  How do FEHBP plans\u2019 use of PBMs affect enrollees, including access  to prescription drugs and out-of-pocket spending?  3.  How do FEHBP plans\u2019 use of PBMs affect retail pharmacies, including  pharmacies\u2019 reimbursements for drugs dispensed and administrative  requirements?  4.  How are PBMs compensated for services provided to FEHBP plans?", "To respond to these questions, we examined the use of PBMs by three  FEHBP plans: Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS), Government  Employees Hospital Association (GEHA), and PacifiCare of California.  Together, these plans accounted for about 55 percent of the 8.3 million  people covered by FEHBP as of July 2002 and represented various plan  types and PBM contractors. BCBS contracted with the two largest PBMs  in the United States for its pharmacy benefit services\u2014Medco Health  Solutions, a subsidiary of the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co., Inc.,  and AdvancePCS. GEHA contracted with Medco Health Solutions and  PacifiCare of California contracted with Prescription Solutions, another  subsidiary of PacifiCare Health Systems.", "We reviewed contracts between the PBMs and plans, financial statements  regarding payments made between the plans and PBMs, and retail and  mail-order prices for selected drugs from the FEHBP plans we reviewed  and the PBMs with which they contracted. We also obtained pricing  information from retail pharmacies, interviewed officials at the Office of  Personnel Management (OPM), and associations representing PBMs and  retail pharmacies, and reviewed studies regarding the use of PBMs and  prescription drug payments. Specifically:    To assess whether PBMs achieve cost savings, we obtained April 2002  prices for 18 drugs that the three FEHBP plans paid to their PBMs for  retail and mail order prescriptions. We compared these prices to cash  prices that customers would pay at retail pharmacies in California, North  Dakota, Washington, D.C., and the Virginia and Maryland suburbs of  Washington, D.C., and to Medicaid reimbursement rates in these locations.

For the same quantity, the average  price paid at mail order for the brand and generic drugs was about 27  percent and 53 percent below the average cash-paying customer price,  respectively.

In the  absence of a PBM, FEHBP plans could obtain some level of drug price  discounts from retail pharmacies and drug manufacturers but would also  directly incur the costs associated with undertaking these responsibilities.  Also, PBMs can negotiate deeper discounts for plans with smaller  networks of retail pharmacies because the pharmacies can anticipate  receiving a higher concentration of the plans\u2019 enrollees. For example,  BCBS introduced its basic option in 2002 that includes a smaller network  of retail pharmacies\u2014about 70 percent as many pharmacies as its  standard option\u2014and deeper discounts in its retail pharmacy payments  compared to its standard option."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PBMs Further Reduced Plans\u2019 Drug Expenditures by Passing Through Certain Manufacturer Rebates", "paragraphs": ["PBMs also passed through to the FEHBP plans they contracted with some  or all of drug manufacturer rebates associated with their FEHBP business.

The share of rebates PBMs  pass through to plans varies and is subject to contractual agreements  negotiated between PBMs and the plans.", "Rebates and formularies are interrelated. Drug manufacturers provide  PBMs certain rebates depending not only on inclusion of their drugs on a  plan\u2019s formulary but also on the PBMs\u2019 ability to increase a manufacturer\u2019s  market share for certain drugs. Formulary incentives, such as lower  enrollee cost sharing for certain drugs compared to competing  therapeutically equivalent drugs, encourage the former\u2019s use.  Manufacturers may pay higher rebates when formularies have stronger  incentives to use specific drugs.

The  FEHBP plans and PBMs we reviewed reported savings for individual  intervention techniques ranging from less than 1 percent to 9 percent of  plans\u2019 total drug spending in 2001. Because plans varied in their use of  intervention techniques and employed different cost savings  methodologies, these estimates may not be comparable across plans.  Techniques plans most commonly used included concurrent drug  utilization review, prior authorization, therapeutic brand interchange, and  brand to generic substitution. The reported cumulative effect of several  techniques for one plan amounted to 14 percent of drug spending.", "Measuring cost savings from PBM intervention techniques is difficult for  various reasons, including:    Savings methodologies did not reflect the effect intervention techniques  may have over time on enrollees\u2019 utilization patterns and physicians\u2019  prescribing practices. That is, there may be a sentinel effect from PBMs\u2019  reviews whereby enrollees and physicians may stop filling or prescribing  drugs that do not meet PBMs\u2019 utilization review or refill criteria, but the  extent to which these behavior changes occur is beyond the scope of  PBMs\u2019 data systems.", "Plans and PBMs we reviewed did not consistently measure the number or  costs of drugs not dispensed as a result of PBM interventions that result in  drug substitutions, denials for adverse drug interaction, or other  interventions, making it difficult to estimate savings from certain  intervention techniques.", "Plans did not systematically measure savings when the primary goal of the  intervention technique was patient safety and compliance with drugs\u2019  clinical guidelines.", "Among various intervention techniques, concurrent drug utilization and  prior authorization provided some plans the largest quantifiable savings.  The following are examples of intervention savings estimates reported by  plans we reviewed.", "Drug utilization review includes the PBM examining prescriptions  concurrently at the time of purchase to assess safety considerations, such  as potential adverse interactions, and compliance with clinical guidelines,  including quantity and dose. These reviews can also occur retrospectively  to analyze enrollees\u2019 drug utilization and physicians\u2019 prescribing patterns.  Two plans estimated savings from drug utilization review ranging from 6  percent to 9 percent, with about 60 percent to 80 percent of the savings  from concurrent reviews, including claim denials from the PBM to prevent  early drug refills and safety advisories to caution pharmacists about  potential adverse interactions or therapy duplications. The remaining  estimated savings are from retrospective reviews.", "Prior authorization requires enrollees to receive approval from the plan  or PBM before dispensing certain drugs that treat conditions or illnesses  not otherwise covered by plans, have high costs, have a high potential for  abuse, or are ordered in unusual quantities. Some plans may also require  prior authorization for nonformulary drugs. Each of the plans we reviewed  required prior authorization for certain drugs such as growth hormones  and a drug used to treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Two plans reported savings  from prior authorization ranging from 1 percent to 6 percent of plan  spending for drugs that either were not dispensed or were substituted for  with less costly alternatives.", "Therapeutic interchange encourages the substitution of less expensive  formulary brand-name medications considered safe and effective for more  expensive nonformulary drugs within the same drug class. Two plans  reported savings ranging from 1 percent to 4.5 percent from therapeutic  interchange. These estimates are in addition to savings associated with  rebates plans earned for drugs in the formulary.", "Generic substitution involves dispensing less expensive, chemically- equivalent generic drugs in place of brand name drugs. Where a PBM  specifically intervened by contacting the physician to change a  prescription from requiring a brand name to allowing a generic drug, one  plan reported savings of less than 1 percent of the plan\u2019s total drug  spending. The other two plans said they do not have readily available data  to measure savings from PBM interventions for generic drugs. All three  plans reported more general information on their generic drug use, but the  extent to which generic drugs are used cannot solely be attributed to  PBMs because plan benefit design and physician prescribing patterns also  influence generic drug use. On average, the plans we reviewed reported  that generic drugs were dispensed more often by retail pharmacies (about  45 percent of all drugs dispensed) than by mail-order pharmacies (about  34 percent). The difference in use of generic drugs may in part reflect  differences in the types of drugs that are typically dispensed through retail  and mail-order pharmacies. For drugs where a generic version was  available, the retail and mail-order pharmacies dispensed generic drugs at  more similar rates\u2014on average 89 percent of the time for retail  pharmacies and 87 percent of the time for mail-order pharmacies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "PBMs Provided FEHBP Enrollees Generally Unrestricted Access to Prescription Drugs, Cost Savings, and Other Benefits", "paragraphs": ["PBMs we reviewed generally provided enrollees with access to a nearby  pharmacy, maintained formularies for plan enrollees that included drugs  in most major therapeutic categories, and provided access to  nonformulary drugs when medically necessary.

The PBMs for these  plans reported to us they exceeded plans\u2019 access standards and that close  to 100 percent of enrollees live within 5 miles of a network pharmacy. The  third plan did not have a specific contractual access standard, but plan  officials said they have verified that well over 90 percent of enrollees live  within 5 miles of a network pharmacy.

While the plans\u2019 formularies varied with respect to the number of drugs  covered, they included prescription drugs in most major therapeutic  categories. To provide a benchmark for comparing the breadth and depth  of the FEHBP formularies, we compared the three formularies to the  outpatient prescription drugs included in the Department of Veterans  Affairs (VA) National Formulary, considered by the Institute of Medicine  to be not overly restrictive.

Enrollees must pay a  flat $25 copayment for formulary brand drugs but must pay the greater of a  $35 copayment or 50 percent of the plan\u2019s cost for nonformulary brand  drugs (known as coinsurance). BCBS required the enrollees to pay the  same 25 percent coinsurance for formulary and nonformulary drugs under  its standard option plan.

PBM mail-order pharmacy programs  often provided for lower out-of-pocket costs for 90-day supplies of drugs  than an enrollee would pay for the same prescriptions filled at a retail  pharmacy. The GEHA high option plan and PacifiCare of California  imposed lower cost-sharing requirements for mail order while the BCBS  standard option plan imposed a flat copayment for mail order but required  enrollees to pay 25-percent coinsurance at retail. The flat copayments  provided an incentive for enrollees to use mail order for more expensive  brand drugs. Only the GEHA standard plan included the same cost sharing  requirements for both retail and mail order. (See table 3.)", "The interaction between a plan\u2019s benefit design and PBM cost savings can  also affect the amount of enrollees\u2019 out-of-pocket costs for prescription  drugs. For example, in instances where a plan required enrollees to pay a  coinsurance rate representing a portion of the actual drug cost, enrollees  shared directly in price discounts PBMs obtained from pharmacies. To  illustrate, for a hypothetical drug with an undiscounted cash price of $64,  and a PBM-obtained discount price of $52, an enrollee in a plan with a 25- percent coinsurance requirement would pay $13 rather than $16.

Fee-for-service FEHBP plan  premiums are based on past years\u2019 claims data for FEHBP enrollees.  Consequently, PBM reductions in plan claims costs for prescription drugs  translate into lower premiums for enrollees in later years. For example, we  estimate that PBM savings in the form of rebates passed on to the two fee- for-service FEHBP plans we examined between 1998 and 2000 translate  into about a 1-percent decrease from what the plans\u2019 future premiums  would have been.

PBMs we reviewed retained  little or no revenue from plan payments for retail drug costs and  dispensing fees because they were largely passed through to retail  pharmacies. While not disclosing their acquisition costs for mail-order  drugs, PBM officials said that plan payments were somewhat higher than  their payments to pharmaceutical manufacturers for mail-order drugs.  Using the average manufacturer price (AMP) as a proxy for PBMs\u2019 mail- order acquisition costs, we estimate that the discounted price for mail- order drugs that plans and enrollees paid were on average higher than the  estimated mail-order acquisition cost for some (but not all) brand-name  drugs and all generic drugs that we reviewed. On average, the AMP was  about 2 percent below the plan prices for 7 of the 14 brand-name drugs we  reviewed but about 3 percent higher than the plan prices for the other 7  brand-name drugs. The AMP was below plan prices for all four generic  drugs we reviewed.", "Rebates. PBMs shared with the FEHBP plans certain rebates that a drug  manufacturer provides a PBM associated with their FEHBP business,  although the extent to which the PBMs retained a portion of these rebates  varied, depending on the contracts negotiated between the plans and  PBMs. We estimate the rebates retained by the PBMs we reviewed  represented less than half of one percent of total plan drug spending. The  plans we reviewed varied as to whether they reimbursed PBMs separately  for administrative services in exchange for a larger share of contractual  rebates or they received less of the contractual rebates and were charged  low or no fees for administrative services.", "PBMs also received other manufacturer rebates or payments for services  based on their total volume of a particular manufacturer\u2019s drugs sold  through FEHBP plans and other plans. For example, one PBM we  reviewed earned additional manufacturer rebates for its efforts to increase  drug manufacturers\u2019 share of certain products. The PBMs also received  fees from manufacturers for various services, such as encouraging  physicians to change prescribing patterns, educational services to  enrollees regarding compliance with certain drug regimens, and data  reporting services. These rebates and other payments were a large portion  of PBMs\u2019 earnings, according to PBM officials and industry experts, but  the actual amounts were undisclosed because they are proprietary. Public  financial information suggests that manufacturer payments are important  sources of earnings. For example, in financial reports submitted to the  SEC, two of the PBMs we reviewed stated that manufacturer rebates and  fees were key to their profitability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["PBMs are central to most FEHBP plan efforts to manage their prescription  drug benefits, and PBMs have helped the FEHBP plans we reviewed  reduce what they would likely otherwise pay in prescription drug  expenditures while generally maintaining wide access to most retail  pharmacies and drugs. As the cost of prescription drugs continues to  increase, FEHBP plans are likely to encourage PBMs to continue to  leverage their purchasing power with drug manufacturers and retail  pharmacies and pass on the savings to the plans and their enrollees.  However, attempts to achieve additional cost savings can involve trade- offs for plan enrollees. For example, additional savings through formulary  management can accrue if more restrictive formularies are used, but  enrollees would likely have unrestricted access to fewer drugs. Similarly,  retail pharmacies may be willing to provide deeper discounts as part of  smaller, more selective retail pharmacy networks. Smaller networks have  the potential to draw more enrollees into participating stores but offer  enrollees access to fewer retail pharmacies. OPM, FEHBP plans, and  PBMs must balance these trade-offs in designing affordable and accessible  prescription drug benefits for federal employees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency and Other Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to OPM, the three plans and three PBMs  we reviewed, two pharmacy associations (NACDS and NCPA), and two  independent expert reviewers.", "In written comments, OPM generally concurred with our findings. OPM  highlighted the advantages and trade-offs associated with FEHBP plans\u2019  use of PBMs in providing affordable drug benefits and providing enrollees  with access to prescription drugs. Appendix II contains OPM\u2019s comments.", "The plans and PBMs reviewed the report for the accuracy of information  regarding their arrangements and provided technical comments regarding  information we reported about them, which we incorporated as  appropriate. Two independent external experts on pharmaceutical drug  pricing who were not affiliated with PBMs, pharmacies, or drug  manufacturers indicated that the draft was fair and balanced. They also  provided technical comments that we incorporated as appropriate.", "In oral comments, NACDS\u2019 Vice President for Policy and Programs  expressed strong concerns, particularly focusing on the scope of our  work, and NCPA\u2019s Senior Vice President for Government Affairs and  General Counsel separately informed us that he generally concurred with  NACDS\u2019 comments. NACDS\u2019 concerns included the following:    Our draft did not adequately address the overall PBM industry and how it  operates, including special economic relationships that may exist between  some drug manufacturers and PBMs. The NACDS representative stated  that these relationships create incentives for PBMs to encourage use of  certain manufacturers\u2019 drugs even if they are more costly to the plan or  enrollees. As we noted in the draft, we were asked to examine the role of  PBMs specifically for FEHBP-participating plans and enrollees, not the  PBM industry in general. While the savings we report through discounts,  rebates, and certain interventions do not reflect whether PBMs encourage  higher-cost drugs, the FEHBP plans we reviewed informed us they  believed they saved money from using PBMs. Relationships between PBMs  and manufacturers and pharmacies for other plans were beyond the scope  of this report. In response to the concern about PBMs\u2019 influence on drug  switching, we added information based on two PBMs\u2019 filings with the SEC  regarding an ongoing Department of Justice investigation of certain PBMs\u2019  relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers and retail pharmacies.    The draft report did not include information about all three plans\u2019 use of  generic drugs, which is one means to reduce the overall cost of the drug  benefit. In the draft report, we addressed savings PBMs achieve through  direct interventions to switch from a prescribed brand drug to a generic,  as opposed to overall generic use rates, which are affected by other  factors such as plans\u2019 benefit designs. To clarify our findings, we added  information on the relative use of generic drugs among the retail and mail  order pharmacy services for the plans we reviewed.", "Our finding that the PBMs we reviewed retained little or no compensation  from the payments they receive from plans for retail drugs because they  pass these payments on in total to the retail pharmacies seemed  inconsistent with NACDS\u2019 experience. While PBMs\u2019 contractual  arrangements with other plans may differ, the contractual arrangements  with the FEHBP-participating plans we reviewed resulted in the PBMs  passing through to the retail pharmacies the entire payment that they  receive from the plans.", "Our estimate that retail pharmacies\u2019 drug acquisition costs are on average  about 8 percent below the payments they receive from the FEHBP plans  we reviewed implies this is a profit and does not adequately acknowledge  overhead costs. Our draft report stated that this estimated margin does not  reflect a retail drug store\u2019s profit because it does not include overhead  costs nor certain other savings that may be available to some drug stores.  We revised the report to better clarify this point and added information  regarding NACDS\u2019 and other recent studies\u2019 estimates of overhead costs  for retail pharmacies on a per prescription basis.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Director of the Office of  Personnel Management, appropriate congressional committees, and other  interested parties.

Together, these plans accounted for  about 55 percent of the 8.3 million people covered through FEHBP plans  as of July 2002 and represented various plan types and PBM contractors.  BCBS contracted with the two largest PBMs in the United States, Medco  Health Solutions and AdvancePCS, for its pharmacy benefit services.  GEHA contracted with Medco Health Solutions and PacifiCare of  California contracted with Prescription Solutions, another subsidiary of  PacifiCare Health Systems.", "We reviewed contracts between the PBMs and plans, financial statements  regarding payments made between the plans and PBMs, and retail and  mail-order prices for selected drugs from the FEHBP plans we reviewed  and the PBMs with which they contracted. We also obtained pricing  information from retail pharmacies, interviewed officials at the Office of  Personnel Management (OPM), the federal agency responsible for  administering FEHBP, and associations representing PBMs and retail  pharmacies, and reviewed studies regarding the use of PBMs and  prescription drug payments.", "Specifically, to assess the drug discount savings PBMs achieved, we  selected 18 drugs that were among the drugs with the highest expenditures  or number of prescriptions dispensed based on data reported by the plans.  Combined, these 18 high-volume/high-expenditure drugs represented 12  percent of all prescriptions dispensed to enrollees of the selected FEHBP  plans and 16 percent of total plans\u2019 drug expenditures in 2001. In selecting  these drugs, we also sought to ensure a distribution of generic and brand  drugs for a range of treatment conditions sold by different drug  manufacturers. Table 4 lists the drugs included in our price comparisons.", "At our request, the plans provided prices paid as of April 2002 for the most  common strength, dosage form, and quantity dispensed for these drugs at  retail pharmacies (typically, a 30-day supply) and at mail-order pharmacies  (typically, a 90-day supply). Prices represent the plan and enrollees\u2019 share  of the drug ingredient cost\u2014expressed as a discount from an industry  standard price such as the average wholesale price (AWP) or maximum  allowable cost (MAC)\u2014plus a dispensing fee. We did not independently  verify the accuracy of these plan-reported prices.", "To compare prices negotiated with PBMs for retail and mail-order  prescriptions to cash prices a customer without third-party coverage  would pay at retail pharmacies, we surveyed 36 pharmacies in California,  North Dakota, Washington, D.C., and the Virginia and Maryland suburbs of  Washington, D.C., from April 18 through April 30, 2002. We selected the  locations to be geographically diverse, specifically including California  because it is the only state in which PacifiCare of California operates,  North Dakota to include a state with a low population density, and the  Washington, D.C., metropolitan area because it includes a large number of  FEHBP enrollees. We randomly selected 12 pharmacies in each of these  areas, including both large chain pharmacies and independent or small  chain pharmacies. We determined that each of the pharmacies surveyed  participated in the retail networks for each of our selected FEHBP plans  serving that area. From each pharmacy, we obtained prices for a 30-day  supply of the 18 selected drugs. These prices are applicable only to the  pharmacies surveyed and at the time they were obtained.", "We also compared prices plans paid to retail and mail-order pharmacies to  the pharmacies\u2019 estimated acquisition costs. Retail pharmacies typically  purchase drugs from intermediary wholesale distributors and\u2014to a lesser  extent\u2014drug manufacturers, while PBM-owned mail-order pharmacies  more typically purchase drugs from manufacturers. Since no data source  exists to identify pharmacy acquisition costs, we estimated retail  pharmacies\u2019 acquisition costs for drugs purchased from wholesalers using  the wholesale acquisition prices (WAC) reported in Red Book, a  compilation of drug pricing data published by Medical Economics  Company, Inc., as of April 2002. We added 3 percent to WAC to estimate  the wholesalers\u2019 margin, based on information provided by retail  pharmacy officials. To estimate mail-order pharmacies\u2019 acquisition costs  for drugs purchased directly from drug manufacturers, we used industry- reported and confidential average manufacturers\u2019 price information (AMP)  obtained from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. We selected  WAC and AMP prices for our 18 selected drugs using the most common  national drug code reported by the plans for reimbursing retail and mail- order prescription claims. The acquisition costs we have estimated cannot  be generalized beyond the drugs we reviewed. Also, the acquisition costs  we reported are based on averages for the drugs we reviewed, and  individual pharmacies or mail-order operations may have higher or lower  acquisition costs.", "To assess enrollee access to prescription drugs, we compared the number  of retail pharmacies in the plans\u2019 retail pharmacy networks to the total  number of licensed retail pharmacies in California, the District of  Columbia, Maryland, North Dakota, and Virginia. To examine the breadth  and depth of each plan\u2019s formulary, we compared each plan\u2019s formulary to  the National Formulary developed by the Department of Veterans Affairs  (VA). Although the VA formulary was designed for the veteran-specific  population, it is considered by the Institute of Medicine as not overly  restrictive based on its comparison with other formularies and clinical  literature. We obtained the National Formulary from the VA\u2019s Pharmacy  Benefits Management Strategic Healthcare Group. The VA formulary  contains approximately 1,200 items, including generic, brand name, and  over-the-counter drugs, devices, and supplies. We requested that VA  officials remove devices, supplies, and drugs that are usually prescribed  on an in-patient basis or are available over-the-counter because the  FEHBP plans we reviewed cover inpatient drugs as part of the hospital  benefit and do not cover drugs available over-the-counter. The resulting  list included 513 outpatient prescription drugs representing 162  therapeutic classes. To examine the breadth and depth of each plan\u2019s  formulary relative to these outpatient prescription drugs from the VA  formulary, we determined whether each of the drugs and therapeutic  classes included on the list of drugs drawn from the VA formulary was also  included on each of the plan formularies. Each plan also provided us with  examples of therapeutically equivalent drugs included on the plan\u2019s  formulary for drugs that did not have an exact match on the VA formulary  list. We considered a VA therapeutic class to be included on a plan  formulary if at least one of the VA drugs in that class or a therapeutically  equivalent drug was listed in the plan formulary. For VA therapeutic  classes not included on a plan formulary, we used National Institutes of  Health and Medco Health Solutions on-line databases to analyze the types  of medical conditions treated by the excluded drugs within these classes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Office of Personnel Management", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["The following staff made important contributions to this report:   Rashmi Agarwal, Randy Dirosa, Betty Kirksey, Carmen Rivera-Lowitt, and  Annesha White."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["VA and DOD Health Care: Factors Contributing to Reduced Pharmacy  Costs and Continuing Challenges.
