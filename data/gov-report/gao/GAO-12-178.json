GSA concluded that agency buyers paid higher prices when they bought office supplies outside GSA\u0092s Multiple Award Schedule program than they would have using the schedules or OS II. According to GSA, the price premiums averaged 75 percent compared to the schedule prices and 86 percent compared to OS II. GAO identified data and other limitations in GSA\u0092s study, such as not always controlling for variation in quantities of identical items when comparing prices. GAO was not able to fully quantify the impact of these limitations. Officials from other agencies\u0097Air Force, Army, Navy, and DHS\u0097also questioned the study\u0092s specific findings on price premiums, believing them to be overstated, but their own studies support GSA\u0092s general conclusion that better prices can be obtained through consolidated, leveraged purchasing. The GSA study also concluded that buyers compared prices before making purchases, but this conclusion was based on interviews with senior-level acquisition officials and not on information obtained from any of the approximately 270,000 government purchase cardholders who made the purchasing decisions.", "According to available data, GSA\u0092s new office supplies sourcing initiative, OS II, has produced savings. GSA estimated that the government saved $16 million from June 2010 through August 2011 through this initiative. According to GSA, the OS II initiative is demonstrating that leveraged buying can produce savings and has provided improvements for managing ongoing and future strategic sourcing initiatives. GSA reports that OS II allowed it to negotiate discounts with vendors who were selected for the initiative, and has spurred price competition among schedule vendors that were not selected as they react to the OS II pricing, resulting in decreased schedule prices. The initiative is also expected to lower government-wide office supply costs through more centralized contract management. Another key aspect of the initiative is that participating vendors provide sales and other information to GSA to help monitor prices, savings, and vendor performance.

For relatively small purchases, generally up to $3,000,  authorized users can use their government purchase cards. For larger  purchases, agencies may use other procedures under the Federal  Acquisition Regulation, such as awarding a contract. Alternatively, GSA  provides federal agencies with a simplified method for procuring office  supplies through its Federal Supply Schedule program, also known as the  Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) or schedules program. Under the  schedules program, the federal government\u2019s largest interagency  contracting program, GSA awards contracts to multiple vendors for a  wide range of commercially available goods and services. The schedules  program can leverage the government\u2019s significant aggregate buying  power. Also, under the schedules program, to ensure the government is  getting the most value for the taxpayer\u2019s dollar, GSA seeks to obtain price  discounts equal to those that vendors offer their \u201cmost favored  customers.\u201d", "In November 2007, GSA initiated another approach for buying office  supplies by creating blanket purchase agreements (BPA) under the  schedules program. BPAs are a simplified method of fulfilling repetitive  needs for supplies and services that also provide an opportunity to seek  reduced pricing from vendors\u2019 schedule prices. The approach was part of  the government\u2019s Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI). GSA  officials acknowledged they could have done a better job promoting this  initiative. Ultimately, GSA determined that the initiative did not meet its  expectations and initiated a second strategic sourcing initiative known as  FSSI Office Supplies II (OS II) in 2010. By July 2010, GSA competitively  awarded 15 BPAs to 13 small businesses and 2 other businesses to  support the OS II initiative.", "The GSA study on office supply purchases reviewed 14 categories of  mostly consumable office supplies, ranging from paper and writing  instruments to calendars and filing supplies. The report did not include non-consumable items such as office furniture and computers because  they are not part of the standard industry definition of office supplies.", "The GSA report estimated that the 10 agencies with the highest spending  on office supplies accounted for about $1.3 billion, about 81 percent of  the total $1.6 billion spent governmentwide on the 14 categories of office  supplies during fiscal year 2009. The amounts spent by the top 10  agencies are shown in figure 1.", "The report found that about 58 percent of office supply purchases were  made outside of the GSA schedules program, mostly at retail stores. The  report also found that agencies often paid more\u2014a price premium\u2014than  they would have by using the GSA schedules program or OS II. On  average, GSA found that agencies paid 75 percent more than schedule  prices and 86 percent more than OS II prices for their retail purchases.

Because of this, GSA obtained data for its  study from multiple government sources, and purchase card information  provided by the commercial banks that issue the government purchase  cards. To determine the funds spent on office supplies and to conduct  related analyses, GSA sorted through data from these various sources,  which included about 7 million purchase transactions involving over   12 million items. GSA took a number of steps to clean the data prior to  using them. For example, because a single purchase might have been  reported in more than one data source, GSA removed duplicate  purchases prior to its analysis. The data were further cleaned to remove  items and their related costs that did not meet GSA\u2019s definition of office  supplies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GSA\u2019s Retail Price Premium Analyses Faced Data and Other Limitations", "paragraphs": ["To determine retail price premiums, GSA focused its analyses on 219  office supply items that were purchased in 2009 from retailers and the  GSA schedules. In its report, GSA acknowledged that the data used to  analyze governmentwide purchases of office supplies in 2009 had  limitations, in part due to the decentralized data sources for office supply  purchases and the limited time GSA had to conduct its study. A significant  issue GSA faced was attempting to control for variation in quantities; in  other words, GSA tried to ensure that when comparing prices, it was  using transactions that involved identical quantities. A purchase of pens,  for example, could involve a single pen, a package of three pens, a box of  a dozen, or any other quantity. GSA officials told us that the primary  means they used to control for quantities was the use of the  manufacturer\u2019s part number. They explained that they searched available  databases to identify items with identical part numbers. They told us that  when they found large variations in retail prices for apparently identical  items, they excluded transactions they considered to be outliers.", "This approach, however, may not have been adequate to account for  variations in quantity. When we contacted a national organization  representing manufacturers, a senior staff director told us that there is no  consistent approach among manufacturers for assigning part numbers.  Some manufacturers may assign one part number to individual items and  different part numbers to packages of those same items containing  different quantities, while other manufacturers may assign the same part  number both to individual items and to packages of items. In addition,  when we reviewed some of the individual transaction data GSA obtained  for retail purchases, we identified substantial price variations for a number  of drawing and graphic arts supplies and writing instruments that carried  the same manufacturer\u2019s part number.", "Specifically, when we reviewed GSA\u2019s retail transaction data for 10 items  within the writing instruments category, we found that retail prices for 6 of  the 10 items varied by more than 300 percent. For instance, for one item  involving black Rollerball pens, GSA\u2019s retail transaction data showed  prices ranging from $9.96 to $44.96 for items listed with the same part  number. These transactions were all with the same nationwide retailer.  When asked about such substantial price differences for items with the  same part number, GSA officials acknowledged that the purchase card  data they used for retail prices did not always accurately identify the  quantity of items involved in each transaction. The existence of  substantial price differences for a number of items indicates that GSA\u2019s  attempts to compare prices may not have adequately controlled for  variations in quantities.", "We also identified a weakness with the clarity of the GSA report with  regard to how price premium estimates were calculated. Specifically,  GSA\u2019s study described a specific formula that was used to calculate the  price premiums, but our review of the study\u2019s supporting documents  found that the GSA actually used a different formula to calculate price  premiums for 10 of the 14 office supply categories. In a discussion with  GSA officials, they agreed that the study did involve the use of two  different formulas. When we used the formula described in the study to  recalculate the retail price premiums for those 10 categories of office  supplies, we found the price premiums would have changed from what  GSA reported by less than 5 percentage points for all categories except  drawing and graphic arts supplies. For that category, the recalculated  price premium was 68 percent, as compared to the 278 percent reported  in the study. The use of this unreported formula did not have a substantial  impact on the retail price premium calculations for most categories of  office supplies or the overall conclusions of the study, but the GSA report  could have been more complete had it fully disclosed all the formulas  used for all categories of office supplies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data from Other Agencies Show Savings of Smaller Magnitude", "paragraphs": ["On the basis of their own studies, Air Force, Army, Navy, and DHS  officials also questioned the specific price premiums and savings reported  by GSA.

However, the agencies agreed with GSA\u2019s overall conclusion  that better prices can be obtained through leveraged buys.", "In addition, all four agencies in our review found that the prices available  through the new OS II BPAs were better than the prices available from  their existing agency BPAs. For example, a DHS study found savings of  about 20 percent when analyzing the prices associated with a mix of 348  items. The Air Force determined that the OS II BPAs could save about   7 percent in a study of the 125 most commonly purchased items. On the  basis of this analysis, the Air Force decided to let its existing office supply  contracts expire. Similarly, the Navy\u2019s comparison of 71 items found that  using the OS II BPAs could save about 6 percent, which led Navy officials  to move purchasing to the OS II BPAs.

These savings were estimated by comparing  the lowest prices of a set of over 400 items available on GSA\u2019s schedules  program contracts before OS II with prices and discounts being offered  for the same items on the OS II BPAs. Importantly, and unlike GSA\u2019s  report, GSA\u2019s conclusions about savings realized under OS II are based  on data from vendors\u2014which they are required to collect and provide in  the normal course of business\u2014and not on data collected after the fact  from sources not designed to produce information needed to estimate  savings.", "GSA\u2019s comparison of the market basket of best schedule prices against  the OS II BPA vendors\u2019 prices found that the BPA vendors offered prices  that were an average of 8 percent lower, and the average savings is  expected to fluctuate somewhat as the OS II initiative continues to be  implemented. The expected fluctuation is based on anticipated changes  in the mix of vendors, products, and agencies. For example, GSA found  the savings, as a percentage, declined slightly as agencies with  historically strong office supplies management programs increased their  use of OS II. Conversely, they expect the savings percentage to increase  as agencies without strong office supplies management programs  increase their use. In addition to the savings from the BPAs, GSA  representatives told us that they are also seeing prices decrease on  schedules program contracts as vendors that were not selected for the  OS II program react to the additional price competition created by the OS  II initiative by reducing their schedule prices.", "After the first year the OS II BPAs were in use, GSA extended the BPAs  for an additional year after negotiating additional price discounts. As a  result of these discussions, 13 of the 15 BPA vendors decreased their  prices by an additional 3.9 percent on average. Additionally, the BPAs  included tiered discounts, which apply when specific sales volume  thresholds are met. Sales realized by one of the BPA vendors reached  the first tier discount level in September 2011, and the vendor has since  adjusted its prices to provide the corresponding price discounts. GSA  anticipates additional vendor sales to exceed the first tier discount  threshold in the first option year, which will trigger additional discounts.", "GSA expects that OS II will result in lower government-wide costs for  office supplies as more agencies move from their agency-specific BPAs  for office supplies to the OS II BPAs. Many agencies that had their own  BPAs for office supplies did not renew their BPAs and have opted to use  the OS II instead. As these agencies move to OS II, their contract  management costs should decrease. For example, according to Air Force  officials, instead of having personnel in every agency administer their own  BPAs for office supplies, personnel at GSA will administer the OS II  program on behalf of other agencies. While this may create some  additional burden for GSA, officials believe the overall government costs  to administer office supply purchases should decrease."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OS II Includes Key Management Goals to Enhance Oversight and Manage Suppliers", "paragraphs": ["GSA has incorporated a range of activities representative of a strategic  procurement approach into the OS II initiative, including aspects of  managing the suppliers. These activities range from obtaining a better  picture of spending on services, to taking an enterprisewide approach, to  developing new ways of doing business. All of these activities involve  some level of centralized oversight and management. In addition, this  approach involves activities associated with the management of the  supply chain, which includes planning and managing all activities involved  in sourcing and procurement decisions, as well as logistics management  activities. These include coordination and collaboration with stakeholders,  such as suppliers or vendors, intermediaries sometimes referred to as  resellers, third party service providers, and customers or buying agencies.  As part of the planning process for OS II, GSA assessed its schedules  program office supply vendor pool and determined a sufficient number of  vendors could meet its critical requirements.", "As part of the overall strategy, in addition to savings, GSA through its  commodity council also identified five overarching goals for the OS II  initiative, to facilitate overall management, as shown in table 2.", "As part of preparing for the competition for OS II, GSA obtained input  from the interested vendors before issuing the request for quotations by  holding an industry day. For example, based on vendor input that  identified shipping as a key cost driver, a $100 minimum order level was  included as part of the BPA. A reverse auction process was used to carry  out the competition for the BPAs, which GSA anticipated would result in  more pricing discounts offered by vendors. As part of the reverse auction  process, the vendors submitted an initial quote. After GSA evaluated the  quotes, the vendors were notified of the lowest quotes and provided at  least one opportunity to revise their quotes, resulting in price reductions.", "GSA obtained commitments from agencies and help set goals for  additional discounts to let businesses know that the agencies were  serious in their commitment to the BPAs. This also helped GSA  determine the number of BPAs that would be awarded. Because  government purchase cards were the most common way to purchase  office supplies, OS II includes a point of sale discount, under which BPA  prices are automatically charged whenever a government purchase card  is used for an item covered by the BPA rather than having the buyers ask  for a discount. Additionally, purchases are automatically tax exempt if the  purchases are made using a government purchase card.
