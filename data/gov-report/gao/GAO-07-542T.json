From a broad financial management perspective, the federal government's financial condition and fiscal outlook are worse than many understand. We are currently experiencing strong economic growth and yet running large on-budget (operating) deficits that are largely unrelated to the Global War on Terrorism. The federal government faces large and growing structural deficits in future years due primarily to known demographic trends and rising health care costs. If it is assumed that recent tax reductions are made permanent and discretionary spending keeps pace with the growth of our economy, GAO's long-term simulations suggest that by 2040, federal revenues may be adequate to pay little more than interest on debt held by the public and some Social Security benefits. Neither slowing the discretionary spending growth nor allowing certain tax provisions to expire--nor both together--would eliminate the imbalance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to testify on the progress made towards a  results-oriented, accountable, and relevant government and the challenges  that must be addressed to provide accountability and exercise  stewardship. The foundation laid by the Chief Financial Officers (CFO)  Act of 1990 and other management reform legislation provides a basis to  improve the accountability of government programs and operations as  well as to routinely produce valuable cost and operating performance  information. While certain material weaknesses in internal control and in  selected accounting and financial reporting practices continue to prevent  GAO from being able to issue an opinion on the consolidated financial  statements of the U.S. government, the federal government has come a  long way since enactment of the CFO Act. At the same time, there is a  continuing need to address persistent, long-standing accountability  problems and to take financial management to the next level. This will be  important as the federal government faces difficult fiscal challenges that  will require reliable cost and performance information to support timely  decisions on spending and, at the same time, pressures to address fraud,  waste, abuse, and mismanagement will only intensify.", "From a broad financial management perspective, the federal government\u2019s  deteriorating long-range financial condition and long-term fiscal imbalance  are matters of increasing concern. We face large and growing structural  deficits due primarily to known demographic trends and rising health care  costs. There is a need to engage in a fundamental review, reprioritization,  and reengineering of the base of government.

If I were to summarize in just a few words the environment  in 2007 as compared to prior to enactment of key financial management  laws, financial management has gone from the backroom to the  boardroom. There has been a cultural change in how financial  management is viewed and carried out in the agencies and a recognition of  the value and need for good financial management throughout  government, which was not the case in 1990 when the Congress passed the  CFO Act. Financial management systems and internal control have been  strengthened. Generally accepted government accounting standards have  been developed. For fiscal year 2006, 19 of 24 CFO Act agencies received  clean audit opinions on their financial statements, up from just 6 for fiscal  year 1996. While there has been marked progress in federal financial  management, a number of challenges still remain, including transforming  financial management and business practices at DOD, modernizing  financial management systems, and building a financial management  workforce for the future. Fully meeting these challenges will enable the  federal government to provide the world-class financial management  anticipated by the CFO Act and other management reform legislation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Progress Made since Passage of Key Federal Financial Management Legislation", "paragraphs": ["First, I would like to briefly highlight the legislative framework that  governs federal financial management. The Congress has long recognized  the importance of the federal government implementing strong financial  management practices. Towards this end, the Congress has passed a series  of management reform legislation aimed at improving and providing a  strong foundation for federal financial management. This series of  legislation started with the Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act of  1982 (FMFIA), which the Congress passed to strengthen internal control  and accounting systems throughout the federal government, among other  purposes. In accordance with FMFIA, GAO has issued Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government, which provides the  standards that are directed at helping agency managers implement  effective internal control, an integral part of improving financial  management systems.", "While agencies had achieved some early success in identifying and  correcting material internal control and accounting system weaknesses,  their efforts to implement FMFIA had not produced the intended results.  Therefore, the Congress passed additional management reform legislation  to improve the general and financial management of the federal  government. This legislation includes the (1) CFO Act of 1990, (2)  Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA), (3)  Government Management Reform Act of 1994 (GMRA), (4) Federal  Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA), (5) Clinger- Cohen Act of 1996, (6) Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002  (ATDA), and (7) Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA).", "The CFO Act is the most comprehensive and far-reaching financial  management improvement act since the Budget and Accounting  Procedures Act of 1950. The CFO Act established a leadership structure,  provided for long-range planning, required audited financial statements  and modern financial systems, and strengthened accountability reporting  for certain agencies. Three years later, the Congress enacted GPRA, which  required certain agencies to develop strategic plans, set performance  goals, and report annually on actual performance compared to goals.", "GPRA\u2019s emphasis on performance management complements the  concepts in the CFO Act. GPRA was followed by GMRA, which made  permanent the pilot program in the CFO Act for annual audited agency- level financial statements, expanded this requirement to all CFO Act  agencies, and established a requirement for the preparation and audit of  governmentwide consolidated financial statements. In 1996, FFMIA built  on the foundation laid by the CFO Act by reflecting the need for CFO Act  agencies to have systems that can generate reliable, useful, and timely  information with which to make fully informed decisions and to ensure  accountability on an ongoing basis. The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (also  known as the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996)  sets forth a variety of initiatives to support better decision making for  capital investments in information technology, which has led to the  development of the Federal Enterprise Architecture and better-informed  capital investment and control processes within agencies and across  government. ATDA required most executive agencies that were not  otherwise required by statute or exempted by OMB, to prepare annual  audited financial statements and to submit such statements to the  Congress and the Director of OMB. Finally, IPIA has increased visibility  over improper payments by requiring executive agency heads, based on  guidance from the OMB, to identify programs and activities susceptible to  significant improper payments, estimate amounts improperly paid, and  report on the amounts of improper payments and their actions to reduce  them. The combination of reforms ushered in by these laws, if successfully  implemented, provides a solid foundation to improve the accountability of  government programs and operations as well as to routinely produce  valuable cost and operating performance information.", "The five key financial management improvements that we have noted from  a governmentwide perspective are as follows.", "Achieving Cultural Change\u2014We have seen true cultural change in  how financial management is viewed. This has been accomplished  through a lot of hard work by OMB and the agencies and continued  strong support and oversight by the Congress. At the top level, federal  financial management reform has gained momentum through the  committed support of top federal leaders. For example, improved  financial performance is one of the governmentwide initiatives in the  President\u2019s Management Agenda (PMA). Under this initiative, agency  CFOs share responsibility\u2014both individually and through the efforts of  the CFO Council\u2014for improving the financial performance of the  government. The Executive Branch Management Scorecard, developed  as part of the PMA, has been an effective tool to monitor progress and  help drive much needed improvements.", "Establishing a Governmentwide Leadership Structure\u2014The Joint  Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP) Principals\u2014 the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of OMB, the Director of  OPM, and myself, the Comptroller General\u2014have provided leadership  by holding periodic meetings that have resulted in unprecedented  substantive deliberations and agreements focused on key reform issues  such as improving accounting for and reporting on social insurance,  accelerating issuance of audited agency financial statements, and  advocating audit committees. GAO has led by example in this regard,  by establishing an audit advisory committee to help us in overseeing  the effectiveness of our current financial reporting and audit processes.", "As established by the CFO Act, the Office of Federal Financial  Management (OFFM), the OMB organization with governmentwide  responsibility for federal financial management for executive agencies,  has demonstrated leadership by undertaking a number of initiatives  related to improving financial management capabilities ranging from  requiring the use of commercial off-the-shelf financial systems to the  promotion of cost accounting to improve the availability of  management information for decision making. In addition to assessing  the status of agencies\u2019 progress in improving financial performance for  the PMA, OFFM has also issued bulletins, circulars, and other guidance  to provide a broad-based foundation for transforming agencies\u2019  financial management operations.", "Strengthening Internal Control\u2014In December 2004, OMB revised its  Circular No. A-123, Management\u2019s Responsibility for Internal Control,  to provide guidance to federal managers on improving the  accountability and effectiveness of federal programs and operations by  establishing, assessing, correcting, and reporting on management  controls. Requiring federal managers, at the executive level, to focus on  internal control demonstrates a renewed emphasis on identifying and  addressing internal control weaknesses. As we testified in 2005, many  internal control problems have been identified and fixed, especially at  the lower levels where internal control assessments were performed  and managers could take focused actions to fix relatively simple  problems. As a recent case in point, based on our 2006 assessment of  high-risk programs, two programs previously designated as high risk,  largely due to financial management weaknesses, were removed from  the list.", "Agencies have also made progress in implementing processes and  controls to identify, estimate, and reduce improper payments. After  passage of IPIA, OMB established Eliminating Improper Payments in  2005 as a new program-specific initiative under the PMA. This separate  PMA program initiative was established in this manner to ensure that  agency managers are held accountable for meeting the goals of IPIA  and are, therefore, dedicating the necessary attention and resources to  meeting IPIA requirements. OMB also issued guidance in August 2006  to help clarify and update requirements to support governmentwide  IPIA compliance.", "Improving Financial Management Systems and Operations\u2014Since  enactment of financial management reform legislation, federal financial  management systems requirements have been developed for the core  financial system; managerial cost system; and other administrative and  programmatic systems, such as grants, property, revenue, travel, and  loans, which are part of an overall financial management system. After  the realignment of the JFMIP Program Management Office, OFFM has  continued the practice of issuing these requirements. Beginning in  1999, OMB required agencies to purchase commercial off-the-shelf  software that had been tested and certified by the federal government  against the systems requirements that I just mentioned. With these  requirements, the federal government has better defined the  functionality needed in its financial management systems, which has  helped the vendor community understand federal agencies\u2019 needs.", "OMB continues to move forward on initiatives that support the PMA  with the further development of the financial management line of  business to promote leveraging shared service solutions to enhance the  government\u2019s performance and services. The financial management  line of business initiative is modeled after the consolidation of agencies  processing payroll, which were dramatically reduced from 22 to 4  systems. OMB, in conjunction with an interagency task force, estimated  that these efforts could save billions of taxpayer dollars. Ultimately,  this initiative is expected to (1) reduce the number of systems that each  individual agency must support, (2) promote standardization, and (3)  reduce the duplication of efforts.", "Preparing Auditable Financial Statements\u2014Unqualified audit  opinions for CFO Act agencies\u2019 financial statements have grown from 6  in fiscal year 1996 to 19 in fiscal year 2006. Improvements in timeliness  have been even more dramatic over the years. Agencies were able to  issue their audited financial statements within the accelerated  reporting time frame\u2014all 24 CFO Act agencies issued their audited  financial statements by the November 15, 2006, deadline, set by OMB,  just 45 days after the close of the fiscal year. Just a few years ago, most  considered this accelerated time frame unrealistic and unachievable.", "Another definitive example of progress made to date is the  establishment of the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board  (FASAB). In conjunction with the passage of the CFO Act, the OMB  Director, Secretary of the Treasury, and the Comptroller General  established FASAB to develop accounting standards and principles for  the newly required financial statements. The concepts and standards  are the basis for OMB\u2019s guidance to agencies on the form and content  of their financial statements and for the government\u2019s consolidated  financial statements. FASAB is comprised of a 10-member advisory  board of 4 knowledgeable individuals from government and 6  nonfederal members selected from the general financial community,  the accounting and auditing community, and academia to promulgate  proposed accounting standards designed to meet the needs of federal  agencies and other users of federal financial information. The mission  of FASAB is to develop accounting standards after considering the  financial and budgetary information needs of congressional oversight  groups, executive agencies, and other users. These accounting and  reporting standards are essential for public accountability and for an  efficient and effective functioning of our democratic system of  government. The standards developed by FASAB have been recognized  by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants as generally  accepted accounting standards for federal entities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Management Challenges Facing the Federal Government", "paragraphs": ["While there has been marked progress in federal financial management, a  number of challenges still remain.

Fully meeting these  challenges will enable the federal government to provide the world-class  financial management anticipated by the CFO Act and other management  reform legislation. While there continues to be much focus on the agency  and governmentwide audit opinions, getting a clean audit opinion, though  important in itself, is not the end goal. The end goal is the establishment of  a fully functioning CFO operation that includes (1) modern financial  management systems that provide reliable, timely, and useful information  to support day-to-day decision making and oversight, and for the  systematic measurement of performance; (2) sound internal controls that  safeguard assets and help ensure proper accountability; and (3) a cadre of  highly qualified CFOs and supporting staff."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Transforming DOD\u2019s Financial and Business Management Practices", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s long-standing financial and business management difficulties are  pervasive, complex, and deeply rooted in virtually all business operations  throughout the department. Resolution of these serious problems is  essential to improving financial management governmentwide and  achieving an opinion on the U.S. government\u2019s consolidated financial  statements. Of the 27 areas on GAO\u2019s high-risk list, DOD has 8 of its own  high-risk areas and shares responsibility for 7 governmentwide high-risk  areas. These weaknesses adversely affect the department\u2019s and the federal  government\u2019s ability to control costs; ensure basic accountability;  anticipate future costs and claims on the budget; measure performance;  maintain funds control; prevent fraud, waste, and abuse; and address  pressing management problems. Additionally, the department invests  billions of dollars each year to operate, maintain, and modernize its  business systems. But despite this significant annual investment, the  department has been continually confronted with the difficult task of  implementing business systems on time, within budget, and with the  promised capability.", "We also have concerns about the reasonableness, reliability, and  transparency of DOD\u2019s budget requests, especially the supplemental  budget requests the department has submitted to the Congress in recent  years. Reasonableness and reliability are critical factors not only for  financial information, but also for budget data. As I testified last year, our  prior work found numerous problems with DOD\u2019s processes for recording  and reporting costs for the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT), the funding  for which has been provided through regular appropriations as well as  supplemental appropriations. These problems included long-standing  deficiencies in DOD\u2019s financial management systems and business  processes, the use of estimates instead of actual cost data, and the lack of  adequate supporting documentation. As a result, neither DOD nor the  Congress have reliable information on GWOT costs or the use of  appropriated funds and also lack historical data useful in considering  future funding needs.", "The nature and severity of DOD\u2019s financial management, business  operations, and system deficiencies not only affect financial reporting, but  also impede the ability of DOD managers to receive the full range of  information needed to effectively manage day-to-day operations. Such  weaknesses have adversely affected the ability of DOD to control costs,  ensure basic accountability, and prevent fraud. The following examples  illustrate DOD\u2019s continuing problems.", "We found that hundreds of separated battle-injured soldiers were  pursued for collection of military debts incurred through no fault of  their own, including 74 soldiers whose debts had been reported to  credit bureaus, private collection agencies, and the Treasury Offset  Program at the time we initiated our audit. Overpayment of pay and  allowances (entitlements), pay calculation errors, and erroneous leave  payments caused 73 percent of the reported debts.", "Over the past several years, we have reported on significant pay  problems experienced by mobilized Army National Guard and Army  Reserve (Army Guard and Reserve) soldiers in the wake of the  September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. These reports included examples  of hundreds of soldiers receiving inaccurate and untimely payroll  payments due to a paper-intensive, error-prone pay process and the  lack of integrated pay and personnel systems. In response to our  reports, DOD has taken some action to improve controls designed to  pay Army Guard and Reserve soldiers accurately and on time,  especially those who had become sick or injured in the line of duty.", "In March 2006, we reported that DOD\u2019s policies and procedures for  determining, reporting, and documenting cost estimates associated  with environmental cleanup or containment activities were not  consistently followed. Further, none of the military services had  adequate controls in place to help ensure that all identified  contaminated sites were included in their environmental liability cost  estimates. These weaknesses not only affected the reliability of DOD\u2019s  environmental liability estimate, but also that of the federal  government as a whole.", "In May 2005, we reported that DOD did not have management controls  in place to assure that excess inventory was reutilized to the maximum  extent possible. We found significant waste and inefficiency because  new, unused, and excellent condition items were transferred and  donated outside of DOD, sold for pennies on the dollar, or destroyed.  Root causes for the waste and inefficiency included (1) unreliable  excess property inventory data; (2) inadequate oversight and physical  inventory control; and (3) outdated, nonintegrated excess inventory  and supply management systems.", "The department is provided billions of dollars annually to operate,  maintain, and modernize its stovepiped, duplicative, legacy business  systems. Despite this significant investment, the department is severely  challenged in implementing business systems on time, within budget, and  with the promised capability. Many of the problems related to DOD\u2019s  inability to effectively implement its business systems can be attributed to  its failure to implement the disciplined processes necessary to reduce the  risks associated with these projects to acceptable levels. Disciplined  processes have been shown to reduce the risks associated with software  development and acquisition efforts and are fundamental to successful  systems acquisition. The weaknesses that we found in DOD business  systems implementations such as the Defense Travel System, the  Logistics Modernization Program, and the Navy\u2019s Enterprise Resource  Planning (ERP) efforts illustrate the types of system acquisition and  investment management controls that need to be effectively implemented  in order for a given investment to be successfully acquired and deployed.", "Meeting the Challenge of Transforming DOD Financial and Business  Management Practices. Successful reform of DOD\u2019s fundamentally flawed  financial and business management operations must simultaneously focus  on its systems, processes, and people. DOD\u2019s top management has  demonstrated a commitment to transforming the department and has  launched key initiatives to improve its financial management processes  and related business systems such as the Financial Improvement and  Audit Readiness (FIAR) Plan. However, DOD still lacks two key elements  that are needed to ensure a successful and sustainable transformation  effort.", "As we have previously recommended, DOD should develop and  implement an integrated and strategic business transformation plan.  Since 1999, we have recommended the need for a comprehensive,  integrated strategy and action plan for reforming DOD\u2019s major business  operations and support activities. Critical to the success of DOD\u2019s  ongoing transformation efforts will be top management attention and  structures that focus on transformation from a broad perspective and a  clear, comprehensive, integrated, and enterprisewide plan that, at a  summary level, addresses all of the department\u2019s major business areas.", "Because of the complexity and long-term nature of DOD\u2019s business  transformation efforts, we again reiterate the need for a chief  management officer (CMO) to provide sustained leadership and  maintain momentum, as we have previously testified. The National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 directs the department  to study the feasibility of a CMO position in DOD. In this regard, the  Institute for Defense Analysis issued its report in December 2006 and,  among other things, called upon the Congress to establish a Deputy  CMO (level III official) at the department. Further, in May 2006, the  Defense Business Board recommended, among other things, the  creation of a Principal Under Secretary of Defense, as a level II official  with a 5-year term appointment, to serve as CMO. I strongly support a  level II official and believe that someone at this level is needed to be  successful given the magnitude of the challenge and the need to effect  change across the department. It is important to note that a CMO  would not assume the responsibilities of the undersecretaries of  defense, the service secretaries, or other DOD officials for the day-to- day management of the department. Rather, the CMO would be  responsible and accountable for planning, integrating, and executing  the overall business transformation effort. The reason I am so  passionate about the need for a CMO at DOD is that progress at DOD  has historically been painfully slow. A host of well-intended past  improvement initiatives has largely failed. I am concerned that without  a CMO who is responsible and accountable for demonstrable results  and sustained success, history will continue to repeat itself."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improving Agency Financial and Performance Reporting", "paragraphs": ["In the area of agency financial and performance reporting, I see obtaining  unqualified opinions on financial statements at all CFO Act agencies as the  primary challenge. While significant progress has been made by many CFO  Act agencies to prepare timely annual financial statements that can pass  the scrutiny of a financial audit, several agencies continue to struggle to  reach this milestone. For fiscal year 2006, five CFO Act agencies\u2014DOD,  DHS,  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the  Departments of Energy and Transportation\u2014failed to meet this basic  requirement. Problems at NASA and the Department of Energy stem from  deficiencies in those agencies\u2019 implementation of new financial  management systems, among other things. The Department of  Transportation auditors cited significant problems with a key accounting  practice at the Federal Aviation Administration as the underlying cause for  qualifying their opinion on the department\u2019s financial statements. As I  previously discussed, the problems faced by DOD are so pervasive that in  accordance with section 1008 of the fiscal year 2002 National Defense  Authorization Act, for the sixth year, DOD acknowledged that its systems  could not support material amounts on DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2006 financial  statements and accordingly, the auditors did not perform auditing  procedures and disclaimed an opinion. At DHS, the auditors recognized  that the department has not yet established the infrastructure and internal  control necessary and disclaimed an opinion on its financial statements.  Problems at these agencies also significantly impact our ability to provide  an opinion on the U.S. government\u2019s consolidated financial statements.", "Meeting the Challenge of Improved Financial and Performance  Reporting. Addressing the financial and performance reporting  weaknesses that impede CFO Act agencies from obtaining unqualified or  clean opinions on the respective agency financial statements will vary  depending upon the circumstances at the agency. Developing and  implementing corrective action plans to address the identified problems  are time-honored methods for resolving such problems. For example, the  DOD Comptroller launched the FIAR Plan to guide improvements to  address financial management deficiencies and achieve clean financial  statement audit opinions. This plan incorporates our prior  recommendations and ties planned improvement activities at the  component and department levels together with accountable personnel,  milestones, and required resources. We view the incremental line item  approach, integration plans, and oversight structure outlined in the FIAR  plan for examining DOD\u2019s operations and preparing for an audit as a  significant improvement over prior financial improvement initiatives.  However, we continue to stress that the effectiveness of DOD\u2019s FIAR plan  will ultimately be measured by the department\u2019s ability to provide timely,  reliable, and useful information for day-to-day management and decision  making."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Modernizing Financial Management Systems", "paragraphs": ["Since the passage of the CFO Act and FFMIA, there has been progress in  achieving the financial systems requirements of these landmark laws.  While improvements have been made throughout government, much work  remains to fulfill the underlying goals of the CFO Act and FFMIA. In fiscal  year 1997, 20 agencies were reported as having systems that were not in  substantial compliance with at least one of the three FFMIA systems  requirements, while in fiscal year 2006, auditors for 17 of the CFO Act  agencies reported that the agencies\u2019 financial management systems did not  substantially comply with at least one of the three FFMIA requirements.  The major barrier to achieving compliance with FFMIA continues to be the  inability of agencies to meet federal financial management systems  requirements, which involve not only core financial systems, but also  administrative and programmatic systems. While the problems are much  more severe at some agencies than at others and progress has been made  in addressing financial management systems\u2019 weaknesses, the lack of  substantial compliance with the three requirements of FFMIA, and the  associated deficiencies, indicates that the financial management systems  of many agencies are still not able to routinely produce reliable, useful,  and timely financial information. Consequently, the federal government\u2019s  access to relevant, timely, and reliable data to effectively manage and  oversee its major programs, which is the ultimate objective, was and  continues to be restricted.", "What is most important is that the problem has been recognized. Across  government, agencies have efforts under way to implement new financial  management systems or to upgrade existing systems. Agencies expect that  the new systems will provide reliable, useful, and timely data to support  day-to-day managerial decision making and assist taxpayer and  congressional oversight. Whether in government or the private sector,  implementing and upgrading information systems is a difficult job and  brings a degree of new risk. Organizations that follow and effectively  implement accepted best practices in systems development and  implementation (commonly referred to as disciplined processes) can  manage and reduce these risks to acceptable levels. For example, as part  of our work at DOD, NASA, and other agencies that have experienced  significant problems in implementing new financial management systems,  we have consistently found that these agencies were not following the  necessary disciplined processes, human capital practices, and information  technology management practices for efficient and effective development  and implementation of such systems.", "Challenges also exist in implementing OMB\u2019s financial management line of  business initiative that is aimed at significantly improving the financial  data government managers need to make timely and successful decisions  and reduce the cost of government operations. For example, as we  reported in March 2006, the requirements for agencies and private sector  firms to become shared service providers and the services they must  provide have not been adequately documented or effectively  communicated to agencies and the private sector. We made several  recommendations that focused on reducing the risk of this important  initiative. During 2006, OMB addressed some of the weaknesses by issuing  an initial version of migration planning guidance and publishing  competition guidance for shared service providers and agencies. However,  as OMB acknowledged in the Federal Financial Management Report  2007, it has not yet developed several critical elements needed to  minimize risk, provide assurance, and develop understandings with  software vendors, shared service providers, and agencies on topics such as  standard business processes and common accounting codes. Further, a  governmentwide concept of operations has not been developed that would  identify interrelationships among federal financial systems and which  financial management systems should be operated at an agency level and  which should be operated at a governmentwide level and how those would  integrate. In addition, processes have not been put in place to facilitate  agency decisions on selecting a provider or focusing investment decisions  on the benefits of standard processes and shared service providers.", "Meeting the Challenge of Modernizing Financial Systems. As the federal  government moves forward with ambitious financial management system  modernization efforts that identify opportunities to eliminate redundant  systems and enhance information reliability and availability, adherence to  disciplined processes, sound human capital practices, and proven  information technology management practices is crucial to reduce risks to  acceptable levels.", "To help address the underlying problems agencies face in  implementing financial management systems that will help them  adhere to the requirements of the CFO Act and FFMIA, we have made  numerous specific recommendations to agencies to address the  specific shortcomings we identified.

Toward this end, we have  recommended that OMB develop such guidance to help minimize the  waste of scarce resources from modernization failures.", "We have also made a number of recommendations to OMB to help it  provide a solid foundation for the financial management line of  business initiative. OMB has projects under way to develop standard  business processes, a common accounting code, and specific measures  to assess the performance of the shared service providers to help  address some shortcomings we identified.

As we have reported  for a number of years in our audit reports on the U.S. government\u2019s  consolidated financial statements, the federal government continues to  have material weaknesses and reportable conditions in internal control  related to property, plant, and equipment; inventories and related  property; liabilities and commitments and contingencies; cost of  government operations; and disbursement activities, just to mention a few  of the problem areas. Particularly problematic to the U.S. government\u2019s  consolidated financial statements is the lack of internal controls to  adequately account for and reconcile intragovernmental activity and  balances between federal agencies. Although OMB and Treasury require  the CFOs of 35 executive departments and agencies to reconcile  intragovernmental activity and balances on a quarterly basis, and report  annually to GAO and others on reconciliation efforts at the end of the  fiscal year, a substantial number of agencies did not adequately perform  these reconciliations. To help address this problem, OMB worked with  Treasury and the CFO Council to revise the business rules for  intragovernmental transactions. Because these new rules became effective  on October 1, 2006, it is too soon to tell if they will have the desired effect  of strengthening internal controls. Resolving the intragovernmental  transactions problem remains a difficult challenge and will require a  strong commitment by agencies to fully implement the recently issued  business rules and continued strong leadership by OMB.", "As we testified in February 2005, we support OMB\u2019s efforts to revitalize  internal control assessments and reporting through the December 2004  revisions to Circular No. A-123. These revisions recognize that effective  internal control is critical to improving federal agencies\u2019 effectiveness and  accountability and to achieving the goals established by the Congress.  They also considered the internal control standards issued by GAO,  which provide an overall framework for establishing and maintaining  internal control and for identifying and addressing major performance and  management challenges and areas at greatest risk of fraud, waste, abuse,  and mismanagement. OMB reported in its Federal Financial Management  Report 2007, that CFO Act agencies identified new financial reporting  material weaknesses under this revised guidance, which is an important  first step. As agencies expand their assessments and all agencies complete  a full-scope assessment of internal control over financial reporting, they  will develop a better understanding of the full nature and extent of  material weaknesses.", "Effective internal control, as envisioned in the revised Circular No. A-123,  inherently includes a successful strategy for addressing improper  payments. Attacking improper payment problems requires a strategy  appropriate to the organization involved and its particular risks. We have  found that entities using successful strategies to address their improper  payment problems shared a common focus of improving the internal  control system\u2014the first line of defense in safeguarding assets and  preventing and detecting errors and fraud. The Congress acted strongly to  address the improper payment problem by passing IPIA and in fiscal year  2005, OMB began to separately track the elimination of improper  payments under the PMA. As I pointed out in testimony before this  Subcommittee in December 2006, while agencies are making progress in  reporting under IPIA, three major challenges remain in meeting the goals  of the act. First, the existing reporting was incomplete because some  agencies still had not instituted systematic methods to review all programs  and some program estimates were not based on a valid statistical sampling  methodology as required. Second, 10 risk-susceptible programs with  outlays totaling over $234 billion in fiscal year 2005 had not provided  improper payment estimates. Finally, OMB\u2019s implementing guidance  includes specific criteria that limit the disclosure and transparency of  agencies\u2019 improper payments.", "Meeting the Challenge of Addressing Internal Control Weaknesses.  Actions can be taken on several fronts to help resolve internal control  weaknesses.", "As pointed out in our February 2005 testimony on internal controls,  there are six issues critical to effectively implementing the changes to  Circular No. A-123\u2014specifically, the need for: (1) development of  supplemental guidance and implementation tools to help ensure that  agency efforts are properly focused and meaningful; (2) vigilance over  the broader range of controls covering program objectives; (3) strong  support from managers throughout the agency, and at all levels; (4)  risk-based assessments and an appropriate balance between the costs  and benefits of controls; (5) management testing of controls in  operation to assess if they are designed adequately and operating  effectively, and to assist in formulating corrective actions; and (6)  management accountability for control breakdowns.", "Addressing the multitude of problems in financial reporting internal  controls, including reconciling intragovernmental activity and balances,  that have been identified to date will require a significant effort over a  long time. Many of these problems have been around for years and  have proven resistant to actions to resolve them. Continuous  monitoring by top agency management and OMB along with oversight  by the Congress will be critical to successfully resolving these material  weaknesses and enhancing financial management.", "The ultimate success of efforts to reduce improper payments depends,  in part, on each agency\u2019s continuing diligence and commitment to  meeting the requirements of IPIA and the related OMB guidance. Full  and reasonable disclosure of the extent of the problems could be  enhanced by modifying the act\u2019s underlying criteria used to identify  which programs and activities are susceptible to significant improper  payments and we asked the Congress to consider amending IPIA to do  so. We also recommended that OMB\u2019s implementing guidance be  strengthened in several areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Building a Financial Management Workforce for the Future", "paragraphs": ["The financial management workforce plays a critical role in government  because the scale and complexity of federal activities requiring financial  management and control are monumental.

It has been clear from the outset that the  current administration is serious about improved financial management.  We have been fortunate that, since the passage of the CFO Act, all three  administrations have been supportive of financial management reform  initiatives. And, as I discussed earlier, we have seen a positive cultural  shift in the way the federal government conducts business. Given the long- term nature of the comprehensive changes needed and challenges still  remaining to fully realize the goals of the CFO Act, it is unlikely they will  all occur before the end of the current administration\u2019s term. Therefore,  sustaining a commitment to transformation in future administrations will  be critical to ensure that key management reforms, such as the CFO Act,  are fully attained.", "Changing the way business is done in a large, diverse, and complex  organization like the federal government is not an easy undertaking.  According to a survey of federal CFOs, federal finance organizations of  the future will have fewer people, with a greater percentage of analysts, as  opposed to accounting technicians. However, today most functions within  federal finance organizations are focused primarily on (1) establishing and  administering financial management policy; (2) tracking, monitoring, and  reconciling account balances; and (3) ensuring compliance with laws and  regulations. While they recognize the need for change, according to the  CFOs surveyed, many questions remain unanswered regarding how best to  facilitate such changes.", "When it comes to world-class financial management, our study of nine  leading private and public sector financial organizations found that leading  financial organizations often had the same or similar core functions (i.e.,  budgeting, treasury management, general accounting, and payroll) as the  federal government. However, the way these functions were put into  operation varied depending on individual entity needs. Leading  organizations reduced the number of resources required to perform  routine financial management activities by (1) consolidating activities at a  shared service center and (2) eliminating or streamlining duplicative or  inefficient processes. Their goal was not only to reduce the cost of finance  but also to organize finance to add value by reallocating finance resources  to more productive and results-oriented activities like measuring financial  performance, developing managerial cost information, and integrating  financial systems.", "The federal financial workforce that supports the business needs of today  is not well-positioned to support the needs of tomorrow.

A 2005 survey of senior level  federal CFO executives noted that the respondents still believed that mid-  and lower-level personnel lack the skills needed for modern financial  management. The 2005 survey indicated that the federal CFO community  thought that overly complex civil service rules made it difficult to recruit  entry-level talent and nearly impossible to hire middle managers from  outside the government. Our work has shown that staffing shortages,  particularly at key agencies such as DOD, DHS, and Treasury can  adversely impact financial management operations. For example, as part  of our work on the U.S. government\u2019s consolidated financial statements,  we found that personnel at Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Service had  excessive workloads that required an extraordinary amount of effort and  dedication to compile the consolidated financial statements and that there  were not enough personnel with specialized financial reporting experience  to help ensure reliable financial reporting by the reporting date.", "Meeting the Challenge of Building the Financial Management Workforce.  We have previously identified several factors that are critical to resolving  financial management human capital issues.", "Part of the commitment to transformation is the establishment of  skilled and sustained leadership through the creation of a chief  management officer (CMO) at selected federal agencies. The CMO  would serve as the strategic, enterprisewide integrator of efforts to  transform agency business operations, including financial management.  While we have called for the creation of such a position specifically at  DOD and DHS, in July 2006, a major global consulting firm  recommended that the concept of a chief operating officer be instituted  in many federal agencies as the means to help achieve the  transformation that many agencies have undertaken.", "Building a world-class financial workforce will require a workforce  transformation strategy devised in partnership between CFOs and  agency human resource departments, now established in law as Chief  Human Capital Officers, working with OMB and OPM. Agency financial  management leadership must identify current and future required  competencies and compare them to an inventory of skills, knowledge,  and current abilities of current employees. Then they must strategically  manage to fill gaps and minimize overages through informed hiring,  development, and separation strategies. This is similar to the approach  that we identified when we designated strategic human capital  management as a high-risk area in 2001. Achieving a successful  financial management vision of the future will be directly determined  by the workforce that supports it.

The lack of effective  internal controls to adequately account for and reconcile  intragovernmental activity and balances is another primary challenge that  impedes our ability to provide an opinion on the consolidated financial  statements.
