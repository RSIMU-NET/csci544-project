To illustrate these practices, we selected the Healthy People, wildland fire management, and Departments of Veterans Affairs and Defense's health resource sharing collaborations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Collaboration can be broadly defined as any joint activity that is intended to produce more public value than could be produced when the organizations act alone. Agencies can enhance and sustain their collaborative efforts by engaging in the eight practices identified below. Running throughout these practices are a number of factors such as leadership, trust, and organizational culture that are necessary elements for a collaborative working relationship: define and articulate a common outcome; establish mutually reinforcing or joint strategies; identify and address needs by leveraging resources; agree on roles and responsibilities; establish compatible policies, procedures, and other means to operate across agency boundaries; develop mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and report on results; reinforce agency accountability for collaborative efforts through agency plans and reports; and reinforce individual accountability for collaborative efforts through performance management systems. GAO has previously reported that GPRA, with its focus on strategic planning, the development of long-term goals, and accountability for results, provides a framework Congress, OMB, and executive branch agencies can use to consider the appropriate mix of long-term strategic goals and strategies needed to identify and address issues that cut across agency boundaries. In addition, to provide a broader perspective on the federal government's goals and strategies to address issues that cut across agencies, we previously recommended that (1) OMB develop a governmentwide performance plan as required by GPRA and (2) Congress consider amending GPRA to require a governmentwide strategic plan. OMB, through the President's Management Agenda (PMA), has emphasized improving government performance through governmentwide and agency-specific initiatives. One of these focuses specifically on improving coordination, but only between the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Defense for health programs and systems. However, many other areas that cut across agency boundaries would benefit from greater OMB focus and attention, including information sharing for homeland security, which GAO recently designated as a high-risk area. OMB has also used its Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) diagnostic tool to determine, among other things, whether individual programs duplicate other efforts and if agencies coordinate and collaborate effectively with related programs. The PART tool provides general guidance for assessing effective program coordination and collaboration, but does not discuss practices for enhancing and sustaining collaboration, such as those described and illustrated in this report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Achieving results for the nation increasingly requires that federal agencies  work together.

One such barrier stems from  missions that are not mutually reinforcing or that may even conflict,  making reaching a consensus on strategies and priorities difficult. Another  significant barrier to interagency collaboration is agencies\u2019 concerns about  protecting jurisdiction over missions and control over resources. Finally,  interagency collaboration is often hindered by incompatible procedures,  processes, data, and computer systems. Instead, federal agencies carry out  programs in a fragmented, uncoordinated way, resulting in a patchwork of  programs that can waste scarce funds, confuse and frustrate program  customers, and limit the overall effectiveness of the federal effort.", "To help agencies overcome these barriers, and in response to your request,  this report identifies key practices that can help enhance and sustain  federal agency collaboration, along with illustrative examples from select  agencies.

In either case, the  collaborative effort requires agency staff working across agency lines to  define and articulate the common federal outcome or purpose they are  seeking to achieve that is consistent with their respective agency goals and  mission. Moreover, the development of a common outcome takes place  over time and requires sustained resources and commitment.", "Following the authority provided in the Sharing Act, a number of VA and  DOD facilities have collaborated to achieve their common goals. VA Gulf  Coast Health Care System and the Naval Hospital Pensacola, for example,  collaborated to build a new joint ambulatory care clinic to improve the  quality, access, and efficiency of health care delivery for their respective  populations. The VA wanted to expand its medical facilities and increase  the type of medical services available in the area, as most beneficiaries  who needed specialty care were transported by the VA to Biloxi,  Mississippi, or New Orleans, Louisiana, adding to the cost of care. The  Navy, with several aging medical facilities, was facing a demand for  services from a growing population of retirees and students from the  cryptology school on the naval base. Over the course of nearly a year,  officials from the VA Gulf Coast Health Care System and the Naval  Hospital Pensacola, who had already shared medical services in the past,  agreed to build a joint ambulatory care center to provide closer and  expanded services as a way of improving access for both VA and Navy  populations. This agreement was formalized in a concept paper signed by  the director of VA Gulf Coast Health Care System and the Commanding  Officer of the Naval Hospital Pensacola.", "USDA and Interior\u2019s current collaboration in managing wildland fires  stemmed from the catastrophic wildland fires of 2000. The fires prompted  the President to request that the Secretaries of USDA and the Interior  develop a response to severe wildland fires, reduce their effects, and  ensure sufficient firefighting resources in the future. Additionally, the  conference committee report accompanying the fiscal year 2001 Interior  appropriations act directed the Secretaries to work with the relevant  Governors to develop a 10-year strategy for reducing wildland fire risk.  The Departments\u2019 response and conference committee direction resulted  in the National Fire Plan that included a collaborative approach for a 10- year strategy and implementation plan to reduce the risk of catastrophic  wildland fires.", "The fires in 2000 also led to a review of the 1995 federal fire policy, which  concluded that while the policy was sound and appropriate, the  implementation was incomplete, particularly where it involved  \u201ccollaboration, coordination, and integration across agency jurisdiction  and across different disciplines.\u201d As a result of the review, as well as  studies by the National Academy of Public Administration and GAO, USDA  and Interior established the Wildland Fire Leadership Council in 2002 to  provide leadership and oversight in implementing the National Fire Plan  and the federal fire policy. This interagency council, comprised of senior  USDA and Interior officials, federal, state, tribal, and county  representatives, including the heads of the five wildland fire agencies,  meets regularly to foster policy coordination and the resolution of  interagency differences.", "In the case of the Healthy People initiative, federal agencies, along with  state and local government agencies and nongovernmental organizations,  came together voluntarily to collaborate because they shared an overall  commitment to and responsibility for health promotion and disease  prevention. Recognizing that progress in improving the nation\u2019s health  required the active participation and leadership of this diverse array of  organizations, the collaboration has grown to over 600 organizations since  it began in 1988. Officials from several federal agencies with public health  responsibilities worked together to review and update as necessary the  Healthy People objectives. For example, the CDC, along with the  Department of Education\u2019s National Institute on Disability and  Rehabilitation Research, worked together to assess current public health  conditions and concluded that the health and well-being of people with  disabilities was an issue that could be better represented in the Healthy  People 2010 agenda. Scientific and technological advances, societal  attitudes, and labor market changes had redefined the extent to which  physical or mental conditions are disabling, and such changes should also  be reflected in the public health system. As a result of this collaborative  review, \u201cDisability and Secondary Conditions\u201d was included as a new  focus area for Healthy People 2010. The goal for this new focus area is to  \u201cpromote the health of people with disabilities, prevent secondary  conditions, and eliminate disparities between people with and without  disabilities.\u201d Specific objectives for this focus area include (1) establishing  a standardized operational definition for disability and collecting  information on people with disabilities, thereby enabling government  policymakers, researchers, and clinicians to make better-informed  decisions; (2) eliminating disparities in employment between working-age  adults with and without disabilities; and (3) increasing the proportion of  children and youth with disabilities in regular education programs.", "In defining and articulating a common outcome, where appropriate,  federal agencies should involve nonfederal partners, key clients, and  stakeholders. In doing so, federal agencies can better address their  interests and expectations and gain their support in achieving the  objectives of the collaboration. In developing the Healthy People 2010  objectives, HHS included as partners nonfederal organizations such as  state and local public health, mental health, and environmental agencies;  professional health groups; and health and recreation organizations.

According to NIFC, no single agency  is capable of providing the resources needed to respond to especially large  fires or to multiple concurrent fires. NIFC monitors the occurrence of  wildland fires and coordinates and mobilizes wildland firefighting  resources nationally to suppress those fires. Local and regional federal fire  centers unable to meet personnel, equipment, and supply needs contact  NIFC in Boise, Idaho. In response, NIFC provides certain resources and  requests others from the closest available federal agency.

Navy officials wanted the new clinic to be within  walking distance from the Center for Cryptology so students attending the  school could have easy access. At the same time, the Navy had concerns  that easy access to the base could expose the cryptology school, which is a  top secret facility, to unauthorized individuals. To address differences in  security standards, the VA and the Navy agreed to install a security fence  around the new clinic, creating an enclave within the naval base with a  separate entrance that is accessible from a public highway.", "The ability to work collaboratively requires mutual trust among the  respective parties\u2014a shared belief that the partners will carry out their  part of the joint agreement.

In particular, the mental health care line director\u2019s  performance agreement included improvement goals related to mental  health for the entire VISN. To make progress towards these goals, this care  line director had to work across each of the VISN\u2019s four medical centers  with the corresponding care line managers at each medical center. As part  of this collaboration, the care line director needed to establish consensus  among VISN officials and external stakeholders on the strategic direction  for the services provided by the mental health care line across the VISN;  develop, implement, and revise integrated clinical programs to reflect that  strategic direction for the VISN; and allocate resources among the centers  for mental health programs to implement these programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GPRA and OMB\u2019s Management Tools Offer Opportunities to Foster Greater Collaboration among Federal Agencies", "paragraphs": ["GPRA, with its focus on strategic planning, the development of long-term  goals, and accountability for results, provides a framework that Congress,  OMB, and executive branch agencies can use to consider the appropriate  mix of long-term strategic goals and strategies needed to identify and  address federal goals that cut across agency boundaries. For example, we  have previously reported that the strategic and annual performance  planning processes under GPRA provide opportunities for federal agencies  to identify other agencies addressing related outcomes, and coordinate  with these agencies to ensure that program goals are complementary;  strategies are mutually reinforcing; and, as appropriate, common  performance measures are used.", "OMB, as the focal point for overall management in the executive branch,  plays a key role in aligning the federal government\u2019s resources and  activities. To better manage the accomplishment of crosscutting policy  goals, we have recommended that OMB fully implement the GPRA  requirement to develop a governmentwide performance plan. A  governmentwide performance plan could provide a broader perspective of  the federal government\u2019s goals and strategies to address issues that cut  across different federal agencies, including redundancy and other  inefficiencies in how the government does its business.", "Moreover, we have recommended Congress amend GPRA to require a  governmentwide strategic plan to provide a framework for identifying  long-term goals and strategies for addressing crosscutting issues. A  strategic plan for the federal government, along with key national  indicators to assess the government\u2019s performance, could provide an  additional tool for governmentwide reexamination of existing programs,  as well as proposals for new programs.

According to OMB, the PMA was implemented to remedy  long-standing federal agency management and performance challenges.  The PMA consists of five governmentwide initiatives\u2014strategic  management of human capital, competitive sourcing, improved financial  performance, expanded electronic government, and budget and  performance integration. For each initiative, OMB has established goals or  \u201cstandards for success,\u201d and OMB rates agencies\u2019 status each quarter in  achieving the goals and making progress toward them. Additionally, the  PMA has nine agency-specific initiatives such as privatization of military  housing and reform of food aid programs, which OMB also rates  quarterly.", "Among the governmentwide initiatives in the PMA is the strategic  management of human capital. One of the standards for success for this  initiative is having performance appraisals and award programs for all  members of the SES and managers, as well as most of the workforce, that  effectively align with agency mission, goals, and outcomes and hold them  accountable for results. In addition, as stated earlier, high-performing  organizations can place greater emphasis on fostering necessary  collaboration to achieve results through their performance management  systems for all levels of employees. OMB and OPM have recognized this  strategic use of performance management and require SES members to be  held accountable for collaboration and teamwork across organizational  boundaries. However, the PMA standards do not include a similar focus  on collaboration and teamwork for managers and the rest of the  workforce, and thus miss an opportunity to reinforce to agencies that their  performance management systems are strategic tools to strengthen  accountability for results.", "One of the nine agency-specific initiatives focuses on improving  coordination of VA and DOD programs and systems to allow for the  seamless transition and continuity of care of beneficiaries from active duty  to veteran status. Apart from this case, however, our work has shown that  many issues cut across more than one agency and their actions are not  well coordinated. Therefore, such issues would benefit from the greater  attention and focus that PMA could provide. For example, information  sharing for securing the homeland is a governmentwide effort involving  multiple federal agencies, including OMB; DOD; the Departments of  Homeland Security, Justice, and State; and the Central Intelligence  Agency. We have recently highlighted this issue as a high-risk area in need  of broad-based transformation in order to facilitate information sharing  among and between government entities and the private sector. To do  this will require an extraordinary level of collaboration among the federal,  state, and local governments and the private sector.", "OMB developed PART as a diagnostic tool meant to provide a consistent  approach to assessing federal programs during the executive budget  formulation process. PART covers four broad topics for all programs  selected for review: (1) program purpose and design, (2) strategic  planning, (3) program management, and (4) program results. In  conducting PART assessments of federal agency programs, OMB  considers, among other things, whether the program coordinates and  collaborates effectively with related programs and whether duplication  exists. In addition, consistent with our recommendation, OMB has begun  to use the PART framework to conduct assessments of groups of  programs in similar areas that cut across agency boundaries. The PART  tool provides general guidance for assessing effective program  coordination and collaboration: to demonstrate effective collaboration,  agencies need to provide evidence of collaborative efforts \u201cleading to  meaningful actions in management and resource allocation\u201d\u2014for example,  a joint grant announcement, planning documents, or performance goals.  However, while these are important steps, as OMB recognizes, such  evidence alone does not demonstrate that meaningful collaboration has  occurred.", "Agency officials from each of the case study agencies we interviewed  agreed that OMB could play an effective role in fostering greater  collaboration among federal agencies. Some officials we interviewed  indicated that the PMA and PART tools were appropriate vehicles for  sharing the practices in this report. For example, an official stated that for  VA and DOD resource sharing, being singled out as a PMA initiative  provided a high level of visibility to the issue\u2014the additional attention  they have received by having a higher-level entity such as OMB focus on  the issue has been helpful in directing leadership attention and resources.
