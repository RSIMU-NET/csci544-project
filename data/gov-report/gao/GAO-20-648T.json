Thus, the military services are limited in their ability to identify disparities (i.e., instances in which a racial or ethnic group was overrepresented) in the military justice system. The military services were not required to, and thus did not, report demographic information that would provide greater visibility into potential disparities in their annual military justice reports.", "GAO's analysis of available data identified disparities in how likely servicemembers of different races were to be subjects of investigations recorded in military criminal investigative organization databases and tried in general and special courts-martial in particular. For example, in three military services, Black servicemembers were about twice as likely as White servicemembers to be tried in general and special courts-martial. Racial disparities generally were not present in convictions or punishments. These findings show an association for disparities at particular stages of the military justice process, but are inconclusive regarding other stages. However, GAO's findings of racial disparities, taken alone, do not establish whether unlawful discrimination has occurred, as that is a legal determination that would involve other corroborating information and supporting statistics.", "Note: These analyses, taken alone, should not be used to make conclusions about the presence of unlawful discrimination. These multivariate regression analysis results estimate whether a racial group is more likely or less likely to be the subject of an investigation or a trial in general or special courts-martial after controlling for race, gender, rank, and education, and in the Air Force, years of service. GAO made all racial comparisons to White servicemembers, and grouped individuals of Hispanic ethnicity together, regardless of race. The Other race category includes individuals who identified as American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, and multiple races.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken some steps to study disparities but has not comprehensively evaluated the causes of racial disparities in the military justice system. Doing so would better position DOD to identify actions to address disparities and to help ensure the military justice system is fair and just."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO made 11 recommendations in prior work, including that the military services develop the capability to present consistent race and ethnicity data, and DOD and the Coast Guard include demographic information in military justice annual reports and evaluate the causes of disparities.

Continued attention is needed to ensure that the remainder of these recommendations are addressed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for providing me with the opportunity to discuss GAO\u2019s  findings and recommendations about racial disparities in the military  justice system. Recent events, such as the killings of Ahmaud Arbery  and George Floyd, have raised public awareness and activism about  racial bias. Although those cases did not involve military personnel, these  concerns about racial bias carry over to the military justice system. The  Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) was established to provide the  statutory framework of the military criminal justice system. The UCMJ  contains articles that punish traditional crimes such as unlawful drug use  and assault as well as unique military offenses including desertion, failure  to obey orders or regulations, and misbehavior before the enemy, among  others. The Military Justice Review Group elaborated on the purpose of  the UCMJ, stating that its current structure and practice embodies a  single overarching principle: a system of military law can foster a highly  disciplined force if it is fair and just, and is recognized as such by both  members of the armed forces and by the American public. Every active- duty servicemember of the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air  Force, and the Coast Guard is subject to the UCMJ, with more than  258,000 individuals disciplined from fiscal years 2013-2017, out of more  than 2.3 million unique active-duty servicemembers.", "In response to a provision in House Report 115-200, accompanying a bill  for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, in May  2019, we issued a report that focused on differences in information the  military services collect about the race and gender of servicemembers  convicted of violations of the UCMJ as well as the extent that disparities  may exist in the military justice system. My statement today is based on  that report and addresses (1) the collection of race and ethnicity  information in the military services\u2019 investigations, military justice, and  personnel databases, (2) the extent of racial disparities in investigations,  disciplinary actions, and case outcomes in the military justice system, and  (3) steps taken by DOD and the military services to study any identified  disparities. Our full report also discusses reporting of data that provides  visibility into disparities challenges in other areas, such as gender  disparities and collection of gender information.", "For our May 2019 report, to assess the collection of race and ethnicity  information in the military services\u2019 investigations, military justice, and  personnel databases, we interviewed agency officials and reviewed  service guidance, user manuals, and other documentation. Our review  identified the types of data officials are required to collect and to maintain,  as well as internal procedures the military services follow to input  information about race and ethnicity into these databases. We analyzed  the data we received from the investigations, military justice, and  personnel databases to determine the completeness of the race and  ethnicity information recorded in each of the databases.", "To assess the extent of racial disparities in investigations, disciplinary  actions, and case outcomes in the military justice system, we analyzed  military justice actions initiated and recorded in each military service\u2019s  investigations, military justice, and personnel databases between fiscal  years 2013 through 2017\u2014the most recent data available at the time of  our review. To prepare the data for our analyses and to help ensure that  we had consistent profiles for the race and ethnicity of servicemembers,  we merged records using unique identifiers, such as a social security  number or a DOD employee identification number, that were common  among a particular military service\u2019s databases. Based on discussions  with service officials, we treated the personnel databases as the  authoritative sources for servicemembers\u2019 demographic and  administrative data.", "In addition, as part of our data preparation, we consolidated the various  race and ethnicity values in the service personnel databases to the five  groups for race and the two groups for ethnicity established by Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) standards. When military service  personnel databases included different or additional possible options for  race and ethnicity than the groups established by the OMB standards, we  consolidated the options in accordance with the definitions for each race  and ethnicity option listed in the OMB standards. We grouped individuals  of Hispanic ethnicity together, regardless of their racial identification, so  that we could compare those of Hispanic ethnicity to other racial groups.  Throughout this statement, we refer to the combined race and ethnicity  values as race.", "We conducted multivariate regression analyses to test the association  between servicemember characteristics, such as race and ethnicity, and  the odds of a military justice action. Our multivariate regression analyses  controlled for attributes such as race, gender, rank, years of service, and  education. We conducted data reliability assessments on the datasets we  received from the databases in our review. We examined the  documentation related to the databases, conducted electronic tests on  the data we received, and discussed data reliability with database  managers. We found the variables we ultimately reported on to be  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our analysis.", "Our analyses of these data, taken alone, do not establish whether  unlawful discrimination has occurred, as that is a legal determination that  would involve other corroborating information along with supporting  statistics. Further, we did not identify the causes of any racial disparities,  and the results of our work alone should not be used to make conclusions  about the military justice process.", "To assess the extent to which disparities in the military justice system had  been studied by DOD, we conducted a literature review, reviewed prior  GAO reports, and asked DOD and service officials to identify publications  relevant to disparities in military justice. We reviewed those publications  that assessed racial, ethnic, or gender disparities among servicemembers  in the military justice system. More detailed information on our objectives,  scope, and methodology for our prior work can be found in the issued  report.", "We conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Each of these types of military courts  respectively is intended to deal with progressively more serious offenses,  and each court-martial type may adjudicate more severe maximum  punishments as prescribed under the UCMJ. In addition, an accused  servicemember can receive nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of  the UCMJ, by which a commander can punish a servicemember without  going through the court-martial process.", "There are several steps in the discipline of a servicemember who  allegedly commits a crime under the UCMJ, which are summarized in  figure 1 below.", "The military justice process begins once an offense is alleged and an  initial report is made, typically to law enforcement, an investigative entity,  or the suspect\u2019s chain of command. The commanding officer, law  enforcement, or a military criminal investigative organization (MCIO) will  conduct an inquiry or investigation into the accusation and gather all  reasonably available evidence. Investigations are recorded in MCIO  databases when a servicemember is the subject of a criminal allegation;  for the purposes of our report, we say the servicemember had a  \u201crecorded investigation\u201d to describe these cases. Following an  investigation, the first step toward initiation of a court-martial is when the  accused is presented with a list of charges signed by the accuser under  oath, which is called preferral of charges. After charges are preferred, the  charges are forwarded to an officer with sufficient legal authority to  convene a court-martial, also known as the \u201cconvening authority.\u201d The  convening authority in receipt of preferred charges may, among other  actions, refer the case to its own court or forward the case to a superior  commander for disposition. Once referred to a general or special court- martial, an accused servicemember may be tried by a military judge alone  or by a military judge with a military jury. In summary courts-martial, a  single commissioned officer who is not a military judge adjudicates minor  offenses and a sentence. Convictions at the general and special court- martial level are subject to a post-trial process and may be appealed to  higher courts in cases where the sentence reaches a certain threshold.", "The military justice system, like the civilian criminal justice system,  provides avenues for accused servicemembers to raise allegations of  discrimination, improprieties in investigations, improprieties in disposition,  and improprieties in the selection of the military jury at the court-martial  proceeding, before a judge and on appellate review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Military Services Do Not Collect, Maintain, and Report Consistent Information about Race and Ethnicity, Limiting the Ability to Assess Data to Identify Any Disparities", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Military Services Do Not Collect and Maintain Consistent Data for Race and Ethnicity", "paragraphs": ["The military services do not collect and maintain consistent information  regarding race and ethnicity in their investigations, military justice, and  personnel databases.

The Coast  Guard did not track information about race or ethnicity in its military  justice database, Law Manager. Coast Guard officials stated that this is  because Law Manager was designed to determine the status of court- martial cases, and captures attributes that are needed to generate  relevant UCMJ documents, such as court pleadings. Demographic  information such as race and ethnicity is not included in these official  documents, so this information is not input into Law Manager. Further,  four of the databases we reviewed\u2014including both of the Army\u2019s military  justice databases, and the Navy and the Marine Corps\u2019 military justice  databases\u2014collect information on race and ethnicity in a combined data  field as shown in table 2 above, whereas the other databases collect and  maintain race and ethnicity information in two separate fields.

To address  these inconsistencies, in our May 2019 report, we made four separate  recommendations to each of the military departments and to the  Secretary of Homeland Security for the Coast Guard. We recommended  that these entities develop the capability to present servicemembers\u2019 race  and ethnicity data in their investigations and personnel databases using  the same categories of race and ethnicity established in the uniform  standards for the military justice databases that were issued in December  2018. As part of these uniform standards, the military services were  directed to collect data related to race and ethnicity in their military justice  databases, to collect race and ethnicity data in separate data fields, and  to standardize the reporting of the data into categories identified in the  standards. However, DOD applied these December 2018 standards  only to the military justice databases and not to the investigations and  personnel databases. DOD officials stated that the investigations and  personnel databases do not fall under the charter of the DOD General  Counsel, which issued the standards for the military justice databases.", "DOD and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) concurred with  these four recommendations. As of October 2019, officials from each of  the military departments said that they were working to implement the  uniform standards for race and ethnicity and the ability to aggregate the  data, and they expected to implement these categories in December  2020.

We made that change before the  report was issued.", "In October 2019, DOD officials said that the department was exploring the  feasibility of conducting a research project to delve into the differences in  military justice data to inform implementation of this recommendation. At  that time, they estimated that this research might be concluded in March  2021. In December 2019, the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2020 included a provision directing the Secretary of Defense  to conduct an evaluation consistent with our recommendation. DOD was  directed to commence or carry out these activities by June 2020. We  believe that conducting a comprehensive analysis into the causes of  disparities in the military justice system, would better position DOD and  the military services to identify actions to address disparities, and thus  help ensure that the military justice system is fair and just, a key principle  of the UCMJ.", "In conclusion, our analysis of available data identified racial disparities in  all of the military services for servicemembers with recorded  investigations, and for four of the military services for trials in special and  general courts-martial, but these disparities generally were not present in  the convictions or punishments of cases. These findings show an  association for disparities at particular stages of the military justice  process, but are inconclusive regarding other stages for the period  covered by our analysis. However, our findings of racial disparities, taken  alone, do not establish whether unlawful discrimination has occurred, as  that is a legal determination that would involve other corroborating  information along with supporting statistics. The absence of complete  nonjudicial punishment data in the Army, the Navy, and the Coast Guard  limits their visibility into the vast majority of legal punishments imposed on  servicemembers under the UCMJ every year. Without such data, these  three military services will remain limited in their ability to assess or  identify disparities among populations subject to this type of punishment.", "Our May 2019 report included several recommendations with specific  actions that can be taken to better position DOD and the military services  to identify and address disparities, such as (1) developing the capability to  present race and ethnicity data from the military services\u2019 personnel and  investigations databases using the same categories as the military justice  databases; (2) establishing criteria to determine when possible disparities  among racial or ethnic groups should be further reviewed, and describing  the steps that should be taken in such a review; and, importantly, (3)  conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the causes of these disparities  and taking steps to address them. To help build confidence that DOD is  committed to a military justice system that is fair and just, and for the  system of military law to be recognized as fair and just by both members  of the armed forces and by the American public, DOD and the military  services need to take actions to address these recommendations.", "Madam Chairwoman Speier, Ranking Member Kelly, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
