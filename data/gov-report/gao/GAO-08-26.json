To date, debate has focused primarily on the potential impact on retirees, with less attention to the effects on other Social Security recipients, such as disabled workers and dependents. As these beneficiaries may have fewer alternative sources of income than traditional retirees, there has been interest in considering various options to protect the benefits of disabled workers and certain dependents. This report examines (1) how certain elements of Social Security reform proposals could affect disability and dependent benefits, (2) options for protecting these benefits and how they might affect disabled workers and dependents, and (3) how protecting benefits could affect the Social Security program. To conduct this study, GAO used a microsimulation model to simulate benefits under various reform scenarios. GAO also interviewed experts and reviewed various reform plans, current literature, and GAO's past work."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["We considered several reform elements that could improve Social Security Trust Fund solvency by reducing the initial benefits received or the growth of individual benefits over time. According to our simulations, these reform elements would reduce median lifetime benefits for disabled workers by up to 27 percent and dependents by up to 30 percent of currently scheduled levels. While the size of the benefit reduction could vary across individuals, it could be substantial for the vast majority of these beneficiaries, depending upon the reform element. Options for protecting the benefits of disabled workers and dependents from the impact of reform elements include, among others, a partial exemption, whereby currently scheduled benefits are maintained until retirement age. For example, while simulations showed that one reform element could decrease median lifetime benefits of disabled workers to about 89 percent of currently scheduled levels, a partial exemption could restore them to about 96 percent. Further, these protections could be more targeted. For example, a larger cost of living adjustment would result in more rapid benefit growth for those disabled workers who receive benefits for a prolonged period of time. Some protections for dependent benefits could be targeted to a single group of dependents, such as widows, while others could affect multiple groups. For example, increasing the maximum benefit a family can receive could protect a wider group of beneficiaries, including children and spouses of disabled workers, and disabled adult children. While it may be desirable to protect the benefits of disabled workers and certain dependents, such protections would come at a cost to Social Security. Protecting benefits could lessen the impact that a reform element would have on solvency. In addition, such protections could create incentives to apply for Disability Insurance, if disability benefits remained stable while retirement benefits were reduced."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Social Security forms the foundation of retirement income, providing old  Social Security forms the foundation of retirement income, providing old  age benefits to millions of Americans.

We then estimated the  percentage of disabled workers and dependents whose benefits would be  affected by certain reform elements by simulating the outcome for a  sample of workers born in 1985, using a microsimulation model. We also  used data from this model to analyze the difference in both median and  total lifetime benefits between currently scheduled benefits and those  under each reform element. Rather than consider the distribution of  benefits across recipients, we show the impact of reform and protections  on median benefits. This approach provides a snapshot of how the reforms  would affect individuals in each target group (disabled workers and  dependents). In addition, when we consider total lifetime benefits, we are  able to examine the extent to which individuals are affected. While  scheduled benefits are not attainable under current funding levels, they  nevertheless provide us with a point of comparison in examining the  impact of various reform elements. To identify options for protecting  disabled worker and dependent benefits, we reviewed the current  literature and our past work and interviewed relevant experts. To  determine how these protections would affect both disability and  dependent benefits, we analyzed the change in median lifetime benefits  given various reform elements and different protections, using the  microsimulation model, as well as some qualitative analysis. Finally, to  determine the impact that protecting benefits could have on the Social  Security program itself, we interviewed relevant experts, reviewed the  literature, and conducted a qualitative analysis of the issues involved.  Throughout our analysis, we assume that the Disability Insurance (DI)  program maintains its current operational structure in terms of disability  determination, although GAO has recommended certain measures that  Social Security should take to modernize the program and its  administration.

Although the majority of Social Security benefits are paid to  retirees, Social Security does much more than provide retirement income.  Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) pays monthly cash benefits to  nearly 7 million workers who, due to a severe long-term disability, can no  longer remain in the workforce. Additionally, Social Security provides  benefits to over 11 million dependents, including payments to widows and  widowers as well as surviving parents and children under Survivors\u2019  Insurance (SI), plus benefits to dependent spouses and children of retired  and disabled workers paid from the Old Age Insurance (or Old Age) and DI  trust funds. Social Security benefits often represent a significant source of  income for their recipients, providing an average of $1,051 a month (as of  July 2007) to retired workers, $995 a month to widows and widowers, and  $979 a month to disabled workers. Although disabled workers and  dependents receive slightly lower average monthly benefits than retired  workers, benefits could be particularly important to these individuals.  These beneficiaries may face considerable hardships; for example, a  disabling condition may make work and other activities of daily living  more difficult. As a result, these beneficiaries may have financial  difficulties planning and preparing for death or disability in the way one  might plan for retirement. Social Security was never intended to provide  an adequate income by itself, but instead serves as an income base on  which to build. In fact, the Social Security program balances the goals of  income adequacy with individual equity, i.e., that lower income  beneficiaries should receive higher benefits relative to wages than higher  income beneficiaries (adequacy), and beneficiaries with higher lifetime  income receive higher benefits in accordance with their income/lifetime  contributions (equity)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "History and Development of DI and Dependents\u2019 Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Although Social Security had originally been envisioned to include  disability and survivors\u2019 insurance, the 1935 Social Security Act created  only a retirement program. Over the next 40 years, the program expanded  both the size and type of its benefits, introducing benefits for dependents  and disabled workers (fig. 2). The first new type of benefits went to  dependents, as the 1939 amendments offered payments to elderly  dependent wives and widows, as well as dependent children. (Some  husbands and widowers were allowed to receive these same benefits after  1950). Creating these benefits was not only seen as socially desirable, but  also offered additional protections for workers and their families from risk  and spent down surpluses created by the system. Disability Insurance,  which had been recommended by the 1938 and 1948 advisory councils,  was established in 1956 to provide cash benefits to permanently disabled  workers over the age of 50. The DI program was later expanded to include  disabled workers under the age of 50 as well. In 1961, widows benefits  increased from 75 to 85 percent of their deceased spouse\u2019s benefits, and  then to 100 percent in 1972. In addition, eligibility was extended to  divorced spouses as well as to the spouses and children of disabled  workers. Furthermore, benefit levels for retirees, dependents, and  disabled worker beneficiaries grew during this time period. However,  facing solvency crises, legislative efforts to control the size of the Social  Security program were made in the mid 1970s and early 1980s.", "In order to maintain trust fund solvency, major changes were enacted to  reduce the growth of Social Security benefit levels from the mid1970s to  the early 1980s. Additionally, a number of legislative changes to the DI and  dependents\u2019 programs eliminated or reduced certain benefits and  tightened the eligibility standards for receiving other benefits. However,  despite ongoing fiscal concerns, eligibility for a few dependents\u2019 and  disability benefits has been expanded since 1975, suggesting an interest in  protecting some vulnerable populations who may rely on Social Security  for a significant portion of their monthly income. Although recent reform  proposals have focused on elements intended to improve solvency, there  continues to be some interest in protecting some or all DI and dependents\u2019  benefits from potential benefit reductions. Figure 3 shows how Old Age,  Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) has grown financially and in  terms of beneficiaries over time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Development of a Single Benefit Formula", "paragraphs": ["Although the 1935 act did not provide for disability and dependents\u2019  benefits, those benefits were later built upon the existing Social Security  structure, and today all benefits continue to be calculated from a common  formula. Dependents\u2019 benefit levels were set as fractions of the benefits  owed to the person upon whom beneficiaries depended. For example,  under the 1939 legislation, a widow would receive 75 percent of her  deceased husband\u2019s benefits, and dependent children or spouses would  receive 50 percent of the retired worker\u2019s benefits. When Congress created  the DI program in 1956, it provided a lower retirement age (50) for those  who were permanently and totally disabled. The same benefit formula  used in computing OASI benefits was adopted for disability benefits  because the original DI program treated disabled workers as being forced  into premature retirement. In 1960, when Congress expanded the DI  program by eliminating the requirement that disabled workers had to be  50 years old, the same benefit formula applied. Because benefit types  shared a common formula, automatic indexing provisions implemented in  1972 and 1977 applied across the board.", "The OASDI programs are tightly linked in other ways as well. These  programs are financed through a common mechanism\u2014payroll taxes;  receipts from the payroll tax are deposited into the OASI and DI trust  funds which, like the two programs, are separate but often combined in  discussion and analysis of Social Security\u2019s solvency and sustainability.  Furthermore, beneficiaries can receive multiple types of benefits over  their lifetimes, moving into, out of, and among Social Security programs at  different life stages. When disabled workers reach the full retirement age  (FRA), for example, they begin to receive retirement benefits from the Old  Age program, in place of DI benefits; the common benefit formula keeps  such individuals\u2019 benefit levels stable. In another case, a recent widow(er)  might have her (or his) retirement or spousal benefits replaced with  survivors\u2019 benefits based on the relative earnings of the deceased spouse.  Because parents, children, or spouses may be eligible for dependents\u2019  benefits through the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance  programs, a person can collect several types of Social Security benefits  over a lifetime, although generally not simultaneously.

For those who receive retirement benefits,  this earnings history is generally based on the 40 years in which credited  earnings were highest, with the 5 lowest-earning years dropped out  (leaving the highest 35 years of indexed earnings to be included in the  initial benefit calculation). Dependents\u2019 benefit levels are determined as a  given percentage of Old Age benefit levels. Eligible children and spouses  can receive up to 50 percent of a worker\u2019s benefit; widow(er)s can be  given up to 100 percent; and surviving parents or children can collect up to  75 percent, subject to a family maximum.", "DI benefits are calculated similarly to Old Age benefits, but are generally  based upon a shortened work history. (For more detail on how benefits  are calculated, refer to app. II.) To be eligible for benefits, individuals must  have a specified number of recent work credits under Social Security  when they first become disabled. Individuals must also demonstrate the  inability to engage in substantial gainful activity by reason of a physical or  mental impairment that has lasted or is expected to last for twelve  continuous months or to result in death. If not eligible on medical grounds,  SSA must also consider age, education and past work history.  In  particular, medical eligibility criteria for DI are less stringent for  applicants over the age of 55.", "Based on prior work, GAO has designated modernizing federal disability  programs (including the DI program) as a high risk area because of  challenges that continue today. For example, GAO found that federal  disability programs remain grounded in outmoded concepts that equate  medical conditions with work incapacity. While SSA has taken some  actions in response to prior GAO recommendations, GAO continues to  believe that SSA should continue to take a lead role in examining the  fundamental causes of program problems and seek the regulatory and  legislative solutions needed to modernize its programs so that they are  aligned with the current state of science, medicine, technology, and labor  market conditions. Moreover, SSA should continue to develop and  implement strategies to better manage the programs\u2019 accuracy, timeliness,  and consistency of decision making.", "Social Security\u2019s Financing  Social Security is currently financed primarily on a pay-as-you-go basis, in  which payroll tax contributions of current workers are used primarily to  pay for current benefits. Since the mid1980s, the Social Security program  has collected more in taxes than it has paid out in benefits. However,  because of the retirement of the baby boomers coupled with increases in  life expectancy, and decreases in the fertility rate, this situation will soon  reverse itself. According to the Social Security Administration\u2019s 2007  intermediate assumptions, annual cash surpluses are predicted to turn  into ever-growing cash deficits beginning in 2017. Absent changes to the  program, these deficits are projected to deplete the Social Security DI trust  fund in 2026 and the OASI trust fund in 2042, leaving the combined system  unable to pay full benefits by 2041. Reductions in benefits, increases in  revenues, or a combination of both will likely be needed to restore long- term solvency. A number of proposals have been made to restore fiscal  solvency to the program, and many include revenue enhancements, benefit  reductions, or structural changes such as the introduction of individual  accounts as a part of Social Security. Because many reforms to the benefit  side of the equation would reduce benefits through changes in the benefit  formula, they could affect DI and dependents\u2019 benefits as well as Old Age  benefits. Unless accompanied by offsets or protections, these reforms  might reduce the income of disabled workers and dependents. This  situation could be challenging for these beneficiaries as they may have  relatively low incomes or higher health care costs and rely heavily on  Social Security income. Many disabled workers and dependents may also  have trouble taking on additional work and accumulating more savings  and, thus, have difficulty preparing for Social Security benefit reductions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Certain Benefit- Reducing Reform Elements Could Have a Substantial Impact on Disabled Workers and Dependents", "paragraphs": ["Many reform elements could have a substantial impact on the benefits of  Social Security recipients, including those of disabled workers and  dependents.

Such indexing  would maintain relatively comparable levels of lifetime benefits across  birth years by proportionally reducing the replacement factors in the  initial benefit formula.", "Price indexing would maintain purchasing power while slowing the  growth of initial benefits. This would be accomplished by indexing  initial benefits to the growth in prices rather than wages, as wages tend  to increase faster than prices.", "Progressive price indexing, a form of price indexing, would control  costs while protecting the benefits of those beneficiaries at the lowest  earnings levels (in terms of career average earnings). It would continue  to index initial benefit levels to wages for those below a certain  earnings threshold and employ a graduated combination of price  indexing and wage indexing for those above this threshold.  Increasing the number of years used in the benefit calculation would  also control program costs. For example, initial benefits could be based  on the highest 40, rather than 35, years of indexed earnings. This could  be done either by eliminating the 5 years normally excluded from the  calculation or by increasing the total number of years factored in from  40 to 45 years. In either of these cases, the initial Old Age benefit would  be calculated using the highest 40 years of indexed earnings.

Increasing the full retirement age would improve solvency by generally  increasing the number of years worked, reducing the number of years  benefits are received and increasing revenue to the system through  payroll taxes in the additional years worked. Further, those who retire  early would have their benefits actuarially reduced.", "Though it would not generally affect initial benefit amounts, a change  to Social Security\u2019s cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) could also control  costs and improve solvency by limiting the growth of an individual\u2019s  benefits over time. The COLA adjusts benefits to account for inflation  by indexing benefits to price growth annually, using the Consumer  Price Index (CPI). Setting the COLA below the CPI would limit the  nominal growth of an individual\u2019s benefits over time, and as such  those who receive benefits for a prolonged period of time would see  the largest reductions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most of the Social Security Reform Elements We Considered Would Reduce Benefits for Virtually All Beneficiaries", "paragraphs": ["According to our projections for the 1985 cohort, four of the five reform  elements that we analyzed would reduce total lifetime benefits for more  than three-quarters of disabled workers and dependents, relative to  currently scheduled benefits.

For  three of the elements\u2014reducing the COLA by one percentage point, price  indexing and progressive price indexing\u2014the percentage of disabled  workers affected is very similar to the percentage of dependents affected.  Moreover, for these three reform elements, more than 99 percent, or  virtually all, disabled workers and dependents would see their benefits  reduced. In contrast, progressive price indexing differs from other reform  elements in its impact: fewer beneficiaries are affected, and the percentage  of disabled workers affected varies from that of dependents. While an  estimated 87 percent of dependents would experience a reduction in  lifetime benefits under progressive price indexing, an estimated 77 percent  of disabled workers would do so.", "While the COLA reduction, longevity indexing and price indexing are all  designed in such a way that they affect virtually all beneficiaries, the  COLA, which has a greater impact on solvency than longevity indexing,  affects relatively fewer disabled workers and dependents. This is because  the COLA reduction would first affect benefits one year after the initial  benefit payment was made, whereas both longevity indexing and price  indexing affect the initial benefit amount.

Since dependent benefits are linked to those of the primary  worker, an increase in the full retirement age could shorten the period of  time over which they both receive benefits. Alternatively, some workers  may decide not to adjust their retirement plans in response to the increase  in the FRA. Those who maintain their original retirement plans, retiring  prior to the new FRA, will also receive reduced benefits relative to current  law. (See app. II for a discussion of how benefits are adjusted for early  retirement.) Thus, under both scenarios, total lifetime benefits would be  reduced, and so, too, would median lifetime benefits. A similar outcome  results from increasing the number of computation years by which initial  benefits are calculated.

In addition, a super COLA could help protect the benefits of  disabled workers and dependents.

For example,  a number of proposals have called for increasing the percentage of the  worker\u2019s benefit that widow(er)s receive. Another option that could  protect the benefits of a wide range of dependents would be to raise the  maximum benefit that families can receive based on one worker\u2019s earnings  record. Other protection options, such as caregiver credits, could focus on  protecting particular groups of dependents. Several reform proposals  have, in fact, called for providing caregiver credits to individuals who  spend time out of the workforce to care for their dependents or to those  with reduced or low earnings while attending to care-giving  responsibilities. Some proposals assign caregivers a specified level of  earnings for each year the caregiver received zero or low earnings  compared to prior years. Other proposals exclude zero-earning care years  from the initial benefit calculation. Another option specific to a certain  type of dependent would be to increase benefits for aged survivors, since  they are more likely to rely on Social Security to stay out of poverty and  could have fewer opportunities, such as returning to work, to respond to  benefit-reducing reforms.", "Increasing the early retirement age could offer some protection for  survivors. If the early retirement age were raised\u2014for example, from 62 to  64\u2014then workers who take early retirement would receive actuarially  adjusted benefits for a shorter period of time under the new early  retirement age, and thus their monthly benefits would be relatively higher  than the monthly benefits they would have received if they had retired at  the current early retirement age. Since a dependent\u2019s benefit is linked to  the worker\u2019s initial benefit amount, an increase in the worker\u2019s benefit  would also increase the dependent\u2019s benefit, mitigating some of the  negative effects of other reforms. Similarly, raising the FRA coupled with a  partial exemption from a benefit reduction could offer some additional  protection for disabled worker benefits. With an increase in the FRA,  disabled workers would receive (exempted) DI benefits for a longer  period of time because the age at which their disability benefits are  converted to retiree benefits would rise with the new FRA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Benefit Protections Could Restore Benefits to Levels near Those Scheduled under Current Law", "paragraphs": ["In general, the reform elements we examined reduce median lifetime  benefits for disabled workers and dependents. Because disabled workers  may not have the financial resources\u2014especially earnings related  income\u2014to adjust to benefit reductions, we explored the interaction of  reform elements and certain options to offset them.", "According to our projections, protections from a reduction in the COLA  could restore benefits of disabled workers to levels close to those  scheduled under current law. Reducing the COLA by one percentage point  would result in about a 10 percent decrease in median lifetime benefits for  workers who become disabled before age 60. To offset such a decrease,  they could be partially or fully exempted. With a COLA reduction, a partial  exemption would mean that the Social Security Administration would  increase a disabled worker\u2019s benefits annually as scheduled under current  law (i.e., using the full COLA) until the worker reached the full retirement  age. At that point, the disabled worker\u2019s benefits would grow annually by  the reduced COLA (1 percentage point lower than what it would be under  current law). Our projections showed that a partial exemption as  described above would raise median lifetime benefits from their reduced  levels by 7 percent (up to 96 percent of scheduled levels under current  law). In contrast, a full exemption would allow annual COLA adjustments  in line with current law until death (fig. 8).", "In addition to a decrease in the COLA, we analyzed options for protecting  the benefits of disabled workers under three reform elements that have an  impact on the initial benefit amount a disabled worker receives\u2014price  indexing, longevity indexing, and progressive price indexing. There are  several protection options for mitigating the effects of these reform  elements, including full and partial exemptions. In the case of price  indexing initial benefits, we projected that the median lifetime benefits of  disabled workers would be about 75 percent of the median benefits under  current law (fig. 9). A full exemption for disabled workers would raise the  benefits of those disabled workers who exclusively receive DI benefits to  the currently scheduled levels. However, a partial exemption from price  indexing would restore the median lifetime benefit to 89 to 90 percent of  scheduled levels, depending on how the partial exemption is  implemented. One type of partial exemption (Type I) uses price indexing  to calculate the portion of the benefits based on the years a person is out  of the workforce and receiving DI benefits. In contrast, the other type of  partial exemption (Type II) uses wage indexing to cover the same time  period. (For more details, please see app. I.) The difference between the  two partial exemptions becomes more substantial the earlier one becomes  disabled, as the difference between wages and prices increases over time.   While offering some protection from benefit reductions, both types of  partial exemptions involve a recalculation of benefits at the full retirement  age.  This recalculation would result in lower benefits for the DI recipient  and could create a potential problem if that individual relied on the prior  benefit amount and had limited options for replacing the lost income. (See  figs. 10 and 11 for longevity indexing and progressive price indexing,  respectively.)", "Another protection option would be to allow disability benefits to grow at  a greater rate than other benefits. For example, disabled workers could be  explicitly included in the scope of the reform, and receive reduced initial  benefits. However, instead of receiving annual increases based on the  current-law COLA, disabled workers could have their benefits increased  by a \u201csuper COLA\u201d\u2014one that is set above the Consumer Price Index. In  this case, benefits for the disabled would grow at a faster rate than they  would under current law and could approach or even exceed current law  levels. Variations on the super-COLA could include an \u201cage-indexed super  COLA\u201d which would be greater for those disabled at younger ages. For  those workers who become disabled near the full retirement age the COLA  would be closer to that used for retirees.

The circumstances around which a person becomes a  dependent vary greatly, as does the role of Social Security benefits in their  lives. For some, Social Security may be the primary source of support; for  others, it may be only a small proportion of their income.", "Protections could target children, who make up about 8 percent of Social  Security beneficiaries, receiving benefits as the survivors or dependents of  disabled or retired workers. Table 3 shows the number of children who  receive benefits in each category and the average monthly benefit for  these children. One way to protect the benefits of children would be to  exempt them from any reform, keeping their benefit calculation tied to  current law. Another way to protect their benefits to some degree would  be to raise the maximum benefit a family could receive on a single  worker\u2019s earnings record.", "The majority of experts with whom we spoke told us that increasing the  maximum amount that a family could receive from one worker\u2019s earnings  record could help protect child and other dependent benefits. Such an  increase could help those dependents who are constrained by the family  maximum. A family may have several people receiving benefits based on  one worker\u2019s record. The sum of the family members\u2019 benefits may exceed  the specified maximum, which is calculated as a percentage of the  worker\u2019s benefit amount. Thus, any reform that would result in a decrease  in the primary benefit amount would also result in a decrease in the  amount that each eligible family member would receive and a  corresponding decrease in the total amount a family would receive.", "Certain options, including increased allowable benefits for widows or  partial exemptions, could be designed to protect the benefits of  widow(er)s or others who may have fewer resources available to them.  Under current law, widows and widowers can collect 100 percent of their  deceased spouse\u2019s benefits (or their own benefit\u2014whichever is greater);  a \u201cwidow\u2019s boost\u201d would allow them to receive up to 75 percent of the  couple\u2019s combined benefits. Widow(er)s may rely on Social Security for a  large percentage of their retirement income, in part because they may live  many years beyond the exhaustion of other financial resources, may find it  difficult to work, or may incur large health expenses that deplete their  other resources.", "A reduction in the COLA may be particularly detrimental to the lifetime  benefits of those who live long lives, because the effect of reducing the  COLA is compounded over time. As such, it may be desirable to protect  older widow(er)s\u2014along with other individuals who receive benefits for a  prolonged period of time\u2014from the effect of a COLA reduction. For  example, in our projections for the COLA reduction, we found that for the  group of widows who received some benefits and who died before age 75,  median lifetime benefits would be approximately 93 percent of those  under current law.

For example, before a change in the retirement age a worker  who is a year away from the full retirement age, and who would qualify for  DI but is unsure of that outcome, may choose to wait and only receive Old  Age benefits. Once the full retirement age is raised, this worker may  choose to apply for DI, rather than waiting to receive retirement benefits.  The greater the benefit disparity between the two programs, the more  likely it may be that DI applications and enrollment will increase.

However, if disabled workers were fully  exempted from price indexing, the simulated disabled worker\u2019s lifetime  benefits would be back to the initial amount of $505,000, or 72 percent  greater than those of the retired worker.

Once the AIME is determined, a progressive formula is  applied to the AIME to yield a worker\u2019s Primary Insurance Amount (PIA).  In 2007, the PIA formula had the following bend points: 90 percent of the  first $680 of AIME, plus 32 percent of the next $3,420, and 15 percent of  any earnings above that level (fig. 13).
