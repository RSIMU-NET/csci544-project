Ensuring the safety of imported food challenges the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to better target its resources on the foods posing the greatest risks to public health and to coordinate efforts with the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP) so that unsafe food does not enter U.S. commerce. This testimony focuses on (1) FDA's overseas inspections, (2) identified gaps in agencies' enforcement efforts to ensure the safety of imported food, and (3) statutory authorities that GAO has identified that could help FDA's oversight of food safety. This testimony is principally based on GAO's September 2009 report, Food Safety: Agencies Need to Address Gaps in Enforcement and Collaboration to Enhance Safety of Imported Food (GAO-09-873) and has been updated with information from FDA."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While the number of FDA overseas inspections has fluctuated, FDA has opened up several overseas offices to address the safety of imported food at the point of origin, and is testing a computer-based system to target high-risk imports for additional inspection when they arrive at ports of entry. Specifically, in 2008, FDA inspected 153 foreign food facilities out of an estimated 189,000 such facilities registered with FDA; in 2007, FDA inspected 95 facilities. FDA estimated that it would conduct 200 inspections in 2009 and 600 in 2010. In addition, FDA opened offices in China, Costa Rica, and India and expects to open offices in Mexico and Chile and to post staff at European Union agencies. Furthermore, FDA's testing of a new computer screening system--the Predictive Risk-Based Evaluation for Dynamic Import Compliance Targeting (PREDICT)--indicates that the system could enhance FDA's risk-based screening efforts at ports of entry, but the system is not yet fully operational. PREDICT is to generate a numerical risk score for all FDA-regulated products by analyzing importers' shipment information using sets of FDA-developed risk criteria and to target for inspection products that have a high risk score. GAO previously identified several gaps in enforcement that could allow food products that violate safety laws to enter U.S. commerce. For example, FDA has limited authority to assess penalties on importers who introduce such food products, and the lack of a unique identifier for firms exporting food products may allow contaminated food to evade FDA's review. In addition, FDA's and CBP's computer systems do not share information. FDA does not always share certain distribution-related information, such as a recalling firm's product distribution lists with states, which impedes states' efforts to quickly remove contaminated products from grocery stores and warehouses. GAO identified certain statutory authorities that could help FDA in its oversight of food safety. Specifically, GAO previously reported that FDA currently lacks mandatory recall authority for companies that do not voluntarily recall food products identified as unsafe. Limitations in FDA's food recall authorities heighten the risk that unsafe food will remain in the food supply. In addition, under current FDA regulations, companies may conclude a food ingredient is generally recognized as safe without FDA's approval or knowledge. GAO recommended that if FDA determines that it does not have the authority to implement one or more recommendations, the agency should seek the authority from Congress. Finally, GAO reported that FDA has identified a need for explicit authority from Congress to issue regulations requiring preventive controls by firms producing foods that have been associated with repeated instances of serious health problems or death. FDA already has preventive regulations for seafood and juice, which require firms to analyze safety hazards and implement plans to address those hazards."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss findings from our work on the  Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA\u2019s) efforts to ensure the safety of  imported food and on our other recently issued food safety work.  According to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) data, food imported  from more than 150 countries and territories constitutes a substantial and  increasing percentage of the U.S. food supply. Imported food constitutes  15 percent of the U.S. food supply, including 60 percent of fresh fruits and  vegetables and 80 percent of seafood. Additionally, the volume of  agricultural and seafood products imported for consumption increased 29  percent from fiscal years 2003 to 2008, and the value of these products  increased 65 percent. Ensuring the safety of imported food challenges  federal agencies to better target their resources on the foods posing the  greatest risks to public health and to coordinate efforts so that unsafe food  does not enter U.S. commerce.", "We have reported on the safety of imported food for many years. In 1998,  we assessed the federal government\u2019s efforts to ensure the safety of  imported foods and determined that federal agencies could not be certain  that the growing volume of imported food was safe for consumers. More  recently, we reported in September 2009 that agencies need to address  gaps in enforcement and collaboration to enhance the safety of imported  food. Federal agencies involved in the oversight of food imports include  the following:    FDA\u2014which is responsible for roughly 80 percent of the food supply,  including dairy products, seafood, fruits, and vegetables\u2014oversees  imported food safety through targeted inspections, sampling, and  surveillance, among other things. Owing in part to the volume of imported  products it regulates, FDA physically examines approximately 1 percent of  imported food; however, the agency is developing the Predictive Risk- Based Evaluation for Dynamic Import Compliance Targeting (PREDICT)  computer system to improve its targeted screening efforts.", "Customs and Border Protection (CBP), under the Department of  Homeland Security, is responsible for inspecting food imports for  compliance with U.S. law and coordinating with FDA to enforce food  safety laws at the border, among other things. CBP\u2019s computerized  screening system processes all imported shipments, including food. CBP  requires importers to (1) give a manufacturer identification number for  each imported shipment and (2) post a monetary bond for formal entries  to provide assurance that these shipments meet U.S. requirements, among  other things.", "USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has responsibility for  the safety of imported meat and poultry and relies on an equivalency  system whereby exporting countries must demonstrate that their systems  meet standards that are equivalent to those of the U.S. system.", "Furthermore, food safety responsibility is further divided among the 50  states, which may have their own statutes, regulations, and agencies for  regulating and inspecting the safety and quality of food products. This  fragmentation is the key reason that we added federal oversight of food  safety to our high risk-series in January 2007 and called for a  governmentwide examination of the food safety system.", "Several food safety bills have recently been introduced in Congress, and a  comprehensive bill, H.R. 2749, passed the House of Representatives in July  2009. The House bill would require importers to register annually with  FDA and to submit an appropriate unique facility identifier as a condition  of such registration, among other provisions. The bill would also authorize  FDA to issue a mandatory recall of foods that may cause serious adverse  health consequences or death to humans or animals and would expand the  agency\u2019s authority to assess criminal and civil penalties. Our September  2009 report made some of the same recommendations.", "My testimony today will focus on three key issues: (1) FDA overseas  inspections to address the safety of imported food, (2) identified gaps in  agencies\u2019 enforcement that undermine efforts to ensure the safety of  imported food, and (3) statutory authorities that we have identified that  could help FDA\u2019s oversight of food safety.", "As detailed in our reports, we found the following:     First, while the number of FDA\u2019s foreign inspections has fluctuated, the  agency has opened several overseas offices to address the safety of  imported food at the point of origin. In addition, FDA testing of PREDICT  indicates that the system could enhance FDA\u2019s risk-based screening  efforts, but the system is not yet fully operational. FDA officials stated that  a scheduled nationwide rollout this summer of PREDICT has been delayed  primarily because of technical problems, such as server crashes and  overloads, which are affecting FDA\u2019s field data systems nationwide.", "Second, gaps in FDA\u2019s and other agencies\u2019 enforcement could allow  violative food products to enter U.S. commerce. For example, FDA has  limited authority to assess penalties on importers who introduce violative  food products, and the lack of a unique identifier for firms exporting food  products may allow contaminated food to evade FDA review.", "Finally, we have made several recommendations that would help FDA  improve food safety oversight.  For example, we recommended that FDA  seek additional authorities, such more explicit authority to create  preventive controls for high-risk foods, and we have recommended that  Congress consider giving FDA additional authority, such as mandatory  recall authority.  FDA agreed with our recommendations and has sought  authority to order food safety recalls and issue additional preventive  controls for high-risk foods.", "This testimony is largely based on our September 2009 report on imported  food safety, as well as other recent reports, and updated with information  from FDA. See appendixes I-IV for highlights of our prior work. We  conducted our work in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "While the Number of FDA Overseas Inspections Has Fluctuated, the Agency Has Opened Overseas Offices, and Has Piloted PREDICT", "paragraphs": ["In 2008, FDA inspected 153 foreign food facilities out of an estimated  189,000 such facilities registered with FDA and estimated that it would  conduct 200 inspections in 2009 and 600 in 2010. In 2007, FDA inspected  95 facilities. Table 1 shows the number of FDA inspections of foreign food  facilities, by country, from fiscal years 2001 through 2008. As the table  shows, FDA conducted 1,186 inspections in 56 countries from fiscal years  2001 through 2008; the majority of FDA inspections were in Mexico,  followed by Ecuador, Thailand, and Chile. FDA conducted a total of 46  inspections in China during this period.", "For fiscal year 2009, FDA allocated 272 full-time employees to examine  imported food shipments at U.S. ports of entry and estimated a budget of  approximately $93.1 million for field import activities. The total estimated  2009 FDA budget for all FDA products and programs, including food,  drugs, medical devices, and other products, was $2.7 billion. In 2008, we  testified that if FDA were to inspect each of the 189,000 registered foreign  facilities\u2014at the FDA Commissioner\u2019s estimated cost of $16,700 per  inspection\u2014it would cost FDA approximately $3.2 billion to inspect all of  these facilities once.", "Since November 2008, FDA has opened overseas offices to help prevent  food that violates U.S. standards from reaching the United States. These  offices are expected to provide FDA with direct access to information  about foreign facilities\u2019 food manufacturing practices so that its staff at  U.S. ports of entry can make more informed decisions about which food  imports to examine. For example, FDA\u2019s overseas staff are working with  staff at counterpart regulatory agencies overseas, as well as with other  stakeholders who may be knowledgeable about certain industries.  Overseas staff are also educating local exporters to make sure they  understand U.S. food safety laws and regulations and FDA expectations.  FDA opened offices in China (Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shanghai); in  Europe (Brussels, London, and soon in Parma, Italy); in Latin America  (San Jose, Costa Rica; Santiago, Chile; and Mexico City, Mexico); and in  India (New Delhi and Mumbai). The FDA Middle East Office is operating  out of FDA headquarters because the Department of State denied its  request to locate in Amman, Jordan, due to security concerns.", "In addition to having overseas offices assist FDA\u2019s oversight of imported  food, the agency is developing PREDICT. PREDICT is intended to assist  FDA\u2019s oversight of imported food and uses FDA-developed criteria to  estimate the risk of imported food shipments. These criteria are to  incorporate, among other things, the violative histories of the product,  importer, manufacturer, consignee, and country of origin; the results of  laboratory analyses and foreign facility inspections; and general  intelligence on recent world events\u2014such as natural disasters, foreign  recalls, and disease outbreaks\u2014that may affect the safety of a particular  imported food product. In addition, agency officials stated that PREDICT  will assign higher risk scores to firms for which the system does not have  historical data.", "PREDICT generates a numerical risk score for all FDA-regulated products.  According to FDA, PREDICT is to present the shipment\u2019s risk score to  FDA reviewers if the score is above an FDA-specified threshold.  Shipments that are below the threshold are to receive a system \u201cmay  proceed\u201d (cleared) message unless other conditions are present, such as  an FDA import alert. FDA intends that reviewers using PREDICT will also  be able to view the specific risk factors that contributed to the shipment\u2019s  risk score, such as whether the product or importer has a history of FDA  violations. FDA expects reviewers to use PREDICT to supplement, rather  than replace, their professional judgment when deciding what food  products to inspect.", "A 2007 pilot test of PREDICT in Los Angeles for seafood products  indicated that the system could enhance FDA\u2019s risk-based import  screening efforts. When compared with baseline data from FDA\u2019s existing  import screening system, the Operational and Administrative System for  Import Support (OASIS), PREDICT improved FDA\u2019s ability to target  imports that the agency considers to be high risk for further examinations  and allowed a greater percentage of products the agency considers to be  low risk to enter U.S. commerce without requiring a reviewer\u2019s  intervention. Specifically, PREDICT nearly doubled the percentage of field  examinations\u2014and increased by approximately one-third the percentage  of laboratory examinations\u2014that resulted in violations, relative to  baseline OASIS data. In addition, according to FDA, the violations in  shipments that reviewers targeted using PREDICT, on average, posed a  greater risk to human health than the violations that OASIS detected.", "FDA told us on April 12, 2010, that PREDICT is fully operational in the Los  Angeles and New York districts, but due to technical problems, FDA has  not determined when the system will be deployed in the Seattle district. In  addition, FDA officials stated that a scheduled nationwide rollout of  PREDICT this summer has been delayed, primarily because of technical  problems, such as server crashes and overloads, which are affecting FDA\u2019s  field data systems nationwide.", "Although the PREDICT pilot produced positive results and demonstrated  the system\u2019s potential to improve import screening efforts, we reported  that further agency actions were needed to help ensure that the system is  effective. For example, FDA had not yet developed a performance  measurement plan to evaluate, among other things, PREDICT\u2019s ability to  identify high-risk shipments for manual review while simultaneously  returning \u201cmay proceed\u201d messages for low-risk shipments and enabling  them to enter U.S. commerce. We recommended FDA develop such a plan.  According to agency officials, since our report was issued in September  2009, FDA had completed a draft performance measurement plan.  However, we have not reviewed this draft plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA and Other Agencies Face Gaps in Enforcement That Undermine Efforts to Ensure the Safety of Imported Food", "paragraphs": ["We identified specific gaps in enforcement that could allow violative food  products to enter U.S. commerce: (1) FDA\u2019s limited authority to assess  civil penalties on certain violators; (2) lack of unique identifiers for firms  exporting FDA-regulated products; (3) lack of information-sharing  between agencies\u2019 computer systems and (4) FDA\u2019s not sharing product  distribution information during a recall."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FDA Has Limited Authority to Ensure Importers\u2019 Compliance", "paragraphs": ["Importers can retain possession of their food shipments until FDA  approves their release into U.S. commerce. However, FDA and CBP  officials do not believe that CBP\u2019s current bonding procedures for FDA- regulated food effectively deter importers from introducing violative food  products into U.S. commerce. Specifically, importers post a monetary  bond for formal entries (i.e., all shipments exceeding $2,000 and certain  shipments valued below that amount) to provide assurance that these  shipments meet U.S. requirements. According to these officials, many  importers still consider the occasional payment of forfeited bonds as part  of the cost of doing business. Indeed, as we reported in 1998, forfeiture of  the shipment\u2019s maximum bond value is often not sufficient to deter the  sale of imported goods that FDA has not yet released. In its response to  our September 2009 report, FDA agreed with this finding. According to  FDA\u2019s regulatory procedures manual, the bond penalty is intended to  make the unauthorized distribution of articles unprofitable, but liquidated  damages incurred by importers are often so small that they, in effect,  encourage future illegal distribution of imported shipments. Even though  the bond may be up to three times the value of the shipment, for a large  importer, this sum may be negligible, especially when the importer  successfully petitions CBP to reduce the amount.", "We recommended that the FDA Commissioner seek authority from  Congress to assess civil penalties on firms and persons who violate FDA\u2019s  food safety laws and that the Commissioner determine what violations  should be subject to this new FDA civil penalties authority, as well as the  appropriate nature and magnitude of the penalties. FDA agreed with this  recommendation and was working with Congress to include civil penalty  authority in food safety legislation. FDA officials also told us that if the  agency had the authority to impose civil penalties on importers, which is  also provided for in H.R. 2749, FDA might be better able to deter  violations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA and CBP Do Not Provide Unique Identification Numbers to Firms", "paragraphs": ["High-risk foods may enter U.S. commerce because the identification  numbers that FDA uses to target manufacturers that have violated FDA  standards in the past are not unique, and therefore these manufacturers  and their shipments, may evade FDA review. Importers generate a  manufacturer identification number at the time of import, when, among  other things, they electronically file entry information with CBP. (CBP is  responsible for validating the manufacturer identification numbers and  ensuring they are unique.) CBP electronically sends this information to  FDA\u2019s computer system. From this new manufacturer identification  number, FDA\u2019s computer system automatically creates an FDA firm  identification number\u2014called the FDA establishment identifier. Officials  told us that a single firm may often have multiple CBP manufacturer  identification numbers\u2014and therefore multiple FDA establishment  identifiers. FDA officials told us that because CBP has multiple  identification numbers for many firms, FDA has an average of three  \u201cunique\u201d identifiers per firm, and one firm had 75 identifiers.", "The creation of multiple identifiers can happen in a number of ways. For  example, if information about an establishment\u2014such as its name\u2014is  entered by importers incorrectly at the time of filing with CBP, a new  manufacturer identification number, and therefore a new FDA  establishment identifier, could be created for an establishment that  already has an FDA number. In this scenario, an importer may\u2014 intentionally or unintentionally\u2014enter a firm\u2019s name or address slightly  differently from the way it is displayed in FDA\u2019s computer system. This  entry would lead to the creation of an additional FDA number for that  firm. If an import alert was set using the original FDA establishment  identifier, a shipment that should be subject to the import alert may be  overlooked because the new number does not match the one identified in  the alert.", "In addition, foreign facilities that manufacture, process, pack, or hold food  for consumption in the United States, with some exceptions, are required  to register with FDA. Upon registration, FDA assigns a registration  number. FDA calculated that in 2008, 189,000 foreign firms were registered  under this requirement. However, some of the firms included in that total  may be duplicates because the facility may have been reregistered without  the cancellation of the original registration; consequently FDA may not  know the precise number of foreign firms registered. As we previously  reported, FDA officials told us they are working to address the unique  identifier problem by establishing an interactive process in which FDA\u2019s  systems recognize when a product\u2019s identifier does not match its  manufacturer\u2019s registration number.", "As we reported, FDA could consider requiring food manufacturers to use a  unique identification number that FDA or a designated private sector firm  provides at the time of import. However, the use of this unique number  would necessitate collaboration with CBP, since importers would use such  a number each time they file with CBP to ship goods to the United States.  That is, CBP\u2019s computer system would need to be programmed to accept  an FDA unique identification number. According to CBP officials, it is  unknown if or when CBP\u2019s system will have this capability. To improve  FDA\u2019s and CBP\u2019s ability to identify foreign firms with violative histories,  we recommended that the FDA Commissioner explore ways to improve  the agency\u2019s ability to identify foreign firms with a unique identifier and  that the CBP Commissioner ensure that its computer system is able to  accept a unique identification number for foreign firms that export FDA- regulated foods. Both FDA and CBP agreed with our recommendation, and  CBP officials told us that the agency has developed a plan for  implementing a unique identifier. However, we have not reviewed this  plan. We observe that H.R. 2749 contains a provision that may allow the  Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the  Commissioner of CBP, to specify the unique numerical identifier system to  be used, taking into account compatibility with CBP\u2019s automated systems.  Such actions would help prevent high-risk foods from entering U.S.  commerce."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information Is Not Shared between Computer Systems", "paragraphs": ["When we issued our report in September 2009, we reported that CBP\u2019s  computer system did not notify FDA\u2019s or FSIS\u2019s systems when imported  food shipments arrive at U.S. ports, which increases the risk that  potentially unsafe food may enter U.S. commerce, particularly at truck  ports. If FDA chooses to examine a shipment as part of its admissibility  review, the agency notifies both CBP and the importer through its  computer system, OASIS. However, once the shipment arrives at the port  and clears CBP\u2019s inspection process, the importer is not required to wait at  the port for FDA to conduct its examination. Instead, the importer may  choose to transport the shipment to the consignee\u2019s warehouse or other  facility within the United States. The importer might choose to do so  because, for example, CBP and FDA do not have the same hours of  operation at some ports, and FDA\u2019s port office may be closed when the  shipment arrives. In such cases, as a condition of the bond with CBP, the  importer agrees to hold the shipment intact and not distribute any portion  of it into U.S. commerce until FDA has examined it.", "CBP and FDA officials told us that, occasionally, an importer will  transport the shipment to the consignee\u2019s warehouse without first  notifying FDA. If this occurs, FDA will not quickly know that the shipment  has arrived and been transported to a U.S. warehouse because CBP\u2019s  computer system does not notify FDA\u2019s OASIS computer system when the  shipment arrives at the port. Instead, from the perspective of an FDA  reviewer using OASIS, it will appear as if the shipment\u2019s arrival is still  pending. FDA port officials told us that it could be 2 or 3 days before FDA  reviewers become suspicious and contact CBP to inquire about the  shipment\u2019s arrival status. By this time, an unscrupulous importer could  have distributed the shipment\u2019s contents into U.S. commerce without  FDA\u2019s approval. As we reported, if CBP communicated time-of-arrival  information directly to OASIS, then FDA would be able to quickly identify  shipments that are transported into the United States without agency  notification and arrange to examine them before they are distributed to  U.S. markets. Since our report was issued in September 2009, CBP told us  that it had modified its software to notify FDA of a shipment\u2019s time of  arrival.

According to  one state official, because FDA does not provide this information, the state  has to spend time tracking it down on its own. Public health may be at risk  during the time it takes for the states to independently track distribution  information when a product is found to be contaminated. FDA told us that  it usually considers such information to be confidential commercial  information, the disclosure of which is subject to statutory restrictions,  such as the Trade Secrets Act. However, FDA\u2019s regulations allow for  sharing of confidential commercial information with state and local  government officials if, for example,  the state has provided a written statement that it has the authority to  protect the information from public disclosure and that it will not further  disclose the information without FDA\u2019s permission, and FDA has  determined that disclosure would be in the interest of public health, if  such sharing is necessary to effectuate a recall, or the information is shared only with state and local officials who are duly  commissioned to conduct examinations or investigations under the  Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
