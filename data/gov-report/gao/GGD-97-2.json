Some individuals and organizations have called for increasing regulation of businesses and other nonfederal entities to achieve certain goals, such as fairer competition, cleaner water, or safer consumer products and services. Others have recommended drastic reductions in federal regulatory activity and/or the imposition of constraints on how agencies develop or implement regulations, often because of the burden associated with regulatory compliance and questions about whether the regulations are actually achieving their stated purposes.", "A number of studies have attempted to analyze the effect of federal regulations on businesses or the economy as a whole, with some analysts claiming that federal regulations cost the economy hundreds of billions of dollars each year. Although these estimates are frequently cited, measurement of the effects of regulation on the economy is imprecise and controversial. Also, relatively little is known about the impact of all regulations on individual businesses or even how many regulations apply to a business. This type of information about the impact of regulations on individual businesses would provide a better understanding of the impact of regulations on the economy as a whole."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Regulations generally start with an act of Congress and serve as the means by which statutes are implemented and specific requirements are established. These requirements tell people and businesses what must be done to comply with the law. The statutory basis for a regulation can vary dramatically, from (1) very broad grants of authority that state only the general intent of the legislation and leave agencies with a great deal of discretion as to how that intent should be implemented to (2) very specific requirements delineating what regulatory agencies should do and how they should do it.", "The Agricultural Adjustment Act is an example of a broad grant of authority, delegating to the Secretary of Agriculture wide discretion to make agricultural marketing \u201corderly.\u201d The statute provides little guidance on which crops should have marketing orders or how to apportion the market among growers.", "The toxic air provisions of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 are examples of very specific statutory requirements. The provisions specified that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) establish standards, on the basis of the best existing pollution control technologies, for major sources of 189 of the most prevalent and hazardous air pollutants. The provisions also established three interim milestones and a final milestone for setting the standards and specified certain consequences if EPA missed a milestone for any source category. Likewise, in the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1986, Congress specified 83 contaminants for which EPA was to promulgate standards within 3 years. The act also required EPA to regulate drinking water contaminants to be as close as technically feasible to a level at which no known or anticipated health effects occur.", "The federal government has long regulated economic activity, often through independent regulatory agencies established separate from traditional federal departments and agencies. Social regulation in such areas as environmental quality, workplace safety, and consumer protection is a relatively recent phenomenon. Beginning in the 1960s, a number of major new statutes were enacted in those areas, including amendments to the Clean Air Act (CAA) and the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Truth in Lending Act, and the Consumer Product Safety Act. Those and other acts, as well as executive orders, also created new regulatory agencies, such as EPA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. By the 1980s, an array of federal regulations were in place that affected many decisions made by American businesses. Concerns then began to be raised about whether the benefits these regulations and regulatory agencies were attempting to achieve were worth the costs associated with compliance. Concerns were also being raised about the cumulative effect of all federal regulations on individual businesses."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Rulemaking Process", "paragraphs": ["The basic rulemaking process is spelled out in section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act, which, among other things, generally requires agencies to (1) publish notice of a proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register; (2) allow interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking by providing \u201cwritten data, views, or arguments\u201d; and (3) publish the rule 30 days before it becomes effective.", "Other procedural rulemaking requirements have been added through general statutes, executive orders, and judicial decisions. For example, certain executive orders since 1981 have required agencies (other than those considered to be independent regulatory agencies) to submit at least their significant regulations to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review before publication in the Federal Register. Because of the numerous processes involved, federal rulemaking can take years to complete. Once completed, federal regulations are compiled in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulatory Reform Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Numerous attempts have been made legislatively and by the executive branch to reform federal regulatory processes. For example, Congress enacted the following two regulatory reform initiatives in 1980: (1) the Paperwork Reduction Act and (2) the Regulatory Flexibility Act. As its name implies, the Paperwork Reduction Act attempted to minimize the paperwork and reporting burdens agencies impose on nonfederal entities. The act also established the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within OMB to review and approve all agency information collection activities. The Regulatory Flexibility Act required agencies to assess the impact of their regulations on small entities (e.g., businesses and governments) and to publish their plans for new regulations. We have reported on the effects these laws have had on agencies\u2019 regulatory programs and recommended improvements to their design and implementation.", "During the 104th Congress, numerous legislative initiatives have been introduced that attempted to reform the regulatory process and/or reduce businesses\u2019 regulatory burden. As of July 1996, at least three major governmentwide reform initiatives had been enacted. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 established a mechanism for advising Congress of the nature and size of federal mandates in proposed legislation or regulations to allow congressional consideration of the appropriateness of such mandates on state, local, or tribal governments or the private sector. As part of that process, agencies are required to assess the anticipated costs and benefits of federal mandates. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 reaffirmed the principles of the 1980 Act, required OIRA to establish governmentwide and agency-specific paperwork reduction goals, redefined key terms such as \u201ccollection of information,\u201d and required agencies to establish their own paperwork review and clearance function. The Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 made several changes in regulatory procedures, including (1) amending the Regulatory Flexibility Act to allow for judicial review of agency decisions, (2) requiring the publication of \u201csmall entity compliance guides\u201d to explain the actions a small business or other small entity must take to comply with a rule or a group of rules, and (3) establishing a congressional review process through which Congress can disapprove of final agency regulations. Some Members of Congress viewed this review process as necessary because they believed some agencies had issued regulations that went beyond the intent of Congress when it passed the underlying statutes.", "Every president in recent years also has taken steps intended to reduce the burden of federal regulations. In 1981, President Reagan issued Executive Order 12291, which gave OMB the authority to review all new regulations for consistency with administration policies. The order also required agencies to prepare a \u201cregulatory impact analysis\u201d for each major rule, describing the costs, benefits, and alternatives to the rule. In 1985, President Reagan issued Executive Order 12498, which required agencies subject to Executive Order 12291 to submit a list of significant regulatory actions they expected to propose during the upcoming year to OMB for clearance. The President also established a Task Force on Regulatory Relief, headed by then Vice President Bush. In turn, President Bush named his Vice President to head the Competitiveness Council, which was charged with advocating regulatory relief for business. In 1992, President Bush sent a memorandum to all federal departments and agencies calling for a 90-day moratorium on new proposed or final rules. During the moratorium, agencies were \u201c. . . to identify and accelerate action on initiatives that will eliminate any unnecessary regulatory burden or otherwise promote economic growth.\u201d", "The Clinton administration has also made a number of attempts to reform the federal regulatory process. Issued in September 1993, Executive Order 12866 revoked Executive Orders 12291 and 12498 and, among other things, established a number of \u201cprinciples of regulation\u201d (e.g., use the best scientific, technical, economic, or other information; specify performance objectives, not behaviors; make regulations simple and easy to understand; and use cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment) and reaffirmed the role of OMB in the regulatory review process (although only for \u201csignificant\u201d rules). Vice President Gore\u2019s National Performance Review also made a number of recommendations to improve the regulatory process, including (1) encouraging innovative regulatory approaches and negotiated rulemaking; (2) streamlining agency rulemaking procedures; and (3) ranking the seriousness of environmental, health, or safety risks. In March 1995, the President reiterated his interest in regulatory reform, calling on all agencies to (1) conduct a page-by-page review of all their regulations and eliminate or revise those outdated or in need of reform; (2) change the performance measures of agencies and regulators to focus on results, not process and punishment; (3) convene groups of regulators and the people affected by their regulations around the country and create \u201cgrassroots partnerships\u201d; and (4) expand their efforts to promote consensual rulemaking.", "During 1995 and early 1996, the President also announced regulatory reform initiatives aimed at certain agencies or issues (e.g., the environment, pensions, and cancer drugs) and announced other reforms applicable to all federal agencies. For example, agencies were asked to halve many of their reporting requirements, reduce penalties for self-disclosed violations of certain regulations, and allow companies to change processes for certain low-risk manufacturing operations without agency preapproval."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Measures of Regulatory Activity/Burden", "paragraphs": ["The level of federal regulatory activity, and the burden placed on businesses and others as a result of that activity, has been measured in a number of ways. For example, a number of commentors have used relatively simple, easy-to-understand indicators, such as the number of pages in the CFR, the length of the CFR on the bookshelf, the total weight of the rules, and even the length of all of the rules if each sheet of paper were placed end to end. Others have characterized federal regulatory burden in terms of federal spending on regulatory programs or the number of federal employees assigned to regulatory activities. Although these types of measures are relatively easy to develop and are appealing in some respects, they are at best only relative and indirect measures of regulatory burden and may not accurately reflect the difficulties experienced by the public or individual businesses in complying with federal regulations. These measures also require careful interpretation.", "Another indicator of regulatory burden that some analysts have used is the number of hours federal agencies estimate are needed to fill out their required paperwork. Although a more direct measure of regulatory burden than the measures previously described, a paperwork hour estimate has several limitations as a measure of overall regulatory burden. First, paperwork is but one element of the overall burden of federal regulations, and paperwork burden does not include other potentially relevant factors, such as labor costs unrelated to paperwork or capital expenditures. Second, paperwork burden is generally considered to be inaccurately measured. Not all paperwork burden is always counted in the data that agencies submit pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act, and many believe that the paperwork burden that is measured is underestimated. Finally, users of these paperwork estimates must be careful in their interpretation; changes in the burden hour totals may not reflect changes in the regulatory burden felt by businesses and individuals.", "Another common measure of regulatory burden is the cost borne by entities responsible for complying with the regulations involved. Studies of the costs associated with federal regulations vary in such terms as their scope (i.e., whether focused on individual businesses, sectors, or the economy as a whole) and the factors they consider (i.e., economic costs, social costs, paperwork costs, etc.). Types of regulatory cost studies are discussed in detail in chapter 3 of this report. Regardless of the nature of the study, though, the results must be carefully interpreted."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["At the request of five Members of Congress, we agreed to obtain information about the cumulative impact of federal regulations on selected businesses. Therefore, we focused our efforts on a limited number of businesses that could help us understand the issues and variables involved. Our specific objectives were to describe (1) what selected businesses and federal agencies believed were the federal regulations that applied to those businesses, (2) what those businesses believed was the impact (cost and other) of those regulations, and (3) the regulations those businesses said were most problematic to them and relevant federal agencies\u2019 responses to those concerns.", "To accomplish these objectives, we first needed to identify the businesses that would be the focus of our study. Because some of the information we wanted to collect was proprietary in nature (e.g., information on the companies\u2019 operating expenses) or involved regulatory enforcement actions that could be very sensitive, we recognized that some companies might not want to participate in our study unless their identities could be concealed. Therefore, we told the businesses we contacted that we would not disclose their identity unless we had their permission to do so or unless we were legally compelled or required to do so by Congress. We asked for and received pledges from our requesters that they would concur with and honor our pledge of confidentiality, and that they would oppose disclosure requests from other committees or Members of Congress. The requesters agreed that, although they would have access to summary data that would not identify individuals or firms, neither they nor their staff would have access to the individual business\u2019 responses.", "We initially attempted to obtain nominations of businesses to participate in our study from two types of organizations: (1) business interest groups, including several that had testified before Congress and/or made public comments criticizing federal regulations, and (2) public interest groups, some of which had defended the need for federal regulatory action. The five business interest groups we contacted were the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB), the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA), and the Greater Washington Board of Trade. The four public interest groups we contacted were Public Citizen Litigation Group, OMB Watch, Business for Social Responsibility (BSR), and Global Environmental Management Initiative (GEMI). We initially contacted most of these organizations during June through August 1994 and asked them to nominate businesses that they believed would be good candidates for our study.", "Of these organizations, NAM and the Greater Washington Board of Trade provided nominees for the study (three and six nominees, respectively). Although the U.S. Chamber of Commerce initially indicated it would be able to provide nominees for our study, several months later a representative of the Chamber said that it would not provide any nominees because of concerns its member companies had about our ability to guarantee the confidentiality of their responses. During several months of telephone calls, the NFIB representatives said that they were not able to provide nominees because their efforts were then directed toward other legislative initiatives and priorities. GEMI\u2019s board of directors declined to participate but did not provide a reason. BSR representatives initially appeared interested in providing nominees for the review, but they did not respond to any of our subsequent telephone calls. CMA, Public Citizen, and OMB Watch initially agreed to try to identify companies for us to contact, but we never received any nominees from either organization.", "Because we wanted to contact more companies than the interest groups identified, we turned to other sources for potential study participants. One such source was a list of companies that had participated in a March 1994 forum on regulatory reform sponsored by the Small Business Administration (SBA). SBA staff who worked on the forum identified seven companies that they believed would be good candidates for participation in our review, and we accepted the nomination of another company from one of the SBA nominees. Another source that we used to identify possible company participants (35 companies) was newspaper and magazine articles in which specific companies commented either positively or negatively about federal regulations or their federal regulatory experience. The periodicals we reviewed to identify these companies included INC., Nation\u2019s Business, The Wall Street Journal, and the ABA Banking Journal. We also used a literature search to improve the diversity of our company selections, focusing on articles about companies in certain industrial categories and geographic areas that were not represented by the other nominees.

Therefore, we asked the companies participating in this review to develop a list of all of the federal regulations with which they had to comply at the time of our review.

Therefore, we told the businesses that their list of applicable regulations should, at a minimum, cite the major federal statutes governing the regulations. For example, we said the list of statutes in the health and safety area of workplace regulations might include the Occupational Safety and Health Act or the Drug Free Workplace Act. We also said that other categories of workplace regulations could include labor standards (e.g., the Fair Labor Standards Act); employee benefits (e.g., Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)); civil rights (e.g., title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964); and labor relations (e.g., the National Labor Relations Act).

The companies\u2019 lists varied substantially in the degree to which they covered the general regulatory areas that would probably be applicable to the companies (e.g., tax, wage and hour, and workplace rules). Several companies listed regulations in only certain functional areas or for certain agencies. For example, officials from the paper company identified what they believed were applicable environmental, health and safety, and transportation regulations\u2014areas that they said were their company\u2019s greatest concern. However, they did not identify any regulations in the employee benefits, civil rights, labor relations, or tax areas. Some companies provided what they described as a partial list of regulations and indicated they would provide additional information, but never did so. Two companies\u2019 lists reflected only the problematic regulations we asked them to identify for another portion of this review. (See ch. 4 of this report.) Although officials from several companies said they believed their lists contained 75 to 90 percent of the regulations applicable to them, most of the companies\u2019 officials acknowledged that their lists were incomplete.", "The companies\u2019 lists also varied in the level of detail they provided.

However, even these lists were not comprehensive. For example, the petrochemical company had developed a list of environmental, workplace safety, and other regulations for use by their internal auditing staff. However, company officials told us that the list was not necessarily complete.

We recognized that producing an aggregate list of regulations would be an expensive and time-intensive endeavor because of the complex analysis required to identify every regulation affecting the business.", "Some of the companies also said that some federal regulatory requirements were hard to identify because they had become part of the companies\u2019 standard procedures. For example, Roadway\u2019s officials said that developing a comprehensive list of regulations was difficult because many regulations have been around for so long they are now part of everyday operations of the company. Officials from the fish farm said that some regulatory requirements (e.g., payroll recordkeeping standards) are now considered part of their everyday business operations. The officials also said that some outside organizations (e.g., insurance companies) require the company to follow certain safety procedures, and they were not sure whether those procedures were also required by regulations.", "Officials from the petrochemical company said regulations often cause a fundamental shift in business processes that later becomes less distinctive. The officials noted that industry incurred start-up costs associated with the requirement to produce unleaded gasoline, but because the entire industry was required to be in compliance the identification and capture of these costs became less relevant over time.", "Some of the companies also said it was difficult to distinguish between federal requirements and those of other governmental jurisdictions. Officials from the paper company said making this distinction was \u201cdifficult, if not impossible.\u201d The petrochemical company indicated that it was particularly difficult to separate the requirements when state or local governments enforce federal standards and can add additional requirements. One California company noted that all OSHA regulations and many EPA regulations are enforced by the state, and that California often adds stricter state requirements.", "The companies also cited other reasons why their lists of applicable regulations were incomplete or difficult to compile. For example, a fish farm official said that the regulators themselves are sometimes unable to inform the company of all applicable regulations. Petrochemical company officials were reluctant to characterize their list as complete because of a concern that if a regulator saw certain requirements missing from their list they might assume the company was not complying with the missing regulations and pursue some type of enforcement action against the company.

For example, a DOT official said that the agency would need such information as whether the company uses rail transportation, the types of material the company transports, and the nature of the business enterprise (e.g., whether it was a partnership or a corporation). IRS officials said they would need to know whether the business was privately or publicly held, whether it imported or exported materials or products, and whether it had foreign as well as domestic operations. The IRS officials said operational and administrative decisions made throughout the existence of the companies affect their tax status and, therefore, the applicable tax regulations.", "EPA officials also said that the collection of the information they needed to identify applicable regulations would require a large expenditure of resources at a time when their budget was uncertain.

First, we asked 17 of the regulatory agencies that the companies had cited in their lists of regulations to describe the kinds of information they needed to be able to determine the applicability of their regulations to a particular company. Second, we asked each of these agencies to describe the kinds of assistance they provide to companies to help them determine which regulations were applicable to them and how to comply with the regulations.

Similarly, the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s (FRB) officials said that coverage of its regulations \u201cis determined by either the nature of a particular company or the nature of the activities in which a particular company engages or intends to engage.\u201d \u2022 EPA officials said that \u201cthere is no single set of regulatory determinants that would cover all situations in which a facility may be covered by EPA\u2019s regulations. Many of our regulations are event driven, some factors are related to facility location, and many regulations are triggered by physical and operational characteristics of a particular facility.\u201d IRS officials said it was difficult to come up with criteria for the development of a list of regulations applicable to a particular company because of decisions that companies make in the course of their business. For example, IRS officials said that if a company chooses to provide a qualified retirement plan, it must comply with the statutory provisions and regulations applicable to such plans. \u2022 OSHA\u2019s officials said that it \u201cregulates occupational safety and health hazards, not specific industries.\u201d Therefore, the \u201capplicability of individual standards depends on whether or not the hazard addressed by the standard is present in the workplace.\u201d", "Officials from DOL indicated that companies\u2019 specific reporting requirements also varied according to specific criteria. For example, the officials said that the requirements for the Form 5500 used by employee benefit plan administrators to satisfy their reporting obligations under title I of ERISA, title IV of ERISA, and the Internal Revenue Code depend on (1) the type of plan (i.e., whether the plan is a pension or welfare plan); (2) the size of the plan (i.e., whether the plan has fewer than 100 participants or 100 or more participants); and (3) how the benefits are funded (i.e., through a trust or insurance or from the general assets of the employer).", "On the other hand, some agencies\u2019 officials said that determining the applicability of their regulations is relatively straightforward. See the following examples: \u2022 EEOC officials said that, with the exception of reporting requirements, EEOC regulations apply to all entities covered by the statutes it enforces, and the officials indicated that the applicability of those statutes is primarily a function of company size. For example, EEOC officials said that title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) apply to any company with 15 or more employees. The officials also said that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) applies to all employers with 20 or more employees. According to the officials, any private employer with 100 or more employees must complete their EEO-1 reporting form indicating the race, ethnicity, and sex of employees by job category.\u2022 Officials from the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) in DOL said Executive Order 11246, which OFCCP administers, applies only to contractors and subcontractors who perform government contracts that total at least $10,000 in a 12-month period. However, the officials said that nonconstruction contractors with 50 or more employees and contracts greater than $50,000 have additional obligations. \u2022 The PBGC officials said PBGC\u2019s insurance program and regulations apply only with respect to defined benefit pension plans as described in section 4021 of ERISA. The agency officials said that section 4021 generally covers all defined benefit pension plans voluntarily established by private sector employers, and specifically states what plans are excluded from coverage. \u2022 The FDIC officials said that coverage by FDIC regulations \u201cis determined basically by whether an institution is FDIC-insured, and as a subset of that status, whether the institution is an insured nonmember bank for which the FDIC has primary supervisory responsibility at the federal level.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Informational Mechanisms Varied", "paragraphs": ["Sixteen agencies described how they provide information to companies and the public on their regulatory requirements.

Six agencies indicated that they used some type of electronic bulletin board as an informational mechanism.", "OSHA described a variety of informational resources and programs, including the following examples: \u2022 more than 80 different publications available from OSHA\u2019s Publications Office, some of which were also available in OSHA\u2019s 100 field offices; \u2022 safety and health standards in CD-ROM format (available for purchase from the Government Printing Office) containing all OSHA standards, compliance directives, and standards interpretations; \u2022 a DOL-operated Labor News Electronic Bulletin Board and an OSHA Computer Information System accessible through the Internet, which contains some of the information on the CD-ROM; the OSHA Consultation Program, which offers free, on-site, expert assistance to small employers in all 50 states to help them comply with OSHA requirements and establish effective safety and health programs (according to OSHA, more than 100,000 employers have used this service and priority is given to small firms in high-hazard businesses); and \u2022 courses on specific safety and health issues for employers who want intensive information about specific safety and health issues at OSHA\u2019s Training Institute in Des Plaines, IL, and at OSHA Education Centers in 12 states.", "OSHA\u2019s officials said OSHA is also piloting several other ways to use computer technology to provide assistance to employers, including the development of interactive compliance tools.", "EPA also cited dozens of sources of information about its regulations, including brochures, pamphlets, fact sheets, booklets, letters, hotlines, regional contact numbers, guidance manuals, posters, question and answer sheets, and catalogues of informational materials. EPA listed informational sources for each of its program offices and, within those offices, the sources were also often differentiated by issue. For example, the Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances said it had many of the informational modes listed above as well as information lines for pesticide questions, \u201cPR Notices\u201d providing detailed information to regulated industries, registration kits for those interested in how to register new pesticide products, and outreach efforts to help growers that rely on minor use pesticides. Among the initiatives EPA particularly noted were the following: \u2022 Compliance assistance centers were being established by EPA\u2019s Office of Compliance for four industry sectors\u2014automotive, metal finishing, printing, and agriculture. EPA officials said the centers offer \u201cone-stop shopping\u201d for understandable guidance materials, waste minimization and pollution prevention assistance, and advice in reducing regulatory compliance costs. \u2022 Sector Notebooks, which are profiles of 18 industries (e.g., metal fabrication, petroleum refining, and printing), were designed to assist firms in understanding what multimedia regulations apply to them. Each profile includes, among other things, applicable federal statutes and regulations as well as compliance assistance information. Notebooks are available through the Government Printing Office and on an electronic bulletin board. \u2022 The Office of the Small Business Ombudsman was established to provide a variety of information mechanisms to help communication between the small business community and EPA. EPA officials said the Office has a hotline service that receives nearly 20,000 calls per year, serves as the \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for EPA technical assistance and information, maintains an informal dialogue with over 45 trade associations, and advocates small business positions inside EPA.", "EPA also described the mechanisms one of its regional offices (Kansas City) used to communicate regulatory information to the public, including an Agricultural Compliance Assistance Center, public meetings and workshops, \u201cavailability sessions\u201d in which regional staff privately meet with citizens one-on-one to discuss issues, state- and trade association-sponsored meetings, mass mailings, public speaking, a toll-free Action Line, and an Iowa RCRA Hazardous Waste Helpline.", "Other agencies cited many of the same kinds of mechanisms. According to its officials, EEOC (1) conducted training and outreach seminars during fiscal year 1993 that reached an estimated 4,000 private sector employers and more than 94,000 individuals; (2) published and distributed millions of copies of training materials; (3) mailed out 477,933 publications during the first three quarters of fiscal year 1995; and (4) responded to thousands of public inquiries per year. DOT\u2019s officials said DOT public information efforts include electronic bulletin boards, toll-free hotlines, free guidance materials, news releases, mailing lists, and briefings to industry associations. The DOJ officials cited their toll-free ADA Information Line; technical assistance materials; a computer bulletin board and Internet connections; a speakers\u2019 bureau, which provides technical assistance at about 120 events each year; more than 40 technical assistance grants to trade associations; an ADA Information File containing more than 30 technical assistance publications placed in 15,000 public libraries throughout the country; and informational notices about the ADA, which are distributed to 6 million businesses through IRS\u2019 quarterly mailing to employers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulatory Information Relies on Businesses\u2019 Initiative, Appears Fragmented", "paragraphs": ["Some of the agencies\u2019 regulatory informational mechanisms are proactive, providing information to businesses and others at the agencies\u2019 initiative.

For example, OSHA officials said that although the agency offered a variety of informational mechanisms, it was up to each business to understand its own regulatory compliance responsibilities. However, the businesses that we talked to sometimes indicated a reluctance to approach regulatory agencies for information. For example, an official from Minco said that it was difficult to stay aware of the changes in regulatory requirements because they could not ask \u201cenforcers\u201d to provide information without potentially calling Minco\u2019s actions into question.

For example, DOJ officials explained that the ADA defines separate responsibilities for EEOC and DOJ. EEOC provides information about ADA employment regulations, but information about titles II and III of the act (architectural barriers) is available only from DOJ. Sometimes multiple information sources exist within a particular agency, with businesses frequently required to make more than one contact to gather information about that agency\u2019s regulatory requirements. As previously noted, EPA listed informational mechanisms by program office\u2014Air and Radiation; Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances; Solid Waste and Emergency Response; and Water\u2014as well as within a regional office. Therefore, a business would need to be aware of EPA\u2019s structure and programmatic configuration to obtain information about all EPA programs.

For example, in June 1995, the President asked SBA to cochair an effort to make government information more accessible to government customers. SBA developed the idea of a World Wide Web site on the Internet that would, among other things, allow companies to know what federal regulations apply to their operations. Working with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the University of Massachusetts, and more than two dozen federal departments and agencies, SBA developed the \u201cU.S. Business Advisor\u201d home page, a version of which was formally unveiled in February 1996. Using the Advisor, businesses can access a regulatory assistance center to search an electronic database of current and proposed regulations within particular subject areas. For example, a business can type in the term \u201cchlorine production\u201d and get a listing of chlorine-related regulations and proposed regulations.

SBA officials said the Advisor is still being developed, and they hope that future iterations will be even more user-friendly.", "Some agencies are developing their own World Wide Web sites on the Internet with regard to particular issues. For example, in October 1995, OSHA worked with the business community to create an on-line \u201casbestos advisor\u201d program that helps businesses determine whether their company is complying with regulations on asbestos exposure. The program solicits information about users\u2019 workplaces and tasks, and automatically provides guidance to ensure compliance. As of July 1996, more than 6,100 people had downloaded copies of the program. OSHA said that because of further distribution of the asbestos advisor by major corporations and trade associations, actual circulation could be 10 times greater than the number of downloaded copies. OSHA has developed on-line advisors for other standards (e.g., permit-required confined spaces and cadmium) and plans to create other interactive expert advisors on other issues (e.g., lead in construction and control of hazardous energy sources).

Zaclon is located in Cleveland, OH; has 52 employees; and manufactures organic and inorganic chemical compounds.", "Officials from some of the agencies we contacted initially expressed concerns about providing a list of regulations applicable to the companies. For example, EPA officials said that if the list was incomplete in any way (e.g., because new regulations were issued after they provided a list or because EPA did not know about an element of a company\u2019s operations that was covered by its regulations), the absence of a regulation from its list could be construed to mean that the company did not legally have to comply with that requirement. An official at OSHA questioned whether developing a list of applicable regulations was a useful method to measure the impact of OSHA\u2019s regulatory requirements. The official said that a list of all OSHA regulations a company must comply with could appear extensive, but would not provide any information on the beneficial results produced by these requirements.

As a result, a business attempting to determine its regulatory responsibilities may find it necessary to contact multiple agencies, and sometimes multiple offices within particular agencies, to collect the information it needs. In some cases, responsibility for an issue may be spread between two or more agencies, making it difficult for companies to determine which agency or agencies should be called regarding that issue.

Direct costs are those that regulated entities incur in the course of complying with regulatory requirements. These direct costs include the wages and salaries of workers carrying out regulatory responsibilities; capital expenditures (e.g., wastewater treatment facilities or safety equipment); employee training expenses; and other costs incurred as a direct result of regulatory requirements. Indirect or secondary costs include costs such as lost productivity, decreased competitiveness, construction delays, or resource misallocation. Still other costs include those associated with the development and enforcement of regulations, not just costs borne by regulated entities; therefore, these studies could include the budgets of regulatory agencies.", "Regulatory cost studies also vary in terms of the range of regulations included within the scope of the study. Studies may focus on costs associated with compliance with any regulatory requirements issued by any agency, or on only selected regulations, such as those within certain subject areas (e.g., environmental rules) or those issued by certain agencies.", "Cost studies also vary in terms of the types of costs considered attributable to regulatory requirements. Studies could include all expenditures by the regulated entity that are in any way related to the regulatory requirements at issue. In such studies, for example, if a company spent a total of $1 million during the course of a year on worker safety training and equipment, the full $1 million would be counted toward the company\u2019s regulatory costs. However, because the cost study includes all of the company\u2019s expenditures in this area, such an approach implicitly assumes that the company would have spent nothing on worker safety training and equipment during that year in the absence of regulatory requirements. Because many companies probably spend some money to protect their workers in the normal course of business, attributing those expenditures to regulatory requirements is erroneous and overstates the burden of regulations. Another approach does not include all expenditures in the measurement of regulatory costs, focusing only on the incremental costs directly attributable to the regulations in question. If, in the above example, the company had spent $600,000 on worker safety training and equipment, regardless of any regulatory requirements, the incremental cost attributable to regulations in that year would be $400,000 ($1 million minus $600,000).", "\u201c. . . must be measured against a baseline.

Some studies, such as the work of Thomas Hopkins, attempted to estimate the cost of regulations to the economy as a whole. Hopkins included the following five expenditure categories in his estimates of cumulative regulatory costs: \u2022 direct costs of environmental regulations; \u2022 direct costs of other social regulations, including consumer safety, nuclear safety, worker health, and worker security and pensions; \u2022 direct costs of economic regulations, which include agricultural, communications, transportation, energy, financial, construction, and international trade regulations; transfers stemming from economic regulations, including transfers stimulating exports and agricultural price supports; and \u2022 process costs of paperwork and reporting obligations, based upon the OMB estimate of the number of hours spent on federal paperwork requirements.", "Totaling data from all five cost categories, Hopkins estimated in 1993 that the cumulative cost of federal regulations to the economy would be $607 billion in 1995. However, some economists believe that one of the elements of Hopkins\u2019 study\u2014transfer costs\u2014should not be considered part of the cost of regulations to the economy because transfers represent a loss to one group and a corresponding benefit to another. There are also concerns about the accuracy of some of the data included in Hopkins\u2019 analysis.

Also, officials from the paper company said that determining their federal regulatory costs was \u201cdifficult if not impossible\u201d because they could not distinguish between costs to comply with federal regulations versus state and local requirements.

The cost data the companies provided were also incomplete in other ways. For example, one company provided data on its incremental regulatory costs, but only for a portion of its labor expenses. The company did not provide comprehensive data on capital or other types of costs, and the labor cost data did not include the company\u2019s hourly workers.", "Also, although one company said its incremental cost estimate covered the entire company, the manner in which the estimate was calculated revealed that all units were not actually represented. Company officials estimated the company\u2019s total incremental regulatory costs at $52.4 million\u2014$44.9 million for labor costs, $6.8 million in capital costs, and $700,000 in other costs. The officials said they developed these cost figures by first generating these costs for their largest operating unit, then doubling this figure to arrive at the estimated total cost. They said they used this method because the operating unit generated one-half of the company\u2019s revenue and accounted for one-half of the company\u2019s costs. Therefore, they said that doubling the unit\u2019s regulatory costs was a reasonable estimate of the whole company\u2019s incremental regulatory costs.

They said the company\u2019s international competitiveness is also affected by regulations. The officials said that, contrary to popular belief, European countries are less regulated than U.S. companies, and as a result, U.S. companies are at a competitive disadvantage. \u2022 Representatives from the petrochemical company said that the company had curtailed or forgone facility expansions because of regulations that discourage voluntary emissions reductions at the plant site or emissions trading programs that are too administratively burdensome. Company officials also expressed concerns about regulations that restrict access to potential natural gas markets even though the increased use of natural gas is a cost-effective means of achieving emissions reductions. The officials also referred to the unavailability of cash flow to capture business opportunities because of the allocation of funds to compliance requirements. \u2022 An official from Minco, a federal subcontractor, said that regulatory activity tends to drive out other human resource-related actions the company would like to take. For example, she said that the company would like to offer more training and employee development but cannot do so because January and February are generally dedicated to development of affirmative action plans. Another Minco official said that the company could make more money as a prime contractor but intentionally remains a subcontractor because of the complexity of federal procurement regulations. \u2022 A Multiplex official commented on how responding to regulatory requirements causes a delay of management information and responsiveness to business-related needs.

Also, although agencies could question or dispute the companies\u2019 concerns about regulatory issues, we did not give companies a comparable opportunity to respond to the agencies\u2019 assertions. Lastly, agencies had the final word regarding the companies\u2019 concerns, but this presentation should not be interpreted to imply our agreement with the agencies\u2019 positions regarding these issues."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Companies Expressed Concerns About Regulations and Regulators\u2019 Actions", "paragraphs": ["The 15 companies\u2019 regulatory concerns varied substantially. Many of these concerns were about specific federal regulations, but others focused on federal regulatory agencies\u2019 actions and the interrelationship between regulations at other levels of government. After analyzing them, we grouped the companies\u2019 concerns into the following 10 broad themes: (1) Compliance with a regulation was costly and/or those costs outweighed the benefits provided by the regulation. (2) The compliance costs associated with a regulation affected the companies\u2019 competitiveness. (3) The regulation at issue was unreasonable (e.g., it was not scientifically based). (4) The requirements associated with a regulation were difficult to understand, either because of the technical language involved or because the requirements kept changing. (5) Certain regulatory requirements were unnecessarily rigid or inflexible. (6) The paperwork or process requirements associated with a regulation were excessive and costly. (7) The penalties imposed on companies for noncompliance were too severe. (8) Regulators were overly deficiency-oriented or had a \u201cgotcha\u201d enforcement approach. (9) Regulators lacked knowledge of industries and provided little assistance to businesses trying to comply with the regulations. (10) Regulations from different agencies or levels of government were poorly coordinated or duplicative.", "About half of the concerns that the businesses expressed included elements of more than 1 of these 10 themes. For example, 14 of the companies\u2019 concerns indicated that certain regulations were both too costly and unreasonable. Similarly, a number of concerns involved both paperwork issues and regulatory costs. Some individual concerns included as many as five themes.", "Each of the 10 company concern themes is discussed below along with the associated comments from the regulatory agencies. Like the companies\u2019 concerns, the agencies\u2019 comments varied substantially. In some cases, the agencies agreed with the companies\u2019 concerns and said that actions had been taken or needed to be taken to address those concerns. In other cases, the agencies disagreed with the companies\u2019 portrayal of an enforcement action or of a regulation\u2019s requirements. In still other cases, the agencies said the companies\u2019 concerns were a function of the regulations\u2019 underlying statutory requirements.", "Appendix II contains a sample of the companies\u2019 concerns and the applicable agencies\u2019 responses for each of the 10 themes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Companies Said Regulatory Compliance Was Costly or Costs Outweighed Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Company officials most frequently expressed concerns about the cost of complying with particular federal regulations. Representatives of 14 of the 15 companies mentioned this concern about at least one regulation. For example, one official said DOT-required hazardous materials training cost the company $475,000 annually. Another company official said that as a result of changes to CAA\u2019s regulatory requirements, the cost of air quality testing, which was needed to get approval of a construction permit, increased from $10,000 to $30,000.", "In response to these concerns, the agencies most frequently said that the companies had overstated regulatory compliance costs. For example, EEOC and DOJ raised questions about the $750,000 Roadway said it spent to comply with ADA requirements. Both agencies said that practical experience to date indicates that the cost of ADA compliance is limited. EEOC cited a study commissioned by Sears, Roebuck and Co. showing that less than 3 percent of the accommodations that Sears made to comply with the ADA cost the company more than $1,000. In several cases, agencies said the costs incurred by the companies might be a function of the way that they complied with the regulations. For example, one company said that OSHA required them to replace certain electrical receptacle boxes with more expensive ones. In response, OSHA said the company only had to abate the electrical hazard, and it was up to the company to decide how to accomplish that goal. According to OSHA officials, the company could have found other ways to power its equipment or used other, less expensive receptacle boxes available for indoor use. OSHA officials added that their standard is consistent with the national electrical code, which is recognized by most authorities as a safe way to provide electrical energy to buildings.", "A number of companies also said that they believed the costs associated with compliance with certain regulations outweighed any regulatory benefits. Many companies said they found it difficult to see any benefits associated with the regulations they mentioned, either to themselves or to society in general. Other companies said they did not mind spending money to comply with federal regulations, but not when costs exceeded the benefits. For example, some companies said that although they had substantially met the goals set in particular regulations, total compliance would be extremely costly and would far outweigh any marginal benefits provided by those increased costs. In other cases, two companies mentioned having to retrofit machinery and/or train more employees than necessary to satisfy certain regulatory requirements\u2014expenditures that they said were unnecessary and yielded no apparent benefits.", "Agencies responding to these concerns frequently said that the companies did not recognize the benefits that the regulations provided and/or that they overstated the costs. Another common agency response was that the company had misstated or misinterpreted the regulatory requirement. In several instances, the agencies said that the particular regulatory procedure mentioned by the company was required by law. For example, one company said that the nondiscrimination test IRS requires in the administration of the company\u2019s 401(k) thrift savings plan was costly, and that the IRS requirement for a separate audit of the plan was an unnecessary expense. However, IRS said that both of these requirements were imposed by statute. In other cases, though, the agencies agreed with the companies\u2019 cost concerns and said they had taken or were taking action to make regulatory compliance less costly.", "Examples 1 through 4 in appendix II illustrate companies\u2019 concerns and agencies\u2019 responses relating to cost and cost-benefit issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Companies Said Regulatory Costs Affected Competitiveness", "paragraphs": ["Nine companies indicated that the costs associated with compliance with certain regulations were a disincentive to their investment or expansion decisions, or otherwise affected the companies\u2019 competitiveness in the marketplace. Some of the companies said that particular regulations prevented them from expanding their operations because their compliance costs would increase disproportionately to the profits they expected to generate from the expansion. Other companies said that compliance costs imposed a potential liability that discouraged investment. Still other company concerns were that some regulations applied to only certain types of businesses, thereby giving a competitive advantage to similar businesses that were exempt from those regulations.", "In response, the agencies often acknowledged that regulatory compliance costs could affect companies\u2019 competitiveness and/or flexibility of decisionmaking. However, they frequently said that the requirements in question were statutorily mandated. Several agencies also indicated that the regulations in question were necessary and yielded benefits that the companies did not mention. In several cases, the agencies said they were working to improve the operation of the regulations the companies cited as inhibiting competition, making them more consistent, flexible, or less burdensome. For example, one company said it would not purchase property that had previously been the site of industrial operations because of the potential cleanup liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Thus, the company felt that its options for choosing new sites were restricted at a time when it needed property for business expansion. EPA responded to this concern by indicating that it has initiatives under way to encourage economic redevelopment through environmental cleanup. Also, EPA said it has encouraged redevelopment of these sites by reassuring prospective new owners that they may not have to face Superfund liability.", "Also, some agencies\u2019 responses indicated that the way in which companies chose to comply with the regulations could have affected their costs. For example, Bank C said that it had to create 15 new forms as a result of a regulatory requirement, but FRB said that there was no requirement that bank personnel had to complete forms to accomplish the goal of the regulation.", "Examples 5 and 6 in appendix II illustrate two of the companies\u2019 concerns and agencies\u2019 responses relating to the effect of regulatory costs on competitiveness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Companies Said Regulations Were Unreasonable", "paragraphs": ["Twelve of the 15 companies said that certain regulations they dealt with were unreasonable because they were either (1) not based on sound scientific research, (2) outdated, (3) unlikely to achieve their intended goals, or (4) unreasonable for some other reason. For example, officials of the paper company objected to a DOT requirement that each of the company\u2019s several hundred locations submit drivers\u2019 logs and other documents to the company\u2019s headquarters to help DOT\u2019s review. The company thought it was impractical and unnecessary to maintain all of the drivers\u2019 logs in one place. In another example, the paper company alleged that title V of CAA requires the regulation of extremely low levels of emissions, and that the company was required to obtain a permit for methanol emissions at the company\u2019s fence line that are no more concentrated than in a person\u2019s breath.", "The regulatory agencies frequently disagreed with the companies\u2019 characterization of their regulations as unreasonable. In about half of these areas of disagreement, the agencies said that the regulations did, in fact, have a rational basis and/or provided benefits the companies did not acknowledge. For example, EPA officials said that the paper company\u2019s concern creates the misleading impression that paper mills are subject to title V only for low levels of methanol emissions when, in fact, large emissions of other pollutants would easily justify the need for a title V permit even if the mill had no methanol emissions.", "In the other half of these cases, the agencies said that the companies had mischaracterized the regulation or the incident involved. For example, hospital officials questioned the reasonableness of what they described as a revised Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rule that shortened the shift lengths of helicopter pilots. However, FAA said that the shift length rules had not recently changed. In several other instances, the regulatory agencies said that the regulatory provisions the companies characterized as unreasonable were required by law. For example, HUD officials said that disclosure requirements that bank officials said were unreasonable were established by Congress in specific provisions of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq). However, in some cases the agencies agreed with the companies\u2019 concerns about the reasonableness of regulations, and said that they or Congress had taken or were taking steps to minimize the problems the companies had experienced.", "Examples 7 through 10 in appendix II illustrate companies\u2019 concerns and agencies\u2019 responses relating to the reasonableness of regulatory requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Companies Said Regulatory Requirements Were Difficult to Understand", "paragraphs": ["Most companies said they did not understand certain regulatory requirements because they were vague or complex. As a result, the companies said they had difficulty determining whether regulations applied to them and, if so, what they needed to do to be in compliance. Some companies cited confusing, ambiguous, or conflicting terminology used in the regulations themselves or on the required forms. Some companies said they were not able to obtain clarification of the regulations\u2019 requirements from agency staff. Other companies said they had to hire outside consultants to explain the requirements or complete the forms, but even those experts are sometimes not able to help them. For example, paper company officials said OSHA regulations require their paper machines to have mechanisms that will stop the machines \u201cquickly,\u201d but the rule does not define what \u201cquickly\u201d means, and experts do not agree on a single definition.", "In many instances, the regulatory agencies agreed with the companies that the regulations cited in their concerns were vague and/or complex. The agencies often said that some kind of action had been taken or was being taken to clarify the regulations and make them less complex. For example, regulators frequently cited direct compliance assistance, written guidance, simplified processes, toll-free telephone numbers, computerized bulletin boards, and presentation of examples within the regulations themselves as ways that they have tried to make the requirements more understandable. In several instances, the regulators said the complexity of the regulations in question\u2014particularly IRS regulations\u2014was a function of the law or actions taken by Congress. In other cases, the regulators indicated that the regulations were complex because of the inherent complexity of the subject matter being regulated.", "Companies also said they did not understand regulatory requirements because of frequent changes to the regulations, thereby making it difficult to stay up to date and know what was required to be in compliance. For example, officials from the hospital said that it was difficult to keep pace with the frequently changing Medicare and Medicaid billing rules, which caused the hospital\u2019s computer programmers to spend numerous hours attempting to update the automated patient billing system.", "In virtually every case where a company complained about frequent regulatory changes, the agencies said that the changes were caused by congressional, not agency, action. For example, in response to bank officials\u2019 concerns about frequent changes in the tax code, Department of the Treasury officials indicated that the changes were initiated by Congress. Treasury officials said they had urged Congress to stabilize the tax code so that taxpayers and their advisers could understand its requirements. FDIC officials said that the number of changes and the level of detail in their call reports were driven in part by statutory requirements.", "Examples 11 through 13 in appendix II illustrate companies\u2019 concerns about regulations that were vague, complex, and/or frequently changing and agencies\u2019 responses to those concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Companies Said Regulations Were Inflexible", "paragraphs": ["Many companies said some federal regulations that they have to comply with were unnecessarily inflexible or rigid. The companies expressed frustration with the same standards or regulations being applied to all companies, locations, or situations without any consideration to other factors that they believed should be taken into consideration. Some companies felt that in certain regulatory situations, a variety of factors should be considered in determining whether a company should have to comply with that regulation. Examples of the factors the companies believed should be considered included the number of employees in a company, the extent to which a company uses a particular chemical, and the amount of pollutant discharged as the result of a company\u2019s process.", "For the most part, the agencies disagreed that the regulations or the situations the companies cited were examples of unnecessary inflexibility. In some of the situations the companies described, the agencies said that the requirements were justifiable regardless of other factors that the companies believed should be taken into consideration. In other cases, the agencies said that the regulations the companies cited already had some flexibility built in or that the companies had misunderstood the process or the regulation cited. In some cases, the regulators said that there was no need for the regulations to be more flexible because the standards the company cited were not even applicable to the situation the company described.", "Examples 14 and 15 in appendix II illustrate companies\u2019 concerns and agencies\u2019 responses about regulations that are considered to be inflexible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Companies Said Paperwork and Process Requirements Were Excessive or Costly", "paragraphs": ["Officials from 14 of the 15 companies said certain regulations\u2019 paperwork or other procedural requirements were excessive. The paperwork that company officials cited as problematic included (1) forms or reports that had to be periodically submitted to federal agencies and/or kept for their own records and (2) permit applications that had to be submitted to an agency to obtain approval for certain company activities.", "Most of the paperwork or process costs the companies mentioned related to labor costs associated with having their employees complete the required forms or reports. For example, the hospital said it had to hire a consultant for $50,000 to help complete the annual Medicare cost report. Two of the companies indicated that they would not mind bearing the expense of preparing regulatory reports if they felt the reports were actually used by federal agencies. For example, Bank B considered the reporting requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act to be of negligible value to law enforcement agencies. Bank officials said they had seen little evidence of law enforcement agencies\u2019 using the information and few prosecutions resulting from information in these reports. Other companies\u2019 concerns focused on the costs associated with having to prepare similar reports for regulators at the federal, state, and/or local levels.", "Agencies responding to these concerns most frequently said they agreed that the paperwork or procedural requirements could be expensive. They also said their agencies had taken or were taking action to address the companies\u2019 concerns. In several other instances, the agencies said that the costly paperwork or procedures were required by law. For example, in response to the hospital\u2019s concern about the annual Medicare cost report being a burden to prepare, HHS officials said that the Social Security Act requires the agency to maintain a system of cost-reporting for prospective payment system hospitals, including annual information to settle costs associated with health care services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries. In about half of the other responses, the agencies said that the companies had misinterpreted or misstated the paperwork or procedural requirements; therefore, they were incurring unnecessary expenses. For example, although one company complained that they had to keep certain employee safety training records \u201cforever,\u201d OSHA said that no such employee training records were required and, therefore, no retention requirement existed.", "Examples 16 through 19 in appendix II illustrate companies\u2019 concerns and agencies\u2019 responses relating to paperwork and process issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Companies Said Regulatory Penalties Were Too Severe", "paragraphs": ["Many companies expressed concerns that the penalties imposed on them for noncompliance with regulations or their requirements were too severe. For example, the glass company said sizable penalties had been imposed on them for procedural \u201cmistakes,\u201d such as not filing pension-related paperwork on time. Another company said it was fined several hundred thousand dollars for not obtaining a federal wastewater discharge permit. The company thought the penalty for this offense was too severe given that the company had a state permit that it believed was sufficient. In addition, a Metro Machine Corporation official said OSHA currently holds companies, rather than individual employees, accountable for violations caused by employee negligence or willful removal of company-installed safety devices. He said OSHA should differentiate between corporate negligence and employee responsibility.", "In response to these concerns, the agencies most frequently said that the penalties the companies cited would be imposed only in the most egregious circumstances. For example, in response to the Metro Machine Corporation concern, OSHA said that when it conducts an inspection and determines that a company\u2019s management is attempting all reasonable steps to comply and get employees to comply but the employees are systematically refusing to comply with safety and health standards or rules, OSHA will excuse the employer from a violation. OSHA officials added that the Occupational Safety and Health Act does not permit citing employees for violations. In another response, EPA said two companies\u2019 concerns about possible imprisonment of company officials for failing to disclose certain information would be imposed only in instances where those officials had knowingly falsified information or willfully failed to provide the required public notice of the release of a hazardous substance. Agencies also said that the penalties the companies complained about were established in the underlying statutes and, in other cases, that the agency had taken or would take action to address these concerns about the severity of certain regulatory penalties.", "Examples 20 and 21 in appendix II illustrate companies\u2019 concerns and agencies\u2019 responses to penalty issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Companies Said Regulators Had a \u201cGotcha\u201d Enforcement Approach", "paragraphs": ["Officials from more than half of the companies cited incidents in which regulators evidenced a \u201cgotcha\u201d manner or were more interested in finding companies in noncompliance with regulatory requirements than helping companies comply with the regulations. For example, one company said an IRS official unexpectedly visited its facility and, in a \u201cnasty\u201d manner, threatened to close the company down if the company did not immediately remit taxes that were reportedly unpaid. In another instance, a company said that EPA could initiate enforcement actions even when companies self-report deficiencies. Company officials also cited examples in which regulators were more focused on procedural or administrative issues (e.g., filing timely reports) than on whether the objective of the regulation was being achieved (e.g., less air or water pollution from their manufacturing processes).", "The agencies responded to the companies\u2019 comments in a variety of ways. The agencies often said that (1) their enforcement approaches were reasonable and consistent with their policies, (2) the companies had mischaracterized the incidents or the rules involved, or (3) they have or will take action to minimize these problems. For example, OSHA said that it had used citations and penalties as workforce performance measures in the past, but said it has now \u201cput a stop to that practice.\u201d EPA said that in 1995, it revised its policy to generally reduce or eliminate penalties when violations are self-disclosed and corrected. In response to the company\u2019s concern about the IRS employee\u2019s demand for immediate payment, IRS said it did not approve of employees who do not follow IRS procedures that require employees to do their jobs in a professional, ethical, and fair manner.", "Examples 22 and 23 in appendix II illustrate the types of concerns companies had about how agencies enforce their regulations and the agencies\u2019 responses to those concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Companies Said Regulators Were Not Always Helpful or Knowledgeable", "paragraphs": ["Some companies said regulators were uninformed about the regulations they enforced and did not understand the business practices of the companies they regulate.

For example, although the tank car company repeatedly tried to obtain clarification from EPA about the meaning of the term \u201capproaching atmospheric,\u201d the company said it was unable to get any assistance from EPA. In another case, officials from the fish farm said they had difficulties getting assistance from DOL on how to interpret the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) regulations when an employee is on leave under FMLA and does not intend to work after the leave period.", "Relatedly, officials from some companies said agencies do not always provide companies with sufficient opportunities for input into the rulemaking process or adequately consider the comments they receive during that process.

In a few cases, the agencies indicated efforts were under way to improve their staffs\u2019 knowledge of the industries they regulate. For example, IRS said it was working to develop a highly skilled frontline workforce that is more knowledgeable about different industries. In a response to a concern about lack of assistance, OSHA said it has implemented a number of information-dissemination projects and plans to undertake new initiatives to improve the availability of safety and health data to the public.", "In response to the rulemaking concerns, agencies said companies usually get the opportunity to provide comments as a rule is being developed. Also, one agency said that while all comments received are considered, these comments cannot always be incorporated in the final regulation.

Several of those changes have been enacted, including new paperwork reduction goals and new judicial review processes. Congress has even made itself part of the regulatory review process by instituting an expedited process to reject agency rules that it finds objectionable. The administration\u2019s regulatory reform efforts have addressed a number of areas as well, including eliminating and revising existing regulations; changing the performance measures of agencies and regulators to focus on results, not process and punishment; and working with the regulated community in the development of new regulations.", "A great deal of the debate about federal regulation has centered on whether the burdens associated with federal regulations outweigh the benefits that those regulations are intended to provide. A number of attempts have been made to measure the burden of federal regulations. Some of these measures are only indirect indicators of regulatory burden (e.g., the number of regulators and the number of pages in the CFR). Other, more direct measures are of questionable validity (e.g., paperwork burden-hour estimates). For example, one study of the direct cost of federal regulations estimated that their cost to the economy would be $607 billion in 1995. However, the validity of this estimate has been questioned by economists and others. Other studies of regulatory costs within particular sectors of the economy have been similarly criticized.The benefits of federal regulations are generally regarded as even more difficult to measure than regulatory burdens, so measures of those benefits may also be of questionable validity.", "In this review, we did not try to measure the overall burdens or benefits of federal regulations. We focused our analysis on a limited number of businesses so that we could better understand the issues and the variables involved in the federal regulatory process. Specifically, we attempted to develop information on the impact of federal regulations on selected businesses by determining (1) which federal regulations the businesses participating in our review and relevant federal agencies believed were applicable to those businesses, (2) the impact (particularly cost but also other effects) the businesses believed those regulations had on them, and (3) the regulations those businesses considered were most problematic and relevant federal agencies\u2019 responses to those concerns.", "Although our objectives were modest in comparison to those of many previous studies of regulations, we experienced a number of difficulties in conducting this review. First, most of the interest groups we contacted\u2014both critics and defenders of federal regulations\u2014did not provide the names of businesses with whom we could discuss these issues. Some of these groups cited concerns about confidentiality or the priority of other business as the reasons why they would not provide nominees. Second, most of the 51 businesses that we were able to identify and contact through other means refused to participate in our study, frequently citing time and resource constraints. Some of these businesses had publicly criticized federal regulations or regulatory processes. Third, many of the 15 businesses we contacted, which had agreed to participate in the review, did not provide information that they initially indicated that they would be able to provide. For example, although nearly all of the businesses said they could develop a list of applicable federal regulations, none of the businesses provided a complete listing. None could provide comprehensive data on the incremental costs of regulations.", "Our experience and the information we were able to collect led us to several conclusions. First, we believe that comprehensive, empirically based data about the cost of federal regulations to individual businesses do not readily exist and could not be developed without a great deal of time and effort on the part of both the regulators and the regulated community. Without such data, the cost of regulations to a business or the economy as a whole can only be roughly estimated. Second, the agencies also said that they are reexamining at least some of the federal regulations and processes that businesses found most problematic. If so, the businesses may feel some reduction in the burden associated with those regulations in the future. Third, we believe that communication between businesses and federal regulators about which regulations are applicable to particular businesses and how to comply with specific regulatory requirements is not always effective. Finally, although the agencies frequently said that problematic regulations were statutorily driven, some Members of Congress believe agencies sometimes establish regulations that go beyond the intent of Congress. This suggests that an opportunity exists for improved communication between Congress and federal regulators\u2014communication that may occur through recently enacted congressional regulatory review procedures."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cost of Regulations Is Difficult to Determine", "paragraphs": ["As previously noted, the burden associated with federal regulations is generally considered to be easier to measure than the benefits of regulations. Within the burden category, direct regulatory costs are generally regarded as easier to measure than other types of burden (e.g., negative effects on competitiveness or productivity). Conceptually and logistically, it would seem to be easier to calculate regulatory costs with regard to a single business than for an entire industry or the economy as a whole. However, our work suggests that it is extremely difficult to develop a comprehensive, data-based measure of direct incremental regulatory costs, even for an individual business.", "The first step in determining the cost of federal regulations to a business is to identify all of the regulations applicable to that business. Any comprehensive tally of a business\u2019 regulatory costs will only be as complete as its list of applicable regulations. Although nearly all of the businesses we contacted said they could develop a complete list of applicable federal regulations, none did so. As we discussed in chapter 2, development of such a list is very difficult, requiring a sophisticated understanding of the circumstances in which federal regulations apply as well as a detailed understanding of a company\u2019s business processes and products. The businesses we contacted generally did not have prepared lists of applicable regulations, and most found it difficult to distinguish between federal, state, and local regulations or said they did not have the time or resources to develop such a list. Although it may seem logical to assume that regulatory agencies would be able to easily develop a list of applicable regulations, in many cases the agencies would have to gather detailed information about the companies\u2019 business processes and products to determine regulatory applicability.", "Another step in determining the cost of regulations to a business is to obtain data on its expenditures that are directly traceable to federal regulatory requirements and estimate its incremental regulatory costs. Because most businesses would have incurred some expenses related to regulatory goals, such as a safe workplace or the prevention of environmental damage, even if no regulations existed, the incremental measure is the most appropriate gauge of a company\u2019s regulatory costs. To identify their incremental regulatory costs, businesses must subtract expenses they would have incurred in the absence of regulatory requirements from their total expenditures in such areas as worker safety or environmental protection. However, the businesses we contacted did not collect or retain data on their incremental regulatory compliance costs, probably because there is no business reason for them to do so. The businesses also indicated that they could not develop incremental cost data because they could not say what actions they would have taken or what expenses they would have incurred in the absence of regulatory requirements.", "In summary, determining the actual cost of federal regulations to a single company or the economy as a whole requires data\u2014data that the companies we visited did not have and that our work showed would be extremely difficult for them to obtain or develop. The universe of regulations for which cost data should be gathered was difficult for the companies to identify and incremental cost data could at best be roughly estimated because the businesses could not determine what expenses they would have incurred if current federal regulations did not exist. We believe that these problems are unlikely to be unique to the companies we visited. Therefore, unless the breadth of companies\u2019 regulatory responsibilities is made clear and the incremental costs of regulations can be accurately gauged, measures of the cost of regulations to a company or the economy as a whole should be viewed as estimates, not precise measures of regulatory burden. The more these estimates rely on empirical data and sound assumptions, the greater value they hold for decisionmakers. Public policymakers should use regulatory cost estimates only with a clear understanding of their underlying conceptual and methodological bases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Said Many Regulatory Concerns Are Being Addressed", "paragraphs": ["The agencies\u2019 responses to the companies\u2019 regulatory concerns also indicated that many of the regulations or regulatory processes underlying those concerns were being reviewed or had recently been changed.

They also said that new pension simplification proposals announced by the President in June 1995 would, if enacted, simplify the rules even further.\u2022 EPA said it was reexamining its data needs and ways to improve its data gathering systems for the RCRA hazardous waste management program. The agency also said that, for certain companies, it had completed a number of actions that significantly reduced the reporting burden associated with the EPCRA Form R report, thereby reducing companies\u2019 reporting requirements from nine pages to two pages. \u2022 EPA said it has published guidelines for reducing or eliminating penalties when violations are self-disclosed and corrected. EPA also said that its policy is to generally provide penalty reductions for such matters as good faith efforts to comply, ability to pay, and other factors.", "The number of times that the agencies indicated that they were taking action or had already taken action regarding areas of concern to the companies suggests that a variety of regulatory reform initiatives are under way within the federal government. As noted in chapter 1, every president in recent years has attempted to reform the regulatory process, and both the Clinton administration and Congress have recently taken a number of reform actions. The administration\u2019s National Performance Review and other initiatives in this area, such as those aimed at eliminating certain reporting requirements and reducing penalties for self-disclosed violations of certain regulations, are part of this larger effort. Also, Congress\u2019 recent assumption of a role in the review of proposed regulations also presages possible modification of regulations that Congress concludes are uneconomic or otherwise objectionable.", "We have not examined the initiatives the agencies described to determine whether they have been implemented or whether they will actually afford the businesses we talked with in this study the kind of regulatory relief they sought.

Most of the agencies said that companies\u2019 compliance responsibilities are highly situational, dependent on such factors as the companies\u2019 size, location, and decisions they make in the course of conducting their business (e.g., whether to have an underground storage tank or to have a qualified retirement plan). As a result, most of the regulatory agencies we contacted said they needed a great deal of information about a business to identify the regulations applicable to that business. Businesses also need a great deal of information about the factors that trigger regulatory coverage to identify their own regulatory compliance responsibilities. However, both the agencies and the businesses told us they could not devote the time and resources needed to develop the information they need to make those determinations.", "Interestingly, each party in the regulatory process already has the information the other party needs. Agencies know about their regulations and what characteristics of companies can determine the applicability of those regulations, but are unfamiliar with individual companies\u2019 operations and, therefore, would need to expend substantial amounts of time and energy learning about them to provide regulatory counsel. Businesses know how their organizations are configured regarding relevant regulatory determinants, but they do not always understand those determinants and, therefore, may not know about all of their regulatory compliance responsibilities.

In some of those cases, the agencies said the companies were incurring unnecessary expenses because they had misconstrued the requirements or had taken steps that the regulations did not necessarily require. Listed below are examples of inadequate communication between the agencies and companies. \u2022 Officials from Bank B said that some regulations required banks (but not investment firms) to disclose the risks that consumers face regarding certain investment products, and that about a quarter of the advertising time Bank B purchased was used to publicize these risks.

A business\u2019 regulatory compliance responsibilities can originate from any of the several dozen federal regulatory agencies, each of which separately provides information about its own regulatory programs. Therefore, although the agencies have a dizzying array of brochures, toll-free numbers, and other methods to inform businesses of their regulatory requirements, a business attempting to determine its governmentwide compliance responsibilities may have to contact each agency to obtain this information. In some cases, multiple agencies have responsibility for implementing a single statute, with each agency specifying its own functions and requirements.", "Regulatory compliance responsibilities may also differ within a particular agency. For example, EPA regulatory requirements originate from several different program units within the agency (Air and Radiation; Water; Solid Waste and Emergency Response; and Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances). Each of these units has its own informational mechanisms. EPA has established an Office of the Small Business Ombudsman and compliance assistance centers for certain industry sectors for the purpose of consolidating information from these different program offices.

However, the information that we obtained in this review suggests that the federal government\u2019s overall approach to the dissemination of regulatory information is fragmented and may be contributing to ineffective communication between regulatory agencies and the business community. We recognize that there is a natural tension that exists between regulators and those in the regulated community and that no amount of information or communication will completely eliminate disagreements and compliance problems. However, a better understanding of which regulations are applicable to a business and the requirements those regulations impose on the business is fundamental to an improved relationship between these parties.", "Agencies have recently taken steps to make information about their regulations more centralized and accessible to businesses.
