Federal agencies rely extensively  on computerized systems and electronic data to support their missions  and critical operations. Concerned with reports that continuing, pervasive  security weaknesses place federal operations at significant risk of  disruption, tampering, fraud, and inappropriate disclosures of sensitive  information, the Congress enacted the reform provisions to reduce these  risks and provide more effective oversight of federal information security.", "In my testimony today, I will first describe some of the improvement  efforts and benefits that have resulted from this first year implementation  of the reform provisions. Next, I will describe the results of our evaluation  of actions by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), 24 of the  largest federal agencies, and these agencies\u2019 inspectors general (IGs) to  implement the reform provisions. As part of this discussion, I will also  summarize the overall results of these actions and, in particular, note any  challenges to effective implementation or oversight of the reform  provisions.", "Mr. Chairman, as you know we have been conducting a review of the  implementation of the reform provisions for you and the ranking member.  Today, I will provide the preliminary results of our review. In conducting  this review, we interviewed officials and staff in the offices of the chief  information officer (CIO) and the IGs for 24 of the largest federal agencies.  We reviewed OMB guidance and instructions related to the reform  provisions and, for the 24 agencies, analyzed summaries of their  management reviews of their information security programs. Further, we  analyzed the IGs\u2019 summaries and reports on their independent evaluations  of the agencies\u2019 information security programs. We also analyzed OMB\u2019s  fiscal year 2001 report to the Congress on the results of these reviews and  evaluations.", "We performed this review from May 2001 to March 2002 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Dramatic increases in computer interconnectivity, especially in the use of  the Internet, continue to revolutionize the way our government, our  nation, and much of the world communicate and conduct business.  However, this widespread interconnectivity also poses significant risks to  our computer systems and, more important, to the critical operations and  infrastructures they support, such as telecommunications, power  distribution, public health, national defense (including the military\u2019s  warfighting capability), law enforcement, government, and emergency  services. Likewise, the speed and accessibility that create the enormous  benefits of the computer age, if not properly controlled, allow individuals  and organizations to inexpensively eavesdrop on or interfere with these  operations from remote locations for mischievous or malicious purposes,  including fraud or sabotage.", "As greater amounts of money are transferred through computer systems,  as more sensitive economic and commercial information is exchanged  electronically, and as the nation\u2019s defense and intelligence communities  increasingly rely on commercially available information technology, the  likelihood increases that information attacks will threaten vital national  interests. Further, the events of September 11, 2001, underscored the need  to protect America\u2019s cyberspace against potentially disastrous cyber  attacks\u2014attacks that could also be coordinated to coincide with physical  terrorist attacks to maximize the impact of both.", "Since September 1996, we have reported that poor information security is  a widespread federal problem with potentially devastating consequences.Although agencies have taken steps to redesign and strengthen their  information system security programs, our analyses of information  security at major federal agencies have shown that federal systems were  not being adequately protected from computer-based threats, even though  these systems process, store, and transmit enormous amounts of sensitive  data and are indispensable to many federal agency operations. In addition,  in both 1998 and 2000, we analyzed audit results for 24 of the largest  federal agencies and found that all 24 had significant information security  weaknesses. As a result of these analyses, we have identified information  security as a governmentwide high-risk issue in reports to the Congress  since 1997\u2014most recently in January 2001.", "To fully understand the significance of the weaknesses we identified, it is  necessary to link them to the risks they present to federal operations and  assets. Virtually all federal operations are supported by automated systems  and electronic data, and agencies would find it difficult, if not impossible,  to carry out their missions and account for their resources without these  information assets. Hence, the degree of risk caused by security  weaknesses is extremely high.", "The weaknesses identified place a broad array of federal operations and  assets at risk. For example, resources, such as federal payments and collections, could be lost or computer resources could be used for unauthorized purposes or to launch sensitive information, such as taxpayer data, social security records,  medical records, and proprietary business information, could be  inappropriately disclosed or browsed or copied for purposes of espionage  or other types of crime; critical operations, such as those supporting national defense and  emergency services, could be disrupted; data could be modified or destroyed for purposes of fraud or disruption; agency missions could be undermined by embarrassing incidents that  result in diminished confidence in their ability to conduct operations and  fulfill their fiduciary responsibilities.", "Concerned with accounts of attacks on commercial systems via the  Internet and reports of significant weaknesses in federal computer  systems that make them vulnerable to attack, on October 30, 2000,  Congress enacted Government Information Security Reform provisions as  part of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2001. These provisions became effective November 29, 2000, and are  in effect for 2 years after this date. The reform provisions supplement  information security requirements established in the Computer Security  Act of 1987, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, and the Clinger-Cohen  Act of 1996 and are consistent with existing information security guidance  issued by OMB and the National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST), as well as audit and best practice guidance issued by GAO. Most  importantly, however, the provisions consolidate these separate  requirements and guidance into an overall framework for managing  information security and establish new annual review, independent  evaluation, and reporting requirements to help ensure agency  implementation and both OMB and congressional oversight.", "The legislation assigned specific responsibilities to OMB, agency heads  and CIOs, and the IGs. OMB is responsible for establishing and overseeing  policies, standards and guidelines for information security. This includes  the authority to approve agency information security programs, but  delegates OMB\u2019s responsibilities with regard to national security systems  to national security agencies. OMB is also required to submit an annual  report to the Congress summarizing results of agencies\u2019 evaluations of  their information security programs. The reform provisions do not specify  a date for this report.", "Each agency, including national security agencies, is to establish an  agencywide risk-based information security program to be overseen by the  agency CIO and ensure that information security is practiced throughout  the life cycle of each agency system. Specifically, this program is to  include periodic risk assessments that consider internal and external threats to the  integrity, confidentiality, and availability of systems, and to data  supporting critical operations and assets;  the development and implementation of risk-based, cost-effective policies  and procedures to provide security protections for information collected  or maintained by or for the agency;  training on security responsibilities for information security personnel and  on security awareness for agency personnel; periodic management testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of  policies, procedures, controls, and techniques; a process for identifying and remediating any significant deficiencies; procedures for detecting, reporting and responding to security incidents; an annual program review by agency program officials.", "In addition to the responsibilities listed above, the reform provisions  require each agency to have an annual independent evaluation of its  information security program and practices, including control testing and  compliance assessment. The evaluations of non-national-security systems  are to be performed by the agency IG or an independent evaluator, and the  results of these evaluations are to be reported to OMB. For the evaluation  of national security systems, special provisions include designation of  evaluators by national security agencies, restricted reporting of evaluation  results, and an audit of the independent evaluation performed by the IG or  an independent evaluator. For national security systems, only the results  of each audit of an evaluation are to be reported to OMB.", "Finally, the reform provisions also assign additional responsibilities for  information security policies, standards, guidance, training, and other  functions to other agencies. These agencies are NIST, the Department of  Defense, the Intelligence Community, the Attorney General, the General  Services Administration (GSA), and the Office of Personnel Management.", "With oversight jurisdiction for information security, this subcommittee has  continued to hold hearings on the status of information security in the  federal government. Most recently, on November 9, 2001, the  subcommittee issued information security \u201cgrades\u201d based primarily on the  agencies\u2019 reform provision review summaries and IG evaluations that were  submitted to OMB. The overall grade for the federal government was an  \u201cF.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reform Provisions Increase Management Attention to Information Security", "paragraphs": ["The initial implementation of the reform provisions is a significant step in  addressing the serious, pervasive weaknesses in the federal government\u2019s  information security. The legislation consolidates existing security  requirements and adds new statutory requirements designed to improve  information security, such as independent evaluations and annual  reporting. In addition, implementation of the provisions has improved  agency focus on information security and resulted in important actions by  the administration.", "Although security requirements existed in law and policy before this law,  the reform provisions put into law several important additional  requirements. First, the provisions require a risk-based security  management program covering all operations and assets of the agency and  those provided or managed for the agency by others to be implemented by  agency program managers and CIOs. Instituting such an approach is  important since many agencies had not effectively evaluated their  information security risks and implemented appropriate controls. Our  studies of public and private best practices have shown that effective  security program management requires implementing a process that  provides for a cycle of risk management activities as now included in the  reform provisions. Moreover, other efforts to improve agency information  security will not be fully effective and lasting unless they are supported by  a strong agencywide security management program.", "Second, the reform provisions require an annual independent evaluation of  each agency\u2019s information security program. Individually, as well as  collectively, these evaluations can provide much needed information for  improved oversight by OMB and the Congress. Our years of auditing  agency security programs have shown that independent tests and  evaluations are essential to verifying the effectiveness of computer-based  controls. Audits can also evaluate agency implementation of management  initiatives, thus promoting management accountability. Annual  independent evaluations of agency information security programs will  help drive reform because they will spotlight both the obstacles and  progress toward improving information security and provide a means of  measuring progress, much like the financial statement audits required by  the Government Management Reform Act of 1994. Further, independent  reviews proved to be an important mechanism for monitoring progress  and uncovering problems that needed attention in the federal  government\u2019s efforts to meet the Year 2000 computing challenge.", "Third, the reform provisions take a governmentwide approach to  information security by accommodating a wide range of information  security needs and applying requirements to all agencies, including those  engaged in national security. This is important because the information  security needs of civilian agency operations and those of national security  operations have converged in recent years. In the past, when sensitive  information was more likely to be maintained on paper or in stand-alone  computers, the main concern was data confidentiality, especially as it  pertained to classified national security data. Now, virtually all agencies  rely on interconnected computers to maintain information and carry out  operations that are essential to their missions. While the confidentiality  needs of these data vary, all agencies must be concerned about the  integrity and the availability of their systems and data. It is important for  all agencies to understand these various types of risks and take  appropriate steps to manage them.", "Fourth, the annual reporting requirements provide a means for both OMB  and the Congress to oversee the effectiveness of agency and government- wide information security, measure progress in improving information  security, and consider information security in budget deliberations. In  addition to management reviews, annual IG reporting of the independent  evaluation results to OMB and OMB\u2019s reporting of these results to the  Congress provide the Congress with an objective assessment of agencies\u2019  information security programs on which to base its oversight and  budgeting activities. This reporting also facilitates a process to help ensure  consistent identification of information security weaknesses by both the  IG and agency management.", "In addition to new statutory provisions, first-year implementation of the  reform provisions has yielded significant benefits in terms of agency focus  on information security. A number of agencies stated that as a result of  implementing the reform provisions, they are taking significant steps to  improve their information security programs. For example, one agency  stated that the legislation provided it with the opportunity to identify some  systemic program-level weaknesses for which it plans to undertake  separate initiatives targeted specifically to improve the weaknesses. Other  benefits agencies observed included (1) higher visibility of information  security within the agencies, (2) increased awareness of information  security requirements among department personnel, (3) recognition that  program managers are to be held accountable for the security of their  operations, (4) greater agency consideration of security throughout the  system life cycle, and (5) justification for additional resources and funding  needed to improve security. Agency IGs also viewed the reform provisions  as a positive step towards improving information security particularly by  increasing agency management\u2019s focus on this issue.", "Implementation of the reform provisions has also resulted in important  actions by the administration, which if properly implemented, should  continue to improve information security in the federal government. For  example, OMB has issued guidance that information technology  investments will not be funded unless security is incorporated into and  funded as part of each investment, and NIST has established a Computer  Security Expert Assist Team to review agencies\u2019 computer security  management. The administration also has plans to direct all large agencies to undertake a review to identify and prioritize  critical assets within the agencies and their interrelationships with other  agencies and the private sector, as well as a cross-government review to  ensure that all critical government processes and assets have been  identified; integrate security into the President\u2019s Management Agenda Scorecard; develop workable measures of performance; develop e-training on mandatory topics, including security; and explore methods to disseminate vulnerability patches to agencies more  effectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OMB has Guided and Overseen Agency Implementation", "paragraphs": ["On January 16, 2001, OMB issued guidance to the agencies on  implementing the reform provisions that summarized OMB, agency, and IG  responsibilities, and provided answers to other specific implementation  questions. OMB followed up the implementation guidance with agency  reporting instructions first issued in draft form in April and then in final  form on June 22. These final reporting instructions directed agencies to  transmit copies of the annual agency program reviews, IG independent  evaluations, and for national security systems, audits of the independent  evaluations to OMB 3 months later, on September 10, 2001\u2014the same time  they were to submit their fiscal year 2003 budget materials. In addition to  the program reviews and evaluations, agency heads were also to provide a  brief executive summary developed by the agency CIO, agency program  officials, and the IG based on the results of their work.", "The OMB reporting instructions also listed specific topics that the  agencies were to address, many of which were referenced back to  corresponding requirements of the reform provisions. These topics, which  became the basic structure of the executive summaries submitted by the  agencies and most IGs, basically asked that agencies identify, describe, or  report:  1. \t Total security funding as found in the agency\u2019s fiscal year 2001 budget  request, fiscal year 2001 budget enacted, and the fiscal year 2002 budget  request.  2. \t The total number of programs included in the program reviews or  independent evaluations.  3. \t The methods used to conduct the program reviews and independent  evaluations.  4. \t Any material weakness in policies, procedures, or practices as identified  and required to be reported under existing law.  5. \t The specific measures and actual performance for performance measures  that agencies used to ensure that for operations and assets under their  control, agency program officials have assessed the risk, determined the  appropriate level of security, maintained an up-to-date security plan (that  is practiced throughout the life cycle) for each supporting system, and  tested and evaluated security controls and techniques.  6. \t The specific measures and actual performance for performance measures  that agencies used to ensure that the agency CIO (a) adequately maintains  an agencywide security program, (b) ensures the effective implementation  of the program and evaluates the performance of major agency  components, and (c) ensures that agency employees with significant  security responsibilities are trained.  7. \t How the agency ensures that employees are sufficiently trained in their  security responsibilities to include identifying the total number of agency  employees, the types of security training available during the reporting  period, the number of agency employees that received each type of  training, and the total costs of providing such training.", "8.", "The agency\u2019s documented procedures for reporting security incidents and  sharing information regarding common vulnerabilities.  9. \t How the agency integrates security into its capital planning and  investment control process.  10. \t The specific methodology and how it has been implemented by the agency  to identify, prioritize, and protect critical assets within its enterprise  architecture, including links with key external systems.  11. \t The specific measures and actual performance for performance measures  that the head of the agency used to ensure that the agency\u2019s information  security plan is practiced throughout the life cycle of each agency system.  12. \t How the agency has integrated its information and information technology  security program with its critical infrastructure protection responsibilities  and other security programs.  13. \t The specific methods used by the agency to ensure that contractor- provided services or services provided by another agency are adequately  secure and meet the requirements of the reform provisions and other  governmentwide and agency policy and guidance.", "The reporting instructions also included an additional requirement for  each agency head to work with the CIO and program officials to provide a  strategy to correct security weaknesses identified through the annual  program reviews, independent evaluations, other reviews or audits  performed throughout the reporting period, as well as any uncompleted  actions identified before the reporting period. Due to OMB by October 31,  2001, this information was to include a \u201cplan of action and milestones\u201d  (corrective action plan) that listed the weaknesses; showed required  resources, milestones, and completion dates; and described how the  agency planned to address these weaknesses. In response to agency  requests, on October 17, OMB provided more detailed guidance for  preparing and submitting these corrective action plans, which also  provided a sample spreadsheet-type format. The guidance also  established a requirement for agencies to submit quarterly status updates  to OMB with the first update due on January 31, 2002.", "OMB\u2019s guidance addressed many key information security requirements in  the reform provisions, and agencies generally considered the guidance  beneficial in summarizing their efforts to implement these requirements.  However, with their reports due to OMB on September 10, several  agencies questioned the timeliness of the final reporting guidance being  issued less than 3 months before this deadline.", "Several agencies also noted the need for additional clarification or  guidance in some areas. For example, our analysis of agency executive  summaries showed that many agencies did not have or were still in the  process of developing and implementing security performance measures.  Some thought additional guidance on appropriate measures would be  helpful and more cost-effective than having each agency develop its own.  Other agencies had questions regarding what should be identified and  reported as security costs in their budgets.", "In addition to providing guidance, OMB also reviewed the results of  agencies\u2019 program reviews and independent evaluations and consulted  with officials in the agencies to clarify information and provide feedback.  OMB also sent letters to the agency heads that provided the results of its  assessment of the agencies\u2019 submissions for the reform provisions and  either conditionally approved or disapproved their information security  programs. Further, OMB states in its report to the Congress that it will  discuss security corrective action plans with each agency and monitor  their progress through the quarterly updates that agencies are to submit.  These actions should contribute to OMB\u2019s effective oversight and help  focus agencies\u2019 improvement efforts. However, OMB\u2019s sustained  commitment to both implementing the reform provisions and overseeing  agencies will be critical to ensuring that agencies substantially improve  their information security programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Information Needed for Congressional Oversight", "paragraphs": ["On February 13, 2002, OMB released its required report to the Congress to  summarize the agency independent evaluations.

OMB notes that although examples of good security exist in many  agencies, and others are working very hard to improve their performance,  many agencies have significant deficiencies in every important area of  security. In particular, the report highlights six common security  weaknesses: a lack of senior management attention to information security; inadequate accountability for job and program performance related to  information technology security;  limited security training for general users, information technology  professionals, and security professionals;  inadequate integration of security into the capital planning and investment  control process; poor security for contractor-provided services; and limited capability to detect, report, and share information on  vulnerabilities or to detect intrusions, suspected intrusions, or virus  infections.", "Overall, OMB views its report to the Congress and the agency reports to be  a valuable baseline to record agency security performance\u2014a baseline  captured with more detailed information than previously available that  will be useful for oversight by agencies, IGs, OMB, GAO, and the Congress.", "While we agree and believe that OMB\u2019s report provides a useful overview  of OMB and agency efforts to comply with the reform provisions, certain  additional information not included in the report is necessary to fully  assess and oversee these efforts. The lack of such important information  limits congressional oversight for agencies\u2019 implementation, compliance,  and corrective action efforts, as well as for budget deliberations.  Specifically, OMB\u2019s report does not address the following:", "The report does not provide any specific analysis or opinion on the  adequacy of agency corrective action plans that were submitted to OMB in  late October of last year and included the planned timeframes for  correcting security weaknesses. Agency corrective actions are underway,  and while OMB indicated that performance in implementing these plans  would be reflected in next year\u2019s report, information about the adequacy  and reasonableness of such plans and the related costs to implement them,  as well as an independent review, are important elements in congressional  oversight and budget deliberations. In August 2001, OMB sent a  memorandum to agency heads stating that it considered all reform  provision material prepared by the CIOs for OMB to be predecisional and  not releasable the public, the Congress, or GAO. In September, this  subcommittee interceded to request that OMB provide the agency  executive summaries to you, and OMB complied with this request.  Recently, OMB agreed that it would also authorize the agencies to release  the more detailed material to us after the agencies redact any sensitive  information. OMB has continued to restrict access to agency corrective  action plans. We plan to continue working with OMB in an effort to find  workable solutions to obtain the information needed for congressional  oversight. With the president requesting $4.2 billion for information  security funding for fiscal year 2003, congressional oversight of future  spending on information security will be important to ensuring that  agencies are not using the funds they receive to continue ad hoc,  piecemeal security fixes that are not supported by a strong agency risk  management process. Accordingly, OMB should consider authorizing  agencies to release appropriate information from the corrective action  plans to the Congress. Also, future IG evaluations need to provide an  independent assessment of agency corrective action plans.", "The report discusses review results for national security systems in several  individual agency summaries, but does not summarize the overall results  of the audits of the evaluations for these systems, which the reform  provisions specifically require agencies to provide OMB and OMB to  report subsequently to the Congress. This lack of an overall summary was  compounded by limited access to information regarding national security  systems by the director of central intelligence (DCI). The reform  provisions assign the DCI and the secretary of defense specific  responsibilities for national security systems, including developing and  ensuring that information security policies, standards, and guidelines are  implemented and designating the entity to perform the independent  evaluation of the information security program and practices for these  systems. As part of our review, DCI staff declined to meet with us to  discuss the guidance and assistance they provided agencies to implement  the reform provisions for national security systems. The DCI stated that  our inquiry related to matters of intelligence oversight, which are under  the purview of the congressional entities charged with overseeing the  intelligence community. While evaluations and audits of evaluations for  systems under the control of the DCI are available only to the appropriate  oversight committees of Congress, OMB is required to report to the  Congress on the results of audits of evaluations that the agencies submit to  OMB for national security systems. We acknowledge the sensitivity of this  information. Nevertheless, because the review, evaluation, and reporting  requirements of the reform provisions apply to national security systems,  as well as non-national-security systems, this lack of high-level summary  information on implementation of the provisions and the security for  national security systems limits the ability of the Congress to provide  governmentwide oversight for information security.

However, the report does not address the status or  effectiveness of the agencies\u2019 efforts to implement specific requirements  of an agencywide information security program such as conducting risk  assessments and testing and evaluating controls. OMB addresses these  requirements in its individual agency summaries, but does not provide any  overall results. Our analyses showed that most agencies have not fully  implemented requirements to assess risk and test and evaluate controls  and that this represents systemic weaknesses in the federal government\u2019s  information security. Such requirements are critical elements of an overall  information security program, and the Congress should be fully informed  on the status of agency efforts to implement and comply with them.

Moreover, an annual independent  evaluation of agency information security programs will help drive reform  because it will spotlight both the obstacles and progress toward improving  information security.", "For this first-year evaluation and reporting for the reform provisions, IGs  primarily performed the independent evaluations and largely relied on  existing or ongoing work to evaluate agency security, most of which was  related to their financial statement audits. With the reform provisions  applicable to essentially all major systems including national security  systems, as well as other types of risk beyond financial statements, future  IG independent evaluation efforts will have to expand their coverage to  include such additional risks and more nonfinancial systems, particularly  for agencies with significant nonfinancial operations such as the  departments of Defense and Justice. An important step toward ensuring  information security is to fully understand the weaknesses that exist, and  as the body of audit evidence expands, it is probable that additional  significant deficiencies will be identified. However, this expanded  coverage will also place a significant new burden on existing audit  capabilities, which will require ensuring that agency IGs have sufficient  resources to either perform or contract for the needed work.", "While no format was prescribed for their evaluation reports, most IGs  prepared an executive summary and report which, at OMB\u2019s request,  addressed the specific topics identified in OMB\u2019s reporting guidance.

For the most part and particularly where the CIO and IG  offices coordinated their responses, the IG evaluations were consistent  with what the agencies reported. However, there were areas where the  CIO reviews and the IG evaluations did not agree in their assessments of  the agencies\u2019 progress in implementing the requirements of the reform  provisions.

To  summarize these identified weaknesses, we also analyzed the results of IG  and GAO audit reports published from July 2000 through September 2001,  including the results of the IGs\u2019 independent evaluations.

As a result, they did not have  system reviews they could use to help respond to review requirements of  the reform provisions. In addition, several agencies sought contractor  assistance, but said that delays in obtaining this help limited what they  could do in time to meet the September 10 deadline for reporting to OMB.", "For example, one agency was still trying to obtain contractor services as  late as July 2001 with the reporting deadline only 2 months away. Also,  several agencies noted that late final guidance from OMB on reporting also  limited what they could do to gather and report information. Many  agencies also had not maintained data that OMB requested be reported,  such as training statistics and actual performance measure results that  would help them demonstrate the extent to which they had met security  requirements.", "One final challenge emphasized by many agencies was the need for  adequate funding to implement security requirements. Several agencies  noted that funding limitations had directly affected their ability to  implement existing security requirements and, thus, affected their  compliance with the reform provisions. Although, in most instances, this  issue involved a lack of funding, in at least one agency, CIO staff pointed  to specific security funding the agency received as key to the improvement  efforts it has undertaken in recent years.", "While citing funding as an implementation challenge, agencies apparently  had difficulty identifying how much they spend related to information  security. The security costs that OMB requested agencies to report were  not provided in some cases. In addition, for costs that were provided,  there was no detail as to what these costs consisted of or how they are  actually reflected in agency budget submissions.

On the basis of the final costs shown in OMB\u2019s report  to the Congress, we present, in figure 2, the 24 agencies\u2019 fiscal year 2002  security funding as a percentage of their total information technology  spending. These percentages range from a high of 17.0 percent for the  Department of Labor to a low of 1.0 percent for the Department of  Agriculture.", "OMB reports that it assessed the agencies\u2019 performance against the  amount they spent and did not find that increased security spending equals  increased security performance.

We also agree with  OMB that much can be done to cost-effectively address common  weaknesses, such as security training, across government rather than  piecemeal by agency.  At the same time, however, agencies have specific  weaknesses that they must correct. OMB has required agencies to identify  these weaknesses and to indicate the level of resources required to correct  them in their corrective action plans.", "From the IGs\u2019 perspective, several have indicated that the requirement for  an annual evaluation will represent a challenge because of their difficulty  in obtaining adequate resources in today\u2019s competitive market for  information security professionals.

The president also (1) appointed a special advisor for  cyberspace security to coordinate interagency efforts to secure  information systems and (2) created the President\u2019s Critical Infrastructure  Protection Board to recommend policies and coordinate programs for  protecting information for critical infrastructure. The board is to include a  standing committee for executive branch information systems security,  chaired by an OMB designee.", "These actions are laudable. However, given recent events and reports that  critical operations and assets continue to be highly vulnerable to  computer-based attacks, the government still faces a challenge in ensuring  that risks from cyber threats are appropriately addressed in the context of  the broader array of risks to the nation\u2019s welfare. Accordingly, it is  important that federal information security efforts be guided by a  comprehensive strategy for improvement. In 1998, shortly after the initial  issuance of Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 63 on protecting the  nation\u2019s critical infrastructure, we recommended that OMB, which, by law,  is responsible for overseeing federal information security, and the  assistant to the president for national security affairs work together to  ensure that the roles of new and existing federal efforts were coordinated  under a comprehensive strategy. Our more recent reviews of the National  Infrastructure Protection Center and of broader federal efforts to counter  computer-based attacks showed that there was a continuing need to  clarify responsibilities and critical infrastructure protection objectives.As the administration refines the strategy that it has begun to lay out in  recent months, it is imperative that it takes steps to ensure that  information security receives appropriate attention and resources and that  known deficiencies are addressed.", "First, it is important that the federal strategy delineate the roles and  responsibilities of the numerous entities involved in federal information  security and related aspects of critical infrastructure protection. Under  current law, OMB is responsible for overseeing and coordinating federal  agency security, and NIST, with assistance from the National Security  Agency, is responsible for establishing related standards. In addition,  interagency bodies\u2014such as the CIO Council and the entities created  under PDD 63 on critical infrastructure protection\u2014are attempting to  coordinate agency initiatives. Although these organizations have  developed fundamentally sound policies and guidance and have  undertaken potentially useful initiatives, effective improvements are not  yet taking place. Further, it is unclear how the activities of these many  organizations interrelate, who should be held accountable for their  success or failure, and whether they will effectively and efficiently support  national goals.", "Second, more specific guidance to agencies on the controls that they need  to implement could help ensure adequate protection. Currently, agencies  have wide discretion in deciding what computer security controls to  implement and the level of rigor with which to enforce these controls. In  theory, this discretion is appropriate since, as OMB and NIST guidance  states, the level of protection that agencies provide should be  commensurate with the risk to agency operations and assets. In essence,  one set of specific controls will not be appropriate for all types of systems  and data. Nevertheless, our studies of best practices at leading  organizations have shown that more specific guidance is important. In  particular, specific mandatory standards for varying risk levels can clarify  expectations for information protection, including audit criteria; provide a  standard framework for assessing information security risk; help ensure  that shared data are appropriately protected; and reduce demands for  limited resources to independently develop security controls.  Implementing such standards for federal agencies would require  developing a single set of information classification categories for use by  all agencies to define the criticality and sensitivity of the various types of  information they maintain. It would also necessitate establishing minimum  mandatory requirements for protecting information in each classification  category.", "Third, ensuring effective implementation of agency information security  and critical infrastructure protection plans will require active monitoring  by the agencies to determine if milestones are being met and testing to  determine if policies and controls are operating as intended. Routine  periodic audits, such as those required by the reform provisions, would  allow for more meaningful performance measurement. In addition, the  annual evaluation, reporting, and monitoring process established through  these provisions, is an important mechanism, previously missing, to hold  agencies accountable for implementing effective security and to manage  the problem from a governmentwide perspective.", "Fourth, the Congress and the executive branch can use audit results to  monitor agency performance and take whatever action is deemed  advisable to remedy identified problems. Such oversight is essential for  holding agencies accountable for their performance, as was demonstrated  by the OMB and congressional efforts to oversee the Year 2000 computer  challenge.", "Fifth, agencies must have the technical expertise they need to select,  implement, and maintain controls that protect their information systems.  Similarly, the federal government must maximize the value of its technical  staff by sharing expertise and information. Highlighted during the Year  2000 challenge, the availability of adequate technical and audit expertise is  a continuing concern to agencies.", "Sixth, agencies can allocate resources sufficient to support their  information security and infrastructure protection activities. Funding for  security is already embedded to some extent in agency budgets for  computer system development efforts and routine network and system  management and maintenance. However, some additional amounts are  likely to be needed to address specific weaknesses and new tasks. OMB  and congressional oversight of future spending on information security  will be important to ensuring that agencies are not using the funds they  receive to continue ad hoc, piecemeal security fixes that are not supported  by a strong agency risk management process.", "Seventh, expanded research is needed in the area of information systems  protection. While a number of research efforts are underway, experts have  noted that more is needed to achieve significant advances. As the director  of the CERT\u00ae Coordination Center testified before this subcommittee last  September, \u201cIt is essential to seek fundamental technological solutions and  to seek proactive, preventive approaches, not just reactive, curative  approaches.\u201d In addition, in its December 2001 third annual report, the  Advisory Panel to Assess Domestic Response Capabilities for Terrorism  Involving Weapons of Mass Destruction (also known as the Gilmore  Commission) recommended that the Office of Homeland Security develop  and implement a comprehensive plan for research, development, test, and  evaluation to enhance cyber security.", "In summary, first-year implementation of the reform provisions has  resulted in a number of positive initiatives and benefits, and OMB, the  agencies, and the IGs all undertook efforts to implement these provisions.  However, faced with limited past efforts to implement security and other  obstacles, agencies in their reviews did not provide the scope or depth of  coverage intended, particularly in testing and evaluating controls. The IGs  also had to rely primarily on their existing work for this first-year effort.  Consequently, much work remains to be done to achieve the objectives of  the reform legislation. In addition, OMB did not report to the Congress on  key elements of the provisions, such as the adequacy of agencies\u2019  corrective action plans and overall evaluation results for national security  systems, or provide supporting information. We plan to continue to work  with OMB in an effort to find workable solutions to obtain the information  needed for congressional oversight. These factors limit congressional  insight into the status of information security for the federal government,  as well as its ability to perform its responsibilities for oversight and budget  deliberations. Further, with the increasing threat to critical federal  operations and assets and poor federal information security, as indicated  by reform provision reviews and evaluations, it is imperative that the  administration and the agencies implement a comprehensive strategy for  improvement that emphasizes information security and addresses known  weaknesses.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
