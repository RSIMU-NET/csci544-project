The funds collected would be submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to pay for its administrative and enforcement costs in carrying out the act, and any remaining funds would be used to pay expenses related to border protection.

Concerns about the reliability and  consistency of remittance estimates from the Group of Eight and other  international observers have led to the creation of a guide that aims to  substantially improve the quality of remittance data. In 2009, the  Luxembourg Group on Remittances, which included representatives from  the IMF, World Bank, Organization for Economic Co-operation and  Development (OECD), Eurostat and national statistical offices and central  banks from countries around the world, produced detailed guidance that  includes recommendations for best practices in collecting information  about and estimating remittances.", "In January 2015, the Remittance Status Verification Act of 2015 was  introduced in the U.S. Senate. The proposed legislation would amend  the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) to require remittance transfer  providers to request that all senders of remittance transfers to recipients  outside of the United States provide proof of their legal status under the  immigration laws. The proposed legislation would require remittance  transfer providers to impose a fine on any sender unable to provide proof  of immigration status and would also include a provision for GAO to study  the act\u2019s effects. In states that require proof of legal residence, acceptable  documentation for showing proof of legal status under the proposed law  would include a state-issued driver\u2019s license or federal passport, or the  same documentation as required by the state for proof of identity for the  issuance of a driver\u2019s license or as required for a federal passport.

Finally, we constructed a set of  hypothetical scenarios using factors that would affect the amount of  revenue generated for border protection. We varied the following factors  to highlight the uncertainty associated with estimates of net revenue from  the fine: dollar amounts of remittances sent by immigrants without legal  status, the percentage reduction in remittances in response to the fine,  and administrative and enforcement costs associated with the fine.

In a number of developing  economies, remittances have become an important and stable source of  funds that exceeds revenues from exports of goods and services and  financial inflows from foreign direct investment.", "Remittances can be sent through formal transfer systems and informal  methods. Formal systems typically include banks, credit unions, money  transfer businesses such as wire services, and postal services. In the  United States, providers of remittance transfer services (including bank  and nonbank institutions) are subject to federal oversight and, depending  on the state in which they operate, can be subject to supervision by  states. According to CFPB, nonbank remittance transfer providers sent  an estimated 150 million individual transfers from the United States in  2012. Informal remittance transfer methods include hand-carried cash,  courier services, and agents known as hawalas.", "Individuals can transfer remittance funds in several ways, such as  1.  cash payments to individuals and bank accounts;  2.  prepaid debit or credit cards; and  3.  online and through mobile devices.", "Global remittance estimates are published annually by some international  organizations on an annual basis. IMF collects data on components of  remittances submitted by its member countries, including the United  States, as part of its annual publication of balance of payments  statistics. IMF\u2019s Balance of Payments and International Investment  Position Manual provides a framework for identifying individual remittance  flows that benefit households. According to IMF, this framework can be  applied by all countries and should lead to some level of comparability  among them. The World Bank uses IMF statistics to produce an annual  Migration and Remittances Factbook and monthly and annual remittances  data on its website. Other international organizations, such as the IDB  through the Multilateral Investment Fund, also produce annual reports on  remittance estimates. In the United States, BEA is responsible for  compiling the official U.S. estimates. Other nations may delegate the  official estimation of remittances to central banks or specific government  agencies.", "In response to requests from policymakers, remittance data compilers,  and other data users, IMF and the World Bank published a guide for  compilers and users of remittances data. The purpose of the guide is to  promote lasting improvements in remittances data, which it seeks to  accomplish by summarizing the definitions and concepts related to the  balance of payments framework and by providing practical compilation  guidance. Two items in the guide that substantially relate to remittances  are \u201cpersonal transfers\u201d and \u201ccompensation of employees,\u201d both of which  countries are required to report to IMF. Personal transfers are a measure  of all transfers in cash or in kind made or received by resident households  to or from nonresident individuals and households. Compensation of  employees is a measure of the income of short-term workers in an  economy where they are not resident and of the income of resident  workers who are employed by a nonresident entity. The guide also  defines additional measures related to remittances, which countries are  encouraged but not required to report. For example, personal remittances  represent the sum of personal transfers, net compensation of employees,  and capital transfers between households, according to the guide.", "Institutions use different methodologies to produce estimates of  remittances. For example, BEA uses demographic and household survey  data and a model that calculates the remittance rates by demographic  group to create the official estimate of remittances from the United States.  The World Bank has developed its own methodology to create remittance  estimates. Its research group produces country-specific development  indicators and international development statistics. The World Bank then  complements these data with information from the IMF\u2019s Balance of  Payments and International Investment Position Manual to create annual  and semi-annual remittance estimates.", "Since 2010, researchers at the World Bank have also used United  Nations population data to develop a bilateral migration matrix, which  provides a second set of country-specific bilateral remittance estimates\u2014 that is, estimates between sending and receiving countries. These  estimates are based on the number of migrants in different destination  countries and estimates of how changes in the income of migrants  influence the remittances they send. IDB\u2019s Multilateral Investment Fund  has a different methodology, using estimates reported by central banks to  IMF as a baseline for individual country estimates. The Multilateral  Investment Fund then works with the Center for Latin American Monetary  Studies to help refine remittance estimates for selected countries in the  Latin America and Caribbean region.", "Finally, some central banks use a combination of methods to estimate  remittances. The central bank of Mexico, known as Banco de M\u00e9xico,  tracks remittance flows to Mexico with the help of regulatory reporting  requirements on money transmitters. Since 2003, Mexico\u2019s methodology  for estimating remittances has required firms that receive remittances to  report, on a monthly basis, the amount of money received and the  number of transactions conducted between the United States and  Mexico. To track remittances through informal channels, such as couriers  that fall outside this regulatory framework, Banco de M\u00e9xico conducts a  survey at the U.S.-Mexico border of Mexicans entering the country. The  central bank of the Philippines, known as Bangko Sentral Ng Pilipinas,  estimates remittances that are channeled through banks. The Philippine  government also has established a formal program for registering and  tracking overseas Filipino workers. This program provides data to the  government on the type of employment these workers obtain as well as  their salaries. The Bangko Sentral Ng Pilipinas also uses the Survey of  Overseas Filipinos to supplement data from the program.

The revenue raised by the fine would depend on  the dollar amount of remittances sent by those individuals in the  United States without legal immigration status and, specifically by  those using regulated remittance transfer providers. According to  three studies we identified during discussions with experts, estimates  of unauthorized U.S. immigrants in 2012 ranged from 11.1 million to  11.4 million people. Of that number, only those who conduct  transactions through providers that are subject to EFTA would actually  pay a fine, should they continue to use such providers, and that  number is unknown.", "The response to the fine by individuals in the United States without  legal status, including a reduction in remittances through regulated  providers. If individuals without legal status respond to the fine by  making money transfers that may not be subject to EFTA  requirements, by remitting less, or leveraging connections with  immigrants with legal status, the amount of revenue raised by the fine  would be lower. Representatives from almost all of the organizations  we spoke with, including providers, researchers, federal agencies,  and community groups, stated that remitters without legal status may  be deterred by the fine and the additional scrutiny around their  immigration status. The amount of revenue generated by the fine  would also depend on the extent to which those without legal  immigration status continue to use regulated systems after the fine is  imposed instead of switching to informal methods, such as hawalas.  Two articles identified in our literature search noted that those without  legal status may use methods that allow them to maintain a higher  degree of anonymity. For example, those without legal immigration  status may have relatives or friends who are authorized to be in the  United States send remittances for them, potentially lowering the  amount of revenue raised by a fine.", "Conversely, if most remitters continue to remit the same amount, and  continue to remit through regulated channels, the total amount remitted  may remain stable, and more revenue will be raised. Research experts,  officials from industry, community groups, and some federal agencies  with which we spoke suggested that some remitters unable to provide  proof of legal status may send the remittance and pay the fine, but the  exact percentage is unknown. While the effect of the fine depends heavily  on the remitting behavior of individuals without legal immigration status  and their response to the fine, limited information exists on how many of  these individuals remit or the extent to which they rely on regulated  methods. In the absence of definitive studies on remitting behavior, the  extent to which immigrants use regulated or informal methods for  remitting and how they will respond to price increases is unknown.", "If the costs of the fine, including costs for providers to implement the  requirements of the proposed legislation, are passed on to the remitter in  the form of a price increase, remitters might reduce the amounts or the  frequency with which they remit. Information on price sensitivity\u2014how  senders respond to an increase in price\u2014is limited. According to a CFPB  report and a remittance transfer provider with whom we spoke, remitters\u2019  response to higher prices may partly depend on knowledge of other  available options, including access to information about fees charged by  other providers. Behavioral changes could substantially limit the amount  of revenue generated for border protection.", "Administrative and enforcement costs associated with the fine.", "Although the regulatory costs associated with the proposed legislation  are unknown, CFPB officials told us that the agency would incur  expenses associated with implementing the legislation and ensuring  compliance. According to CFPB, these expenses would include the  costs of developing rules, examining remittance transfer providers,  and cooperating with other federal agencies on enforcement actions  against noncompliant institutions. Other federal regulators also  enforce EFTA for their regulated entities, and state regulators also  may play a role in oversight of remittance transfer providers. As the  revenue for the fine would be used first to reimburse CFPB for  administrative and enforcement costs to carry out the proposed  legislation, high costs to CFPB for these activities would mean less  net revenue available for border protection. Uncertainty in these  costs would contribute to uncertainty in how much revenue remains  for border protection.", "Given the uncertainty related to these important factors, we constructed a  scenario analysis to illustrate how the revenue generated for border  protection could vary based on the values we assume for the following,  given our starting assumptions about the total volume of remittances and  proportion of those in the formal sector:  1.  the dollar amount of remittances sent by immigrants without legal  2.  the reduction in remittances through regulated providers in response  to the request to show proof of legal status or pay a fine, and  3.  the magnitude of administrative and enforcement costs to CFPB.", "The scenarios are hypothetical because the factors used to generate the  results were selected solely to demonstrate the uncertainty in how much  revenue would be collected. They are not supported by empirical  research or evidence. The selected scenarios we illustrate are from a  larger number that we analyzed to examine how sensitive net revenue  from fines is to the factors. The three factors shown in figure 2 illustrate  the potentially wide variation in net revenue from fines. In our analysis, we  begin by assuming that the total volume of remittances is $50 billion and  50 percent of the total volume of remittances is sent through regulated  providers. The scenario analysis varies the three factors above, thereby  demonstrating the breadth of uncertainty in potential net revenue.", "As figure 2 demonstrates, when the factors vary potential net revenue  from fines can change significantly. For example, one scenario with no  change in the amount of remittances and low administrative and  enforcement costs could provide $0.41 billion in potential net revenue for  border protection. In contrast, another scenario with a 75 percent  reduction in remittances after the fine and high administrative and  enforcement costs would generate potential net revenue of only $0.01  billion. In some cases, the cost incurred by CFPB could be more than the  revenue from the fine. For example, a small dollar amount of remittances  sent by immigrants without legal status, large reductions in remittances,  and high administrative and enforcement costs could lead to negative net  revenue. Obtaining reasonable estimates of net revenue would depend  upon having accurate, reliable, and complete information on the amount  immigrants without legal status remit and their response to a requirement  for providers to request proof of legal status or assess a fine, as well as  administrative and enforcement costs. In the absence of such information,  the potential net revenue a fine would generate is unknown."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proposed Legislation Raises Other Issues for CFPB", "paragraphs": ["Officials from CFPB noted that in addition to creating uncertainty about  administrative and enforcement costs, the proposed legislation, if passed,  would require CFPB to address other issues, including issuing new rules  to define what constitutes proof of legal status and to establish  procedures for submitting fines, as well as coordinating with other  regulators.", "As noted earlier, CFPB would be required to define by rule what  constitutes acceptable documentation in states that do not require  proof of legal status to obtain a state-issued driver\u2019s license or a  federal passport.", "CFPB would need to coordinate with other financial regulators. For  example, the proposed legislation calls for remittance transfer  providers to submit the fines to CFPB and for CFPB to then transfer to  Treasury any remaining funds after the payment of CFPB\u2019s  administrative and enforcement costs. However as noted previously,  other federal regulators have the authority to enforce EFTA for the  entities they supervise, including enforcing the remittance provisions  against those supervised entities that are remittance transfer  providers under the act.

CFPB staff told  us that CFPB does not currently levy fines on consumers. Instead,  CFPB levies monetary sanctions and brings other enforcement  actions against consumer finance businesses and other persons in  connection with violations of Federal consumer financial law.

Without any corresponding  reduction in cost, the decrease in remittances might decrease profits for  some providers, but by how much is uncertain. Prior experience with  legislation passed in Oklahoma in 2009 may demonstrate effects similar  to those that could result from the proposed legislation though there are  some key differences between the two. The Oklahoma law imposed a  $5 fee on each wire transfer from a nondepository institution, and 1  percent of the amount of the transaction, if any, in excess of $500.  When making a transfer, all persons regardless of immigration status  were required to pay the fee. Under the Oklahoma law, customers who  paid the fee are entitled to an income tax credit equal to the amount paid  when filing individual income taxes in Oklahoma with either a valid Social  Security number or a valid taxpayer identification number. The tax credit  in effect means that those customers without a Social Security or  taxpayer identification number are not eligible for the state income tax  credit and therefore will have paid the remittance fee without being able to  obtain a credit or refund.", "Statements of four remittance transfer providers with operations in  Oklahoma suggest that the law has had mixed effects. According to two  providers, revenues decreased once the law was in place. Two providers  told us that transaction activity in the state had fallen. One other provider  stated that their company had still not recovered from the decline in  revenue. This provider told us that the decreased number of transactions  was the result of remittances that moved to out of state providers or from  regulated to informal channels. The other two providers we interviewed  noticed decreases in remittances, although they noted they did not have a  large presence in Oklahoma. Also, one official from a state audit  association noted that fee revenues for the State of Oklahoma continued  to increase after the first year of the imposition of the fee. Remittance  transfer providers, industry associations, research experts, and some  federal agencies we met with said that they expected to see revenues  decrease in the regulated market if the proposed law (S.79) were passed,  as it would send remittances to the informal market.", "New proof-of-legal status requirements and fine collection could also  increase remittance transfer providers\u2019 costs. Such potential costs were  noted by almost all providers, and representatives from industry  associations we spoke to. Several providers noted that they might need to  pay for new computer infrastructure and databases, staff training, and  compliance. One provider pointed out that just to add a new variable  listing information on customers to an existing information system was a  9-month process that would involve testing and validation.  Representatives of an industry association and one remittance transfer  provider cited potential costs related to maintaining databases used to  verify legal status.", "Remittance transfer providers could also face increased compliance costs  related to new requirements. In some cases, providers told us that  compliance costs could be significant. For example, some providers said  that they had made significant investments to comply with the fee and  exchange rate disclosures and other requirements implemented through  amendments to Regulation E after the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act,  such as developing procedures to electronically disclose the fees charged  by the provider. Another provider said that it had spent more than $3  million on technology enhancements and customer service teams to  satisfy the requirements of the rule. Still another provider noted that the  company spent about 3 percent to 4 percent of its revenue on the legal  compliance budget.", "One representative of a transfer provider whom we interviewed said that  the company might be able to incorporate compliance requirements into  its Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)/anti-money-laundering (AML) efforts.  BSA/AML requirements for institutions that provide money transfer  services include, among other things, collecting sender identification for  each transfer in the amount of $3,000 or more. Banks are also required  to implement a customer identification program, under which they  establish procedures specifying what identifying information they will  collect when customers open accounts. However, other providers noted  that collecting identification is not the same as verifying legal status. For  example, several providers accepted the Matr\u00edcula Consular de Alta  Seguridad, which is an official identity card that Mexican Consulates issue  to nationals living outside Mexico. As previously discussed, under the  Remittance Status Verification Act this card would not be an acceptable  form of identification for proving legal status within the United States for  purposes of the act. One provider we spoke with explained that not all  states require proof of legal status before issuing a driver\u2019s license or  other form of identification. Forms of identification that demonstrate legal  status may vary from state to state. It could be difficult for money transfer  clerks to know what form of identification to collect, particularly when  remitters may hold identification from other states.", "Some providers and one trade association also noted that the proposed  legislation would require additional staff training. For example, one  provider said that the company operated through many retail outlets, such  as grocery stores and gas stations, and it would not be practical to train  all store clerks to determine the appropriate form of identification to show  legal residency status. Another provider stated that it would be a  significant challenge to train all agents\u2014retail outlets that conduct  transactions for the provider\u2014on the documentation they would be  responsible for collecting for proof of legal status. A trade association  noted the difficulty and potential expense of training staff on how to  properly check for proof of legal status; calculate, disclose, and collect the  fine; and put the transaction in a database.", "How much of the fine and added cost would be absorbed by the provider  or retail outlet partly depends upon the competitiveness of the market.  Remittance transfer providers stated that in competitive markets with a  number of providers and a variety of methods for transmitting money, the  demand for remittances is more sensitive to prices. For example, one  provider indicated that it lost customers when its prices were only  marginally higher than those charged by other providers. With the  prospect of losing more customers and revenue, one provider with whom  we spoke stated that it might choose to absorb some of the fine and  added cost instead of passing it on. One provider we spoke with expected  that the added costs would increase the costs passed on to consumers  by 3 to 4 percentage points. If these costs were passed on in such a  manner, all consumers, regardless of legal status, could experience an  increase in the price of remittance transfers that are sent to a foreign  country.", "In addition, certain providers might be disproportionately affected by the  requirements of the proposed legislation.

For its revised model, BEA employed a  multiplicative model\u2014that is, a model whose results are the product of the  combined effects produced by the individual variables. It used a  nonstandard iterative technique to estimate the remittance rates. These  rates show the proportion of income that is remitted. To obtain total  remittances, the remittance rates for different demographic categories  can be multiplied by the number of individuals in those categories and  their incomes. In its new methodology, BEA combined the new remittance  rates from its revised model with ACS data on foreign-born residents and  their income to estimate total remittances sent annually from the United  States (see fig. 4).", "The availability of nationally representative data on remittances in the  CPS with actual reported numbers on remittances provided BEA with an  opportunity to revise the model it created in 2005.

Therefore, in 2012 BEA changed the new model by,  removing U.S. citizens born abroad of American parents, assuming  that this group\u2019s remittance behavior would be similar to the behavior  of U.S. born who were not included in their study;  replacing the \u201cchildren/no children\u201d category with \u201cmarried, spouse  absent/other marital,\u201d because those in the latter category were more  likely to send remittances to spouses abroad and were thus a better  predictor of remittances; adding the category \u201cliving with roommates/other living  arrangements,\u201d assuming that people shared housing to save money  and therefore could send more remittances;  combining immigrants who had been in the United States for 16 to 30  years with those who had been in the country for longer than 30 years  into one category, \u201c15 plus years,\u201d as they found in CPS data that  these two categories had similar remittance rates; and  reallocating countries within pre-existing geographical tiers as BEA  found that their previous country allocations were not the best match  for the CPS data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BEA\u2019s Methodology Resulted in Unreliable Estimates, Partly Due to its Failure to Follow Best Practices and Guidelines for Federal Statistical Agencies", "paragraphs": ["We found several issues with BEA\u2019s methodology that resulted in  unreliable remittance estimates.

We were unable to verify the accuracy of the data because we  were not provided with documents detailing the steps and analyses  BEA undertook to convert CPS data to the dataset BEA actually used  to estimate the model. A BEA best practice states that an analysis of  the estimate should include a discussion of questionable aspects of  the source data, including outliers. However, BEA could not provide  us with documents showing analyses performed to deal with various  problematic aspects of the data and treatment of outliers. In  addition, BEA conducts an analysis to assign a portion of the  household\u2019s income to each individual in the household. The income  amount attributed to each individual is a critical component of the  model and has a substantial effect on the result, yet BEA could not  provide any documents showing sensitivity analyses of this critical  assumption to see how the attribution of income affects its results.  Further, for some households that did not have any family income in  CPS data, BEA assigned them incomes but could not tell us how they  calculated them. BEA also assigned all households within a given  range of family income the same income. This approach introduces  measurement error to the extent that households within a given range  of family income do not, in fact, have the same income. BEA could not  provide any documentation explaining these details or what  implications the assigned incomes could have on its results.", "Estimation Technique. As described earlier, BEA used a nonstandard  iterative technique to estimate its model. BEA staff acknowledged that  the method was unusual and may be hard to comprehend.

However, officials later said the review was informal and no  written opinion was provided.", "Model specification.

BEA\u2019s model  assumption that all individuals within a demographic category remit on  average the same percentage of their income is inconsistent with its  data, which show that 75 percent of households remit nothing at all.  Moreover, BEA\u2019s model generates remittance rates for certain  categories of households that have no individuals in them. For  example, the model calculates that individuals in households with  married persons with absent spouses who have roommates, who  remit to low-tier countries, and who have spent 6 to 15 years in the  United States, remit 8.5 percent of their income. However, there are  no such individuals in the data. BEA failed to point out these data  deficiencies even though OMB\u2019s Statistical Policy Directive No.4 asks  agencies to clearly point out limitations of the data to users.", "Failure to account for censored data leads to biased results. Because  the value of reported remittances is only partially known, BEA\u2019s  remittance data are censored data. The remittance data are censored  (at the bottom) because 75 percent of households remit $0 and all  other households remit positive sums. The remittance data are  censored (at the top) because, as noted earlier, the CPS assigns all  households that remit over $10,000 a remittance value of $27,199.  Estimating a model on censored data demands certain econometric  techniques, which BEA has not adopted, in order to yield unbiased  estimates. The guidelines presented by NRC as mentioned above  specifically ask agencies to use appropriate methods for analysis that  take account of variability and other sources of error.", "BEA\u2019s model is incorrectly specified in its documentation, and the  actual model specification may lead to biases. BEA\u2019s documentation  states that its model explains the total amount remitted by a  household (in part) in terms of that household\u2019s income level.  However, BEA\u2019s model assumes that the total amount remitted by a  household depends only on the income of the foreign-born individuals  in the household. To the extent that U.S.-born individuals in a  household do remit, BEA\u2019s model overestimates the fraction of  income remitted by foreign-born individuals in that household. BEA  officials said that they excluded U.S.-born individuals from a  household on the basis that they remitted very little. But we found that  407 households with only U.S.-born individuals reported remitting  almost 13 percent of total remittances, suggesting that the remittance  rates of foreign-born individuals may be overestimated and, thus,  biased.", "Measurement errors in a critical explanatory variable bias the results.", "As explained earlier, BEA\u2019s assignment of household income to  individuals within the household is critical to its analysis. Since this  individual income variable is subject to measurement error, it biases  the effect of this variable on the remittance rates, contributing to the  unreliability of the remittance estimates calculated by BEA.", "Several coding and other errors also contributed to inaccuracy. BEA  staff said that they considered the estimation of the personal transfers  model a relatively straightforward task. As such, they did not  consider independent programming of code by a reviewer necessary.  We found several errors and unexplained adjustments in BEA\u2019s code  that might have been detected had a review been conducted.", "Calibration of this new model to match unreliable old estimates  enhanced unreliability. BEA\u2019s model predicts total remittance amounts  that are substantially lower than those BEA has historically published.  BEA handles this difference by multiplying the remittance rates from  its model by an arbitrary calibration factor so that the total model\u2019s  estimated remittances equal those that BEA previously calculated for  2008. BEA calibrated the model because an analysis of CPS data  determined that remittance rates may have been underestimated  because many immigrants were reluctant to report their precise  remittances. Because BEA calibrated the new model to old  estimates, BEA estimated the same remittance amount for the year  2008 that the old model had produced. For the years following 2008,  the remittance estimates differed slightly from the previous estimates  because of the different demographic characteristics used in the new  model (see table 2).", "In our March 2006 report on BEA remittance estimates, we questioned  the accuracy of BEA estimates based on the model developed in 2005  after finding that the remittance rates BEA used were primarily based on  its own judgment. We found shortcomings in BEA\u2019s model, specifically  with regard to the assumptions BEA made about the percentage of  income remitted and the percentage of foreign-born persons who remit.  We were unable to link the parameters that BEA used to capture the  remitting behavior of foreign-born persons directly to the sources that  BEA cited. We found that BEA used its own judgment to determine the  proportion of the adult foreign-born population that sent remittances and  the proportion of income they remitted. We concluded that the accuracy  of these estimates was affected both by the quality of the underlying data  as well as by these assumptions. Therefore, calibration of the new  model\u2014which may itself be unreliable\u2014to the old estimates further  affects the reliability of the final estimates."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "BEA Does Not Regard Its Remittance Estimate as Influential", "paragraphs": ["BEA officials told us that the personal transfers estimate was not a  principal economic indicator.

Nonetheless, BEA\u2019s Information Quality Guidelines state  that at BEA the notion of data integrity goes beyond the maintaining of the  security of its information. Integrity includes, among other things,  transparency that is ensured by providing certain information, such as  assumptions for missing source data and discussions of revisions. BEA  officials also noted that personal remittances were a relatively small  component of the U.S. current account. According to BEA officials, over  the past 5 years personal transfers accounted for an average of 0.59  percent of gross current account transactions. Officials said that, as a  result, resources devoted to improving the estimation of personal  remittances had to be balanced with resources allocated to improving  other estimates that could be more important to the balance of payments.  However, a number of organizations use BEA\u2019s estimates. BEA reports  its personal transfer estimates to IMF, which publishes country estimates  in its Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. In addition, the World  Bank uses BEA estimates submitted to IMF as part of its calculations on  remittances.

More specifically, BEA commented that it  believes that its remittance estimates are valid and reasonable for the  purpose for which they are prepared and that the documentation provided  to GAO was fully adequate. We recognize BEA\u2019s resource constraints.  However, we maintain that our findings related to the reliability of BEA\u2019s  remittance estimates and documentation of the methodology to produce  such estimates are valid and support the recommendations we made in  the report.", "Regarding our conclusion that BEA\u2019s remittance estimates are unreliable,  in its comment letter BEA acknowledged the data limitations that GAO  pointed out in the report but did not explain how these may affect its  estimates. The limitations described in BEA\u2019s comment letter were not  discussed in the documentation provided by BEA. Nor did BEA provide  evidence showing that it conducted alternative analyses to conclude that  these limitations did not affect the quality of its final estimates. For  example, in its comment letter BEA mentions that the calculation of its  income variable was problematic but during our review did not present us  with analysis to show how sensitive its estimates were to various  assumptions about income, including that of taking the midpoint of the  range of income provided in its data. Even BEA\u2019s choice of demographic  variables included in their analysis depends on how it calculates  individual income. BEA acknowledges that its data was censored\u2014where  the value of reported remittances for some households in its data set is  only partially known\u2014but during our review, it did not provide evidence  that it conducted additional analyses using an alternative methodology to  see how final estimates might be affected. BEA told us that these  households were responsible for a substantial proportion of all  remittances and we found that it had considerable influence on BEA\u2019s  estimates. Though these and other data limitations described in this  report could have substantial impact on the estimates, in its comments  BEA dismisses the limitations stating that they would only have marginal  effect on the estimates. However, BEA does not present evidence of  having tested the magnitude of the effects on the estimates. Moreover,  calibrating the estimates resulting from BEA\u2019s revised estimation model to  its previous estimates, the accuracy of which was deemed uncertain in a  previous GAO report, further undermines our confidence in these  estimates. As a result of data limitations, BEA\u2019s choice of methodology in  light of those limitations, and other errors and corrections BEA made, we  maintain that BEA\u2019s revised estimation model produces unreliable  remittance estimates.", "Regarding our conclusion that BEA did not follow the best practices,  policies, and guidance to which it is subject for documenting its methods  and analyses, BEA stated that the documentation provided to GAO was  fully adequate. We disagree. As discussed in this report, we identified  several instances where BEA did not follow best practices, policies, and  guidance. For example, we requested files that provided documentation  of the analyses BEA conducted to determine changes to its estimation  methodology. BEA provided written descriptions of its regression analysis  in a conference paper. BEA staff told us that its analysis files had been  saved among many partially complete files and that it would be difficult to  identify the files that led to the current version of the model. BEA\u2019s best  practice standards require that all methodological changes and the  rationale for the changes be clearly documented. As we describe in the  report, without documentation BEA could not effectively convey and  support the rationale and appropriateness of its methodology. We were  unable to verify, among other things, the accuracy of much of BEA\u2019s data  or fully understand the selection of its methodology.", "As we stated in the report, documentation of analysis, testing, and  evaluations of models should show evidence of adherence to procedures  and policies that are part of an effective quality assurance framework.  BEA did not provide documentation that reflected such a framework. For  example, BEA officials described conducting managerial and external  reviews of the model\u2019s revision but provided only the minutes to one  management review meeting indicating that the model had been  discussed but was still under consideration. Though we requested  documentation of final approval of the model by the management  committee, BEA told us that it had nothing further to provide. BEA also  described an external review of its model revision that was done by an  external econometrician for quality assurance purposes.

By replicating these steps, we  found inconsistencies between BEA\u2019s description of the analysis and  what was actually done, and other errors.  We did not and would not have  been able to reproduce the analysis, based on the documentation that  BEA provided, that led to the final remittance estimates or even create the  dataset used by BEA from its listed sources.", "BEA noted that it provided us with new summaries to help explain certain  aspects of its methodology, but asserted that we conflated this additional  effort with an inadequacy of internal control and initial documentation.  However, we maintain that in some cases, BEA provided these  summaries because it was unable to provide us with original  documentation. For example, we asked for records of analysis that  supported the calculations of 2012 and 2013 estimates.

BEA\u2019s comment inaccurately described the purpose and scope  of our review. As we describe in this report, our review focused on two  separate objectives which were to (1) discuss the potential effects of  assessing a fine on remitters unable to provide proof of legal U.S.  immigration status, and (2) examine BEA\u2019s remittance estimate and the  extent to which its revised estimation methodology met government-wide  policies and agency best practices.

Together, DHS, Pew Research, and CMS are primary sources for the  estimates of immigrants without legal status in the United States, which  we determined by asking experts from each organization above to  discuss all other similar estimates. Through interviews with immigration  researchers, review of research articles, and comparison of the  estimates, which ranged from 11.1 million to 11.4 million immigrants in  the United States without legal status in 2012, we determined that the  estimates were authoritative and sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  this report. We used these sources to identify the size of the potentially  affected group of immigrants without legal status.", "To acquire information on the effects of the proposed requirement to  provide proof of legal status or pay a fine, we reviewed relevant academic  and industry studies based on a literature search. We reviewed and  summarized the literature for factors that could be associated with the  proposed legislation, including the number and remitting behavior of  immigrants without legal status, changes in remittance flows in response  to a price increase, the effect of requiring proof of legal status on  remittances, and market competition between remittance providers.. We  determined the studies to be reliable for our purposes.", "To obtain perspectives on the potential effects of imposing a fine on  remitters without proof of U.S. legal status, we interviewed researchers  with expertise in remittances and immigration to the United States,  financial institutions, remittance service providers, two industry trade  associations, one state audit association, two community groups with  knowledge of remitters\u2019 concerns, and knowledgeable federal and  international agencies. We judgmentally selected a cross-section of  remittance transfer providers that included five nondepository remittance  transfer providers and four depository institutions based on a number of  factors, including the volume of remittances and diversity of countries  serviced. We spoke with regulators, including the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement  Network (FinCEN), to obtain their perspectives on compliance with  requirements of the proposed Remittance Status Verification Act of 2015,  should it become law. We also reviewed laws and regulations relevant to  remittance transfer providers. Researchers with expertise in remittance  transfers were selected by contacting two recognized experts and asking  for referrals. We interviewed the experts recommended and continued to  ask for others until the referrals began to repeat with experts we already  interviewed. To select community groups, we asked others we  interviewed for recommended groups.", "To highlight the uncertainty associated with the effects of the fine, we  constructed a scenario analysis of several factors that may affect net  revenue from the fine, which is the amount of fine collected that remains  available for border protection after payment of CFPB\u2019s administrative  and enforcements costs. We varied hypothetical amounts for the following  three factors: dollar amount of remittances sent by immigrants without  legal status, the percentage reduction in remittances in response to the  fine, and the cost for administration and enforcement. We selected the  three factors by analyzing them among other potential factors and we  found that these three provided wide variability in net revenue from the  fine. Other factors we considered included the volume of total  remittances, the percentage transmitted through formal methods, and the  percent of remittances sent by immigrants without legal status. Though  we conducted a literature search for statistics for each factor in our  analysis, any studies found were not generalizable or sufficient for our  purposes. The data were limited to remittance flows between specific  countries, for example remittances sent between the United States and  Mexico, or were not recent. Therefore, the dollar amounts or percentages  given to each factor in our scenario analysis are hypothetical and  selected only to show the potential variability in net revenue from the fine.", "To obtain information on BEA\u2019s estimate of remittances (personal  transfers) from the United States, we met several times with BEA officials  responsible for developing the estimate. They provided us with an  estimate of the total volume of remittances from the United States to the  rest of the world from 2006 to 2014 that they provided to the IMF for  inclusion in balance of payments statistics. In this report, we further  assess BEA\u2019s estimation model and find that its results are unreliable.", "To understand BEA\u2019s revised methodology for estimating remittances  (personal transfers) we conducted multiple interviews with BEA staff  responsible for developing the estimate. We obtained BEA documentation  describing the agency\u2019s approach to estimating remittances, including  components of its model, related statistical program files, and its outputs.  We reviewed BEA\u2019s presentation and description of the model and  checked for consistency with its statistical program files and other  calculations. We provided BEA with numerous follow-up questions about  the methodology, and BEA provided us with written responses and  attended additional meetings to provide more clarity. We also obtained  documentation on the Census Bureau\u2019s (Census) American Community  Survey and Current Population Survey data to understand how they were  used in BEA\u2019s remittance estimation methodology and interviewed  Census officials familiar with the survey. We also reviewed BEA\u2019s best  practices, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) statistical directives,  and the National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academies of  Sciences\u2019 manual for statistical agencies to determine the extent to which  BEA\u2019s methodological changes conformed with guidance on statistical  practices.", "To determine the extent to which BEA documented its changed  methodology and its results and adhered to best practice standards, we  met with BEA staff responsible for developing the estimate. BEA staff  explained their documentation procedures to us. BEA staff also provided  copies of BEA guidance on best practices regarding methodological  changes. We also reviewed relevant law and regulations, as well as  guidance from IMF, the Department of Commerce, OMB, and NRC. We  reviewed documents provided by BEA for transparency and  completeness. Additionally, we provided BEA with follow-up questions  about the agency\u2019s documentation processes and procedures, and BEA  provided us with written responses. After receiving the responses, we  again met with BEA staff to discuss these processes and procedures.", "To obtain a variety of views on remittance estimation, we met with  officials from IMF, World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank and  their external consultant, as well as the Mexican and Philippine central  banks. We selected these two countries because they were among the  top 10 recipient countries of U.S. annual outflows and both countries use  a formal methodology to track inflows and outflows on at least an annual  basis. In meetings with these entities, we gained an understanding of the  methodologies used to estimate remittances and challenges in remittance  estimation.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2014 to February  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
