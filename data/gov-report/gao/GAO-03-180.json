By 1997,  approximately 5.2 million Medicare beneficiaries (14 percent) were  enrolled in an HMO.  Although Medicare HMOs were available in most  urban areas, they were often unavailable in rural areas.  The  Medicare+Choice (M+C) program, established by the Balanced Budget Act  of 1997 (BBA), was designed to expand beneficiaries\u2019 health plan choices  by encouraging the wider availability of HMOs and permitting Medicare to  contract with organizations offering other types of health plans, such as  preferred provider organization (PPO) plans and private fee-for-service  (PFFS) plans.", "In practice, however, virtually all M+C health plans in 2002 are offered by  HMOs and the number of health plan choices has decreased in each of the  last 4 years. From 1998 to 2002, the number of Medicare contracts with  HMOs declined from about 340 to 147, and the percentage of beneficiaries  with access to at least one HMO in the area where they lived declined from  74 to 61 percent.  Enrollment in Medicare HMOs, which had reached 6.3  million in 1999, had fallen to less than 5 million (12 percent of all Medicare  beneficiaries) as of July 2002.", "Representatives of the managed care industry have stated that declining  HMO participation in Medicare is largely due to inadequate M+C payment  rates and excessive administrative requirements.  The Medicare, Medicaid,  and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (BBRA) and the  Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act  of 2000 (BIPA) increased payment rates and made other changes to help  address the industry\u2019s concerns. But these legislative changes have not  halted the decline in HMO participation. To encourage health plans to  participate in M+C, legislative proposals have been made to further  increase M+C payment rates and streamline the program\u2019s administrative  requirements.", "To assist in your consideration of potential M+C reforms, you asked us to  summarize the program\u2019s HMO requirements in four areas: (1) the annual  benefit package proposals that HMOs submit, (2) the beneficiary  enrollment process, (3) marketing materials and enrollee communications,  and (4) quality improvement.  To provide benchmarks that could be used  when examining M+C requirements, you asked us to summarize parallel  requirements for HMOs that participate in the Federal Employees Health  Benefits Program (FEHBP), another large purchaser of health care.  You  also asked us to describe the HMO requirements established by other  entities in one or more of the four M+C areas we reviewed.  In consultation  with your office, we selected three entities that are not health care  purchasers but that do set requirements for HMOs: the National  Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), the Joint Commission on  Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), and the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA).  NAIC, a nonprofit  organization for state regulators, drafts and publishes model acts and  regulations that set standards for insurers that any state may adopt in  whole or in part.  JCAHO and NCQA, both nongovernmental and  nonprofit organizations, operate nationally recognized accreditation  programs for HMOs.", "To conduct our work, we summarized the applicable M+C requirements in  federal statutes and regulations, M+C operational guidance to HMOs, and  other materials prepared by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS), the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS) that administers Medicare.   We obtained additional information  from CMS officials.  We gathered and summarized FEHBP requirements in  federal statutes and regulations and FEHBP operational guidance to HMOs,  various NAIC model requirements, and relevant standards from the current  JCAHO and NCQA accreditation manuals. We also interviewed officials  from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the agency that  administers FEHBP, and representatives of NAIC, JCAHO, and NCQA.  Because M+C requirements are broadly similar to the requirements set by  other entities, but may be different in specific details, we compiled our  work into summary tables that provide information on the key details of  each entity\u2019s requirements (see appendixes I through IV). Our work was  performed from June 2001 through September 2002 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["M+C and FEHBP both represent large health care purchasing programs  that contract with HMOs and other types of health care organizations to  provide services.  NAIC, JCAHO, and NCQA are not purchasers of health  care, but they play important roles in establishing certain HMO  requirements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "M+C", "paragraphs": ["M+C is a component of Medicare, the federal entitlement program for  adults age 65 and older and some individuals who are disabled or have end- stage renal disease (ESRD). Medicare beneficiaries can choose to receive  covered services through the FFS program or through an M+C health plan  if one is offered in the area where they live.  HMOs and other types of health care organizations contract with CMS to offer M+C health plans.   HMOs participating in M+C receive fixed monthly payments for enrolled  beneficiaries, regardless of what their enrollees\u2019 care actually costs, in  return for providing all Medicare-covered benefits, except hospice care,  and complying with all M+C requirements. CMS monitors each HMO and  periodically conducts an on-site review to determine whether the HMO is  complying with program requirements. The agency also requires HMOs to  regularly submit certain information, such as enrollment and other data  used to compute HMO payments.", "In creating M+C, BBA included many requirements from the previous risk- contract program.  For example, the M+C requirement that HMOs submit  marketing and enrollee communications for agency approval was a  requirement of the risk-contract program.   BBA also included  requirements that were modifications of previous ones and others that  were new.  For example, BBA included quality assurance requirements\u2014 such as those pertaining to the collection, analysis, and reporting of health  outcomes and member satisfaction\u2014that were more comprehensive than  previous requirements.  BBA required that M+C payments to an HMO be  adjusted to reflect the relative health status of that HMO\u2019s enrollees  beginning in 2000.  The law directed the Secretary of HHS to require HMOs  to submit data on their enrollees\u2019 use of inpatient hospital services and data  on other services as the Secretary deemed necessary.  In addition to the  inpatient hospital data requirement, the Secretary required HMOs, in 1998,  to collect data on the use of physician and hospital outpatient services.   BBA also limited, effective January 1, 2002, the number of opportunities  beneficiaries had each year to enroll or change enrollment in a M+C health  plan.", "M+C\u2019s requirements have continued to evolve since BBA, partly as a result  of subsequent legislation.  Some legislative changes addressed HMOs\u2019  concerns about BBA\u2019s initial implementation. For example, BBRA  increased the amount of time that HMOs have each year to develop their  benefit package proposals by moving the annual submission deadline from  May 1 to July 1.  To reduce the administrative burden on HMOs that are  monitored by both a private accreditation organization and the agency,  BBRA increased the number of topical areas where HMOs may fulfill M+C  requirements by receiving accreditation from an organization that has  standards, as well as a process for ensuring compliance with those  standards, which are determined by CMS to meet or exceed M+C  requirements.  BBA allowed accreditation standards to be applied for  quality assurance and confidentiality of records requirements.  BBRA  expanded this list to include antidiscrimination, access to services,  advance directives, and provider participation requirements.  Under BIPA,  CMS must expedite review of HMO marketing materials that use agency- specified language without modification. BIPA also required HMOs to  expand their quality improvement activities to include a separate focus on  racial and ethnic minorities.  The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism  Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (Bioterrorism Act) made  temporary modifications to M+C requirements.  It enabled Medicare to  reinstate, through 2004, beneficiaries\u2019 opportunities to change enrollment  into any M+C health plan accepting new enrollments or switch to the FFS  program on a monthly basis.  It also moved the annual submission deadline  for HMOs\u2019 benefit package proposals to the second Monday in September  for benefit years 2003 through 2005.", "CMS has also modified certain M+C requirements, in some instances to  reduce the administrative burden on participating HMOs. In 2001, for  example, the agency postponed the date by which HMOs would have to  begin submitting data on beneficiaries\u2019 use of physician and hospital  outpatient services.  In 2002, CMS gave HMOs more flexibility in  advertising plan benefits not available in the FFS program.  For example,  HMOs were allowed to describe their health plans\u2019 pharmacy discounts in  the standard summary of benefits distributed to beneficiaries.  CMS has  also made changes to address shortcomings that agency staff or outside  groups identified.  The process for reviewing and approving HMOs\u2019  marketing materials was revised, in part, to correct problems we identified  in 1999.", "Since BBA was enacted, CMS has issued Federal Register notices and other  written instructions to inform HMOs about program changes. During 2001,  CMS began releasing chapters of a new Medicare managed care manual  intended to inform HMOs about program requirements. As of July 11,  2002, the agency had released 9 of a planned 20 chapters.  No release  dates have been announced for the remaining chapters.", "FEHBP is the largest employer-sponsored group health insurance program  in the United States.  In 2002, FEHBP covers approximately 8.28 million  individuals, consisting of 2.19 million federal employees, 1.86 million  federal retirees, and 4.23 million dependents. Like most Medicare  beneficiaries, FEHBP beneficiaries may select from among available health  plans during an annual open enrollment period.  OPM contracts with HMOs  and other types of health care organizations to offer health plans to FEHBP  beneficiaries.  The number of HMOs participating in FEHBP has declined in  recent years, from 476 HMOs in 1996 to about 200 HMOs in 2002.  In 2002,  about 2.42 million FEHBP beneficiaries (29 percent) are enrolled in HMOs.   The remaining 5.86 million beneficiaries (71 percent) are enrolled in other  types of health plans, such as PPOs.", "NAIC is a nonprofit association of the insurance regulators of the 50 states,  the District of Columbia, and 4 United States territories.  Its mission  includes promoting consistent health insurance regulations.  To help  achieve this objective, NAIC prepares model requirements that any state  may adopt, in whole or in part, to regulate HMOs operating in the state.    NAIC\u2019s model requirements are largely written in general terms to provide a  framework that states can tailor to meet local needs.  According to NAIC,  approximately 30 states have passed legislation based on the requirements  in NAIC\u2019s Model HMO Act, which provides a legal framework for the  organization and functioning of HMOs and a regulatory framework for state  oversight.", "JCAHO and NCQA provide accreditation programs for HMOs and other  health care entities that contract with public and private employers to  serve their employees and retirees, with state governments to serve  Medicaid beneficiaries, or with the federal government to serve Medicare  beneficiaries.  JCAHO\u2019s and NCQA\u2019s accreditation standards focus on the  HMO operations that affect the quality of care delivered and interactions  with members, rather than on all the requirements that a purchaser would  typically specify for an HMO, such as the benefits offered and the cost of  providing those benefits.  HMOs may seek accreditation from a nationally  recognized organization, such as JCAHO or NCQA, to signal their  commitment to quality and to help attract business.  Some potential  purchasers consider an HMO\u2019s accreditation status when deciding whether  to contract with the HMO. An HMO\u2019s accreditation status may also be an  important consideration for some potential enrollees. For that reason, OPM  lists the accreditation status of participating HMOs in the annual guide  made available to FEHBP beneficiaries.  In addition, HMOs with M+C  health plans that have received full accreditation from JCAHO or NCQA,  and have been determined by one of those organizations to have met  certain additional standards, are considered by CMS to have met the M+C  quality requirements discussed in this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selected M+C Requirements for HMOs", "paragraphs": ["An HMO that contracts to serve Medicare beneficiaries must meet M+C  program requirements specified by CMS regarding benefit package  proposals, the beneficiary enrollment process, marketing and enrollee  communications, and quality improvement.

Beneficiary enrollment process requirements  establish how HMOs must collect and process applications, conduct  beneficiary eligibility checks, transmit information to CMS, and reconcile  data discrepancies.  Communication requirements, which cover both  general advertising and specific communications to enrollees, set  standards for the information that HMOs distribute to beneficiaries and  establish CMS\u2019s review and approval process for these materials.

The Bioterrorism Act temporarily changes the  benefit package proposal submission deadline to the second Monday in  September for 2002 through 2004.  The proposals, formally known as  adjusted community rate proposals (ACRP), specify the health plan\u2019s  covered benefits, beneficiary cost sharing, and beneficiary premiums.  An  HMO must cover all services available in the FFS program except hospice.   An HMO may also offer additional services, such as outpatient prescription  drugs, and charge beneficiaries for these services.  If Medicare\u2019s payments  to an HMO are expected to exceed its cost of providing Medicare-covered  services plus the amount of profit or additional revenue that the HMO  would normally earn on non-Medicare contracts, the HMO must use the  additional money to cover additional items or services, reduce beneficiary  cost sharing, or contribute to a benefit stabilization fund\u2014an escrow-like  account that can be drawn upon in future years to help maintain benefit levels\u2014or a combination of these.  The HMO\u2019s benefit package proposal  describes the extent to which these options will be used.", "CMS reviews HMOs\u2019 benefit package proposals and approves them if they  comply with M+C requirements.  For example, an HMO may set beneficiary  cost-sharing requirements on individual services that differ from those in  the FFS program, but the sum of the actuarial value of its cost-sharing  requirements\u2014the total amount that the average beneficiary would be  expected to pay in deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments\u2014and the  health plan premium may not exceed the actuarial value of cost sharing in  the FFS program.  The agency has generally approved the proposals before  the start of Medicare\u2019s annual enrollment period in November.  BIPA  requires the agency\u2019s Chief Actuary to review all benefit package proposals  submitted on or after May 1, 2001, to determine whether the data values  and underlying assumptions in the proposals are reasonable.  According to  CMS officials, actuary reviews will begin with benefit package proposals  submitted in 2002.

For example, market forces  determine HMO payment rates in FEHBP.  In contrast, a statutory formula  specifies HMO payment rates in M+C. The difference in rate-setting  methodologies affects the type of information that OPM and CMS require  HMOs to include in their benefit package proposals.

Each proposal includes the proposed health plan premium,  which must be based on the lowest community-rated premium that the  HMO charges to commercial customers for a similar number of covered  lives.  OPM actuaries evaluate an HMO\u2019s supporting documentation for  the proposed premium.  The benefits to be covered by a health plan and its  cost to the government and to enrollees may be affected by subsequent  discussions between OPM and the HMO.
