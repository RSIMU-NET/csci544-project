During this time period, approximately 539,000 students were enrolled in the program, according to ETA officials. ETA's Office of Job Corps is responsible for administering the Job Corps program, which is the nation's largest residential, educational, and career and technical training program for low-income youth generally between the ages of 16 and 24. As shown in the figure, the three most common types of reported incidents were serious illnesses or injuries, assaults, and drug-related incidents.", "More than three-quarters of the reported incidents occurred onsite at Job Corps centers, and the rest occurred offsite. Most reported violent incidents\u2014specifically assaults, homicides, and sexual assaults that occurred onsite and offsite\u2014involved Job Corps students. For example, students were victims in 72 percent of these reported incidents, while staff were victims in 8 percent, and the remaining incidents involved victims who were not associated with Job Corps.", "GAO's preliminary analysis of ETA's student survey data from March 2007 through March 2017 found that students generally reported feeling safe, but they reported feeling less safe with respect to certain issues. The student survey contains 49 questions about students' experiences in the Job Corps program, including 12 questions related to safety at centers. Across all 12 of these safety-related survey questions, an average of 72 percent of students reported feeling safe over this 10-year period. However, the average percentage of students who reported feeling safe on each individual survey question ranged from 44 percent to 91 percent. For example, an average of 44 percent of students reported that they had never heard students threaten each other, or had not heard such threats within the last month. The remaining 56 percent of students, on average, reported hearing such threats at least once in the last month."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations in this testimony but will consider recommendations, as appropriate, when ongoing work is finished.

In addition, the deaths of two students at  two separate Job Corps centers in 2015 raised concerns. Since then,  ETA and the Office of Job Corps have taken a number of steps to  address safety and security concerns. In a March 2017 review, however,  the Office of Inspector General found that the Office of Job Corps lacked  an overall policy requiring centers to report potentially serious criminal  misconduct to law enforcement, and that 12 Job Corps centers had  physical security weaknesses, among other concerns, and made related  recommendations.

We assessed the reliability of the SIRS data by reviewing relevant  agency documentation about the data and the system that produced  them, and interviewing ETA officials knowledgeable about the data. We  also interviewed officials from DOL\u2019s Office of Inspector General, which  recently found that these data were incomplete for a non-generalizable  sample of 12 of 125 Job Corps centers because they failed to report over  a third of the incidents that occurred. We determined, however, that the  SIRS data were sufficiently reliable to report the minimum number of  incidents, in aggregate, that occurred from January 1, 2007 through June  30, 2016. However, it is likely that the actual number of incidents was  greater than the number we report in this statement.
