Specifically, the National Tribal Transportation Facility Inventory (NTTFI) provides useful data for identifying the roughly 161,000 miles of roads on tribal lands that are eligible for federal funding. However, the purpose for which these data are used has changed, and GAO found incomplete and inconsistent road-description and condition data, raising questions about the continued value of collecting these data. Similarly, BIA's Deferred Maintenance Reporting (DMR) system provides useful data on roughly 29,000 miles of BIA-owned roads eligible for federal funding, but GAO found inaccuracies in fields related to road-condition and road-maintenance needs. BIA does not document its road-maintenance cost estimates, and some tribes under-report performed maintenance. As a result, budget justification and performance reporting using these fields may not accurately reflect maintenance costs and needs. Federal standards for internal control suggest agencies design information systems and use quality information to achieve objectives.", "Funding constraints, overlapping jurisdictions, and adverse weather make improving and maintaining roads on tribal lands challenging. However, intergovernmental partnerships have helped mitigate challenges in some cases. For example, in 2013, federal, state, and tribal agencies partnered on a $35- million project to pave a BIA earth road on the Navajo Nation when the main U.S. highway was closed due to a landslide. By partnering, the agencies completed the project in about 3 months and prior to the start of the school year, eliminating a 45-mile detour.", "GAO's literature review and interviews with education officials indicate that road conditions can be a barrier to attendance, and Department of Education data show that Indian students have a higher chronic absence rate than other students (see fig.). At Interior, the Bureau of Indian Education's (BIE) schools generally do not collect data on transportation-related causes for absences, despite broader federal guidance that recommends doing so. BIE's attendance system lists causes, but transportation-related causes are currently not among them. Thus, BIE cannot quantify the effect of road conditions and target appropriate interventions.

The TTP is jointly administered by the Department of the  Interior\u2019s (Interior) Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Department of  Transportation\u2019s (DOT) Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The  TTP provides funds to over 560 federally recognized tribes for the  planning, design, construction, and maintenance of transportation  facilities\u2014such as roads, bridges, bus shelters, and parking lots\u2014 identified in the National Tribal Transportation Facility Inventory (NTTFI).  The NTTFI is a database maintained by BIA. While BIA is responsible for  ensuring the accuracy of data in the system, data are entered and owned  by individual tribes. NTTFI data includes transportation facilities eligible for assistance under the TTP. In fiscal year 2016, the TTP received an  authorization of $465 million in federal funding from the Fixing America\u2019s  Surface Transportation Act, with the authorized amount increasing by  $10-million per year until the funding level reaches $505 million in fiscal  year 2020.  The RMP is administered by BIA and funds the maintenance  of only BIA roads on tribal lands. BIA has received about $25 million  annually in RMP funding since the 1990s, according to agency officials.  BIA uses a Deferred Maintenance Reporting (DMR) system to track,  among other things, the amount of maintenance conducted and deferred  on the BIA road system. You asked us to review issues concerning road  conditions on tribal lands and how these conditions relate to students\u2019  school attendance.

We conducted three site visits to 10 selected  schools and 7 transportation offices within the Navajo, Pine Ridge, and  Rosebud Indian reservations. While all 567 federally recognized tribes  were considered for site visit selection, these three sites were chosen  because they reflect factors such as different BIA regions; considerable  tribal and BIA road mileage; presence of Bureau of Indian Education  (BIE) schools; and different program agreements. During our site visits, in  addition to meeting with school, tribal, and transportation officials, we  observed road conditions first-hand, including riding on school busses  along their delivery routes. As part of one site visit, we conducted a  facilitated group discussion with 10 tribes from the BIA Great Plains and  Rocky Mountain Regions. Our site visits provide information and  illustrative examples on a range of road condition and student attendance  issues on tribal lands but are not generalizable to all tribal nations. We  obtained geospatial data from the Navajo Nation on road ownership, road  surface type, and road maintenance partnerships for two school districts  within the Nation. We also attended four tribal transportation-related  conferences and interviewed various officials and stakeholders, including  FHWA and BIA headquarters and regional officials about their  coordination with tribes.

To describe attendance  including for Indian students in general, we analyzed national data from  two data sets collected by the Department of Education (Education). We  assessed the reliability of attendance data by reviewing related  documentation and interviewing knowledgeable agency officials, among  other steps, and determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for  our purposes. To identify studies concerning the connection between  road conditions and school attendance, we searched for academic  studies published since 2000, and we reviewed a list of studies compiled  by Education\u2019s National Library of Education. We used a data collection  instrument to consistently record information about key findings related to  the connection between road condition and attendance from each  relevant source. As part of our site visits to the three tribes noted above,  we selected 10 schools and districts to visit that had similar student  demographics (e.g., mostly Indian and mostly low-income) and school  bus routes of varying road surface types. For these schools and districts,  we analyzed available documentation and information on student  attendance and school bus routes; directly observed bus routes; and  interviewed school and district officials on the effects of road conditions  on attendance as well as other school transportation issues. We also  interviewed officials from Education, Interior\u2019s Bureau of Indian Education  (BIE), and other national-level stakeholders from tribal organizations. We  compared information on BIE\u2019s efforts in this area with guidance from an  education forum and federal standards for internal control.

This is in  contrast to inventory data, described above, which continues to be used  to identify roads eligible for TTP-funding.  Specifically, prior to 2012, road-  description and condition data fields were used in the funding formula to  determine the distribution of tribal-funding shares.   When road- description and condition data were used for funding purposes, missing,  out-of-date, or erroneous data could pose a risk to funding decisions.

Federal standards for internal control state  that management should design its information systems and related  control activities to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives including continuing to  evaluate those activities for continued relevance and effectiveness.    Although BIA officials acknowledged that changes in a regulation  affecting how the data are used have contributed to the problem of  outdated and unreliable data, they have not made changes to NTTFI data  collection since its use in the funding formula was discontinued in 2012.   BIA officials also noted that while they generally do not use NTTFI road- description and condition data for system-wide reporting, they do make  this information available to FHWA, which has used it to report on road  condition in its annual budget justification and its Conditions and  Performance Report to Congress. While NTTFI road-description data are  relevant for this purpose, it is unclear how useful the current data are for  such a purpose given the results of our electronic testing.

This can result in inconsistent collection and outdated  data, both of which can lead to inaccuracies when these fields are used  for budget justification and performance reporting.  For example,  required NTTFI data fields pertaining to traffic counts (average daily traffic  on major arterial roads) and surface condition (surface condition index)  are outdated and may not be comparable across tribes. BIA\u2019s guidance  does not require data to be updated on a routine basis, and condition  data is not required to be collected in the same manner by all tribes. In  particular:  Average daily traffic (ADT):  ADT is a measurement of the  amount of traffic that is using the road and, among other things, is  intended to be used to: (1) determine the design standards to  which a road should be built (such as whether the road surface  should be gravel or paved); (2) manage road maintenance (such  as determining which roads to maintain and what treatments to  use); and (3) report on the number of vehicle miles being traveled  (such as for analyzing road usage trends). Research and  guidance on industry practices indicate that ADT on major roads is  typically counted every 2 to 6 years.  We found that BIA does not  provide direction in its coding guide on how often to take traffic  counts and most of NTTFI\u2019s traffic counts for major arterial roads  are between 6 and 12 years old.  In particular, of the existing  major arterial road sections in NTTFI\u2014totaling 1,872 miles\u2014none  have had their ADT counted in the last 3 years, 0.3 percent (6  miles) have been counted in the last 4 years, 3.8 percent (72  miles) have been counted in the last 6 years, and 81 percent  (1,517 miles) have been counted in the last 12 years.  As a result,  ADT information contained in NTTFI likely does not reflect current  road usage and cannot reliably inform reporting or decisions  related to design standards or maintenance management.", "Surface condition index (SCI): SCI is a measurement of road  surface condition that can be used to identify and prioritize  maintenance needs. According to industry guidance, road  conditions are typically evaluated every 1 to 4 years because  conditions deteriorate over time. There is no requirement in  BIA\u2019s coding guide to specify how often SCI should be updated,  and we found that the SCI for about 85 percent (81,080 of the  95,510 miles) of existing paved and gravel roads (those which are  required to be evaluated for SCI) could not have been updated in  at least the last 4 years, and almost 50 percent could not have  been updated in at least the last 8 years.   Further, because the  coding guide allows tribes to use any nationally acceptable  method to rate a road, data may not be collected consistently from  those evaluating the roads.  As a result of outdated SCI data that  is inconsistently collected, NTTFI lacks reliability for use in  prioritizing TTP projects and making the most efficient use of  resources. Further, FHWA\u2019s use of SCI data may contribute to  inaccuracy in its reporting on the overall condition of the system  and whether it is improving or worsening.", "In addition to these specific limitations, the BIA coding guide\u2014which  provides guidance for those collecting and inputting data into the NTTFI\u2014 was last updated as a draft released in 2007 and contains outdated  references. For example, the guide refers to the Indian Reservation  Roads (IRR) Program\u2014the program prior to the TTP. Moreover, in 2008,  FHWA issued a review of the then-IRR Program. The FHWA\u2019s review,  among other things, found that the coding guide had conflicting,  confusing, and ambiguous instructions or definitions.   In its review,  FHWA recommended that the BIA revise the guide to remove subjective  interpretations and ambiguous directions to improve data consistency and  accuracy. BIA has not updated the coding guide to address FHWA\u2019s  review and recommendations, but BIA officials stated that they have  taken some efforts to improve the data.", "BIA officials acknowledged that outdated and inaccurate data exist within  the NTTFI but noted that it is the tribes that are responsible for entering  this information.  BIA officials noted that tribes may have less incentive to  update data fields such as ADT, SCI, and other road-description and  condition data because, as noted above, this information is no longer  used as a factor in determining the allocation of TTP funds to tribes.  Federal standards for internal control state that management should use  quality information. Moreover, these standards recommend that  management design control activities, such as providing clear guidance to  achieve their objectives.

These officials also noted that there is  not a systematic reporting function to identify these errors and generate  an error report to support correction efforts.  While there are some  automated checks on the system that tribes use to enter and update data  in the NTTFI, they do not apply to data already in the system. With  respect to data entry checks, for example, certain fields only accept a  specific range of values for data entry, and some fields require  documentation for entries that require BIA\u2019s review before official  inclusion into the NTTFI.  These checks are intended to eliminate the  possibility of entering incorrectly coded data or the inclusion of erroneous  data. No similar error reporting or checks for compliance with expected  values are applied to existing data. According to BIA officials, this is  because they do not own the tribal data that is in the system they manage  and therefore cannot make changes to the data once it has been  accepted into the system. Tribes are required to update their data  annually.   Nevertheless, BIA has a stewardship responsibility to ensure  the NTTFI\u2019s data accuracy. Federal internal control standards state that  information systems and related control activities, such as monitoring to  identify missing or erroneous data, should be designed to facilitate timely  and targeted corrections.  Without complete and accurate road- description and condition data, BIA and tribes will be limited in their ability  to assess the needs for the entire road system within their scope and  identify TTP priorities. Having more complete and accurate data would  also better support FHWA\u2019s budget-justification and performance  reporting.", "New TTP regulations recently went into effect that may mitigate some of  the data errors we identified.

Controls to ensure that  quality information is used include: obtaining relevant data (that are  reasonably free from error) from reliable sources, obtaining that  information on a timely basis, and processing that data into quality  information that faithfully represents what it purports to represent.", "To determine the amount of deferred maintenance on BIA roads, BIA first  calculates the maintenance needed by multiplying a unit cost of  maintenance per mile, based on a road section\u2019s level of service, by the  length of the road section. However, we found that two of the factors\u2014 level of service and unit cost of maintenance\u2014that BIA uses in its  maintenance cost calculations may be unreliable, resulting in inaccurate  estimates of maintenance needs. In particular:  Level of service (LOS): LOS is a qualitative road condition rating  (on a 1 to 5 scale) based on road surface, drainage, pavement  marking, and other characteristics which change over time. BIA  officials stated that every BIA road is evaluated on an annual  basis. However, it is not possible to determine specifically when  each road section\u2019s LOS was last updated because the DMR  system does not record this information. Without knowing when  the LOS information was last updated, BIA does not have  reasonable assurance that LOS data represent actual road  conditions, or whether BIA is meeting its performance measures  for the RMP.", "Unit cost of maintenance: Unit maintenance costs are used to  identify the estimated annual costs of maintaining a particular road  section. BIA develops unit costs per mile based on a road\u2019s  geographic location, surface type, and level of service to estimate  the amount of maintenance needed for the entire road section.   However, BIA officials told us that they had no formal  documentation showing how the unit cost estimates were  prepared.  According to leading practices for cost estimation, one  key step for ensuring high-quality cost estimates is to document  the estimate that includes auditable and traceable data sources  for each cost element. Because BIA does not document unit  cost estimates, it cannot determine the reliability of the estimates\u2019  sources or the quality of the estimate of maintenance needs  based on their use.", "After determining the amount of maintenance needed, BIA subtracts the  amount of maintenance performed as reported by BIA and tribes in the  DMR from the needed maintenance to determine the amount of deferred  maintenance. However, BIA officials stated that there is under-reporting  of performed maintenance by some tribes.  In particular, BIA officials  noted that approximately 172 tribes have an agreement with BIA to  administer the RMP and maintain BIA roads in their area, but only about  40 percent of those tribes report on their road maintenance activities  which results in the DMR system having incomplete data on maintenance  performed.  BIA officials stated that they continue their educational  efforts to stress the value of the collection and reporting of performed  maintenance. However, these officials told us the reporting of  maintenance performed at the road section level can be difficult because  the maintenance work is not always performed at one specific road  section, and it is challenging to allocate maintenance activities over  multiple sections. BIA officials told us that they are considering alternative  means of reporting the maintenance performed amounts to increase the  completeness of the maintenance performed measure; however, they do  not have a specific plan in place to address this issue at this time.", "Because BIA\u2019s estimates of needed maintenance may be inaccurate and  tribes\u2019 reporting on performed maintenance is incomplete, calculations of  deferred maintenance\u2014the difference between estimated maintenance  needed and actual maintenance performed\u2014that support BIA\u2019s budget  submission and performance reporting may be similarly inaccurate.

(See fig. 3.) Federal, tribal, and other  stakeholders we interviewed noted that constrained funding has limited  the ability of tribes to improve and maintain roads on tribal lands and  contributed to the deterioration of these roads.  In addition, current  funding levels have led to less frequent maintenance and improvement  activities than desired, according to some tribal officials.  For example, a  transportation official from a Great Plains region tribe said that annual  TTP funding allows for resurfacing their reservation\u2019s 54-mile paved road  network every 73 years, when the existing roadway network needs to be  resurfaced at least every 20 years to maintain the roads in an acceptable  condition.", "RMP funding has also remained relatively flat, at about $25 million per  year from fiscal years 2009 through 2015, while the number of BIA roads  eligible for these funds increased over this time period, from 26,868 to  28,859 miles.  Over 85 percent of these BIA road miles are located on  the lands of 59 tribes within six BIA regions. According to BIA and tribal  transportation officials, RMP funding levels have not kept pace with the  growing road maintenance requirements due to the addition of new roads,  the need to address existing roads\u2019 maintenance backlogs, and  emergency operational requirements.  For example, according to BIA and  tribal officials, as much as 90 percent of some tribes\u2019 annual RMP funds  can be expended during the winter for snow and ice removal, leaving little  for other road maintenance activities the remainder of the year. Also,  according to these officials, the remoteness, rugged environment, and  unavailability of materials on some tribal lands leads to comparatively  higher costs for maintaining roads located in these areas, which further  exacerbate funding constraints. Also, as roads fall into disrepair through  the delay of or inability to fund road maintenance, the more expensive  roads become to maintain.  Deferring maintenance may result in greater  future reconstruction expenditures. Most state and local transportation  officials we spoke with said their agencies also face funding constraints  that inhibit their road-improvement and maintenance efforts on tribal  lands. Moreover, the amount of road maintenance funding expended on  tribal lands has generally been less than the amount expended on similar  roads in neighboring jurisdictions, according to BIA and tribal officials.   For example, according to a 2008 analysis completed by a BIA Navajo  Region official, counties bordering the Navajo Nation\u2019s reservation  receive about two times more road maintenance funding per mile to  maintain county-owned roads compared to the road maintenance funding  BIA receives to maintain its roads on the Navajo Nation.", "Over the past several years, BIA and tribal officials have tried to address  road maintenance funding concerns by requesting additional RMP  funding. In March 2016, Interior and tribal officials created a workgroup to  analyze, record, and develop data for road maintenance budget needs.  This group recently held discussions with BIA officials about establishing  a new budget category for roads and transportation so that requirements  such as road maintenance receive greater visibility in the budget.  At the  time of our review, discussions pertaining to this initiative were ongoing."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overlapping Jurisdictions", "paragraphs": ["Overlapping jurisdictions on tribal roads may create confusion and access  issues that can delay or prevent road maintenance and improvement  activities. Tribal lands may be owned by a tribe, an individual Indian, or a  non-Indian. This varied ownership creates interspersed parcels or a  checkerboard pattern of ownership on some tribal lands. According to  federal, state, county, and tribal transportation officials, documentation of  road ownership and rights-of-way do not always exist or are not always  known, a lack that further complicates the ability of stakeholders to  conduct road maintenance and improvement activities. Also, different,  changing, or uncertain management responsibilities pertaining to roads  on tribal lands that are owned by different stakeholders can make  collaboration challenging as the decision-making on road priorities and  funding sources are also dispersed. For example, two adjacent school  districts within the Navajo Nation use many of the same roads for their  school bus routes.  These roads not only have multiple road owners but  they also have different types of road surfaces\u2014paved, gravel, and  earth\u2014which require different types of maintenance. (See fig. 4.)  Because of differences in priorities among road owners, the amount of  maintenance performed on the roads varies, leading to differences in  road condition and potential impediments to transportation.", "Other challenges stem from changing roles and responsibilities, liability  concerns, and differing approaches to meeting regulatory requirements,  for example:", "Some challenges can occur as roles and responsibilities shift from federal to tribal control. For example, in 2013, the Navajo Nation signed a TTP Agreement with FHWA that changed the roles and responsibilities for both the BIA Navajo Region and the Navajo Nation.   Under the agreement, the Navajo Nation assumed responsibility for conducting TTP work that used to be managed by BIA. However, according to federal and tribal transportation officials, it will take time for the Navajo Nation to build its capacity to assume the roles and responsibilities previously performed by BIA. According to a BIA Navajo Region official, they have been adjusting their capacity as their functions and duties diminish over time. As of December 2016, the BIA Navajo Region and the Navajo Nation were still in the process of transitioning operational roles and responsibilities, according to BIA officials.", "According to some federal and tribal transportation officials, tribal councils\u2019 preferences or officials\u2019 decisions may not always align with previously established plans and priorities.  For example, in April 2016, an Oglala Sioux tribal official halted the development of a new gravel quarry location that was believed to be a sacred site. As a result, tribal transportation officials used the next nearest quarry, approximately 50 miles away, thus increasing road maintenance costs.", "Liability issues can halt or delay maintenance work.  For example, the La Jolla Band of Luise\u00f1o Indians is located in a mountainous region of northern San Diego County, California, where rock falls are prone to occur.  When rocks fall on a remote section of a state highway that runs through tribal lands, according to a tribal transportation official, the tribe must wait for state authorities to respond, even though the tribe has equipment that can remove the fallen rocks.  According to this official, the state prohibits the tribe from conducting emergency  maintenance work to avoid potential liability issues. As a result, local  traffic can be blocked for extended time periods while waiting for state  workers to respond.", "Differing approaches to compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act can affect delivery of maintenance and improvement projects.  For example, according to a 2013 Department of Transportation\u2019s Inspector General report, existing agreements between FHWA and BIA do not reconcile the two agencies\u2019 different processes and requirements for National Environmental Policy Act approvals on TTP projects. According to some federal and tribal officials we spoke to, differences exist, in particular, in the process for acquiring a right-of-way for project construction.  FHWA grants categorical exclusions in certain cases where tribes need to establish or amend an existing right-of-way while BIA requires tribes to prepare an environmental assessment for these cases, which is resource- intensive, according to federal and tribal officials.  According to tribal officials, BIA retains right-of-way approval authority for projects on land it owns or holds in trust for tribes, and completing TTP projects at these locations results in additional time and cost.  In November 2016, a final rulemaking included clarification that is expected to minimize or eliminate conflicts that involve differences in federal processes.  The final rule specifies that FHWA\u2019s categorical exclusions will apply to all qualifying TTP projects involving construction or maintenance of roads regardless of whether BIA or FHWA is responsible for overseeing the tribe\u2019s TTP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Adverse Weather", "paragraphs": ["According to various transportation and education officials we met with,  adverse weather can exacerbate maintenance challenges on roads  located on tribal lands.

Further these officials said that these  challenges can be more severe on larger reservations that have more  earth and gravel roads. According to federal and tribal transportation and  education officials we spoke with:  prolonged droughts can result in nearly impassable roads due to sand dunes, rocky surfaces, and deep holes that non-4-wheel drive vehicles cannot traverse; heavy rains can lead to flash flooding and washing out of earth roads, cutting off communities from important access points; high winds can lead to dust storms causing traffic accidents and blockage of the only accessible road; and snowfall can lead to icy and muddy road conditions, creating deep ruts along a road and preventing access by rescue and other vehicles.", "According to federal and tribal transportation officials, after most adverse  weather events, road maintenance workers are unable to quickly deliver  assistance to some remote locations because unpaved roads may be  impassible. In addition, workers are often unable to conduct necessary  maintenance activities during and immediately after some weather events  because they must wait to use the equipment until the adverse weather  ends and the ground dries. Also, although federal and tribal transportation  officials may have maintenance equipment located at different  maintenance yards or prepositioned in strategic locations around tribal  lands to address normal and emergency road maintenance needs, they  said that the remote distances may still prevent immediate responses.  These situations can isolate some people within their communities and  away from essential services until emergency road maintenance can be  conducted, according to officials.

(See fig. 5.) The highway closure caused the  Arizona Department of Transportation to set-up a detour affecting travel  to Page, Arizona, from points south. The detour (along Arizona State  Highway 98 and U.S. Highway 160) affected hundreds of Navajo school  students and was 45 miles longer than the direct route into Page along  U.S. Highway 89.  According to federal, state, and tribal officials through  effective coordination, BIA Route 20 was paved in about three months  and completed prior to the start of the school year so that students could  benefit from a shorter drive on a better road surface.", "In 2014, the Navajo Nation Division of Transportation and Coconino  County (Arizona) established a matching fund program whereby the  county and the Navajo Nation each contributed $200,000 to maintain  school bus routes in the area, among other projects.  (See fig. 6.) The  goal of the program was to implement minor drainage and surfacing  projects on the roads maintained by the county.  According to Coconino  County officials, in addition to the increased road maintenance, the plan  for this funding was to improve school bus route conditions, reduce road  maintenance costs, and increase safety. Transportation officials also said  the partnering enabled the Navajo Nation and the county to use  maintenance funds more efficiently and focus on blading roads versus  having to constantly repair roads damaged by winter and summer storm  events.", "While partnerships have been effective in two cases described above,  collaboration among stakeholders can be difficult and achieving beneficial  outcomes can take time. For example, in the third case, the Hopi Tribe,  Navajo Nation, BIA Hopi Agency, and Navajo County (Arizona) have  been working together since 2009 to obtain funding for the Hopi 60 (Low  Mountain Road) project. According to transportation officials, the road  construction project would pave about 14 miles of BIA Route 60 of which  about 11 miles are located on Hopi tribal lands and about 3 miles are  located on the Navajo Nation. This BIA route is an earth road that is the  primary school-bus route for multiple school districts. According to  transportation officials, during adverse weather conditions, BIA Route 60  becomes impassible and causes drivers on Hopi lands to take a 106-mile  detour along Arizona State Highway 264. These stakeholders partnered  to submit federal discretionary grant applications in 2009 to obtain about  $22 million and in 2015 to obtain about $29 million needed for this project  but were not successful.   Stakeholders continued to pursue funding and  were recently awarded $1.5 million from the State of Arizona.

Road conditions reflect the  surface type and level of maintenance, among other things. On large  reservations as with the three we visited, students may live far from  school, and in many cases their residences and schools are only  accessible by earth and gravel roads. At these 10 schools and districts,  officials told us that adverse weather worsens road conditions on tribal  lands and sometimes affects student attendance. Officials said that  school-provided transportation\u2014buses and sport-utility vehicles (SUVs)\u2014 are the most common means of student transportation. A few school and  district officials said that certain students may not have alternatives to  school-provided transportation to get to school, such as a ride from  family, or that weather or road conditions may preclude students from  getting to school on their own. Thus, when the school vehicle or the  student cannot access the pick-up location due to road conditions, the  student may miss part or all of the school day. For example, at one school  we visited, the principal noted that students who lived far from the bus  route (at least 12 to 20 miles away) have at times missed school, as  families said they could not reach the bus stop due to impassable roads  with mud or snow. Additionally, occasional bus breakdowns, such as  getting stuck in the mud, can affect student attendance, such as arriving  late to school, according to officials in one district on Navajo Nation.", "School and district officials also mentioned that school attendance was  lower when they altered or halted school bus routes because of adverse  weather conditions that compounded the already poor road conditions.  Eight of 10 schools and districts we visited said that during adverse  weather they sometimes kept schools open but altered or did not serve  certain bus routes. School and district officials said that these changes to  bus routes resulted in some students missing school that lived along  those routes. When a bus route is truncated from its original route,  students or their families often have to travel even farther than their  regular bus stop to meet the bus, such as at a main road, travel that can  affect attendance, because families have no way to reach the farther bus  stops, for example. On the Pine Ridge Reservation, one school  superintendent told us that certain families who live in remote locations  along earth roads do not have 4-wheel drive vehicles to reach the farther  bus stop when roads become muddy or snow-covered.", "Student absences can also result when school officials decide not to  serve a bus route on a particular day. At a school in the central part of the  Pine Ridge Reservation, school officials said that the school did not serve  certain routes a few times in a year due to weather and safety concerns,  such as heavy snowfall and icy road conditions. School officials told us  that students on these routes could not get to school, and the school  recorded their absences as excused. In addition to the three tribes we  visited, officials we interviewed from BIE, Education, and other tribes told  us that they heard similar concerns about challenging or impassable road  conditions that affect student attendance. One tribal transportation expert  said that the problem is particularly problematic for tribes with larger  reservations due to the longer distances that people must travel and  typically poor road conditions.", "Officials at schools and districts we visited mentioned a few strategies  they sometimes used to try to mitigate the challenging road conditions  and promote students\u2019 access to school. However, at times, even these  strategies did not allow students to get to school. For example, one  school superintendent on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota  noted that the school used SUVs on certain routes, but even its SUVs  were unable to reach students due to the excessive snow or mud on  earth roads for a total of about three to four days over the course of the  school year. Additionally, as noted above, telecommunication challenges,  such as limited or no internet access on tribal lands, affects the potential  to use technology for virtual education.

The Education Department does not  require school districts to collect particular data about reasons for  absences, according to Education officials. Public school districts develop  their own attendance systems, which may vary across districts, including  reasons for absences. Nonetheless, the education forum provided non- binding guidance in 2009 on how school districts should develop  attendance systems and document reasons for absences. Among other  things, the guidance stated the importance of a comprehensive and  manageable classification of student attendance, including reasons for  absences. It suggested a series of reasons for absences for states and  districts to consider, including transportation issues. Data on reasons for  absences would then be helpful to inform interventions to increase  attendance. Similarly, guidance jointly issued in 2015 by four  departments\u2014Education, Health and Human Services, Housing and  Urban Development, and Justice\u2014emphasized the importance of  collecting and using absence data to improve attendance for those  students who miss many days of school, including understanding reasons  for absences.", "Three of the 10 schools and districts we visited\u2014one BIE school and two  public school districts\u2014 collected data on the number of student  absences related to road and weather conditions.

The percentage of absences at these three locations due  to adverse weather and road conditions ranged from a fraction of 1  percent to 4 percent, according to the data. However, because parents  did not provide a reason for the absence in many cases, the actual  percentage of absences due to roads and weather may be higher. For the  one BIE school that collected data on reasons for absences due to road  and weather conditions, it decided on its own initiative to create a  category for these absences. A school official said that weather-related  absences generally were more likely to involve students who lived along  earth or gravel roads. For example, due to snow, buses may not be able  to reach students living along certain earth or gravel roads, or families  may not be able to bring students to the bus stop. The official noted it is  important for the school to know why students are absent in general, and  how often students are absent, specifically, due to road and weather  conditions in order to understand the extent that these conditions affect  students\u2019 ability to get to school. This information can help schools set  priorities and target interventions depending on the extent of such  absences.", "The other five BIE schools we visited did not collect data in a way that  would capture absences due to road and weather conditions.  Officials at  two schools said that they recorded absences due to difficult road  conditions as more general excused absences. For example, such  absences were due to truncated bus routes or snowbound students who  lived in remote areas accessible only by earth roads. At another school,  officials did not seem aware of the ability to count and track a specific  category of absences due to road and weather conditions, on a school- wide basis.", "According to BIE officials we spoke to, some schools may not collect  absence data for road and weather conditions due to various  circumstances such as school staff turnover, competing priorities among  school attendance staff, or limited emphasis from BIE to collect data on  these reasons for absences. Further, BIE has not provided guidance to its  schools regarding capturing reasons for absences related to roads and  weather. Documentation for the system used to collect absence data  states that each absence should have a reason entered by the school.   However, BIE has not provided instructions or suggestions to the 185  schools it funds to consider including road and weather conditions in their  attendance system. For example, it has not issued a sample list of  reasons that schools can use or tailor for local circumstances. According  to BIE officials, BIE has not done so because it wants to give schools  flexibility on which reasons they should collect on absences. However,  BIE has not taken basic steps to facilitate optional data collection by  schools that may be inclined to do so, such as those that are more  affected by poor roads. For example, BIE\u2019s existing attendance system  currently provides a list from which schools can select reasons, or  schools can create other reasons on their own. Road and weather  conditions are not included as reasons on the existing list, and thus a  school would have to create these reasons as causes for absences. In  the capacity to provide technical support to schools, BIE could provide  guidance to collect these data. Without such guidance, affected BIE  schools as well as the Bureau itself will continue to lack insight into the  effect of roads and weather on absences and the ability to target  interventions accordingly.

For example, on one of our site visits, we followed  an afternoon bus route in dry weather that covered about 30 miles on  mostly earth roads to drop off about 30 students, including elementary  school students. The route\u2019s duration was about 90 minutes.

For example, a BIE school we visited in the Navajo Nation reported that  about 43 percent of its bus miles were on earth roads. The school  principal stated that additional vehicle maintenance\u2014such as replacing  tires, shocks, and other bus parts\u2014resulted from the rough conditions on  poorly maintained earth roads.", "Road conditions on tribal lands, including the surface type such as earth  and gravel roads and the level of road maintenance, contribute to the  wear and tear on vehicles, such as the school buses and SUVs that  transport students daily. Although road conditions affect vehicle  maintenance and thus overall transportation costs, BIE\u2014which supplies  federal funding for transportation to BIE schools\u2014has not reviewed its  formula in a decade to consider costs of vehicle maintenance or other  possible factors.", "Poor road conditions can increase costs for vehicle maintenance and  transportation overall.   Research suggests that rougher road surfaces,  such as unpaved roads as compared to paved roads, tend to increase the  maintenance and operational costs for vehicles, including buses,  depending on the levels of road maintenance and the design of the road  among other things.  According to information from a school  transportation organization, road and weather conditions can have an  impact on the frequency and cost of school bus maintenance. For  example, in one school district we visited in the Navajo Nation, officials  said that the school buses serving the part of the district with more earth  roads accounted for the majority of the costs for vehicle maintenance,  compared to the rest of the district, which had more total miles but fewer  miles of earth roads.", "These increased transportation costs are consistent with our prior work  on BIE school spending. Specifically, we noted the geographically  dispersed locations and poor road conditions, including the vehicle- related maintenance, contributed to schools\u2019 higher transportation costs  per student, on average, for those on tribal lands, such as BIE schools,  than the national average. In contrast to schools on tribal lands, we noted  that slightly more than half of public schools nationwide are located in  cities or suburbs, and therefore may be unlikely to face similarly poor road  conditions or long bus routes.", "Officials from 7 of the 10 schools and school districts we visited told us  about or showed us examples of wear and tear on school vehicles  resulting from poor road conditions. For example, officials at two BIE  schools on the Pine Ridge Reservation and a public school district on the  Rosebud Reservation described how vehicles experience prolonged  vibration caused by riding over the grooved surfaces that tend to form on  earth and gravel roads (known as \u201cwashboard\u201d roads). Vehicles traveling  these roads require more frequent maintenance than those traveling on  paved roads, according to these officials.  Such safety-related  maintenance work can include brake or oil changes, replacements of side  mirrors or door and window parts, and repairs of windshields. (See fig.  10.) During rides on school buses or SUVs, we observed bumpy road  conditions and the vehicle\u2019s vibrating when driving over rough earth and  gravel surfaces. According to district officials at one public school district  that we visited on the Rosebud Reservation, their buses generally travel  on gravel roads and typically have a life expectancy of about a decade. In  contrast, school buses that operate under normal conditions which are  generally on paved roads have a life expectancy of about 12 to 15 years,  according to a report by a school transportation organization.", "BIE\u2019s formula for determining amounts to allocate to BIE schools for  transportation, which was formalized in 2005, does not distinguish  between gravel and paved roads. The formula generally considers both  gravel and paved roads as \u201cimproved\u201d roads for funding purposes.  The  mileage on these \u201cimproved\u201d roads plus an adjusted mileage (increased  by 20 percent) on \u201cunimproved\u201d roads, which generally includes earth  roads, determines a school\u2019s transportation funding amount, subject to  the available appropriation.  When we asked BIE officials about the  rationale for treating gravel and paved roads similarly from a funding  perspective, they responded that the gravel helps to make the roads more  passable in adverse weather, compared to other roads that do not have  gravel or other materials applied.  However, because BIE\u2019s school  transportation funding formula does not consider the likely higher  maintenance costs for vehicles traveling on rough gravel roads, its  allocation of resources may be misaligned with needs.", "Federal standards for internal control state that federal agencies should  periodically review policies and related control activities for continued  relevance and effectiveness in achieving objectives and addressing  risks. However, BIE has not reviewed its transportation funding formula  since 2005 nor has it implemented a recommendation we made in 2003  pertaining to the formula.   Further, BIE and BIA officials said that they  have not communicated in recent years about BIE\u2019s transportation  formula. For example, BIA transportation officials told us that they did not  know that BIE was classifying roads using the terms \u201cimproved\u201d and  \u201cunimproved,\u201d which BIA officials said they no longer use. Further, BIE has not formally worked with tribes on its transportation formula since  2005. According to federal internal control standards, agencies should  communicate with external parties when needed in order to achieve  objectives. As a result of not communicating with BIA or tribes, BIE has  not benefitted from technical expertise and experiences of BIA or tribes  and does not know whether transportation funding is distributed in a way  that reflects disparate maintenance needs. BIE officials said they  understood the importance of aligning funding with transportation costs  and said that funding formulas used by states may provide a good model  for BIE to consider."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Road conditions on tribal lands pose challenges in connecting people to  education, employment, health care, and other essential services. These  challenges are especially magnified during adverse weather because of  the remote location of some tribes and the prevalence of unpaved roads  that are prone to weather-related damage. Useful, accurate, and  consistent data in the NTTFI and DMR system can support road  management and program oversight efforts. However, the purpose for  which NTTFI data are used has changed, in that, since 2012 updates to  NTTFI, data have not been used as a determinant in allocating TTP  funding to tribes. In addition, guidance to tribes for entering data into  NTTFI is dated, and limited monitoring of data that are entered has  resulted in missing or conflicting entries that affect the accuracy and  completeness of these data.  These conditions lead to NTTFI data on  road descriptions and conditions that provide limited usefulness for  management and program oversight purposes and raise questions about  the value of maintaining the NTTFI as it is currently constructed.   Similarly, DMR may contain potentially outdated level of service data  describing road conditions.  In addition, DMR may contain inaccurate data  on maintenance needs because BIA does not document how it develops  maintenance cost estimates and tribes under-report maintenance  performed.  As a result, reports and budget submissions that rely on  these data may not accurately reflect road conditions or maintenance  needs and associated costs. This can inhibit the ability of Congress and  BIA management to make informed decisions about RMP priorities and  funding levels for the BIA road system.", "Many factors affect student attendance, among them the condition of  roads. BIE-funded schools vary in the data they collect and on the  reasons for student absences. Expanded guidance to schools to collect  such information would allow BIE to identify whether poor road conditions  and adverse weather affect attendance to better target interventions. Poor  road conditions also affect vehicle maintenance costs, which may not be  fully addressed in BIE\u2019s formula for funding student transportation.  However, BIE has not recently reviewed its funding formula and does not  know whether transportation funding is distributed in a way that reflects  disparate maintenance needs.  By working with BIA and tribes to revise  the transportation-funding formula, BIE has the opportunity to consider  how varying road conditions and other factors affect maintenance costs  and best align its resource allocation in relation to current needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making eight recommendations to the Secretary of the Interior.", "To help ensure that NTTFI is able to provide quality information to support  management and program oversight efforts, we recommend that the  Secretary of the Interior direct the Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs to  take the following three actions:   coordinate with the FHWA and tribal stakeholders and reexamine  the need for road-description and condition data currently  collected in the NTTFI and eliminate fields that do not serve an  identified purpose,  for fields determined to have continued relevance for management  and program oversight take steps to improve the quality of these  data by clarifying guidance in the NTTFI coding guide that tribes  use to collect data and by providing additional guidance on steps  needed to ensure that data are consistently reported, and establish a process to monitor data to facilitate timely and targeted  corrections to missing or erroneous data.", "To improve the DMR, we recommend that the Secretary of the Interior  direct the Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs to take the following three  actions: develop a means to document when the level of service for each  road section was last evaluated, develop and maintain documentation supporting the unit costs of  maintenance used to estimate maintenance needs, and develop a process for more complete and accurate reporting  occurring under existing authority of RMP funds expended for  performed maintenance on BIA roads.", "To improve data on reasons for student absences, we recommend that  the Secretary of the Interior direct the Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs to  provide guidance to BIE schools to collect data on student absences  related to road and weather conditions.", "To best align resources allocation decisions to needs, we recommend  that the Secretary of the Interior direct the Assistant Secretary-Indian  Affairs to review the formula to fund transportation at BIE schools and  determine, with BIA and tribal stakeholders, what adjustments, such as  distinguishing between gravel and paved roads, are needed to better  reflect transportation costs for schools."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Departments of the Interior,  Transportation, and Education for review and comment.

Interior neither agreed nor disagreed with two  of our recommendations and did not agree with one of our  recommendations. Interior\u2019s comments are reproduced in appendix VI.", "Interior agreed with our three recommendations for ensuring that NTTFI  can provide quality information to support management and program  oversight efforts.  Interior said that eliminating fields that do not serve an  identified purpose will reduce the large amount of missing and erroneous  data and noted that it will take steps to improve the quality of data by  updating the NTTFI coding guide.", "Interior agreed with two of our recommendations for improving DMR and  disagreed with one.", "Interior agreed with our recommendation to document when the  level of service for each road section was last evaluated. Interior  noted it would take this action for roads and bridges that have  been reconstructed or improved and for roads that have been  evaluated at a condition level of fair or better since the last  reporting cycle. Interior said that it is taking this approach because  it believes improvement to level of service can only occur with  reconstruction and not solely from road maintenance. This is a  good first step towards addressing our recommendation.   However, we continue to believe that Interior also needs to know  the level of service and needs to periodically evaluate and  document the evaluation date for all roads in order to effectively  identify and prioritize road maintenance needs.", "Interior agreed with our recommendation to develop and maintain  documentation supporting unit costs of maintenance used to  estimate maintenance needs. Interior noted that it intends to take  this action for tribes it directly serves, which we believe is a good  first step towards addressing this recommendation. While we  understand that tribes not directly served by BIA may not have to  report documentation of maintenance costs, BIA should continue  to obtain information from all tribes or other sources through other  means that are available and document the unit-cost estimates for  maintenance of all BIA roads. This will enable Interior to develop  complete and reliable cost estimates for all BIA roads.", "Interior disagreed with our recommendation to improve the DMR  by coordinating with tribal stakeholders to develop a process for  complete and accurate reporting of Road Maintenance Program  (RMP) funds expended for maintenance performed on BIA roads.  Interior stated that this action cannot be reasonably accomplished  as it conflicts with the intent of federal law and the minimum- reporting requirements when a tribal entity takes over the day-to- day actions and tasks of a program. In response to Interior\u2019s  concerns we have revised our recommendation to clarify that  Interior should develop a reporting process that can be  implemented with existing authority. We continue to believe that  Interior can develop a reporting process for the RMP and could  request tribes with self-determination contracts and self- governance compacts to follow such a process and could  implement such a process for tribes that it serves directly. By  coordinating with tribes and encouraging their self-reporting of  RMP funds expended for maintenance as well as improving data  collected on RMP activities that Interior administers, Interior can  improve the reporting of maintenance performed on BIA roads and  would be better positioned to provide Congress with more  accurate and complete information for funding decisions.", "Interior neither agreed nor disagreed with our recommendations to  provide guidance to BIE schools to collect data on student absences  related to road and weather conditions and to review the formula to fund  transportation at BIE schools and determine what adjustments are  needed. Nevertheless, Interior stated that it will explore the addition of a  field within its Native American Student Information System to capture  whether an individual student's absence is due to inclement weather or  road conditions.  In addition, Interior noted that it does not have authority  to make changes to the rule governing its formula to fund transportation  without proper engagement in a consultation process with tribes, but said  that it will take our recommendation under advisement. We continue to  believe that these recommendations are important for BIE to implement.", "As previously noted, we recently placed Indian programs, including Indian  education, serving Indian tribes and their members on our High-Risk  Series. Given past and ongoing challenges, it is critical that BIE take  action to enhance student access to school. By facilitating data collection  on student absences related to roads and weather, BIE will be in a better  position to understand the extent and consider strategies to address the  effect of road and weather conditions on student attendance. Additionally,  consultation with tribes is fully consistent with our recommendation on the  transportation funding formula.

(3) What is  known about the connection between road conditions on tribal lands and  school attendance as well as other aspects of school transportation?", "To determine the extent to which the NTTFI and DMR systems provide  useful data on road conditions on tribal lands, we reviewed federal  regulations, strategic plans, performance reports, agency reports, industry  practices, guidance, policies, and system documentation pertaining to the  collection, coding, and use of both databases; conducted electronic data  testing, such as for completeness, out-of-range values, and logical  inconsistencies; attended a training workshop on NTTFI data entry; and  interviewed Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Bureau of Indian  Affairs (BIA), and tribal officials about the systems. We analyzed the  NTTFI data as of September 2015\u2014which was the most recent available  data at the time of our review\u2014and the quarterly DMR system inventory  and road condition data for federal fiscal years 2009 through 2015. The  most recent data available was the first quarter 2016 DMR data, however,  we decided not to use it because we could not get full year data and we  wanted to ensure that the date of the most recent DMR data matched the  most recent NTTFI data we were able to obtain. To assess the usability of  the data, we reviewed the results of our electronic testing, interviewed  BIA officials regarding system controls (such as data system design,  monitoring, and edit checks) and other processes (such as cost  estimating practices) in place to promote data accuracy, consistency, and  completeness. We compared the information about each data system  design, monitoring, edit checks, and other processes to federal standards  for internal control.   We determined that these data were sufficiently  reliable for some purposes, such as the road section\u2019s location, owner,  and road surface type (existing roads only) for the NTTFI, but not others,  as described in the report.", "NTTFI data are part of BIA\u2019s Road Inventory Field Database System  (RIFDS)\u2014a broader database of BIA managed roads. To better  understand the overall system and data entry requirements, we attended  a RIFDS training workshop that focused on the process of entering and  deleting NTTFI data. The NTTFI data includes inventory, description, and  condition data for all Tribal Transportation Program (TTP) eligible roads,  bridges, and other transportation facilities in all 12 BIA Regions.

There are no BIA roads in the Alaska and  Eastern Oklahoma BIA regions, according to BIA officials, so these  regions were not included in our assessment of DMR data. We conducted  electronic testing on the following DMR data fields:  To identify any challenges stakeholders face in improving and maintaining  roads on tribal lands, we reviewed relevant federal laws such as the  Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991;  Transportation  Equity Act for the 21st Century;  the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient  Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users;  Moving Ahead for  Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21); and Fixing America\u2019s  Surface Transportation Act. We also reviewed the federal regulation,  guidance, and funding processes pertaining to the TTP and RMP.  We  reviewed both TTP and RMP program documentation including reports to  Congress on the program\u2019s performance measures and program goals.  We analyzed FHWA budget justification data and BIA RMP funding data  for fiscal years 2009 through 2016 to understand the annual level of  funding for each program during those years. We also reviewed tribal  transportation documents for conducting road improvement and  maintenance, such as selected tribes\u2019 program agreements (e.g., for  TTP), lists of tribal transportation projects and priority lists, and various  management plans.", "We interviewed FHWA and BIA headquarters and regional officials to  gain a better understanding of the TTP and RMP programs and examine  how the agencies coordinate with tribes to maintain and improve roads on  tribal lands. We also interviewed federal, state, local, and tribal  transportation officials on how they plan, prioritize, and coordinate road  projects, address jurisdictional issues and National Environmental Policy  Act requirements,  and manage other factors affecting road maintenance  and improvement on tribal lands. We conducted site visits to 10 selected  schools and school districts and 7 transportation offices within the Navajo,  Pine Ridge, and Rosebud Indian Reservations. The Navajo Nation is  located in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah and is within the BIA Navajo  Region; the Oglala Sioux and Rosebud Sioux Tribes are located in South  Dakota and are within the BIA Great Plains Region. While all 567  federally recognized tribes were considered for selection, these three  sites were chosen because they reflect factors such as different BIA  regions; considerable tribal and BIA road mileage; presence of Bureau of  Indian Education (BIE) schools; and different program agreements.  During our site visits, in addition to meeting with school, tribal, and  transportation officials, we observed road conditions first-hand, including  riding on school busses along their delivery routes. As part of one site  visit, we conducted a facilitated group discussion with 10 tribes from the  BIA Great Plains and Rocky Mountain Regions, including two tribes we  visited. Our site visits provide information and illustrative examples on a  range of road condition and student attendance issues on tribal lands but  are not generalizable to all tribal areas. We also attended four tribal  transportation-related conferences through which we met with various  tribal officials. We also met with tribal technical assistance experts and  representatives from national Indian associations such as the National  Congress of American Indians, Intertribal Transportation Association,  National Indian Education Association, and the National Indian Justice  Center.  Last, we obtained geospatial data from the Navajo Nation on  road ownership, road surface type, and road maintenance partnerships  for two school districts within the Navajo Nation. After analyzing the  geospatial data and partnership information, we developed maps and  provided those maps to the Navajo Nation and Coconino County  (Arizona) for them to review our analysis and validate that we developed  accurate maps.", "To determine what is known about the connection between road  conditions on tribal lands and school attendance as well as school  transportation, we used a variety of methods.

For both data  sets, we used the most recently available data and assessed reliability by  reviewing related documentation and interviewing knowledgeable agency  officials, among other steps. Based on these efforts, we determined that  these data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "We also interviewed Education and BIE officials on these issues and  conducted a literature review of national and international academic  studies written about factors that affect student attendance.

We  identified peer-reviewed studies published since 2000 through searches  in research databases, including the Education Resources Information  Center (ERIC), Scopus, and WorldCat. We also reviewed a list of studies  related to school attendance compiled and provided by the National  Library of Education of the Department of Education. Based on our  database searches and the list from Education, we reviewed abstracts  and introductions of studies, and determined that a total of 39 sources  were at least minimally relevant. We determined that 10 of the 39 identified studies were both methodologically sufficient and topically  relevant to the research objective. The 10 studies examined factors  connected with school attendance and absenteeism, which were  generally grouped into one or more of four categories: individual factors,  family factors, school factors, and environment or community factors,  where road conditions and related issues, such as adequate public  transportation, generally fell within the environment or community factor  category. We used a data collection instrument to consistently record  information about key findings related to the connection between road  condition and attendance from each relevant source.", "Lastly, as part of our site visits with the three Tribal Nations noted above,  we selected ten BIE schools and public school districts to visit on those  reservations.  We selected schools and districts with at least 50 enrolled  students and similar student demographics\u2014mostly Indian and mostly  low-income\u2014and with school bus routes of varying road surface types  (i.e., paved, gravel, and earth). At these 10 schools and districts, we  collected available information on attendance, school bus routes, and  road conditions along school bus routes.  We interviewed school and  district officials, including superintendents, principals, transportation  directors, business managers, bus drivers, as well as tribal community  officials.  Topics of these interviews and related data requests  addressed reasons of student absences, conditions of roads serving the  school, and changes to school bus routes due to road conditions, among  others. We directly observed the road conditions on school bus routes by  riding on or following behind school vehicles such as buses and sports  utility vehicles. We compared this information with guidance from an  education forum and federal standards for internal control.  During our  site visits, we took photographs and videos of road conditions on tribal  lands, the equipment used to maintain and repair them, and vehicles the  schools use to transport students on those roads.
