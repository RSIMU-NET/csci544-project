DIILS provides three types of assistance: (1) core rule of law training in the United States and abroad, (2) defense institution-building, and (3) statutorily required human rights training. DIILS takes steps to assess the quality of its assistance, such as by conducting student feedback surveys and real-time classroom assessments of students' learning. Foreign partner recipients of DIILS assistance and U.S. officials working to provide it told us they generally held positive views about the quality of DIILS's services.", "Although the demand for DIILS's assistance has increased since 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) has not assessed whether the size of DIILS's workforce aligns with the scope of its mission. Federal internal control standards highlight the need for management to conduct reviews at the functional or activity level, including conducting a workforce review, if needed. Since fiscal year 2013, the demand for DIILS's assistance has grown by nearly 50 percent, while its workforce has increased by one full-time equivalent (FTE) staff position. According to DIILS officials, as a result of staffing constraints, DIILS staff have completed 55 percent of required after action reports, which capture lessons learned for future events; expended 55 percent of all defense institution-building funds that DOD has made available since fiscal year 2013; and faced challenges in increasing capacity of residence courses to help meet demand. According to DOD officials, DOD has declined DIILS's requests for additional FTE staff based on budget considerations and not on an assessment of whether the size of DIILS's workforce aligns with the scope of its mission. Without a clear understanding provided by such an assessment, DOD cannot adequately ensure that DIILS is effectively meeting demands for its training and assistance to foreign military officials, which may contribute to more robust rule of law systems, more accountable governments, and greater respect for human rights."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["The Secretary of Defense should assess the extent to which the size of DIILS's workforce is aligned with the scope of its mission.

We focused on rule of law  assistance that DIILS provided and excluded rule of law assistance  provided by other DOD entities, the U.S. Agency for International  Development, and the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice.  We also excluded State assistance that DOD did not implement. To  examine the extent to which DIILS has provided rule of law assistance to  foreign partners and assessed its quality for fiscal years 2013 through  2016, we reviewed relevant authorities and identified the processes that  DOD and State have in place to plan rule of law assistance. We focused  on DIILS and the primary processes used to implement (1) core rule of  law training, determined through a series of interagency working groups;  (2) defense institution-building  assistance, determined by the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and State\u2019s Bureau of Political- Military  Affairs in coordination with DOD; and (3) statutorily required  human rights training, delivered pursuant to the authority to build the  capacity of foreign security forces as part of the Global Train and Equip  Program.

Rule of law assistance is an important component of U.S. efforts to build  foreign partner capacity, and according to officials, includes defense  institution-building  and foreign partner training focused on military justice,  human rights, anticorruption, and professionalization of the military.  Officials noted that countries with an established rule of law system have  more stability and fewer people trying to flee to other countries or turning  to terrorism. DOD integrates rule of law concepts into various types of  training and assistance carried out under Title 10 and Title 22 of the  United States Code. Title 10 covers authorities for the armed forces,  focusing primarily on DOD, whereas Title 22 covers authorities regarding  foreign relations, which primarily fall under State. According to officials,  most of this assistance is carried out through military-to-military events.  DOD schools, such as the U.S. Army War College, may also cover some  rule of law concepts as part of other training. (See app. II for examples of  rule of law assistance that various DOD entities implement.)", "DIILS is located in Newport, Rhode Island; its predecessor, the  International  Training Detachment of the Naval Justice School, was  created in 1992 to provide foreign militaries with training on the rule of  law, including human rights and the law of armed conflict, such as rules  for the use of force. In response to DOD and State initiatives in the past  decade, DIILS has expanded its curriculum to include rule of law issues  related to peacekeeping and combating terrorism. Since 1992, DIILS\u2019s  primary focus has been to provide rule of law assistance. According to  officials, DIILS has reached over 30,000 participants in over 140 countries  since it was created."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DIILS Funding Sources", "paragraphs": ["DIILS is funded entirely through reimbursements from DOD and State.  Demand for DIILS assistance may change from year to year. For fiscal  years 2013 through 2016, DOD and State used five primary funding  accounts to fund DIILS\u2019s rule of law assistance each year, with various  other accounts used less consistently. During this period, DIILS disbursed  about $6.2 million a year, on average, for rule of law events, $24.6 million  in total. Figure 1 shows the funding sources and the proportion of DIILS  disbursements attributed to each source for fiscal years 2013 through  2016.", "The funding sources for DIILS assistance are described below, in order of  the amount of total disbursements for fiscal years 2013 through 2016,  from largest to smallest.  1.  International Military Education and Training (IMET) funds account for  48 percent, $11.9 million, of DIILS disbursements for fiscal years 2013  through 2016 and include DIILS operating expenses. IMET  funds are  appropriated to the President. State prioritizes assistance and  develops policy guidance, while DOD has the primary responsibility  for implementing IMET activities. Primarily through IMET, DIILS  currently provides 17 mobile and 8 resident courses on topics ranging  from military justice and peacekeeping operations to legal aspects of  combating corruption and terrorism. Most mobile courses are taught  within a week, while resident courses are generally 3 weeks.  2.  Operation and Maintenance Defense-Wide funds account for 24  percent, $5.9 million, of DIILS disbursements for fiscal years 2013  through 2016 and cover overhead and planning requirements for  DIILS to develop and implement long-term global strategies for rule of  law security cooperation, including defense institution-building  assistance. DOD\u2019s Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy  is responsible for setting priorities and distributing these funds. For  example, DIILS has completed legal assessments in Armenia,  Indonesia, and Ukraine; supported military legislative reform in  Botswana; and conducted defense institution-building  scoping visits in  Cambodia, Guatemala, and Thailand, among other efforts.  3.  Global Train and Equip Program funds account for about 11 percent,  $2.6 million, of DIILS disbursements for fiscal years 2013 through  2016. DOD\u2019s Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Special  Operations and Low Intensity Conflict is responsible for policy  guidance and oversight of the Global Train and Equip Program, with  State concurrence. These funds provide military equipment, supplies,  and training to build the capacity of foreign military forces to conduct  counterterrorism operations, among other things. The legislation  authorizing these activities includes a provision requiring each project  to include elements that promote human rights and respect for civilian  authority within that country, a requirement that DOD has  designated DIILS to fulfill. According to DIILS, it meets this  requirement in a 2-day, in-country seminar.  4.  Peacekeeping Operations funds account for about 9 percent, $2.2  million, of DIILS disbursements for fiscal years 2013 through 2016  and are appropriated to State, and managed by its Bureau of Political- Military  Affairs, for use in regional security peacekeeping operations  and other programs carried out to further U.S. national security  interests. According to DOD, these funds can be transferred to DOD  to support specific requirements identified by a U.S. embassy or  geographic combatant command. Peacekeeping Operations funding  provided to DIILS since fiscal year 2013 has primarily focused on  building the legal capacity of magistrates in the Armed Forces of the  Democratic Republic of the Congo.  5.  Foreign Military Financing funds account for 4 percent, $1.0 million, of  DIILS disbursements for fiscal years 2013 through 2016. Foreign  Military  Financing funds are appropriated to the President. State  determines policy priorities for the use of the account, while DOD\u2019s  DSCA has overall responsibility for implementing Foreign Military  Financing funded programs. Foreign Military Financing funds allow for  the United States to sell defense articles and services to foreign  countries and international organizations if doing so will strengthen  the security of the United States and promote world peace. DIILS is  one DOD school, among others, that uses these funds to provide  training, such as resident and mobile courses, as well as defense  institution-building  efforts. Since fiscal year 2013, these funds have  been used in Belize, Colombia, Ghana, Mexico, and Ukraine, among  others.  6.  Other sources account for 4 percent, $0.9 million, of DIILS  disbursements for fiscal years 2013 through 2016 and include the  Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program and the Global Security  Contingency Fund, among others. The purpose of the Combating  Terrorism Fellowship Program is to provide foreign partners\u2019 mid- and  senior-level defense and security officials with operational and  strategic-level education on combating terrorism while reinforcing  partner-nation capabilities.

The responses were generally  positive, and participants most frequently noted that human rights,  international humanitarian law, and rules of engagement were the  most valuable topics covered in the course.", "Real-time assessments of participant comprehension. DIILS  facilitators generally encourage participation and gather feedback  from participants in real time to assess understanding, generally  making adjustments to their teaching as needed. For example, in  Uganda, we observed facilitators using classroom voting technology  as a basis for discussion and to signal when students were struggling  with the course content, allowing instructors to identify difficult  concepts and spend more time clarifying those concepts. During  fieldwork in Botswana, we observed DIILS officials updating planned  topics daily and corresponding preparatory materials nightly based on  how the meetings progressed and on daily feedback from foreign  partners as to what topics would be most helpful to discuss.", "After action reports. DIILS facilitators prepare after action reports for  certain events to record a summary of the assistance they provided,  outcomes of the training, any challenges they encountered, and  further actions to be taken. DIILS officials stated that after action  reports provide continuity and capture lessons learned for DIILS  facilitators who will be traveling to those countries in the future.

In  addition, for such an assessment, DIILS would research the country\u2019s  legal authorities beforehand to generate questions. DIILS would send a  team of up to four people to conduct the assessment, each with one or  more areas to focus on, such as the penal system. Typically, the DIILS  team would be in-country for 3 to 5 days and would produce a 40- to 70- page assessment, including a history of the foreign government,  information on its key military officials and military-related legal  authorities, and a roadmap for helping the partner nation move forward.  In-country DOD security cooperation officials could use this assessment  to decide whether and to what extent to pursue the course of action  outlined in the assessment. According to DIILS officials, DIILS does not  provide assistance to a country if that country is not receptive to it."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Not Assessed Whether the Size of DIILS\u2019s Workforce Aligns with the Scope of Its Mission", "paragraphs": ["The demand for DIILS\u2019s assistance has increased over time, as  summarized in table 2. However, DOD has not assessed whether the size  of DIILS\u2019s workforce aligns with the scope of its mission, which has been  expanded in response to statutory requirements and U.S. strategic goals.  Federal internal control standards highlight the need for management to  conduct reviews at the functional or activity level, which may include  conducting a workforce review or developing a corrective action plan, if  needed.", "Amid increasing demand and interest in DIILS\u2019s provision of defense- institution building assistance and statutorily required human rights  training, the number of events that DIILS has provided has increased  since fiscal year 2013, while its workforce has increased by a single full- time equivalent (FTE) staff, going from 28 FTE staff in 2013 to 29 FTE  staff in 2016, as illustrated by figure 7.", "Because the demand for DIILS\u2019s assistance is generated externally,  DIILS does not have full control of its workload. As figure 7 further shows,  the number of events that DIILS has provided for all rule of law assistance  has increased since fiscal year 2013\u2014with various DOD and State  sources requesting that DIILS complete 52 more events in fiscal year  2016 than it completed in fiscal year 2013. Currently, to respond to  requests for assistance, DIILS employs 29 FTE staff, which consist of 20  civilian staff and 9 military Staff Judge Advocates who represent the  Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines, and the Coast Guard. To  meet increasing demands for assistance and requests for specialized  subject matter expertise, DIILS augments its FTE staff with military  reserve Staff Judge Advocates and civilian experts. DIILS officials said that its adjunct database lists about 700 individuals and that multiple  adjunct staff generally participate in each DIILS event.", "Although DIILS is funded entirely through reimbursements from DOD and  State, its FTE staff must be approved by DSCA. In fiscal year 2015,  DSCA authorized one additional military FTE staff to address increasing  partner countries\u2019 maritime security needs. DIILS also requested an  additional civilian FTE staff in fiscal year 2015 in part to help meet the  increasing demands of defense institution-building  assistance; however,  according to DOD officials, DSCA did not approve this request. DOD  officials told us that the decision was based on budget considerations  rather than on an assessment of whether the size of DIILS\u2019s workforce  aligns with the scope of its mission to provide rule of law assistance.  Although DIILS officials expressed the need for more than one additional  FTE staff, they noted that they have not requested additional FTE staff  because DSCA has communicated that additional requests would not be  approved.", "According to DIILS officials, DIILS faces staffing constraints in part  because of increased demands and in part because defense institution- building assistance is more resource intensive than DIILS core rule of law  and statutorily required human rights training. As a result of the staffing  constraints, DIILS has expended only 55 percent\u2014$5.9 of $10.7 million\u2014 of the defense institution-building  funds that the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Policy has made available since fiscal year  2013. In addition, DIILS has not completed all required after action  reports for the training and assistance it conducted because DIILS has  not had the staff capacity to do so, according to DIILS officials. These  reports are necessary, according to DIILS officials, for conveying lessons  learned and providing consistency for military officials that serve on  rotational assignments and others who serve as adjunct faculty.  According to DIILS officials, only about 55 percent of required after action  reports since fiscal year 2013 had been completed as of August 2016  because the staff assigned to complete them spend up to three-quarters  of their time on assignments requiring travel abroad. These staff often  travel several weeks in a row to multiple events on different continents  where they are presenting course materials and executing logistics  arrangements for the teams of facilitators and the participants.", "Moreover, as a result of staffing constraints, DIILS has potentially missed  opportunities to provide additional training and assistance to further  address foreign partner needs. For example, an official from U.S.  Southern Command told us that they would hire DIILS to provide  additional assistance if they thought DIILS had the staff capacity to  provide it. However, because of the perceived lack of resources possibly  limiting DIILS\u2019s ability to provide the assistance, the official at U.S.  Southern Command said that resources within the combatant command  are used to provide assistance instead, often by officials that lack the  same level of expertise provided through DIILS. During fieldwork in  Germany, we also observed a DIILS official explaining  to a DOD in- country official that he could only guarantee providing the country with  core rule of law training if the country official used IMET  funds. He noted  that this is because DIILS\u2019s priority is to deliver IMET-funded  core rule of  law training and DIILS may lack staff resources to provide assistance  through other funds.", "In addition, according to DIILS officials, although DIILS has the physical  space to increase the capacity for the courses it holds in Newport, Rhode  Island, from 50 to 75 participants, DIILS is facing logistical challenges in  increasing capacity as a result of staffing constraints. For example, DIILS  does not have sufficient administrative staff to process travel documents  and provide the necessary transportation for that number of resident  course participants, according to DIILS officials.", "Federal internal control standards highlight the need for management to  conduct reviews at the functional or activity level, which may include  conducting a workforce review or developing a corrective action plan, if  needed. Applying this standard would help DOD address its Fiscal  Years 2013\u20132018 Strategic Workforce Plan Report, which states that the  success of the DOD mission requires a well-maintained, properly sized,  and highly capable civilian workforce that aligns to mission and workload  requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Upholding the rule of law is critical to U.S. peace- and security-building  efforts abroad.

Since fiscal  year 2013, the demand for DIILS\u2019s assistance has increased by nearly 50  percent. According to DIILS officials, because of its expanded mission  and the static size of its workforce, DIILS\u2019s ability to meet demands for  training and assistance has been constrained. These officials further note  that DIILS\u2019s ability to complete its after action reports\u2014internal records  necessary for conveying lessons learned\u2014and to increase the capacity of  its resident courses has also been constrained. DOD, however, has not  assessed the extent to which the size of DIILS\u2019s workforce aligns with the  scope of its mission. As such, DOD may not be assured that DIILS\u2019s  existing workforce is properly aligned with its expanded mission.

We focused on rule of law  assistance that DIILS provided and excluded rule of law assistance  provided by other DOD entities, the U.S. Agency for International  Development, and the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice.  We also excluded State assistance not covered under Title 22, such as  assistance provided by State\u2019s Bureau of International  Narcotics and Law  Enforcement Affairs.", "To examine the extent to which DIILS has provided rule of law assistance  to foreign partners and assessed its quality for fiscal years 2013 through  2016, we reviewed relevant authorities and identified the processes that  DOD and State have in place to plan rule of law assistance. We focused  on DIILS and the primary processes used to implement (1) core rule of  law training, determined through a series of interagency working groups;  (2) defense institution-building  assistance, determined by the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and State\u2019s Bureau of Political- Military  Affairs in coordination with DOD; and (3) statutorily required  human rights training, delivered pursuant to the authority to build the  capacity of foreign security forces as part of DOD\u2019s Global Train and  Equip Program. We also analyzed event data from DIILS for fiscal years  2013 through 2016. We used these data to determine the number of rule  of law events in various countries and geographic combatant commands.  To determine the reliability of DIILS\u2019s funding data, we compared and  corroborated the information, requested information from DIILS officials  regarding the processes they use to collect and verify the data, and  checked the data sets for reasonableness and completeness. When we  found discrepancies or missing data fields, we brought them to the  attention of relevant agency officials and worked with the officials to  correct the discrepancies and missing fields. The funding and activity data  we received from DIILS are current as of October 2016. We did not  conduct a financial audit of the funding data and are not expressing a  financial opinion on them. Based on the checks we performed, we  determined that the funding data we collected from DIILS were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives. Additionally,  we  obtained perspectives on the steps DIILS takes to make its assistance  effective by observing DIILS training in the United States, Botswana, and  Uganda and by reviewing select DIILS after action reports to gather  information about the contents of these reports. We also interviewed  DIILS officials and recipients of DIILS assistance. For the purposes of this  review, we did not examine the extent to which DIILS takes these steps  consistently. To examine the extent to which DIILS assessed the quality  of its assistance to foreign partners, we interviewed DIILS officials about  the steps they take to assess the quality of their assistance and foreign  recipients about their perspectives on the assistance they received. We  compared DIILS officials\u2019 statements with leading practices that we have  identified for assessing the quality of strategic training.", "To examine the extent to which the planning processes for DIILS\u2019s rule of  law efforts have considered the needs of foreign partners since fiscal year 2013, we observed a U.S. Africa Command interagency working group  conference for developing this assistance in Garmisch, Germany. We  selected this conference to observe because it was scheduled during the  period from March through May 2016 when we were available to conduct  fieldwork and did not conflict with other planned fieldwork. Additionally,  we reviewed integrated country strategies for the 10 countries for which  DIILS was reimbursed the most money for assistance in fiscal years 2013  through 2015. Of country-specific disbursements in over 70 countries  between fiscal years 2013 through 2015, we selected integrated country  strategies for the 10 countries that spent the most money on DIILS  assistance between fiscal years 2013 and 2015, accounting for over 60  percent of country-specific funds disbursed during that timeframe, or $3.6  million of $5.8 million. DIILS does not track DOD Operation and  Maintenance Defense-Wide defense institution-building  funds on a  country-by-country basis, so funding for this type of assistance was not  considered in selecting the top 10 countries. Ranked from most to least  amount of DIILS assistance, these countries are (1) the Democratic  Republic of the Congo, (2) Colombia, (3) Botswana, (4) the Czech  Republic, (5) Lebanon, (6) Mexico, (7) India, (8) Bosnia and Herzegovina,  (9) Burma, and (10) Niger. Additionally,  the countries represent all six  Geographic Combatant Commands: (1) U.S. Africa Command, (2) U.S.  Central Command, (3) U.S. European Command, (4) U.S. Northern  Command, (5) U.S. Pacific Command, and (6) U.S. Southern Command.  We reviewed those country strategies that covered 2015 and 2016  because the strategies were created on a 3-year rolling basis, and  strategies for 2015 and 2016 were the ones available for all 10 countries  in our scope. The results of our analysis are not generalizable to all  integrated country strategies. We selected two countries\u2014Uganda and  Botswana\u2014for observation based on the nature and timing of assistance  and the assistance that DIILS provided from March through May 2016,  when we were available to conduct overseas fieldwork. We also  conducted fieldwork at DIILS\u2019s headquarters in Newport, Rhode Island.", "In Uganda, we observed DIILS officials providing statutorily required  human rights training to military personnel in the Uganda People\u2019s  Defense Force, which received $12.7 million in vehicles, weapons,  and communications equipment, among other supplies, in support of  the African Union Mission in Somalia and its counterterrorism  operations against al-Shabaab.", "In Botswana, we observed DIILS officials providing a week of  technical assistance to representatives of the Botswana Defence  Force in support of its effort to revise and update the foundational  military legislative authority of Botswana. These discussions included  best practices and U.S. experiences related to gender integration;  compensation for various employee groups, including recruits and  retirees; and nonpunitive measures in the military. This was the  seventh of eight planned exchanges since 2013, with the final  exchange planned to occur prior to when Botswana\u2019s legislature  would consider the revised legislation.", "In Newport, Rhode Island, we observed part of a 3-week military  justice resident course held at DIILS that included an exercise on  nonjudicial punishment attended by foreign military lawyers from  various military services and one civilian official.", "Additionally,  we reviewed theater campaign plans for U.S. Africa  Command, U.S. Central Command, U.S. Northern Command, U.S.  Pacific Command, and U.S. Southern Command but did not include an  analysis of these documents because DOD deems them sensitive. We  focused on core rule of law training and defense institution-building  assistance for this discussion. We excluded statutorily required human  rights training because although DIILS works closely with various entities  to plan and deliver this training, the law requires that DOD provide this  training pursuant to the authority to build the capacity of foreign security  forces as part of the Global Train and Equip Program.

Specifically, we  reviewed DIILS\u2019s full-time equivalent allocations from fiscal years 2013  through 2016, and we compared these to the number of events DIILS provided in the three assistance types during this timeframe. We worked  closely with DIILS  officials to identify  the events  for which after action  reports were required during this time period. In addition,  we reviewed a  DIILS  official\u2019s analysis of the number of after action reports that were  completed, as well as his methodology for completing this analysis.
