Three major reasons for the enactment of section 127 were cited in a June 1988 Department of the Treasury report: (1) to reduce the complexity of the tax system, (2) to reduce possible inequities among taxpayers, and (3) to provide opportunities for upward mobility for less educated individuals. This report also explained that prior law required individuals to pay income taxes on the amount paid for training for new jobs or occupations if an employer had paid for it, a situation that was considered inequitable for those least able to pay but most in need of the education.", "Since section 127 was first authorized, it has expired and has been extended eight times. Several changes were made by these extensions, including setting an annual limit on the amount that can be excluded from employees\u2019 gross income (currently $5,250) and establishing an annual reporting requirement (Form 5500). Based on our 1989 report which noted an absence of data on the use of employer-provided educational assistance, IRS developed Schedule F to supplement Form 5500. This form and schedule require employers to report information on (1) the number of employees eligible for such assistance, (2) the number of employees who received such assistance, and (3) the value of the assistance provided.", "The series of expirations and extensions of section 127 has contributed to problems with the quality of available IRS data. For example, the 1993 extension was not enacted until several months after section 127 had expired and the tax filing year had ended. Companies experienced uncertainty about how and whether to report educational assistance as employee income and withhold taxes from it. Some companies included assistance in employees\u2019 income and withheld taxes, others did not. Ultimately, the extension was passed retroactively, which resulted in those companies that had reported the assistance as employee income having to refile employee wage statements and tax returns. Because of this, IRS has acknowledged that some employers may not have filed the required IRS forms, thus information about section 127 reported to IRS may not be complete. However, IRS officials told us that they believe most employers complied with the reporting requirements during the last expiration period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Tax Treatment of Educational Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Aside from section 127, three tax provisions generally determine the tax treatment of educational assistance: Section 117\u2014Qualified Scholarships; Section 132\u2014Certain Fringe Benefits; and Section 62(a)(2)(A)\u2014Reimbursed Expenses of Employees. Under section 117, educational assistance provided by qualified educational institutions to employees and their dependents can be excluded from employees\u2019 gross income. Under section 132, employees can exclude employer-provided educational assistance from their gross income if it qualifies as a working condition fringe benefit. A working condition fringe benefit is any property or service an employer provides to an employee that, had the employee paid for such property or services, the employee could deduct the payment from his/her income as a business expense. Under section 62, employees can exclude educational assistance from their income if the assistance is provided as part of an employer\u2019s \u201caccountable plan,\u201d which requires that assistance be business-related, expenses be documented, and employees be required to return any excess payments. These three provisions do not have a dollar limit on the amount of assistance that can be excluded.", "Otherwise, employer-provided educational assistance must be included in employees\u2019 gross income. Under certain conditions, however, employees may deduct educational assistance that has been included in their income. Decisions as to whether such assistance included in an employee\u2019s gross income can be deducted depend on whether the assistance qualifies as a business expense under section 162 of the IRC. Section 162 discusses the circumstances under which an employer\u2019s educational assistance expenses are related to an employee\u2019s job and therefore are deductible. It allows individuals who itemize deductions on their tax returns to deduct qualifying job-related educational expenses and other miscellaneous itemized deductions from gross income. Moreover, qualifying educational expenses and other miscellaneous itemized deductions are deductible only to the extent that they exceed 2 percent of the individual\u2019s adjusted gross income.", "Figure 1 illustrates an IRS aid to assist taxpayers in determining whether educational expenses are deductible.", "Does the  education  maintain or business? job? work?"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our objectives were to provide information about (1) employer-provided educational assistance, including the characteristics of employers providing educational assistance and employees eligible for and receiving it, and (2) other tax provisions related to employer-provided educational assistance and how they differ from section 127.", "To achieve the first objective, we identified and obtained relevant data.

Moreover, 22 strata were defined for the selection of institutions and two sampling strata were developed through the classification of institutions based on two criteria: (1) type of ownership or control, e.g., public, private/nonprofit, or private/for-profit institutions and (2) the length of time required to complete the highest degree offered, e.g., 4-year, 2-year, or less than 2-year.", "A sampling of 1,386 institutions was allocated to the 22 strata and 2 sampling frames.

Nonsampling errors are due to a number of sources, including but not limited to, nonresponse, inaccurate coding, misspecification of composite variables, and inaccurate imputations. The Data Analysis System procedures that compute the estimates required 30 or more unweighted cases. Some estimates were not calculated because fewer than 30 cases were in the NPSAS analysis file.", "According to the NPSAS methodology report, the 1992-1993 data is not comparable with prior NPSAS estimates.
