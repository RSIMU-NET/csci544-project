While we previously reported that the use of depreciation presents many practical difficulties in making budget decisions about levels of federal investments, we believe that more research in this area contributes to the overall debate about capital budgeting.", "In addition to investment spending, the federal government makes other expenditures of a capital nature which are intended to provide future benefits to the government as an operating entity; examples are office buildings and computer systems. There might be benefits from some change in the budget treatment of this type of spending, but that issue was not the subject of the request and, therefore, is not addressed in this study. It needs to be considered separately on its own merits.", "We found widespread agreement among accounting and budgeting experts that the federal government generally does not depreciate transportation infrastructure, research and development (R&D), and human capital for either accounting or budgeting purposes. In our research we found no evidence that states or private sector businesses use depreciation in budgeting for any of these types of investments. However, economists depreciate infrastructure and R&D investments in their more global analyses to make rough estimates of national wealth.", "We found virtually no sources that identified methods by which these investments could reasonably be depreciated for federal accounting or budgeting purposes. Our review of the professional literature and consultation with budget and accounting experts did not support depreciating such investments in federal budgeting as useful or appropriate because (1) it could undermine budgetary control (2) it would result in depreciating assets the government does not own, and (3) determining the value and useful life of these investments would be difficult to do.", "We believe that depreciation for these types of federal investments is not an appropriate budgetary treatment. However, we do believe that federal investments with long-term potential benefits for economic growth and productivity should be considered differently than is presently done in the budget. One option we have previously discussed is to include an investment component in the budget focusing on these areas of investment within the Budget Enforcement Act framework, possibly with a separate floor for investment spending, to help ensure attention to these needed areas of investment while preserving the established controls in the current budget process.", "We are sending copies of this study to interested congressional committees and the Directors of the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office.

The federal government contributes to investment in two primary ways.", "First, the federal government can facilitate private investment by reducing the federal deficit. Federal budget deficits have absorbed large proportions of national savings that would otherwise have been available to finance investments, either public or private.", "Second, within an established fiscal policy, the federal government can change the proportion of government spending devoted to investment. In the past, federal investments in infrastructure, human capital, and R&D have played a key role in economic growth, either directly or by creating an environment conducive to private sector investment.", "Both the Congress and the administration are considering budgeting alternatives to decrease the annual federal deficit while increasing long-term federal investment intended to enhance private sector growth. Some discussions have focused on capital budgeting and the possible use of depreciation in the budget as a measure of the cost of federal investments which deliver benefits over a future period of time. These investments include infrastructure such as highways, bridges, and air traffic control systems; R&D, which produces new technology that leads to innovative products and processes; and investments in human capital through education and training designed to increase worker productivity.", "Depreciation is an integral component in capital budgeting\u2014a proposal contained in several bills in recent years. A capital budget approach using depreciation would report total acquisition costs of the investment in a capital budget and the annual depreciation in an operating budget. The cost of the investment recorded in the operating budget would thus be spread over the estimated life of the investment. The operating budget would reflect the cost of goods and services consumed rather than purchased during the period. Under most capital budgeting proposals, the operating budget must balance while the capital budget may be financed by borrowing. By contrast, the federal budget is a unified cash-based budget which treats outlays for capital and operating activities the same.", "Federal debt is undertaken for general purposes of the government rather than for specific projects or activities.", "Three views have been cited in support of proposals to depreciate investments in the federal budget. First, the long-lived nature of the benefits arising from these investments causes some analysts to believe that their costs should also be spread over time by some method of depreciation so that costs are shared by those who will benefit in the future. Second, some analysts believe that because the initial cost of these investments is high, budgeting for the full commitment up-front discourages investment and favors consumption spending. Finally, proponents believe that budgeting for depreciation instead of the full commitment up-front frees up budgetary resources for greater investment or other uses in the current period and reduces the current year\u2019s deficit.", "Other analysts, taking an opposing view, believe that depreciation would not really free up resources or reduce the deficit. Such a proposal would only redefine the deficit to be controlled as the operating budget deficit rather than the larger unified budget deficit. This would mean that any spending categorized as \u201ccapital\u201d would not be subject to the same pressures to reduce the deficit as any other federal spending. Thus, it might be used to justify larger unified budget deficits and borrowing. In addition, they believe that appropriating annual depreciation instead of the amount of the full commitment undertaken by the government poses a loss of budgetary control that would threaten the integrity of the budget and the budget process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The objectives of this review were to determine (1) whether federal agencies are depreciating transportation infrastructure, R&D, and human capital for accounting and budgeting purposes, and if so, the methods they use, (2) whether any state, local, or foreign governments are depreciating these investments, and (3) whether depreciation of these investments could be useful in budgeting. Based on the items traditionally included in these categories, we define infrastructure as federally funded physical transportation assets, such as highways, bridges, railways, and air traffic control systems. We define R&D as federally funded activities intended to produce new or improved products or processes. For purposes of this study, we define investment in human capital as federally funded education and training programs.", "To meet these objectives, we discussed the concept of depreciation as a budgeting tool with professional staff at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).", "We also discussed depreciation from an accounting and budgeting perspective with officials at the Departments of Education and Transportation, the National Science Foundation, the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the Federal Railroad Administration.

It is also a factor in determining the cost of manufactured items and the amount of user charges appropriate for services rendered.", "Depreciation of assets in federal accounting is often not done because it is difficult to do and often provides little relevant information. In the past, federal accounting standards for non-business-type activities established by GAO, known as Title 2, encouraged, but did not require, depreciation of general tangible assets. However, Title 2 did require depreciation accounting for all federal business-type activities in cases where depreciation of federal assets were used to establish sales prices or user charges necessary to reimburse revolving funds or otherwise recover costs. In these cases, federal agencies do depreciate the relevant assets to determine user charges to recover the cost of the asset. Presently, FASAB is considering standards that would require federal agencies to depreciate infrastructure assets owned by the federal government, but probably not intangible investments such as R&D and human capital.", "GASB, which sets accounting standards for state and local governments, prohibits recording annual depreciation charges in financial statements for the general fund because these funds do not operate on a strictly accrual basis. Depreciation, which is an expense, applies only to accrual-based accounting systems. GASB standards, however, do require the reporting of depreciation in financial statements for proprietary and certain trust fund assets because these funds are reported on an accrual rather than a cash basis.", "If depreciation methodologies were to be used in federal budgeting, one starting point for establishing those methodologies conceivably would be the accounting methods used for depreciation of tangible assets for financial statement purposes. Depreciation in accounting can be a complex and technical subject and involves significant subjectivity concerning such key factors as the asset\u2019s value, its useful life, and its salvage value. Because of its subjective nature, it is only an approximation of how much of an asset is used up in any period. Ultimately, depreciation of tangible assets is an imperfect way of spreading costs over the asset\u2019s useful life. Trying to apply depreciation accounting techniques to intangible assets such as R&D and human capital investment for either accounting or budgeting purposes would be even more difficult because of the additional difficulties in estimating value, useful life, or establishing ownership."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Basic Depreciation Calculations", "paragraphs": ["Calculating the amount of depreciation to be recorded annually depends on how assets are valued to determine the depreciation base, the depreciation method used, and the asset\u2019s useful life."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Asset Valuation", "paragraphs": ["There are three general ways to value assets\u2014historical cost, constant cost, and current cost.

Constant cost restates historical cost information in terms of dollars of equal purchasing power. Current cost is the amount of cash or other consideration that would be required today to obtain the same asset or its equivalent. Market prices are often used to determine current cost. Which of these valuation methods is chosen greatly affects the depreciation base. While historical cost is most widely used and documented, current cost provides a more relevant measure of the resources tied up in a particular asset and the cost to replace the asset.

The reason given for this is that the federal government does not own most of the transportation assets it funds. The federal government funds most transportation infrastructure through grants. For example, the federal government spent more than $24 billion on physical transportation investments in 1993, but more than $21 billion of this spending was in the form of grants.", "Generally accepted accounting principles established by FASB provide that infrastructure assets owned by the reporting entity, such as railroad tracks owned by the entity, are depreciated in the entity\u2019s financial statements. At this time, federal accounting standards for infrastructure assets not owned by the federal government do not provide for recording grantee assets for purposes of depreciation. FASAB is considering standards for infrastructure assets owned by the federal government, but not for infrastructure grants or assets owned by grantees.", "DOT analysts cited two major problems with depreciating assets which DOT does not own. First, it is often difficult, and in some cases impossible, to link federal grant money to the value of a specific infrastructure asset. In part, this is because it is difficult to distinguish how the federal share of funding is used when mixed with funding from other sources. It is also difficult to assign value to portions of a project that are only components of larger projects. Also, if federal investment expenditures cannot be linked directly to an asset, there is no basis for determining a useful life over which to spread the cost.", "A second problem cited by analysts at DOT is the difficulty of monitoring the value of an asset not owned by the entity seeking to depreciate it. The owners of an infrastructure asset can improve or discard that asset at their own discretion, although in the case of highways the federal government may share in any monetary return resulting from disposition. Applying the concept of depreciation to federal grants could result in a situation in which an annual depreciation charge would appear in the federal budget for an asset that is not owned by the federal government or that may not even exist any longer.", "Analysts at DOT said that the effort that would be required to determine the value of depreciable transportation assets funded by grants would be large and would detract from DOT\u2019s other missions.

Even New Zealand, the only OECD nation that uses depreciation in its budget, does not appropriate depreciation for infrastructure assets that are owned by the government as a whole. New construction of roads and other infrastructure assets owned by the New Zealand government as a whole are appropriated up front on a cash basis. In this instance, New Zealand\u2019s system is, in principle, similar to the system that is used to budget for highways in the United States. Infrastructure assets not owned by the New Zealand government are not depreciated by the government for either budgeting or financial reporting purposes.

However, they can be capitalized and depreciated in both if they result in a product or process which is demonstrated to be technically useful and is intended to be used or marketed. In cases where this is anticipated, depreciation is deferred until a market asset is produced.

Similar to the DOT with its highway grants, the Department of Education funds education and training mostly through grants for which there is no standard or methodology for depreciation.

In these economywide analyses, the problems of determining ownership or control of assets are not relevant. However, the analysts who generate these estimates maintain that this type of analysis is inappropriate for budgeting because (1) the estimates are imprecise and dependent on questionable assumptions and (2) because measures of stocks have no place in a budget that allocates resource flows.", "In making national economic wealth estimates, the BEA and OMB use a valuation method called the perpetual inventory method.

This sum is then reduced by depreciation and estimated discarded investment to determine net investment. All OECD nations use the perpetual inventory method in estimating their national wealth.", "BEA and OMB have both estimated the value of the stock, that is, inventories, of physical capital investments including infrastructure. In making estimates of the value of the nation\u2019s stocks of economic wealth, BEA depreciates the estimated stock of infrastructure assets valued on historical cost, constant cost, and current cost bases using straight-line depreciation over a 50-year estimated useful life. OMB estimates the total net federally financed physical capital stock including transportation stocks, regardless of ownership. OMB made its estimates using a constant dollar adjustment to historical federal spending for transportation and depreciated it on a straight-line basis.

Thus, in general, the total commitment of the government in making an investment is usually recorded up front, not spread over the useful life of the investment.", "No state records annual depreciation in its capital or operating budgets because depreciation has no effect on the flow of current financial resources.

Businesses do, however, include a cost of capital (primarily principal and interest payments) in their financial budgets. Textbooks on private business budgeting practices indicate that depreciation is irrelevant for budgeting except where income taxes are affected. Private businesses use depreciation primarily for two purposes: (1) to match revenues with expenses in a given period for the purposes of reporting profit or loss in financial statements and (2) for tax purposes. Neither of these purposes, however, are applicable to federal budgeting, except for federal business-type activities which consider revenues and expenses in setting user fees.", "Of the OECD member nations only one, New Zealand, uses depreciation in its budget. New Zealand began to apply depreciation to budgeting in 1992 as a part of its transition from a cash to an accrual-based budgeting system. New Zealand\u2019s accrual-based budgeting system includes depreciation for department or agency-owned physical assets in the budget statements where the depreciation is appropriated as part of the cost of departmental operations. However, assets owned by the government as a whole, such as transportation infrastructure and some R&D, are depreciated in the financial statements, but are not appropriated in the budget. New Zealand does not depreciate expenditures for human capital in either its financial or budget statements.", "In talking to budget experts, we identified four major disadvantages in the use of depreciation for federal investments in infrastructure, R&D, and human capital: (1) loss of budgetary control, (2) increasing uncertainty over budget estimates, (3) obscuring the effect of budgetary decisions on the deficit, and (4) concern with depreciating assets not owned by the federal government.", "The greatest disadvantage according to these experts was that depreciation would result in a loss of budgetary control under an obligation-based budgeting system. In general, the federal budget records the full cost of its spending decisions up front in terms of both budget authority and outlays so that decisionmakers have the information needed and an incentive to take the full cost of any decision into account. The only time that spending on a federal investment can be controlled is before obligations are made. After obligation, recipients of the spending expect it to occur and the government is generally committed to payment of all the costs. Depreciation, on the other hand, would spread that cost over the asset\u2019s expected useful life. The focus of control for the operating budget\u2014the component that would be subject to a balanced budget requirement\u2014would not be on the total up-front government commitment because, by the time the commitment would be fully recognized in the operating budget, the expenditures would have already been made. Although decisionmakers would consider the up-front costs of an investment in the capital budget, this budgetary component would not be subject to resource constraints or balanced budget requirements, thereby diminishing the incentives to carefully weigh total costs and benefits.", "This loss of budget control would be evident in two ways. First, under Budget Enforcement Act provisions, investment spending would be transformed from a discretionary decision in the current year to a stream of sunk mandatory payments in future years to finance the depreciation charge. This would diminish budgetary flexibility in the discretionary portion of the budget. Second, without the establishment of some new method of control, depreciation of investments would nearly eliminate budgetary constraints on current investments. Since assets are only depreciated after they have been fully constructed and put into service, outlays for current investments would not be recognized in the operating budget until the annual depreciation charges began. For example, spending on the recently cancelled Superconducting Super Collider would not have been included in any prior year\u2019s budget nor have been subject to any spending cap because it was never put into service. In addition, all previous spending would appear in the budget in the year it was cancelled, setting up a perverse incentive to continue the program rather than to absorb the accumulated past spending in 1 year.", "Depreciation could be applied to the federal budget process only if it were accompanied by new methods of control that would provide discipline for making up-front commitments that would not destroy budgetary integrity. For example, when New Zealand included depreciation in its budgetary process, it substantially reformed its budget process to include new controls on agencies. These controls included the imposition of asset caps and the establishment of output contracts which established performance goals for agency heads.", "A major disadvantage to using depreciation in the federal budget cited by budget experts is its effect on the quality of budget estimates. They are concerned that depreciation of investments would make budget estimates uncertain and/or unreliable. Determining any asset\u2019s useful life is a complicated technical exercise that is inherently subjective. For example, OECD recently surveyed the useful lives over which capital equipment was depreciated in 14 OECD countries and found wide discrepancies in the average life for the same categories of assets. The range for capital equipment was 11 years in Japan to 26 years in the United Kingdom. Uncertainties about the useful lives for assets with possibly indefinite lives, such as highways, and intangible assets, such as R&D and education, would be even greater. Cash flows provide a more certain and more objective basis for making budgetary decisions.", "Another major disadvantage cited by budget experts is the claim that depreciation would undermine the usefulness of the budget as a fiscal policy measure. The generally cash-based federal budget deficit is currently designed to provide an indication of the level of federal borrowing. Budget decisionmakers consider, among other things, the effect of federal borrowing on the economy in general and the national credit markets in particular. If depreciation, a noncash cost allocation, is recorded in the budget in lieu of actual cash payments, budgetary decisions would no longer be connected to their impact on the government\u2019s borrowing.", "We recognize that there are already departures from a cash-based budget process when the cash basis fails to recognize the government\u2019s full commitment up front. Credit reform, for example, is a revised method, specified in the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, of controlling and accounting for credit programs in the budget. It requires that the full cost of credit programs over their entire lives be included in the budget up front so that the full cost is considered when making budget decisions. However, changes in the treatment of the investment spending we reviewed would do the opposite. For such spending, departing from the cash basis of budgeting by budgeting depreciation would actually spread the government\u2019s commitment over time rather than recognizing it when it is made.", "Finally, budget experts mentioned the difficulty of depreciating assets that are not owned by the federal government. Many of the investment expenditures of the federal government are made in the form of grants for assets or intangibles that the federal government does not own. There is currently no provision in any accounting standard for depreciating assets that are not owned. Grants are normally accounted for as current expenditures.", "Despite the disadvantages cited in using depreciation for budget or resource allocation decisions, there is widespread agreement in the literature and among the budget experts and program analysts we interviewed that depreciation can be a useful analytical tool for certain other purposes. For example, information on depreciation costs may be one factor considered in making budgetary decisions by serving as a reminder that aging assets may require replacement or maintenance. Depreciation may also be used to measure the operating cost of an activity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Investment Component in the Budget", "paragraphs": ["We have previously reported that depreciation is not a practical alternative for the Congress and the administration to use in making decisions on the appropriate level of spending intended to enhance the nation\u2019s long-term economic growth.

In our view, unlike a focus on incremental depreciation charges, this approach has the advantage of focusing budget decisionmakers on the overall level of investment supported in the budget without losing sight of the unified budget deficit\u2019s impact on the economy.
