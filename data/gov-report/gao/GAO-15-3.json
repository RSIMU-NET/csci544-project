DOJ is responsible for pursuing federal civil and criminal penalties for IMBRA violations. State has guidance on processes for providing IMBRA information to beneficiaries (referred to as disclosures), such as a pamphlet outlining for beneficiaries the K visa process and legal rights and resources available to immigrant crime victims. Specifically, State's guidance requires consular officers to document within case notes in State's database whether they made all of the IMBRA-required disclosures to the beneficiary during the visa interview. However, GAO's review of a sample of K visa applications showed that in about 52 percent of interview case notes (76 of 147), consular officers did not document that they had provided beneficiaries the IMBRA pamphlet as required by State's guidance. In October 2014, State drafted a guidance cable for consular officers on IMBRA implementation, including a reminder to follow guidance regarding IMBRA documentation. State's consular officer training courses, however, do not cover IMBRA-related documentation procedures outlined in its guidance. Incorporating IMBRA-related documentation requirements into training courses could help State better ensure that consular officers are aware of the requirements for documenting IMBRA disclosures.", "Consistent with IMBRA, USCIS is to collect and maintain data on, among other things, eight elements in the K visa process for GAO reporting purposes; however, six of the eight elements are either not reliable or are not collected or maintained in a reportable (i.e., electronic) format. Thus, these elements were not readily available for GAO's review. For example, USCIS is to collect and maintain data on I-129F petitions where the petitioner had one or more criminal convictions. This information is maintained in hard copy in the petition file and thus was not readily available for GAO's review. USCIS has begun planning to electronically capture I-129F petition data under the agency's overarching transformation to an electronic immigration benefits system. However, this transformation has faced significant delays, and as of September 2014, the electronic I-129F petition design requirements have not been finalized. Consistent with federal internal control standards, ensuring that all of the IMBRA-related requirements will be captured with the release of the I-129F electronic petition would better position USCIS to collect and maintain complete data on petitioners for reporting purposes and management oversight. Further, USCIS officers have not consistently adjudicated I-129F petitions or recorded complete and accurate data. Specifically, GAO found that USCIS's data are not reliable for determining the number of I-129F petitions filed by persons who have previously filed I-129F petitions for a fianc\u00e9(e) or spouse or that required IMBRA waivers because of, among other things, officer error in recording data on petitions.

As amended, the International Marriage Broker  Regulation Act of 2005 (IMBRA) seeks to address issues of domestic  violence and abuse against beneficiaries by petitioners, including those  who meet their foreign-born fianc\u00e9(e)s through an international marriage  broker (IMB). Among other things, IMBRA contains requirements  intended to ensure that a beneficiary is informed if his or her petitioner  has a criminal history or has filed multiple prior petitions for fianc\u00e9(e)s or  spouses (known as I-129F petitions) to travel to the United States. U.S.  Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), within the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS), is responsible for adjudicating petitions for K  visas. Within USCIS, the Service Center Operations Branch is  responsible for overseeing all activities performed at its four service  centers, which handle the filing, data entry, and adjudication of  applications for certain immigration services and benefits. Consequently,  USCIS is responsible for collecting, among other information, the  petitioners\u2019 criminal and filing histories and, in accordance with IMBRA,  forwarding this information to the Department of State (State) for  disclosure to the beneficiary. State\u2019s consular officers at U.S. embassies  and consulates overseas adjudicate K visa applications and are to  disclose information on petitioners\u2019 criminal background, including any  convictions and protection orders, and any prior I-129F filings to the  beneficiary before adjudicating the K visa application (referred to as  disclosures). IMBRA also imposes disclosure and other requirements on  IMBs to help inform and provide greater assurance for the safety of  noncitizen fianc\u00e9(e)s who meet their petitioners through an IMB. IMBRA  further identifies the Department of Justice (DOJ) as responsible for  seeking civil and criminal penalties for violations of its provisions,  including, for example, instances where an IMB provides personal contact  information of a foreign client (generally, the beneficiary) to someone  other than the potential U.S. client (generally, the petitioner).", "In 2008, we reported on the status of agencies\u2019 implementation of  IMBRA. IMBRA, as amended by the Violence Against Women  Reauthorization Act of 2013, mandates that we review and report on the  continuing impact of the implementation of IMBRA. In support of our  reviews, IMBRA has required that DHS, State, and DOJ collect and  maintain the data necessary for GAO to conduct the required studies.  This report addresses the extent to which (1) DHS, State, and DOJ have  implemented processes to ensure compliance with IMBRA requirements,  and (2) DHS collects and maintains reliable data to manage the K visa  process.", "To determine the extent to which DHS, State, and DOJ have  implemented processes to ensure compliance with IMBRA, we reviewed  IMBRA, relevant INA provisions, and the I-129F petition and its  instructions. We analyzed USCIS\u2019s standard operating procedures (SOP)  for the adjudication of I-129F petitions and for conducting background  checks on petitioners. We also reviewed USCIS\u2019s plans and efforts to  revise the I-129F petition and compared these plans and efforts against  project management standards. We reviewed State\u2019s guidance for adjudicating K visa applications, including relevant sections of the Foreign  Affairs Manual (FAM), relevant cables to consular officers, and the  IMBRA pamphlet distributed to K visa applicants. We reviewed DOJ\u2019s  July 2013 report to Congress describing steps that DOJ, DHS, and State  can take to develop policies and procedures for identifying, investigating,  and prosecuting IMBRA violations. We interviewed DHS, State, and  DOJ headquarters officials responsible for implementing IMBRA  provisions at each agency. In addition, we interviewed USCIS officers  who adjudicate I-129F petitions, supervisors, and fraud detection officials  at four USCIS service centers (California, Nebraska, Texas, and  Vermont) where the majority of I-129F petitions since fiscal year 2013  have been adjudicated.Centers. The information collected from interviews with USCIS officers at  these service centers cannot be projected to all USCIS officers. However,  the site visits and interviews provided us with the perspectives of USCIS  officers and supervisors responsible for adjudicating I-129F petitions in  these locations.", "We visited the Vermont and California Service  In addition, we reviewed consular officers\u2019 interview notes in State\u2019s  Immigrant Visas Overseas (IVO) database for K visa applications  associated with 227 I-129F petitions submitted to USCIS from March  2012 through March 2014, for which USCIS\u2019s data indicated petitioners  had multiple prior I-129F petitions (referred to as multiple filers) and  criminal histories. We selected this time frame because USCIS did not collect automated data on multiple filers with criminal histories prior to  March 2012. We analyzed the interview notes against IMBRA and FAM  requirements, and compared the guidance and training provided to  consular officers on IMBRA implementation with standards in Federal  Standards for Internal Controls in the Federal Government and GAO\u2019s  guide for assessing strategic training and development efforts. We  found State\u2019s consular notes data to be sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of determining whether, in accordance with IMBRA, consular  officers disclosed this information to beneficiaries based on our review of  FAM guidance regarding what consular officers should denote in IVO and  interviews with consular affairs officials. Later in this report, we discuss  limitations in USCIS\u2019s data on multiple filers, but we determined that  USCIS data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of identifying I- 129F petitions where State was required to make disclosures to K visa  applicants based on our review of USCIS\u2019s data, State guidance for  processing visa applications, and State officials\u2019 descriptions of quality  controls and assurance checks.

We also analyzed CLAIMS 3 transaction-level data from March  2012 through March 2014 on more than 4,200 I-129F petitions for which  the data indicated the petitioners were multiple filers. We also analyzed  227 I-129F petitions approved during this same time period, for which the  data indicated the petitioner was a multiple filer with a record of violent  criminal offenses, and as such, required a waiver in order to have his or  her petition approved. We compared the data maintained within CLAIMS  3 with IMBRA\u2019s information collection requirements and with standards in  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government for ensuring  that agency transactions are accurate and clearly documented and  GAO\u2019s best practices for assessing strategic training and development  efforts. We assessed the reliability of these data by (1) reviewing  existing documentation on the controls in CLAIMS 3 and the policies for  ensuring data reliability; (2) interviewing USCIS Service Center  Operations and CLAIMS 3 officials about the data\u2019s sources, the system\u2019s  controls, and any quality assurance steps performed after data are  entered into the system; and, (3) reviewing the data for missing data,  outliers, or obvious errors. We determined that numbers of I-129F  petitions submitted, approved, and denied during this time period were  sufficiently reliable for our reporting purposes.

However, the I-129F petition contains errors and omissions that  we, USCIS, and DOJ have identified and that may limit or affect the  accuracy of information disclosed by a petitioner. Specifically, the I-129F  petition inaccurately describes IMBRA\u2019s filing limits and does not fully  address IMBRA\u2019s disclosure requirements. In particular, the language on  the I-129F petition states that the filing limits apply to petitioners who  have filed three or more I-129F petitions, or who have filed three or more  I-129F petitions and the first I-129F petition was approved within the last  2 years, whereas the instruction accompanying the I-129F petition aligns  more closely with IMBRA and provides that a waiver is required if a prior  I-129F petition had been approved in the past 2 years. USCIS Service  Center Operations officials stated the I-129F petition does not accurately  describe the filing limits and therefore there is a risk that petitioners are  disclosing inaccurate information regarding their filing history on the I- 129F petition, which may affect how USCIS evaluates whether a  petitioner requires a waiver. In October 2014, in response to our audit  work, USCIS modified its website to inform petitioners that the petition is  inaccurate and provide them with instructions that clarify the  requirements. In addition, DOJ officials responsible for enforcing IMBRA  stated that they have been working with USCIS on revisions to the I-129F  petition to better ensure that IMBRA\u2019s disclosure requirements are met.  For example, USCIS Service Center Operations officials noted that, in  consultation with DOJ, they plan to include questions on the I-129F  petition regarding whether petitioners have civil protective or restraining  orders, and prior arrests or convictions related to prostitution.", "According to USCIS Service Center Operations officials, as of August  2014, USCIS has been in the process of revising the current version of  the I-129F petition.

USCIS  Service Center Operations officials stated that there is no target time  frame for completing revisions to the I-129F petition within USCIS before  DHS and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) undertake their  respective reviews, in part because of the interagency review process  among DHS, State, and DOJ, which was ongoing for approximately 10  months as of August 2014. USCIS officials noted that until revisions to  the I-129F petition are complete, petitioners can refer to the Form I-129F  Instructions, which USCIS makes available as a separate document, or to  the clarifying instructions added to its website in October 2014, and  USCIS officers should follow the I-129F SOP, each of which more  accurately describe IMBRA\u2019s filing limits and circumstances under which  a waiver must be requested. However, USCIS officials acknowledged  that petitioners may not use the instructions in completing the I-129F  petition since they are contained in a separate document and are not  referred to on the I-129F petition. Further, as we discuss later in this  report, our review of CLAIMS 3 data indicates that USCIS officers have  not consistently followed the I-129F SOP, which USCIS has modified  multiple times since the summer of 2013 to address, among other things,  inaccuracies in the language associated with the application of IMBRA  waivers.", "USCIS has previously revised the I-129F petition.

According to USCIS  Service Center Operations officials, including the time for public comment  and OMB\u2019s review of the proposed revisions, it took nearly 2 years to  issue the revised I-129F petition (issued in June 2013).

However, these officials stated that the training courses  are generally broad and comprise many different types of nonimmigrant  visas and so do not cover as part of their curricula detailed procedures for  all visa types such as the FAM\u2019s IMBRA-related documentation  requirements. For instance, State\u2019s Foreign Service Institute officials  stated that the basic training course briefly covers State\u2019s IMBRA-related  disclosure requirements in the instructor\u2019s notes, but does not address  the FAM\u2019s requirement for consular officers to document these  disclosures in IVO. Similarly, the voluntary course for midlevel consular  officers does not address the FAM\u2019s documentation requirements.", "A Consular Affairs official stated that there may be some variation in the  content of this course offered to midlevel consular officers, but when he  teaches the course, he chooses to cover the FAM\u2019s IMBRA-related  documentation requirements in his oral remarks. Moreover, Consular  Affairs officials stated that midlevel consular officers are to provide  training to entry-level officers on a routine basis on the FAM\u2019s IMBRA- related disclosure and documentation requirements. These officials  added that State has an internal website for consular training, which  includes a reminder for supervisory consular officers that orientation upon  arrival and continuing on-the-job training at post is vital to develop fully  proficient consular officers. Incorporating the FAM\u2019s IMBRA-related  documentation requirements into State\u2019s training courses for consular  officers could help State better ensure that consular officers are aware of  the requirements so that they can be better positioned to more  consistently document the disclosure of IMBRA information during  interviews with K visa applicants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS and State Have Not Referred Any Potential IMBRA Violations to DOJ", "paragraphs": ["Under IMBRA, DOJ is responsible for pursuing federal civil and criminal  penalties outlined in the law for IMBs and petitioners who violate IMBRA  provisions and for consulting with DHS and State in investigating and  prosecuting such violations.

As it has not  received any referrals of IMBRA violations, DOJ has not brought civil or  criminal cases against an IMB or petitioner under IMBRA.", "USCIS requests information on the I-129F petition regarding whether  petitioners used an IMB and, if so, requests a copy of the signed consent  form the IMB obtained from the beneficiary authorizing the release of  contact information. However, USCIS officials at each of the four service  centers we interviewed stated that, in their experience, few petitioners  indicate the use of IMBs to facilitate relationships with their foreign  fianc\u00e9(e)s, and accordingly, the agency has not referred cases to DOJ for  further investigation and prosecution. In addition, DHS has a process for  referring and investigating potential violations within the department;  however, USCIS has not identified any potential violation for referral and  investigation.", "In accordance with the FAM and consistent with IMBRA, if an IMB does  not provide the required IMBRA disclosures to the beneficiary, consular  officers are to note the lack of disclosure in IVO and refer the case to  State\u2019s Consular Affairs Bureau at headquarters for further review.  Consular Affairs officials in headquarters are responsible for forwarding  cases involving potential IMBRA violations to DOJ. Consular officers at all  five consular posts we interviewed stated that they have not referred  cases involving violations by IMBs for review because beneficiaries  generally do not disclose the use of IMBs during the visa applicant  interviews.", "In July 2013, DOJ reported to Congress on the status of DOJ, DHS, and  State\u2019s efforts to develop processes to effectively identify, investigate, and  prosecute potential IMBRA violations. DOJ reported that it does not  have sufficient information about the nature and potential volume of  IMBRA violations necessary to develop a framework for prosecution.  DOJ\u2019s report outlined a number of actions each agency could address to  more fully develop policies and procedures for identifying, investigating,  and prosecuting IMBRA violations, such as developing mechanisms to  better facilitate the sharing of IMBRA-related case notes among the  agencies. DHS and State officials told us that they are coordinating with  DOJ on ways to facilitate data collection and information sharing and that  it is too early to determine when these actions may be completed. DOJ  officials stated that the agency-specific actions will better position DHS  and State to identify cases warranting investigation and prosecution by  DOJ. For instance, as previously mentioned, DOJ proposed that USCIS  consider revising the I-129F petition to include a question for petitioners  about civil protective or restraining orders consistent with IMB disclosure  requirements under IMBRA. In addition, DOJ proposed that State  establish a mechanism for sharing IMBRA-related case notes from  beneficiary interviews with USCIS and DOJ. Moreover, DOJ is working  with State on the development of a checklist of questions for consular  officers to ask beneficiaries to assist in the identification of potential cases  involving IMBRA violations by IMBs. In October 2014, DOJ issued an  IMBRA bulletin to assist stakeholders, such as state and local law  enforcement entities and women\u2019s and immigrants\u2019 rights organizations,  in identifying and reporting IMBRA violations to DOJ for prosecution."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "USCIS Does Not Collect and Maintain All Data in a Manner Consistent with IMBRA, and Additional Training Could Help to Ensure IMBRA Data Are Accurate and Reliable", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "USCIS Does Not Collect and Maintain All Data Consistent with IMBRA", "paragraphs": ["IMBRA mandates that DHS collect and maintain data necessary for us to  review IMBRA\u2019s impact on the process for granting K nonimmigrant  visas. In 2008, we reported that while USCIS had collected some data  necessary for our study, most of the eight data elements identified by  IMBRA and on which we reported were not maintained in a summary or  reportable (i.e., electronic) format. For this report, we reexamined these  eight data elements, which include information on the number of waiver  applications submitted and I-129F petitions denied, and the reasons for  the decisions. We found that data for two of the eight required elements  are available, at least partially, in an electronic format in CLAIMS 3 and  reliable for our purposes. The remaining six elements were either not  collected and maintained electronically or the electronic data collected are  not reliable. For example, consistent with IMBRA, USCIS is to collect  and maintain information annually on the number of IMBRA waivers  (general, criminal, or mandatory) submitted, the number granted or  denied, and reasons for such decisions, but this information is not  collected and maintained electronically. Rather, USCIS collects and  maintains information on whether a waiver is required (rather than  submitted), and the reasons for their decisions are handwritten by the  officer on the hard copy of the petition and thus were not readily available  for purposes of our review. Table 1 identifies the eight data elements  specified by IMBRA and the extent to which USCIS collects and  maintains reliable electronic data.", "USCIS has taken or is planning to take steps to better collect and  maintain data from petitioners in an electronic format. For example, in  2008, we reported that USCIS was considering modifying its system to  electronically collect and maintain the required data, and in 2012, USCIS  updated CLAIMS 3 to address selected IMBRA requirements.  Specifically, USCIS updated CLAIMS 3 to include a field for officers to  note the number of I-129F petitions previously filed by the current  petitioner, as well as a field to denote whether petitioners require any of  the three IMBRA waivers, although these updates do not specifically  address the IMBRA requirement that annual data on the number of  waiver applications submitted, the number approved and denied, and  reasons why the waivers were approved or denied be collected and  maintained. These updates have helped USCIS collect and maintain  additional data on I-129F petitions in an electronic format. However,  USCIS did not update CLAIMS 3 to capture all of the data required by  IMBRA, including the number of concurrent I-129F petitions filed by  petitioners for other fianc\u00e9(e)s or spouses, or the extent to which  petitioners have criminal convictions. USCIS officials stated that they did  not include all elements in the 2012 system update because of resource  constraints and to avoid rework in anticipation of the larger transition  planned for all of USCIS\u2019s immigration benefit processes. In 2006, USCIS  embarked on its multiyear Transformation Program to transform its paper- based immigration benefits process to a system with electronic  application filing, adjudication, and case management. As we reported in  November 2011, USCIS envisions that once the Transformation Program  is completed, new electronic adjudication capabilities will help improve  agency operations and enable greater data sharing and management of  information. USCIS expects the new system, the Electronic Immigration  System (ELIS), to have features, for example, that will allow applicants to  electronically view their benefit requests, or provide additional  documentation. Once ELIS is implemented, officers are expected to have  electronic access to applications, as well as relevant USCIS policies and  procedures to aid in decision making, and to have electronic linkages with  other agencies, such as State and DOJ, for data-sharing and security  purposes.", "According to USCIS Service Center Operations officials, the agency will  be able to collect and maintain more complete data, in a manner  consistent with IMBRA, through the deployment of the electronic I-129F  petition in ELIS. However, USCIS has faced long-standing challenges in  implementing ELIS, which raise questions about the extent to which its  eventual deployment will position USCIS to collect and maintain more  complete data. In particular, in November 2011, we reported on USCIS\u2019s  progress in implementing its Transformation Program and found that  USCIS had not developed reliable or integrated schedules for the  program, and as a result, USCIS could not reliably estimate when all  phases of the Transformation Program would be complete. We  recommended, among other things, that USCIS ensure its program  schedules are developed in accordance with GAO\u2019s best practices  guidance. DHS concurred with our recommendations and outlined  actions USCIS would take to implement them, including developing an  integrated master schedule to depict the multiple tasks, implementation  activities, and interrelationships needed to successfully develop and  deploy the Transformation Program. Since our November 2011 report,  the Transformation Program schedule has encountered further delays.  The 2008 Acquisition Program Baseline for the program showed that  ELIS would be fully deployed by 2013; however, in July 2014, the Director  of USCIS testified that full deployment was expected to be completed by  2018 or 2019.the I-129F petition would be deployed in ELIS.", "GAO/AIMD-00-21-3.1. purposes, or DOJ for investigating potential IMBRA violations once the  Transformation Program is complete."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Training on IMBRA Requirements Could Help Ensure Consistent Adjudication and Reliable Data", "paragraphs": ["USCIS officers have not consistently adjudicated I-129F petitions or  entered complete and accurate data into CLAIMS 3. On the basis of our  review of CLAIMS 3 data, and interviews with USCIS Service Center  Operations officials and USCIS officers at all four service centers, we  identified errors related to the IMBRA data that USCIS has maintained  since 2012 (see table 1). Specifically, our analysis indicates that USCIS\u2019s  data are not reliable for determining (1) the number of I-129F petitions  filed by persons who have previously filed I-129F petitions (or multiple  filers), or (2) the number of IMBRA waivers required.", "The May 2014 revisions also highlighted that the multiple filer field in CLAIMS 3 should  include the total number of K-1 and K-3 I-129Fs filed by the petitioner. The August 2013  SOP did not specify the type of I-129F (K-1 versus K-3) to include in determining the  number of prior petitions. officers were counting both K-1 and K-3 I-129F petitions in total for the  multiple filer field, or only the number of K-1 I-129F petitions. The May  2014 revision to the SOP emphasized that I-129F petitions for K-3 visas  are not to be included in determining whether a waiver is required.  However, at one service center we visited, officers we spoke to stated  that they had been uncertain about whether both types of I-129F petitions  should be considered for the waiver requirements. Accurate and complete  data in the multiple filer field are important for identifying potential abuse  by petitioners who file multiple I-129F petitions, and for officers to indicate  when a beneficiary should be notified of multiple filings, according to  USCIS officials.", "Data on IMBRA waivers. We found instances of errors and  inconsistencies related to USCIS data on whether petitioners were  subject to IMBRA\u2019s filing limits and required one of the three waivers.  Specifically:", "According to IMBRA and the June 2014 SOP, petitioners may be  required to request one of three waivers, and the waiver requirements  are based, in part, on the number of I-129F petitions filed for K-1 visas  only (petitions for K-3 visas are not to be included). We reviewed  USCIS data on 227 I-129Fs filed from October 1, 2012, through  March 31, 2014, for which the record in CLAIMS 3 indicated that a  criminal waiver was required. We found that 18 of those 227 I-129F  petitions were for K-3 visas. USCIS Service Center Operations  acknowledged that these entries in CLAIMS 3 were incorrect and that  these errors raise questions about the reliability of the CLAIMS 3 data  and officers\u2019 understanding of standard operating procedures and  IMBRA requirements.", "According to the June 2014 I-129F SOP, USCIS officers are to  indicate in CLAIMS 3 whether a petitioner is required to have one of  the three filing limits waivers. Officers are required to note a \u201cY\u201d in one  of three data fields if a waiver is required, or \u201cN\u201d if the waiver is not  required. Consistent with IMBRA, only one waiver could apply per  petition. However, on the basis of our analysis of CLAIMS 3 data, we  found I-129F petitions for which officers incorrectly determined that  more than one waiver was required. Specifically, of the 227 I-129F  petitions we reviewed, 11 indicated that both a general and a criminal  waiver were required, 14 indicated that both a criminal wavier and a  mandatory waiver were required, and 15 indicated that petitioners  required all three waivers. USCIS Service Center Operations officials  attributed the multiple waiver determinations to officers\u2019 errors.  USCIS officers we interviewed at one service center stated that they  were uncertain about the requirements for the waivers in part because  the majority of petitions they adjudicate each year do not require any  waivers. The August 2013 SOP did not specifically contain guidance  to officers that a petitioner could receive only one waiver, if  appropriate. In June 2014, during the course of our audit work, USCIS  updated the I-129F SOP to clarify the filing limits and waiver  requirements and now explicitly states that only one waiver selection  per I-129F petition should be marked in CLAIMS 3, as applicable.  While this revision to the SOP is a positive step, additional training  could better position USCIS officers to be aware of petitioners\u2019  potential filing limits and IMBRA waiver requirements, and USCIS  officials stated that such training could be provided to help ensure  officers understand the IMBRA requirements.", "Consistent with IMBRA and the June 2014 I-129F SOP, a criminal  waiver is required for multiple filers who have been convicted of an  IMBRA-specified offense. However, our analysis of USCIS\u2019s data  indicates that officers have required criminal waivers for petitioners  with no prior I-129F petition filings. Specifically, of the 227 I-129F  petitions filed between March 2012 and March 2014 for which officers  had indicated that a criminal waiver was required, 207 did not meet  the criteria requiring a criminal waiver because the petitioner had not  filed any previous petitions. USCIS officials said that officers were  likely confused regarding when a criminal waiver was required and  speculated that officers may be erring on the side of caution and  requiring a criminal waiver and additional documentation from the  petitioner in any instance of prior criminal convictions. For example,  an officer at one service center we visited stated that he sends the  petitioner a request for evidence for a criminal waiver if there is a  criminal history, regardless of how many I-129F petitions have been  filed. Ensuring that officers have a clear understanding of waiver  requirements in the SOP could help better position USCIS officers to  make USCIS adjudications more consistent with IMBRA  requirements.", "Consistent with IMBRA and the June 2014 I-129F SOP, I-129F  petitions for K-3 visas are not subject to IMBRA waiver requirements.  However, USCIS officers have historically (prior to December 8, 2013)  not been required to indicate in CLAIMS 3 whether the I-129F petition  is in support of a K visa for a fianc\u00e9(e), or spouse. We found that  about 72 percent of the I-129F petitions submitted from fiscal years  2008 through March 2014 (238,288 of the 329,307) did not indicate  whether the I-129F petition was for a K-1 or K-3 visa. USCIS officials  stated that this was a technical issue that was likely overlooked during  the system change in 2008. USCIS officials indicated that beginning in  December 2013, officers could not approve an I-129F in CLAIMS 3  without noting which of the K visas the I-129F supports. Knowledge of  whether the I-129F petition is for a K-1 or K-3 beneficiary is important  because it is a key factor in determining whether a waiver is required,  according to USCIS officials. While USCIS officers can review the  hard copy I-129F petition to determine if it is an I-129F petition for a K- 1 or K-3 beneficiary, this information would not be readily available for  internal control purposes of ensuring I-129F petitions are adjudicated  according to the SOP and consistent with IMBRA.", "According to USCIS Service Center Operations officials, USCIS performs  annual quality assurance reviews of I-129F petitions. USCIS\u2019s Quality  Management Branch establishes the direction for the development and  administration of the quality assurance program, training, communication,  and coaching, and each service center has a quality manager and  personnel who ensure administration of the quality assurance program  within each center. Annual reviews include 3 months of submissions,  reviewed for adherence to USCIS procedures for petition approval,  denial, and requests for evidence. In 2014, USCIS\u2019s quality assurance  reviews of selected I-129F petitions identified inconsistencies in their  adjudication. For example, USCIS conducted a review on a random  sample of I-129F petitions approved at the Texas Service Center in April  2014 (63 out of 796 total approved I-129F petitions). This quality  assurance reviewer found that 9 out of the 63 approved I-129F petitions  did not indicate for State\u2019s consular officers, as required by USCIS\u2019s  procedures, whether IMBRA disclosures applied. Consular officers we  spoke to at one post stated that they were providing information to  beneficiaries only if USCIS officers clearly indicated on the approved I- 129F petition that IMBRA requirements applied. The consular officers  stated that if USCIS officers did not clearly notate the approved I-129F  petitions, they returned the approved I-129F petition to USCIS. USCIS  officials attribute the errors in CLAIMS 3 data to officer error and  misunderstanding of the SOPs regarding IMBRA implementation. In  response to these reviews and our audit work, Service Center Operations  officials stated that, among other things, they revised the I-129F SOP in  May 2014 and again in June 2014. In particular, the May 2014 revision to  the I-129F SOP was intended to clarify, among other things, the IMBRA  filing limits, waiver requirements, and notations indicating whether IMBRA  disclosures apply. In June 2014, USCIS again revised the procedures to  further clarify the waiver requirements. To disseminate SOP revisions, a  Service Center Operations official stated that the revised SOP is e-mailed  to a point of contact in each service, with the revisions highlighted in the  SOP and e-mail. The official said that the point of contact generally  distributes the revised SOP to officers via e-mail, and will meet with staff  to discuss changes, if necessary.", "While these are positive steps, additional training could help provide  USCIS with more reasonable assurance that its officers are aware of  IMBRA requirements to assist them in reviewing and maintaining data on  petitions consistent with USCIS\u2019s procedures. As previously discussed,  our analysis of CLAIMS 3 data showed that USCIS officers have not  entered information into CLAIMS 3 consistent with USCIS\u2019s SOPs.  USCIS Service Center Operations officials attributed the errors we  identified in the CLAIMS 3 data to officers\u2019 misunderstandings of the  required procedures. Service Center Operations officials said in August  2014 that they had no plans to require the service centers to provide  additional training to officers on revisions made to the SOP, as USCIS  officials stated that officers receive initial training when they are hired and  on an ad hoc basis at the service centers, as necessary. USCIS Service  Center Operations does not require service centers to conduct additional  training for incumbent officers based on revisions to its SOPs to ensure  that changes are understood.
