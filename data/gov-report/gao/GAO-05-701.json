TANF also allows the use of TANF funds for marriage and responsible fatherhood programs. Given states' broad discretion in implementing the TANF program, including most aspects of the FVO and marriage and responsible fatherhood programs, this report examines (1) how states identify victims of domestic violence among TANF recipients, (2) how states address domestic violence among TANF recipients once they are identified, and (3) the extent to which states spend TANF funds on marriage and responsible fatherhood programs, and how, if at all, these programs are addressing domestic violence."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Forty-eight states have adopted the FVO or a comparable state policy. Most of these states actively screened clients by directly questioning them about domestic violence, whereas five states simply notified clients of domestic violence waivers without making a direct inquiry. Most states provide staff with a screening tool, but the detail and depth of these tools vary. State officials said that staff in local TANF offices often have limited skills in dealing with domestic violence issues, and policies regarding staff training vary. To address this issue, some state TANF offices employ domestic violence specialists. Although HHS has compiled and disseminated information about domestic violence screening, HHS has not issued guidance regarding best practices in domestic violence screening. State TANF programs help clients address domestic violence issues by granting waivers that exempt victims from TANF requirements, and by referring clients for domestic violence services. Most states will waive the TANF program's federal requirements pertaining to work, the 5-year lifetime limit on cash assistance, and the child support requirements. However, the conditions of these waivers vary from state to state. For example, 27 states required that clients participate in domestic violence services. Limited data on the number of domestic violence waivers indicates that a comparatively small portion of TANF recipients obtain such waivers. Most states have used TANF funds for marriage or responsible fatherhood programs or both. Specifically, 15 states reported funding marriage programs and 28 reported funding responsible fatherhood programs. States that provided usable data reported spending about 5 percent or less of their federal TANF budget on these programs. In addition, some states funded these programs through other funding sources or had programs in development. According to research and practitioners in the field, these programs generally do not explicitly address domestic violence, and HHS has stated that all future Healthy Marriage projects should include domestic violence protections."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program provided  about $17 billion in federal funds to states in fiscal year 2004 for cash  assistance and services to low-income families. This program includes  specific work requirements and a 5-year benefit time limit that some TANF  clients may be unable to meet. Recognizing that not all clients will be  ready to work and that some may need assistance beyond 5 years, the  program also offers various exceptions to these requirements. One  exception\u2014the Family Violence Option\u2014requires that states screen  clients for domestic violence and allows them to grant waivers from  program requirements for clients in domestic violence situations. Adopting  the Family Violence Option is not mandatory, and states that choose not to  do so may nonetheless adopt comparable policies. Although the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) oversees the TANF  program, states have broad discretion in implementing the program,  including most aspects related to the Family Violence Option.", "Currently, the Congress is considering various changes to the TANF  program, including proposals that would establish matching grants to  promote marriage and discourage divorce, as well as measures  emphasizing responsible fatherhood. While spending TANF funds on these  activities is currently allowed under TANF, the amount states spend on  such program is relatively small compared to their total TANF budgets.", "Concerned about these issues, you asked us to examine how state TANF  programs were addressing the issue of domestic violence and how, if at all,  these programs have funded or promoted marriage and fatherhood efforts.  As agreed with your offices, we responded to the following questions:", "What are states doing to identify victims of domestic violence among  TANF recipients?", "What are states doing to address domestic violence among TANF  recipients once victims have been identified?", "To what extent are state TANF programs spending TANF funds on  marriage and responsible fatherhood programs, and how, if at all, are  these programs addressing domestic violence?", "To answer these questions, we conducted a survey of the TANF programs  of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. In this survey, we asked  detailed questions about state policies regarding screening TANF clients  for domestic violence, how states addressed domestic violence situations  once clients have disclosed them, and the extent to which states have used  TANF funds for marriage and responsible fatherhood programs. To  supplement the data obtained through the survey, we conducted in-depth  visits to five states\u2014Colorado, Georgia, New York, Oklahoma, and  Washington. We selected these states because their practices for screening  TANF clients for domestic violence have been in place for various  amounts of time; only one of these states, Oklahoma, has not adopted the  Family Violence Option. We selected one state\u2014Oklahoma\u2014in part  because of its TANF-funded marriage program, and another state\u2014 Georgia\u2014because of its TANF-funded responsible fatherhood program.  During each of these visits, we conducted detailed discussions with state  officials about state policies, obtained documentation of state policies, and  visited two local service delivery offices in each state to discuss and  observe how the policies were implemented. We visited three states\u2014 Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin\u2014while designing our study, and pre-tested  the survey with officials in Maryland, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Finally,  we contacted researchers and policy analysts knowledgeable about the  TANF program, domestic violence, and marriage and responsible  fatherhood programs.

As the  responsible federal agency, HHS provides an annual TANF block grant to  each state. In fiscal year 2004, states spent about $26 billion of federal and  state funds to assist low-income families, including providing monthly  cash assistance to about 2 million families as of June 2004.  States have  considerable flexibility in administering TANF programs, and in turn,  offices in localities throughout each state are responsible for interacting  with TANF clients and running the day-to-day aspects of the program.", "The TANF program encourages recipients to work, places limits on the  length of time that a family can receive federal cash benefits and requires  that clients cooperate with child support authorities. Specifically, in  accordance with the authorizing legislation, TANF regulations state that all  clients must participate in work activities as soon as the state determines  they are ready to do so, or after 24 months of cash benefits, whichever  occurs earlier.  Further, clients may not obtain federal TANF cash  benefits for more than a total of 60 months during their lifetime. TANF  also requires that all families with children for whom paternity has not  been established or for whom a child support order needs to be  established, cooperate with child-support enforcement agencies. The  TANF program both gives states incentives to enforce these requirements,  as well as the flexibility to waive these requirements if necessary.  For  example, states must engage a certain percentage of their overall and two- parent caseloads in work activities, or face financial penalty. In practice,  states can waive the work and time limit requirements for clients in a  number of ways. For example, states can provide cash benefits beyond the  5-year time limit to for up to 20 percent of their caseload. Some states also  provide cash assistance with only state funds when a client has difficulty  meeting federal requirements.", "States enroll applicants in the TANF program through a process that is  roughly comparable, though the particulars may vary from state to state  (see fig. 1). A TANF client may meet with a worker who verifies that the  cash assistance program is appropriate for the client\u2019s needs and that the  client qualifies for cash assistance. The client is typically assigned a  caseworker who conducts a review of the client\u2019s employment prospects,  including the client\u2019s education, work history, skills, and aspects of the  client\u2019s personal life that may affect their ability to hold a job. Based on  this review, the caseworker develops an individual responsibility plan that  outlines actions that the client is to take in order to obtain employment  and become financially self sufficient. This plan may require that a client  immediately begin a job search or that the client first take actions to  address aspects of the client\u2019s life that pose a barrier to work. After this  plan is established, the caseworker meets with the client periodically, in  order to ensure that the client is making progress toward the goals  outlined in the plan. Some states also require a more in-depth,  comprehensive review of the client\u2019s progress at regular intervals or if the  client is having difficulty meeting aspects of the individual responsibility  plan."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Family Violence Option Gives States Incentives to Address Domestic Violence among the Client Population", "paragraphs": ["The TANF legislation also established a provision known as the Family  Violence Option, under which states commit to screen clients for domestic  violence, and refer those who are identified as domestic violence victims  to domestic violence services. Further, states that have adopted the Family  Violence Option can waive program requirements\u2014including those related  to work, the 5-year federal time limit, and cooperation with child support  authorities\u2014if compliance would make it more difficult for clients to  escape domestic violence, or would unfairly penalize domestic violence  victims.", "States that have adopted the Family Violence Option may also avoid  financial penalties related to the work requirements and the 5-year time  limit, if their failure to meet these requirements is at least partly  attributable to clients who have been granted federally recognized, good  cause domestic violence waivers. In order for the domestic violence  waiver to be federally recognized, it must specify which program  requirements are being waived, be granted based on need as determined  by a person trained in domestic violence, and be accompanied by a  services plan. States may report federally recognized good cause domestic  violence waivers to HHS, and HHS requires that such waivers not be  reported unless they meet the regulatory definition.

Further, research shows that it can, in  some cases, pose a barrier to work and financial independence. In 1998,  we reported that studies indicated that between 15 percent to 56 percent  of welfare recipients are, or have been, victims of domestic violence.  Since that time, additional studies with similar findings have been  published. For example, a 2001 report summarized the prevalence of  domestic violence among a random sample of women in the TANF  caseload of an urban county in Michigan. This study found that about 51  percent of the women had been severely abused at some time in their life,  and about 15 percent had been severely abused by a partner at least once  in the preceding year. Further, 61 percent reported being threatened with  violence or other retribution at some point in their lifetime, and 24 percent  reported such an experience had occurred in the preceding 12 months.", "Past research has also revealed that domestic violence can, in some cases,  be a barrier to work and financial independence. In our 1998 report, we  reported that various studies found that women who were or had been  victims of domestic violence were employed at about the same rates as  women who reported never having been abused. However, we also cited  one study that found abused women experienced higher job turnover and  more spells of unemployment than women who had never been abused.  Further, our 1998 report, as well as other research, has outlined how  domestic violence can impede successful employment for some women.  For example, several studies have shown that abusers may be threatened  by any steps a woman takes toward financial independence, and may  thwart a job search or employment by interfering with transportation to  work, or by making harassing phone calls to a woman while she is in the  workplace."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prompting Disclosure of Domestic Violence Can Be Difficult", "paragraphs": ["State TANF programs face significant challenges addressing domestic  violence, in part because it can be especially difficult to detect. Many  victims of domestic violence may be reluctant to disclose such a personal  and potentially humiliating aspect of their life. Researchers in the field of  domestic violence and state officials stated that domestic violence victims  may be unwilling to disclose domestic violence out of shame and  embarrassment. Victims may also fear retribution by the abuser.", "TANF clients may be particularly reluctant to disclose abuse in the TANF  program setting. Advocates for victims of domestic violence explained that  TANF clients often see TANF staff as government officials who cannot be  trusted to keep the disclosure of domestic violence confidential. Further,  some clients may fear that any disclosure of domestic violence to  government officials could result in the loss of custody over their children.  As a result, disclosure may be thwarted, at least until a trusting working  relationship can be developed. Caseworkers may also lack specific skills  that facilitate disclosure. For example, according to some experts,  caseworkers may lack empathy for domestic violence victims.  Additionally, given the heavy workload that some caseworkers face\u2014in  busy urban areas, some have over 100 clients\u2014they may not effectively  screen for domestic violence. According to some researchers, some  caseworkers may see addressing domestic violence as conflicting with the  overall goal of ensuring that clients become employed. Finally, HHS  officials told us that the physical setting of domestic violence screening\u2014 which in many offices can occur in open cubicles or public spaces\u2014may  not facilitate disclosure of domestic violence, as clients may fear being  overheard.", "The difficulty of identifying domestic violence is compounded by a lack of  consensus about the best techniques for screening clients. Some state  officials and researchers reported the benefit of screening tools composed  of multiple questions asking about various aspects of domestic violence\u2014 such as physical abuse, verbal abuse, or stalking. They believe such an  approach helps clients who may not think of themselves as domestic  violence victims and yet may respond affirmatively to a question about a  specific behavior. On the other hand, some research has found that  detailed questions about specific aspects of domestic violence may be  considered overly intrusive, which can put clients on the defensive and  make disclosure less likely. A 1999 study on the state TANF programs\u2019  efforts to assist victims of domestic violence found that screening  instruments should avoid intrusive questions about the specific actions of  an abuser, as such questions can be too personal or shaming."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal TANF Funds May Be Used to Fund Marriage and Responsible Fatherhood Programs", "paragraphs": ["Because the TANF program includes a variety of goals, federal TANF  funds can be used for purposes other than cash assistance to needy  families.

Such  programs attempt to achieve these goals through various measures, such  as education. Similarly, some states have opted to use TANF funds for  responsible fatherhood programs. These programs are designed to  encourage the active and responsible involvement of non-custodial fathers  in the lives of their children.", "State officials, practitioners, and the domestic violence services  community have stressed the importance of involving the domestic  violence services community in development and implementation of  marriage and responsible fatherhood programs. States that have used this  approach have indicated that the involvement of the domestic violence  services community was necessary to ensure that marriage and  responsible fatherhood programs address individual safety. HHS  Administration for Children and Families has echoed this sentiment in an  information memorandum that strongly recommends that states consult  with experts in domestic violence or with relevant community domestic  violence coalitions as they design marriage initiatives.

Eight states reported that they provide staff with guidance such  as regulations, staff manuals, or memoranda, in lieu of a specific screening  tool.", "We learned during our visits to states that the breadth and technique of the  screening tools vary considerably. For example, the state of Washington  uses a nine-question, electronic screening tool that prompts TANF staff to  inquire about various aspects of domestic violence, including queries  about threats, angry outbursts or controlling behavior by the client\u2019s  partner. This screening tool is administered by case managers, who  generally go through these questions verbatim, and record the client\u2019s  responses in a data base. In contrast, the state of Iowa uses a tool designed  to be self-administered by the client that makes a single query about  sexual or physical violence in a table that covers a variety of health related  issues. This tool does not ask specific or probing questions about domestic  violence, but prompts the client to enter a checkmark if physical or sexual  violence is an issue for any member of the client\u2019s family.", "The large majority of states that require formal screening require it early in  the TANF process, with follow-up screenings at certain points. As figure 3  indicates, subsequent screenings occur either at regular intervals, or when  it becomes apparent that a client is having difficulty meeting program  requirements. For example, our survey data show that 24 states screen  during a TANF eligibility review that in some states, such as New York,  can take place every 6 months. Many states also screen when the client  exhibits difficulty in meeting TANF program goals or requirements. For  example, 20 states screen when a client fails to meet the conditions of  cash assistance. State officials told us that such follow-up screenings are  important because the client may be reluctant to disclose domestic  violence initially or because it may emerge as a problem after entry into  the TANF program.", "Five states that have adopted the Family Violence Option or a comparable  policy reported that they do not actively screen TANF clients for domestic  violence. These states indicated that they have no screening requirements  beyond informing clients about available domestic violence waivers.

The policy was developed in the belief that it is best not to probe  clients about domestic violence and risk putting them in an uncomfortable  situation, but to spell out the program flexibilities that exist for domestic  violence victims.

During our site visits,  several state officials told us that although private, confidential settings  are important, many local offices would face constraints in providing such  settings. For example, an official in one state said that the degree of  privacy available varies considerably from office to office, and the setting  in some offices dictates that screening take place at desks near a lobby full  of clients. While this is not ideal, the local offices must work within the  constraints of the facilities in which they are located.", "Ten states said that they have policies regarding individuals who may be  present during screening. For example, officials in the state of Washington  told us that, if a couple comes in to the TANF office to apply for benefits  together, it is state policy that they be separated before domestic violence  will be discussed. According to the Washington \u201cWork First\u201d handbook,  which provides written guidance for caseworkers and other staff in the  state\u2019s TANF program, caseworkers are not to ask about family violence in  the presence of the partner, because this may endanger the client.  Similarly, the screening tool used in Illinois advises caseworkers to ask  questions regarding domestic violence at a later time if the client\u2019s partner  is present. We also found that, although some states do not have policies  in this regard, some caseworkers in these states nonetheless ensure a  client is alone for domestic violence screening. A local office official in  New York, which does not have a privacy policy, said that before  questions about domestic violence are asked, they will separate couples  with a contrived reason, if necessary. For example, they may tell the  partner that he must meet with another staff member about another topic,  such as his job history.", "In contrast, most states have no explicit policy about who can be present  during a client\u2019s domestic violence screening. For example, an official at a  local office in Iowa said that the initial meeting with the caseworker takes  place with both partners present because it is important to see how a  couple interacts. If the caseworker suspects domestic violence, they may  try to separate the couple for a subsequent discussion. Other states  explained that they encourage a middle approach, explicitly relying on the  judgment of the caseworker. Similarly, in New York, state policy directs  that the domestic violence screening form can be mentioned with both  partners present, but that it not be addressed further if the clients are not  interested. However, the policy also advises that caseworkers may need to  be creative in finding a way to mention the domestic violence screening  form again in a private setting."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Screening Is Typically Performed by Caseworkers, but Some States also Use Domestic Violence Specialists", "paragraphs": ["Forty-five states reported that caseworkers or intake workers are the staff  that typically conduct domestic violence screening, a fact acknowledged  by officials during our site visits. As figure 4 indicates, most state policies  require little training for these staff. Twenty states indicated that the state  either had no policy regarding domestic violence-related training, or may  provide training only once in caseworker\u2019s career. Another 25 states  require training once in a staff members\u2019 career and make additional  training optional.", "Officials in each state we visited told us that the skills, abilities, and  inclinations of staff to conduct domestic violence screening vary  considerably. For example, one state official told us that the personalities  and style of caseworkers range across the board. This official said that  many staff are technical people who have spent their careers stressing  program qualifications, and addressing domestic violence and other \u201csoft\u201d  issues is difficult adjustment. An official of another state TANF program  said that even with the best of best training and screening policies,  screening effectiveness is dependent on the effectiveness of individual  caseworkers, and some caseworkers may simply skim the screening  questions and not ask the full range. These comments were reinforced  during our observations of domestic violence screening in several local  TANF offices. At one office, we observed one caseworker who stressed  certain aspects of the TANF experience, such as the need to obtain  employment or attend training services, but gave very peremptory  attention to other issues, such as domestic violence and mental health. At  another office, we witnessed screening performed by a social worker, who  paused at length over these issues, and sensitively asked follow-up  questions regarding the client\u2019s home life, and took the initiative to gently  and patiently describe a local organization that could provide alternative  living arrangements, if this were necessary.", "In order to supplement the skills of the caseworkers, three of the states we  visited\u2014Georgia, New York, and Washington\u2014employed domestic  violence specialists to conduct in-depth screening and assessment after a  client disclosed that domestic violence was an issue.  This practice is  implemented statewide in Georgia and New York, and has been  established for almost all of the TANF offices in Washington state. In all  three states, the domestic violence specialist serves to \u201cbackup\u201d the  screening conducted by the regular caseworker. For example, New York\u2019s  policy requires that a client be referred to a specialist\u2014known as a  domestic violence liaison\u2014as soon as a client discloses that domestic  violence is an issue. State officials told us that the meeting with the  specialist is scheduled as soon as possible and all further inquiry regarding  domestic violence is left to the domestic violence liaison. The specialist  then conducts a more in-depth inquiry and informs clients about options  for protective services and other assistance.", "State officials told us that domestic violence specialists can play an  important role in addressing the needs of domestic violence victims and  are important given the limited skills of many caseworkers in dealing with  domestic violence. Officials in Washington, for example, said that the  presence of a domestic violence specialist increases the likelihood that a  domestic violence victim will attend counseling or other services to  address the problem. A caseworker can immediately walk a client over to  the desk of the domestic violence specialist, who then conducts an in- depth assessment, provides some degree of counseling, and makes  referrals to other agencies for ongoing services. They explained that if the  domestic violence specialist were not there, they believe that many clients  would ignore the referrals to outside agencies, and the domestic violence  issue festers. During one of our site visits, we learned firsthand of the  importance of effective interpersonal skills in domestic violence  screening. We interviewed an employee of a local TANF office who was a  former TANF recipient and a domestic violence victim. She explained that,  when she was screened for domestic violence, she was in a desperate  situation fleeing from her abuser and needed assistance right away.  Nonetheless, the attitude of the screening staff was so perfunctory and  indifferent that, had she not immediately been routed to a domestic  violence specialist, she said she probably would not have returned to that  office. The former victim further noted that many caseworkers are  overwhelmed by other demands, and felt that the caseworker she dealt  with was not equipped to handle domestic violence issues.", "State officials also told us that domestic violence specialists can enhance  the ability of other office staff in dealing with clients\u2019 domestic violence  issues. In Washington, caseworkers at a local TANF office stated that an  onsite domestic violence specialist serves as an important source of  technical assistance for caseworkers. For example, the specialist has  provided training for staff, and made them aware of the \u201cred flags\u201d that  may indicate domestic violence is an issue.

Further, an HHS-funded  report published in 2000 provided in-depth descriptions how 7 counties in  different states identified domestic violence victims and assisted those  who disclosed.

Thirty-eight states  indicated that they will waive specific requirements included in a client\u2019s  individual responsibility plan, which is intended to lead to work and  financial independence. For example, an Illinois official told us that the  individual plan of many clients requires them to meet with their  caseworker in order to continue receiving benefits. If a client misses a  meeting and can demonstrate that the failure to make the appointment  was due to domestic violence, the requirement can be temporarily waived  and cash benefits will not be interrupted. Another six states reported that  they will, if necessary, waive other program requirements in the event that  domestic violence makes them difficult to meet. For example, an Oregon  official reported that they will waive certain financial eligibility  requirements in the event of domestic violence.

As table 2 indicates, 25  states do not require evidence beyond a client\u2019s statement in order to grant  a waiver from work requirements. For example, a Washington official said  that additional evidence before granting a waiver was not needed because  officials expect clients to participate in domestic violence services, which  clients would not want to do unless such services are needed. In contrast,  Illinois requires that recipients provide additional documentation such as a  written statement from a third party, a police report, or documentation  from a domestic or sexual violence program.", "Twenty-seven states reported that they also require domestic violence  victims to participate in domestic violence services in order to waive  program requirements. For example, officials in Iowa and Washington said  that clients must demonstrate that they are making an effort to address the  domestic violence by attending counseling or other services. In contrast,  an Illinois official explained that the state also requires that caseworkers  provide waiver recipients with information about available domestic  violence services and encourage them to attend; however, they cannot  require their participation. Officials said that some clients do not want to  participate in services provided through an agency but prefer to use an  informal network for support and assistance such as family, friends, or  church ministers.", "Some states may also tailor waivers to fit a client\u2019s particular  circumstances and will help clients maximize compliance with program  requirements. For example, New York offers \u201cpartial waivers,\u201d which state  officials believe help to ensure a victim\u2019s safety while still participating in  program activities. For example, a partial waiver could be granted to a  client who is taking job readiness classes but not actively searching for a  job because of safety concerns. In such a case, the partial waiver would  allow the client to fulfill part of the work requirement without interrupting  cash benefits. Similarly, a partial child support waiver would be granted if  it would put the client in danger to appear in court to pursue child support  (this is in contrast to a full child support waiver in which a client would  not be required to pursue child support at all if doing so would threaten  their safety)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Data Indicates That a Small Portion of the TANF Population Use Domestic Violence Waivers", "paragraphs": ["Reliable national data on the number of domestic violence waivers issued  by the states does not exist, according to an HHS official responsible for  tracking state data reporting.

Officials in most  states that we visited said that many victims prefer to work because they  consider financial independence as the best way out of an abusive  situation.

She said that she only grants  a waiver from work requirements to individuals that are in such a critical  situation that they can only deal with their domestic violence issues.

The benefit of  having this service located on-site is that it gives the victim immediate  access to services, and increases the chances that the clients will follow  through with services. Also, because the DVA is located at the TANF  office, the client may receive services without the knowledge of the  abuser.

New York officials also said that services were  less available in rural areas, but that it was simply not cost-effective to  have a full range of services in sparsely populated areas. In addition,  officials in several states that we visited said that transportation is less  available in the rural areas and access to services can be difficult for  victims living many miles from the nearest provider.
