We also found agency strategic and annual performance plans and reports we reviewed have improved over initial efforts. Although a foundation has been established, numerous significant challenges to GPRA implementation still exist. Inconsistent top leadership commitment to achieving results within agencies and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) can hinder the development of results-oriented cultures in agencies. Furthermore, in certain areas, federal managers continue to have difficulty setting outcome-oriented goals, collecting useful data on results, and linking institutional, program, unit, and individual performance measurement and reward systems. Finally, there is an inadequate focus on addressing issues that cut across federal agencies. OMB, as the focal point for management in the federal government, is responsible for overall leadership and direction in addressing these challenges. OMB has clearly placed greater emphasis on management issues during the past several years. However, it has showed less commitment to GPRA implementation in its guidance to agencies and in using the governmentwide performance plan requirement of GPRA to develop an integrated approach to crosscutting issues. In our view, governmentwide strategic planning could better facilitate the integration of federal activities to achieve national goals."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As you requested, we have assessed the effectiveness of the Government  Performance and Results Act (GPRA), in light of its 10-year anniversary in  2003.

A number of  overarching trends, such as diffuse security threats and homeland security  needs, increasing global interdependency, the shift to knowledge-based  economies, and the looming fiscal challenges facing our nation, drive the  need to reconsider the proper role for the federal government in the 21st  century, how the government should do business (including how it should  be structured), and in some instances, who should do the government\u2019s  business.", "Without effective short- and long-term planning, which takes into account  the changing environment and needs of the American public and the  challenges they face and establishes goals to be achieved, federal agencies  risk delivering programs and services that may or may not meet society\u2019s  most critical needs.

The fiscal  pressures created by the retirement of the baby boom generation and rising  health costs threaten to overwhelm the nation\u2019s fiscal future.  As figure 1  shows, by 2040, absent reform or other major tax or spending policy  changes, projected federal revenues will likely be insufficient to pay more  than interest on publicly held debt.

In addition  to GPRA, the framework comprises the Chief Financial Officers Act of  1990, as amended by the Government Management Reform Act of 1994, and  information technology reform legislation, including the Paperwork  Reduction Act of 1995 and the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996.  Together, these  laws provide a powerful framework for developing and integrating  information about agencies\u2019 missions and strategic priorities, the results- oriented performance goals that flow from those priorities, performance  data to show the level of achievement of those goals, and the relationship  of reliable and audited financial information and information technology  investments to the achievement of those goals.", "GPRA was intended to address several broad purposes, including  strengthening the confidence of the American people in their government;  improving federal program effectiveness, accountability, and service  delivery; and enhancing congressional decision making by providing more  objective information on program performance.", "2.  The agency must develop annual performance plans covering each program    activity set forth in the agencies\u2019 budgets*  Building on the decisions made as part of the strategic planning process, GPRA requires  executive agencies to develop annual performance plans covering each program activity set  forth in the agencies\u2019 budgets. Annual performance plans, covering the upcoming fiscal year,  are to be submitted to Congress after the President\u2019s Budget is submitted, which generally  occurs in February. Each plan is to contain an agency\u2019s annual performance goals and  associated measures, which the agency is to use in order to gauge its progress toward  accomplishing its strategic goals. OMB is to use the agencies\u2019 performance plans to develop  an overall federal government performance plan that is to be submitted with the President\u2019s  Budget. The performance plan for the federal government is to present to Congress a single  cohesive picture of the federal government\u2019s annual performance goals for a given fiscal  year. 3.  The agency must prepare annual reports on program performance for the previous    fiscal year, to be issued by March 31 each year GPRA requires executive agencies to prepare annual reports on program performance for  the previous fiscal year, to be issued by March 31 each year. In each report, an agency is to  compare its performance against its goals, summarize the findings of program evaluations  completed during the year, and describe the actions needed to address any unmet goals.  Recent OMB guidance states that executive agencies must combine their program  performance report with their accountability report and transmit the combined report for  fiscal year 2003 by January 30, 2004, and the combined report for fiscal year 2004 by  November 15, 2004. *Program activity refers to the lists of projects and activities in the appendix portion of the Budget of the United States Government. Program    activity structures are intended to provide a meaningful representation of the operations financed by a specific budget account.", "The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) plays an important role in  the management of the federal government\u2019s performance, and specifically  GPRA implementation.  Part of OMB\u2019s overall mission is to ensure that  agency plans and reports are consistent with the President\u2019s Budget and  administration policies.  OMB is responsible for receiving and reviewing  agencies\u2019 strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual  performance reports.  To improve the quality and consistency of these  documents, OMB issues annual guidance to agencies for their preparation,  including guidelines on format, required elements, and submission  deadlines.  GPRA requires OMB to prepare the overall governmentwide  performance plan, based on agencies\u2019 annual performance plan  submissions.  OMB also played an important role in the pilot phase of  GPRA implementation by designating agencies for pilot projects in  performance measurement, managerial accountability and flexibility, and  performance budgeting, and assessing the results of the pilots.  Finally,  GPRA provides OMB with authority to grant agencies waivers to certain  administrative procedures and controls.", "Recent OMB guidance requires agencies to submit \u201cperformance budgets\u201d  in lieu of annual performance plans for their budget submission to OMB  and Congress.  Performance budgets are to meet all the statutory  requirements of GPRA for annual performance plans.  In addition, agencies  are to include all performance goals used in the assessment of program  performance done under OMB\u2019s Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART)  process.  Moreover, the guidance states that until all programs have been  assessed by PART, the performance budget will also for a time include  performance goals for agency programs that have not yet been assessed  using PART.  The expectation is that agencies are to substitute new or  revised performance goals resulting from OMB\u2019s review for goals it deemed  unacceptable.", "In crafting GPRA, Congress recognized that managerial accountability for  results is linked to managers having sufficient flexibility, discretion, and  authority to accomplish desired results.  GPRA authorizes agencies to  apply for managerial flexibility waivers in their annual performance plans  beginning with fiscal year 1999.  The authority of agencies to request  waivers of administrative procedural requirements and controls is intended  to provide federal managers with more flexibility to structure agency  systems to better support program goals.  The nonstatutory requirements  that OMB can waive under GPRA generally involve the allocation and use  of resources, such as restrictions on shifting funds among items within a  budget account.  Agencies must report in their annual performance reports  on the use and effectiveness of any GPRA managerial flexibility waivers  that they receive.", "OMB was to designate at least five agencies from the first set of pilot  projects to test managerial accountability and flexibility during fiscal years  1995 and 1996.  We previously reported on the results of the pilot project to  implement managerial flexibility waivers and found that the pilot did not  work as intended.  OMB did not designate any of the seven departments  and one independent agency that submitted a total of 61 waiver proposals  as GPRA managerial accountability and flexibility pilots.  For about three- quarters of the waiver proposals, OMB or other central management  agencies determined that the waivers were not allowable for statutory or  other reasons or that the requirement for which the waivers were proposed  no longer existed.  For the remaining proposals, OMB or other central  management agencies approved waivers or developed compromises by  using authorities that were already available independent of GPRA.", "Under GPRA, another set of pilot projects, which were scheduled for fiscal  years 1998 and 1999, were to test performance budgeting\u2014i.e., the  presentation of the varying levels of performance that would result from  different budget levels.  We previously reported that OMB initially deferred  these pilots\u2014originally to be designated in fiscal years 1998 and 1999\u2014to  give federal agencies time to develop the capability of calculating the  effects of marginal changes in cost or funding on performance.  When the  pilots began in August 1999, OMB designed them as case studies prepared  by OMB staff to demonstrate how performance information could be used  to compare alternatives and to develop funding recommendations for  incorporation into the President\u2019s fiscal year 2001 budget submission.", "On January 18, 2001, OMB reported the results of five performance  budgeting pilots that explored agencies\u2019 capabilities of more formally  assessing the effects of different funding levels on performance goals.   OMB selected the pilots to reflect a cross section of federal functions and  capabilities so that a representative range of measurement and reporting  issues could be explored.  In its report, OMB concluded that legislative  changes were not needed.  OMB reported that the pilots demonstrated that  assuring further performance measurement improvements and steadily  expanding the scope and quality of performance measures is paramount,  and that the existing statute provides sufficient latitude for such  improvement.", "Overall, OMB concluded that the pilots raised several key challenges about  performance budgeting at the federal level including, for example, the  following:   In many instances, measuring the effects of marginal, annual budget  changes on performance is not precise or meaningful.", "While continuing to change from an almost total reliance on output  measures to outcome measures, it will be much more difficult to  associate specific resource levels with those outcomes, particularly over  short periods of time.", "Establishing clear linkages between funding and outcomes will vary by  the nature of the program and the number of external factors.", "Delays in the availability of performance data, sometimes caused by  agencies\u2019 reliance on nonfederal program partners for data collection,  will continue to present synchronization problems during budget  formulation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To meet the three objectives stated earlier, we reviewed our extensive prior  work on GPRA best practices and implementation and collected  governmentwide data to assess the government\u2019s overall focus on results.

In making this  selection, we chose agencies that collectively represented the full range of  characteristics in the following four areas:  (1) agency size (small, medium,  large); (2) primary program types (direct service, research, regulatory,  transfer payments, and contracts or grants); (3) quality of fiscal year 2000  performance plan based on our previous review (low, medium, high); and  (4) type of agency (cabinet department and independent agency).

Ten years  after enactment, GPRA\u2019s requirements have laid a foundation of results- oriented agency planning, measurement, and reporting that have begun to  address these purposes.  Focus group participants, high-level political  appointees, and OMB officials we interviewed cited positive effects of  GPRA that they generally attributed to GPRA\u2019s statutory requirements for  planning and reporting.

Federal agencies  surveyed indicated that many had a single, long-term plan that contained  goals, standards, or objectives for the entire agency or program.  Many of  these agencies also reported they collected a wide variety of performance  measures.  However, in validating the survey responses with a sample of  agencies, we found that measures were typically generated and used by  program-level units within an agency and focused on measuring work  activity levels and outputs or compliance with statutes.  Little of this  performance information was transparent to Congress, OMB, or the public  and few of the agencies we visited used performance measures to manage  toward long-term objectives.  Few of the agencies surveyed had the  infrastructure in place, such as a unified strategic plan with measurable  goals, an office that collected performance measures, and regular  consolidated reports, to tie plans and measures.", "GPRA addressed these shortcomings by creating a comprehensive and  consistent statutory foundation of required agencywide strategic plans,  annual performance plans, and annual performance reports.  In contrast to  prior federal government efforts to measure performance, GPRA explicitly  emphasized that, in addition to performance indicators that agencies may  need to manage programs on a day-to-day basis, such as quantity, quality,  timeliness, and cost, agencies also needed outcome-oriented goals and  measures that assess the actual results, effects, or impact of a program or  activity compared to its intended purpose.", "Expert and agency focus group participants cited the creation of this  statutory foundation as one of the key accomplishments of GPRA.   Participants agreed that GPRA created a framework in statute for federal  agencies to plan their activities in order to become more results oriented  and provided a managerial tool for program accountability.  Using this  framework, agencies could develop and focus on strategies to carry out the  programs they administer; set goals and identify performance indicators  that will inform them whether or not they achieved the performance they  expected; and determine what impact, if any, their programs have had on  the American public.  According to the experts in one of our focus groups,  comparing federal agencies\u2019 current mission statements contained in their  strategic plans to what they were in the past demonstrates that the  agencies have done some \u201csoul searching\u201d to get a better sense of what  their role is (or should be) and how they can achieve it.  Given that GPRA is  in statute, participants indicated that the use of this planning framework is  likely to be sustained within agencies.", "One of the premises of GPRA is that both congressional and executive  branch oversight of federal agency performance were seriously hampered  by a lack of adequate results-oriented goals and performance information.   As noted above, prior to the enactment of GPRA few agencies reported  their performance information externally.  OMB officials we interviewed as  part of our current review suggested that OMB has been a key consumer of  the performance information produced under GPRA and that it has  provided a foundation for their efforts to oversee agency performance.", "For example, during the development of the fiscal year 2004 budget, OMB  used PART to review and rate 234 federal programs. We recently reported  that one of PART\u2019s major impacts was its ability to highlight OMB\u2019s  recommended changes in program management and design.  PART  reviews look at four elements\u2014program purpose and design, strategic  planning, program management, and program results/accountability\u2014and  rate the program on how well each of these elements is executed.   However, without the foundation of missions, goals, strategies,  performance measures, and performance information generated under  GPRA, such oversight would be difficult to carry out.", "Participants in most of our focus groups also agreed that GPRA has been a  driving force behind many cultural changes that have occurred within  federal agencies.  Highlighting the focus on results, participants stated that  GPRA had stimulated a problem-solving approach within federal agencies  and encouraged agency managers to think creatively when developing  performance indicators for their programs.  GPRA has also changed the  dialogue within federal agencies; front-line managers and staff at lower  levels of the organization now discuss budget issues in connection with  performance.  Similarly, experts noted that information about performance  management and resource investments are more frequently communicated  between agency officials and Congress than in the past.  Within agencies,  GPRA documents can provide a context of missions, goals, and strategies  that political appointees can use to articulate agencies\u2019 priorities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Views on GPRA\u2019s Effect on the Federal Government\u2019s Ability to Deliver Results to the American Public Were Mixed", "paragraphs": ["A key purpose of GPRA was \u201cto improve the confidence of the American  people in the capability of the Federal Government, by systematically  holding Federal agencies accountable for achieving program results.\u201d   When asked about the direct effects of GPRA on the public in our 2003  survey, an estimated 23 percent of federal managers agreed to a moderate  or greater extent that GPRA improved their agency\u2019s ability to deliver  results to the American public; a larger percentage\u201438 percent\u2014chose a  \u201cno basis to judge/not applicable\u201d category.", "When a similar question was posed in our focus groups with experts and  federal managers, participants\u2019 views were generally mixed.  Some federal  managers in our focus groups agreed that GPRA has had a positive effect  on raising awareness on many performance issues, and that in and of itself  is a way of delivering results.  The information gathered and reported for  GPRA allows agencies to make better-informed decisions, which improves  their ability to achieve results.  Other participants stated that while certain  aspects of GPRA-related work have been positive, agencies\u2019 ability to  deliver results and public awareness of their activities cannot always be  exclusively attributed to GPRA.  For example, some participants stated that  many agencies rely on grant recipients to carry out their work, and  delivering results to the American public depends, to a large extent, on the  diligence of these organizations to implement their programs; such results  would not change dramatically if GPRA were no longer a requirement.", "A number of the political appointees we interviewed cited examples of  outcomes they believe would not have occurred without the structure of  GPRA.  For example, a former deputy secretary of the Department of  Veterans Affairs (VA) stated that \u201cthe Results Act brought about a  fundamental rethinking of how we managed our programs and  processes. . . . We developed a strategic plan that was veteran-  focused. . . .

As noted above, prior to GPRA, few agencies  reported performance results outside of their agencies.  Focus group  participants indicated a key accomplishment of GPRA was its value as a  communication tool by increasing the transparency to the public of what  their agencies did in terms the public could understand.  For example,  information on agencies\u2019 strategic plans, performance goals, measures, and  results are easily obtainable from agency Web sites.  One focus group  participant commented that GPRA helps bureaucrats explain to  nonbureaucrats what the federal government does in terms they can better  understand.

This is a statistically  significantly higher percentage than the 76 percent of managers who  answered yes to this item on our 1997 survey.  (See fig. 2.)", "Moreover, when we asked managers who said they had performance  measures which of five types of measures they had to a great or very great  extent, they reported increases in all five types of measures between 1997  and 2003, all of which were statistically significant.

Notably,  managers indicated the existence of outcome measures, defined as  \u201cperformance measures that demonstrate to someone outside the  organization whether or not intended results are being achieved,\u201d grew  from a low of 32 percent in 1997 to the current estimate of 55 percent, a  level that is on par with output measures for the first time since we began  our survey.", "Similarly, focus group participants commented on certain cultural changes  that had taken place within their agencies since the passage of GPRA in  which the \u201cvocabulary\u201d of performance planning and measurement\u2014e.g., a  greater focus on performance management; orientation toward outcomes  over inputs and outputs; and an increased focus on program evaluation\u2014 had become more pervasive.  This perception is partly born out by our  survey results.  Since 1997 those reporting a moderate to extensive  knowledge of GPRA and its requirements shifted significantly from 26  percent to 41 percent in 2003, while those reporting no knowledge of GPRA  declined significantly from 27 percent to 20 percent.  (See fig. 4.)", "Consistent with our survey results indicating increases in results-oriented  performance measures and increasing GPRA knowledge, we also observed  a significant decline in the percentage of federal managers who agreed that  certain factors hindered measuring performance or using the performance  information.  For example, as shown in figure 5, of those who expressed an  opinion, the percentage of managers who noted that determining  meaningful measures was a hindrance to a great or very great extent was  down significantly from 47 percent in 1997 to 36 percent in 2003.

However, efforts to infuse performance  information into resource allocation decisions can more explicitly inform  budget discussions and focus them\u2014both in Congress and in agencies\u2014on  expected results, rather than on inputs.", "GPRA established a basic foundation for performance budgeting by  requiring that an agency\u2019s annual performance plan cover each program  activity in the President\u2019s budget request for that agency.  GPRA does not  specify any level of detail or required components needed to achieve this  coverage.  Further, GPRA recognizes that agencies\u2019 program activity  structures are often inconsistent across budget accounts and thus gives  agencies the flexibility to consolidate, aggregate, or disaggregate program  activities, so long as no major function or operation of the agency is  omitted or minimized.  In addition, OMB guidance has traditionally  required agencies to display, by budget program activity, the funding level  being applied to achieve performance goals.  OMB\u2019s guidance on  developing fiscal year 2005 performance budgets also encourages a greater  link between performance and funding levels, however, it places greater  emphasis on linking agencies\u2019 long-term and annual performance goals to  individual programs.  At a minimum, agencies are to align resources at the  program level, but they are encouraged to align resources at the  performance goal level.  Resources requested for each program are to be  the amounts needed to achieve program performance goal targets.", "Our 1998 assessment of fiscal year 1999 performance plans found that  agencies generally covered the program activities in their budgets, but  most plans did not identify how the funding for those program activities  would be allocated to performance goals.  However, our subsequent  reviews of performance plans indicate that agencies have made progress in  demonstrating how their performance goals and objectives relate to  program activities in the budget.", "Over the first 4 years of agency efforts to implement GPRA, we observed  that agencies continued to tighten the required link between their  performance plans and budget requests.  Of the agencies we reviewed over  this period, all but three met the basic requirement of GPRA to define a link  between their performance plans and the program activities in their budget  requests, and most of the agencies in our review had moved beyond this  basic requirement to indicate some level of funding associated with  expected performance described in the plan.  Most importantly, more of the  agencies we reviewed each year\u2014almost 75 percent in fiscal year 2002  compared to 40 percent in fiscal year 1999\u2014were able to show a direct link  between expected performance and requested program activity funding  levels\u2014the first step in defining the performance consequences of  budgetary decisions.  However, we have also observed that the nature of  these linkages varied considerably.  Most of the agencies in our review of  fiscal year 2002 performance plans associated funding requests with higher,  more general levels of expected performance, rather than the more  detailed \u201cperformance goals or sets of performance goals\u201d suggested in  OMB guidance.", "Although not cited by our group of experts, participants at six of our seven  focus groups with federal managers cited progress in this area as a key  accomplishment of GPRA.  However, the participants also commented that  much remains to be done in this area.  The comments ranged from the  general\u2014GPRA provides a framework for planning and budgeting, to the  more specific\u2014GPRA created a definition of programs and how they will  help the agency achieve its goals/objectives and the amount of money that  will be required to achieve said goals/objectives.  One of the comments  implied that GPRA has helped to prioritize agency efforts by helping  agencies align their efforts with programs or activities that make a  difference.  A political appointee we interviewed echoed this comment,  stating that GPRA was pushing the department to think about what it gets  out of the budget, not just what it puts into it\u201412 to 15 years ago the \u201cso  what\u201d was missing from the budget process.  Another political appointee  we interviewed stated that the department was in the process of tying its  goals to its budget formulation and execution processes and linking  program costs to departmental goals.  A former political appointee  discussed how his department used program performance information to  inform a major information systems investment decision.", "Furthermore, GAO case studies on the integration of performance  information in budget decision making found that performance information  has been used to inform the allocation of resources and for other  management purposes at selected agencies.  For example, the Veterans  Health Administration provides its health care networks with performance  information on patterns of patient care and patient health outcomes, which  can be used to analyze resource allocation and costs and reallocate  resources as appropriate.  Officials at the Administration for Children and  Families said that training and technical assistance and salaries and  expense funds are often allocated based on program and performance  needs.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission monitors performance  against targets and makes resource adjustments, if needed, to achieve  those targets.", "Although there has been progress in formally establishing the linkages  between budgets and plans, our survey results are somewhat conflicting  and have not reflected any notable changes either in managers\u2019 perceptions  governmentwide as to their personal use of plans or performance  information when allocating resources, or in their perceptions about the  use of performance information when funding decisions are made about  their programs.  Our 2003 survey data show that a large majority of federal  managers reported that they consider their agency\u2019s strategic goals when  they are allocating resources.  As shown in figure 7, on our 2003 survey, an  estimated 70 percent of all federal managers agreed to a great or very great  extent that they considered their agency\u2019s strategic goals when allocating  resources.  However, using our 1997 survey responses as a baseline, it was  not a statistically significant increase over 64 percent of the managers who  responded comparably then.  As shown in figure 8, a similar, but somewhat  smaller, majority (60 percent) of managers who expressed an opinion on  our 2003 survey agreed to a great or very great extent that they used  information from performance measurement when they were involved in  allocating resources.  In 1997, the comparable response was about the  same at 62 percent.  When we asked managers on another item, however,  about the extent to which they perceived funding decisions for their  programs being based on results or outcome-oriented performance  information, only 25 percent of federal managers in 2003 endorsed this  view to a great or very great extent.  In 1997, 20 percent of managers  expressed a comparable view, again not a significant increase.

On the basis of our current review of the  strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual performance reports  of six selected agencies\u2014Education, DOE, HUD, DOT, SBA, and SSA\u2014we  found that these documents reflect much of the feedback that was  provided.  For example, goals were more quantifiable and results oriented,  and agencies were providing more information about goals and strategies  to address performance and accountability challenges and the limitations  to their performance data.  However, certain weaknesses, such as lack of  detail on how annual performance goals relate to strategic goals and how  agencies are coordinating with other entities to achieve common  objectives, persist.

Our assessment of 27 agencies\u2019  initial draft strategic plans revealed several critical strategic planning  issues that needed to be addressed.  These planning issues were as follows:  Most of the draft plans did not adequately link required elements in the  plans, such as strategic goals to annual performance goals.", "Long-term strategic goals often tended to have weaknesses.", "Many agencies did not fully develop strategies explaining how their  long-term strategic goals would be achieved.", "Most agencies did not reflect in their draft plans the identification and  planned coordination of activities and programs that cut across multiple  agencies.", "The draft strategic plans did not adequately address program  evaluations.", "We noted that Congress anticipated that it may take several planning cycles  to perfect the process and that strategic plans would be continually refined  as various planning cycles occur.  We also recognized that developing a  strategic plan is a dynamic process and that agencies, with input from OMB  and Congress, were continuing to improve their plans.", "Agencies have now had 6 years to refine their strategic planning processes.   Although the six strategic plans we looked at for this review reflected many  new and continuing strengths as well as improvements over the 1997 initial  drafts, we continued to find certain persistent weaknesses.  As depicted in  table 1, of the six elements required by GPRA, the plans generally discussed  all but one\u2014program evaluation, an area in which we have found capacity  is often lacking in federal agencies.  Although the strategic plans generally  listed the program evaluations agencies planned to complete over the  planning period, they generally did not address how the agencies planned  to use their evaluations to establish new or revise existing strategic goals,  as envisioned by GPRA.  Finally, although not required by GPRA, the  strategic plans would have benefited from more complete discussions of  how agencies planned to coordinate with other entities to address common  challenges or achieve common or complementary goals.  Appendix III  provides a more detailed discussion of (1) the required and other useful  elements we reviewed to assess strategic plan strengths and weaknesses  and (2) changes in the quality of the six agencies\u2019 strategic plans we  reviewed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Strategic Planning Strengths and Improvements from Initial Draft Plans", "paragraphs": ["Consistent with our review of agencies\u2019 1997 strategic plans, the recent  strategic plans we reviewed generally contained mission statements that  were results oriented, distinct from other agencies, and covered the  agencies\u2019 major activities.  DOT\u2019s mission statement had improved by  reflecting additional language from its enabling legislation that we  recommended adding during our 1997 review.  Still improvement could be  made in this area as is shown by DOE\u2019s mission statement.  DOE\u2019s mission  was results oriented but did not address the department\u2019s activities related  to energy supply and conservation.", "Our review of the current strategic plans also revealed improvements in the  development of agencies\u2019 long-term, strategic goals\u2014essential for results- oriented management.  Although GPRA does not require that all of an  agency\u2019s long-term, strategic goals be results oriented, the intent of GPRA  is to have agencies focus their strategic goals on results to the extent  feasible.  In addition, as required by GPRA, the goals should be expressed  in a manner that could be used to gauge success in the future and should  cover an agency\u2019s major functions or activities.  All of the strategic plans  we reviewed contained long-term, strategic goals that demonstrated  improvements in the quality of their 1997 goals.  Agencies\u2019 long-term  strategic goals generally covered their missions, were results oriented, and  were expressed in a manner that could be used to gauge future success.   For example, SBA improved the quality of its long-term goals by focusing  more on key outcomes to be achieved and less on process improvements,  as was the case in its 1997 plan.  In some cases, we observed strategic goals  that addressed the agency\u2019s organizational capacity to achieve results, such  as SSA\u2019s long-term goal to strategically manage and align staff to support its  mission.", "We also found improvements in how agencies\u2019 current plans addressed  performance and accountability challenges we had identified, a key  weakness we identified in our earlier review.  Each of the agency plans we  reviewed discussed the long-term goals and strategies to address the  challenges that we had identified.  For example, Education\u2019s strategic plan  contained a long-term strategic goal to modernize the Federal Student  Assistance programs and address identified problems in this area, which  we have designated as high risk since 1990.  SSA noted that it considered  GAO-identified performance and accountability challenges when it  determined its strategic goals and objectives, however not all of the  challenges are clearly addressed in the plan.", "A third area of improvement we observed was in the description of the  strategies agencies planned to use to achieve their long-term strategic  goals.  In our review of agencies\u2019 1997 draft strategic plans, we found that  many agencies did not fully develop strategies explaining how their long- term strategic goals would be achieved.  In contrast, all six of the current  strategic plans we reviewed contained strategies that appeared logically  linked to achieving the agencies\u2019 long-term goals.", "Other strengths and improvements we observed in meeting GPRA\u2019s basic  requirements involved the reporting of external factors that could affect  the achievement of the long-term goals and the identification of  crosscutting activities, although as indicated below these discussions could  be improved.  The six agencies reviewed for this report each reported on  external factors in current strategic plans.  For example, for each of the  strategic objectives in DOT\u2019s strategic plan, DOT lists factors external to its  control and how those factors could affect the achievement of its  objectives.  Although not a requirement, some of the better plans we  reviewed discussed strategies to ameliorate the effect of external factors.   For example, for an external factor on teacher certification under a goal on  reading, Education\u2019s plan states that the agency \u201cwill work with the states  and national accreditation bodies to encourage the incorporation of  research-based reading instruction into teacher certification  requirements.\u201d", "We have frequently reported that a focus on results, as envisioned by  GPRA, implies that federal programs contributing to the same or similar  results should be closely coordinated to ensure that goals are consistent  and, as appropriate, program efforts are mutually reinforcing.  This means  that federal agencies are to look beyond their organizational boundaries  and coordinate with other agencies to ensure that their efforts are aligned.   During our 1997 review, we found that most agencies did not reflect in their  draft plans the identification and planned coordination of activities and  programs that cut across multiple agencies.  In contrast, each of the six  current agency strategic plans that we reviewed identified at least some  activities and programs that cut across multiple agencies.  For example,  SBA\u2019s 1997 plan contained no evidence of how the agency coordinated with  other agencies, but the current plan contained a separate section  describing crosscutting issues in the areas of innovation and research  assistance, international trade assistance, business development  assistance, veterans affairs, and disaster assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Critical Strategic Planning Issues Needing Further Improvement", "paragraphs": ["First, consistent with our 1997 review, the strategic plans we reviewed did  not adequately link required elements in the plans.  Although all of the  agencies we reviewed provided some information on the relationship  between their long-term and annual goals, the extent of information  provided on how annual goals would be used to measure progress in  achieving the long-term goals varied greatly.  In the case of DOE, the plan  provides a very brief description of the overall relationship between its  long-term and annual goals with examples, but does not demonstrate how  it will assess progress for each of its long-term goals and objectives.   Another plan, DOT\u2019s, refers the reader to the annual performance plan for  information about annual goals.  We have reported that this linkage is  critical for determining whether an agency has a clear sense of how it will  assess progress toward achieving its intended results.", "Second, although the agencies\u2019 descriptions of their strategies had  improved since our initial reviews, with few exceptions, their strategies  generally did not include information on how the agencies plan to align  their activities, core processes, human capital, and other resources to  support their mission-critical outcomes and whether they have the right  mix of activities, skills, and resources to achieve their goals.  Such  information is critical to understanding the viability of the strategies.   Furthermore, none of the agencies discussed alternative strategies they  had considered in developing their plans.  Without such discussions, it is  unclear whether agency planning processes were truly strategic or simply a  recasting of existing activities, processes, etc.", "HUD was the only agency that provided any details of how it intended to  coordinate with other agencies to achieve common or complementary  goals for its crosscutting programs or activities.  For example, to support  its goal of \u201cEqual Opportunity in Housing,\u201d HUD\u2019s plan states that HUD and  the Department of Justice continue to coordinate their fair housing  enforcement activities, especially with respect to responding quickly and  effectively to Fair Housing Act complaints that involve criminal activity  (e.g., hate crimes), a pattern and practice of housing discrimination, or the  legality of state and local zoning or other land use laws or ordinances.  We  have reported that mission fragmentation and program overlap are  widespread throughout the federal government.  As such, interagency  coordination is important for ensuring that crosscutting programs are  mutually reinforcing and efficiently implemented.", "Finally, the draft strategic plans did not adequately address program  evaluations.  In combination with an agency\u2019s performance measurement  system, program evaluations can provide feedback to the agency on how  well its activities and programs contributed to achieving strategic goals.   For example, evaluations can be a potentially critical source of information  for Congress and others in assessing (1) the appropriateness and  reasonableness of goals; (2) the effectiveness of strategies by  supplementing performance measurement data with impact evaluation  studies; and (3) the implementation of programs, such as identifying the  need for corrective action.  Evaluations are important because they  potentially can be critical sources of information for ensuring that goals are  reasonable, strategies for achieving goals are effective, and that corrective  actions are taken in program implementation.  Five out of the six current  plans that we reviewed included a discussion of program evaluations,  however for most of these plans the discussions lacked critical information  required by GPRA, such as a discussion of how evaluations were used to  establish strategic goals or a schedule of future evaluations.  For example,  DOE\u2019s plan stated that internal, GAO, and Inspector General (IG)  evaluations were used as resources to develop its draft strategic plan, but  specific program evaluations were not identified."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Fiscal Year 2004 Annual Performance Plans Addressed Some Weaknesses of Earlier Plans, but Still Have Room for Significant Improvement", "paragraphs": ["According to our review of agencies\u2019 first annual performance plans, which  presented agencies\u2019 annual performance goals for fiscal year 1999, we  found that substantial further development was needed for these plans to  be useful in a significant way to congressional and other decision makers.   Most of the fiscal year 1999 plans that we reviewed contained major  weaknesses that undermined their usefulness in that they (1) did not  consistently provide clear pictures of agencies\u2019 intended performance,   (2) generally did not relate strategies and resources to performance, and  (3) provided limited confidence that agencies\u2019 performance data will be  sufficiently credible.

Our current review of  agencies\u2019 fiscal year 2004 performance plans found that five of the six  agencies provided a clearer picture of intended performance than their  fiscal year 1999 plans did, although only two of the 2004 plans\u2014DOT\u2019s and  SSA\u2019s\u2014received the highest rating possible.  As shown in table 2, except for  DOT, the six agencies we reviewed for this report initially provided a  limited picture of intended performance.  Most of the fiscal year 1999  performance plans we previously reviewed had at least some objective,  quantifiable, and measurable goals, but few plans consistently included a  comprehensive set of goals that focused on the results that programs were  intended to achieve.  Moreover, agencies did not consistently follow OMB\u2019s  guidance that goals for performance and accountability challenges be  included in the plans.  Agencies\u2019 plans generally showed how their missions  and strategic goals were related to their annual performance goals and  covered all of the program activities in the agencies\u2019 budget requests. In  addition, many agencies took the needed first step of identifying their  crosscutting efforts, with some including helpful lists of other agencies  with which they shared a responsibility for addressing similar national  issues.  However, the plans generally did not go further to describe how  agencies expected to coordinate their efforts with other agencies.", "The fiscal year 2004 plans improved the picture of performance by making  annual goals and performance measures more results oriented, objective,  and quantifiable.  For example, Education\u2019s plan included a measure for the  number of states meeting their eighth grade mathematics achievement  targets under the long-term goal to improve mathematics and science  achievement for all students.  We previously criticized Education\u2019s 1999  plan for lacking such outcome-oriented measures.  Another overall  improvement we observed was that all of the plans described intended  efforts to address performance and accountability challenges we and  others had previously identified.  For instance, to address the  governmentwide high-risk area of strategic human capital management,  HUD states that to develop its staff capacity, it will complete a  comprehensive workforce analysis in 2004 to serve as the basis to fill  mission critical skill gaps through succession planning, hiring, and training  initiatives in a 5-year human capital management strategy.  The clarity of  DOE\u2019s plan remained limited because its annual goals were not clearly  linked to its mission, the long-term goals in its strategic plan, or the  program activities in its budget request.", "Although five of the six agencies improved the clarity of the picture of  intended performance, improvement is still needed in reporting on  crosscutting efforts.  In both the 1999 and 2004 plans, many agencies  identified their crosscutting efforts, with some including helpful lists of  other agencies with which they shared a responsibility for addressing  similar national issues.  Our review of fiscal year 2004 plans shows that the  six agencies we reviewed still did not discuss how they expected to  coordinate with other agencies to address common challenges or to  achieve common or complementary performance goals.  As we have  reported previously, improved reporting on crosscutting efforts can help  Congress use the annual performance plan to evaluate whether the annual  goals will put the agency on a path toward achieving its mission and long- term strategic goals.  In addition, the plans can aid in determining efforts to  reduce significant program overlap and fragmentation that can waste  scarce resources, confuse and frustrate program customers, and limit  overall program effectiveness.", "None of the six agencies\u2019 plans indicated an intention to request waivers of  specific administrative procedural requirements and controls that may be  impeding an agencies\u2019 ability to achieve results.  This provision of GPRA  allows agencies greater managerial flexibility in exchange for  accountability for results.  We previously reported on the results of the  pilot project to implement this provision of GPRA and found that the pilot  did not work as intended.  OMB did not designate any of the seven  departments and one independent agency that submitted a total of 61  waiver proposals as GPRA managerial accountability and flexibility pilots.   For about three-quarters of the waiver proposals, OMB or other central  management agencies determined that the waivers were not allowable for  statutory or other reasons or that the requirement for which the waivers  were proposed no longer existed.

Education\u2019s, HUD\u2019s, SBA\u2019s, and SSA\u2019s 1999 plans had a limited discussion,  while DOE\u2019s and DOT\u2019s 1999 plans had a general discussion.

In contrast, the 2004 performance plans we reviewed  generally provided lists of the agencies\u2019 current array of programs and  initiatives.  Several plans provided a perspective on how these programs  and initiatives were necessary or helpful for achieving results.  For  example, DOE and HUD included in their plans a \u201cmeans and strategies\u201d  section for each of their goals that described how the goal would be  achieved.  One strategy DOE identified to meet its goal of contributing  unique, vital facilities to the biological environmental sciences was to  conduct peer reviews of the facilities to assess the scientific output, user  satisfaction, the overall cost-effectiveness of each facility\u2019s operations, and  their ability to deliver the most advanced scientific capability.", "In addition, each of the agencies\u2019 plans identified the external factors that  could influence the degree to which goals are achieved.  Some of the better  plans, such as DOT\u2019s and SBA\u2019s, provided strategies to mitigate the negative  factors or take advantage of positive factors, as appropriate.  For example,  for its transportation accessibility goals, DOT\u2019s plan states that as the  population ages, more people will require accessible public transit, for  which states and local agencies decide how best to allocate federally  provided resources.  One of the strategies DOT intends to employ to  address this external factor is the \u201cSpecial Needs of Elderly Individuals and  Individuals with Disabilities\u201d grant program.  The plan states the grant  program will help meet transportation needs of the elderly and persons  with disabilities when regular transportation services are unavailable,  insufficient, or inappropriate to meet their needs.", "Agencies\u2019 2004 plans did not consistently describe all the resources needed  and how they would be used to achieve agency goals.

The 2004 plans we reviewed generally  described the funding levels needed to achieve their performance goals  overall and in some cases broke out funding needs by high-level  performance goal.  For example, SSA\u2019s plan provides a general perspective  on the financial resources needed to achieve its performance goals because  it provides budget information by account and program activity.  However,  the plan is neither structured by budget program activity or account, nor  does it provide a crosswalk between the strategic goals and budget  program accounts.  In contrast, HUD\u2019s plan presented its requested funding  and staffing levels at the strategic goal level, but did not present budget  information at the level of its annual goals.

Under GPRA, agencies\u2019 annual  performance plans are to describe the means that will be used to verify and  validate performance data.  To help improve the quality of agencies\u2019  performance data, Congress amended GPRA through the Reports  Consolidation Act of 2000 to require that agencies assess the completeness  and reliability of the performance data in their performance reports.   Agencies were also required to discuss in their report any material  inadequacies in the completeness and reliability of their performance data  and discuss actions to address these inadequacies.  Meeting these new  requirements suggests the need for careful planning to ensure that agencies  can comment accurately on the quality of the performance data they report  to the public.", "As shown in table 2, although five of the six agencies we reviewed  improved in reporting how they plan to ensure that performance data will  be credible, only one agency\u2014DOT\u2014improved enough over its 1999 plan  to provide a full level of confidence in the credibility of its performance  data.  Four agencies\u2014Education, HUD, SBA, and SSA\u2014improved enough  to provide a general level of confidence.  However, DOE provided the same  limited level of confidence in the credibility of the performance data as in  its 1999 plan.  Regarding all 24 of the fiscal year 1999 performance plans we  reviewed, we found most provided only superficial descriptions of  procedures that agencies intended to use to verify and validate  performance data.  Moreover, in general, agencies\u2019 performance plans did  not include discussions of documented limitations in financial and other  information systems that may undermine efforts to produce high-quality  data.  As we have previously noted, without such information, and  strategies to address those limitations, Congress and other decision makers  cannot assess the validity and reliability of performance information.", "We found that each of the 2004 plans we reviewed contained some  discussion of the procedures the agencies would use to verify and validate  performance information, although in some cases the discussion was  inconsistent or limited.  For example, the discussions of SBA\u2019s verification  and validation processes for its indicators in the 2004 plan were generally  one- or two-sentence statements.  SBA also noted that it does not  independently verify some of the external data it gathers or that it does not  have access to the data for this purpose.  In contrast, the DOT plan referred  to a separate compendium available on-line that provides source and  accuracy statements, which give more detail on the methods used to  collect performance data, sources of variation and bias in the data, and  methods used to verify and validate the data.", "In addition, all of the agencies except DOE discussed known limitations to  performance data in their plans.  These agencies\u2019 plans generally provided  information about the quality of each performance measure, including any  limitations.  According to DOE officials, DOE\u2019s plan generally does not  discuss data limitations because the department selected goals for which  data are expected to be available and therefore did not anticipate finding  any limitations.  However, in our 2003 Performance and Accountability  Series report on DOE, we identified several performance and  accountability challenges where data were a concern, such as the need for  additional information on the results of contractors\u2019 performance to keep  projects on schedule and within budget.  DOE\u2019s contract management  continues to be a significant challenge for the department and remains at  high risk.", "Finally, the remaining five agencies also discussed plans to address  limitations to the performance data.  For example, DOT\u2019s plan provided a  general discussion of the limitations to the internal and external sources of  data used to measure performance.  Detailed discussions were contained in  an appendix to the plan and separate source and accuracy statements.  This  information had been lacking in its 1999 plan.  Education, HUD, SBA, and  SSA also provided information on limitations to their performance data and  plans for improvement."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Strengths and Weaknesses of Selected Agencies\u2019 Fiscal Year 2002 Annual Performance Reports", "paragraphs": ["Key to improving accountability for results as Congress intended under  GPRA, annual performance reports are to document the results agencies  have achieved compared to the goals they established.  To be useful for  oversight and accountability purposes, the reports should clearly  communicate performance results, provide explanations for any unmet  goals as well as actions needed to address them, and discuss known data  limitations as well as how the limitations are to be addressed in the future.   Compared to our reviews of the six agencies\u2019 fiscal year 1999 performance  reports, we identified a number of strengths and improvements as well as  areas that continued to need improvement.  Because the scope of our  review of the fiscal year 2002 reports was broader than that for the fiscal  year 1999 reports we previously reviewed, we were unable to make specific  comparisons for the three characteristics we used to assess the fiscal year  2002 reports.  However, we discuss comparative information on aspects of  the reports where available.  Table 3 shows the results of our assessment of  the six agencies\u2019 annual performance reports for fiscal year 2002.   Appendix V provides a more detailed discussion of (1) the required and  other useful elements we reviewed to assess the clarity of the picture of  performance, the clarity of the linkage between costs and performance,  and the level of confidence in the performance data and (2) changes in the  quality of the six agencies\u2019 annual performance plans we reviewed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Progress in Providing a Clear Picture of Performance", "paragraphs": ["The six agency reports that we reviewed contained a number of strengths,  some of which we can describe as improvements over the reports on fiscal  year 1999 performance.  A key strength of four of the 2002 reports  (Education, HUD, DOT, SSA) was a discussion of the relationship between  the strategic plan, performance plan, and performance report.  For  example, SSA\u2019s report identified relevant results that were linked to its  strategic objective to deliver \u201ccitizen-centered, world-class service,\u201d such  as maintaining the accuracy, timeliness, and efficiency of service to people  applying for its benefit programs.  The clarity of the DOE and SBA reports  was limited by not clearly relating agency performance results to strategic  and annual performance goals.  For example, the structure of SBA\u2019s report  reflected the objectives in its draft 2003 to 2008 strategic plan rather than  those in its 2002 performance plan, making it difficult to assess progress  against the original 2002 objectives.  Furthermore, although there is no  \u201cright\u201d number of performance measures to be used to assess progress, a  number of the plans allowed for an easier review of results by limiting the  overall number of measures presented or by highlighting key performance  measures of greatest significance to their programs.  For example, SBA  discussed a total of 19 performance goals and DOT discussed a total of 40.   Although SSA discussed a total of 69 performance goals, the report  highlighted its progress in achieving 14 key goals.  In contrast, Education,  HUD, and DOE presented a total of 120, 184, and 260 measures,  respectively.  Furthermore, while Education and SSA each provided a table  showing progress across all its measures, the other agencies did not  provide such summary information.", "As we found in our earlier reviews, the six agencies\u2019 fiscal year 2002 reports  generally allowed for an assessment of progress made in achieving agency  goals.  Some of the reports made this assessment easier than others by  providing easy-to-read summary information.  For example, SSA provided a  table at the beginning of the report that summarized the results for each of  its 69 indicators with the following dispositions:  met, not met, almost met,  and data not yet available.  Other reports, such as HUD\u2019s, required an  extensive review to make this assessment.  In addition, to place current  performance in context, each of the agencies\u2019 reports contained trend  information, as required by GPRA, which allowed for comparisons between  current year and prior year performance.", "In addition, the majority of agencies maintained, or demonstrated  improvements over, the quality of their 1999 reports in discussing the  progress achieved in addressing performance and accountability  challenges identified by agency IGs and GAO.  For example, SBA\u2019s report  contained two broad overviews and an appendix describing the status of  GAO audits and recommendations, as well as a description of the most  serious management challenges SBA faces as identified by the agency\u2019s IG.", "Unfortunately, many of the weaknesses we identified in the agencies\u2019 fiscal  year 2002 reports were similar to those we found in their fiscal year 1999  reports related to the significant number of performance goals (1) which  were not achieved and lacked explanations or plans for achieving the goal  in the future and (2) for which performance data were unavailable.  Three  of the six agencies we reviewed\u2014HUD, SSA, and Transportation\u2014did not  consistently report the reasons for not meeting their goals.  For example,  Transportation provided explanations for only 5 of the 14 goals it did not  meet.  In addition, similar to our 1999 report findings, three of the six  agencies we reviewed\u2014HUD, SBA, and DOT\u2014did not discuss their plans  or strategies to achieve unmet goals in the future.  For example, HUD  reported \u201csubstantially meeting\u201d only 47 percent of the performance targets  in fiscal year 2002.  However, although HUD provides various reasons for  not meeting all its targets, it offers no information on plans or time frames  to achieve the goals in the future.  Finally, we continued to observe a  significant number of goals for which performance data were unavailable.   For example, performance data for 10 of SBA\u2019s 19 performance goals were  unavailable.", "In addition, the majority of the reports we reviewed did not include other  GPRA requirements.  The reports generally did not evaluate the  performance plan for the current year relative to the performance achieved  toward the performance goals in the fiscal year covered by the report.  The  reports also did not discuss the use or effectiveness of any waivers in  achieving performance goals.  In addition, for two of the agencies\u2014DOE  and SBA\u2014program evaluation findings completed during the fiscal year  were not summarized.

The  committee report for GPRA suggested that developing the capacity to  relate the level of program activity with program costs, such as cost per  unit of result, cost per unit of service, or cost per unit of output, should be a  high priority.  In our survey of federal managers, this year we asked for the  first time the extent to which federal managers had measures of cost- effectiveness for the programs they were involved with.  Only 31 percent of  federal managers we surveyed reported having such measures to a great or  very great extent, lower than any of the other types of measures associated  with GPRA we asked about by at least 12 percent (see fig. 3 in ch. 2).  Under  the PMA, the current administration has set an ambitious agenda for  performance budgeting, calling for agencies to better align budgets with  performance goals and focus on capturing full budgetary costs and  matching those costs with output and outcome goals.  All this suggests that  agencies will need to develop integrated financial and performance  management systems that will enable the reporting of the actual costs  associated with performance goals and objectives along with presentations  designed to meet other budgetary or financial purposes, such as the  accounts and program activities found in the President\u2019s Budget and  responsibility segments found in financial statements.", "Of the six agencies we reviewed, only Education\u2019s report clearly linked its  budgetary information to the achievement of its performance goals or  objectives.  Education\u2019s report laid out, using both graphics and text, the  estimated appropriations associated with achieving each of its 24  objectives.  In addition the report provided the staffing in full-time  equivalent employment (FTEs) and an estimate of the funds from salaries  and expenses contributing to the support of each of these objectives.  SBA\u2019s  report contained crosswalks that showed the relationship between SBA\u2019s  strategic goals, outcome goals, performance goals, and programs.  Because  SBA shows the resources for each program, a reader can infer a  relationship between SBA\u2019s resources and performance goals.  However,  the linkage between resources and results would be clearer if results and  resources were presented by performance goal as well.  SSA provided a  limited view of the costs of achieving its performance goals by providing  the costs associated with four out of five of its strategic goals.  However,  as reported by the IG, SSA needs to further develop its cost accounting  system, which would help link costs to performance.  DOE also provided  a limited view of the costs of achieving its performance goals by organizing  its performance information by budget program activity and associated net  costs.  According to DOE officials, the department plans to link its  individual performance measures to the costs of program activities in  future reports.

The other agencies provided general or limited  confidence in their data.", "All six agencies in our current review complied with the Reports  Consolidation Act of 2000 by including assessments of the completeness  and reliability of their performance data in their transmittal letters.  In  contrast, we found that only 5 of the 24 CFO Act agencies included this  information in their fiscal year 2000 performance reports.  Of the six  agencies in our current review, only DOE provided this assessment in its  fiscal year 2000 report.  For example, the Secretary of DOT stated in the  transmittal letter that the 2002 report \u201ccontains performance and financial  data that are substantially complete and reliable.\u201d  However, only two of  the six agencies also disclosed material inadequacies in the completeness  and reliability of their performance data and discussed actions to address  the inadequacies in their transmittal letters.  For example, SBA stated in its  transmittal letter that it is \u201cworking to improve the completeness and  reliability of the performance data for the advice provided to small  business through SBA\u2019s resource partners.\u201d  SBA explained that data for  this aspect of its performance are collected through surveys, which are  inconsistent and not comparable, and for which client responses are  difficult to obtain.  SBA stated that it is working to improve the survey  instruments it uses to obtain performance data.", "In addition to the requirements of the Reports Consolidation Act, we have  previously reported on other practices that enhance the credibility of  performance data that are not specifically required by GPRA.  For instance,  discussions of standards and methods used by agencies to assess the  quality of their performance data in their performance reports provide  decision makers greater insight into the quality and value of the  performance data.  None of the reports explicitly referred to a specific  standard they used, however, DOE described its method for assuring data  quality.  The report states that the heads of DOE\u2019s organizational elements  certified the accuracy of their performance data.  DOE subsequently  reviewed the data for quality and completeness.", "Other useful practices that help foster transparency to the public and assist  decision makers in understanding the quality of an agency\u2019s data include:  (1) discussion of data quality, including known data limitations and actions  to address the limitations, and (2) discussion of data verification and  validation procedures, including proposals to review data collection and  verification and validation procedures.", "All six agencies\u2019 reports described data limitations, although discussions  were mostly brief and very high level.  One exception was DOT, which  directed readers to the DOT Web site to obtain an assessment of the  completeness and reliability of its performance data and detailed  information on the source, scope, and limitations of the performance data.   HUD and SBA also discussed plans for addressing the limitations.  For  example, HUD stated that to address problems with its indicator on the  number of homeowners who have been assisted with the Home Investment  Partnership Program (HOME), HUD has established a team of managers,  technical staff, and contractors to make a series of improvements to the  Integrated Disbursement and Information System beginning in fiscal year  2003 that should reduce the need to clean up the data.", "Each of the six agencies\u2019 reports also discussed the procedures they used  to verify and validate their performance data.  However, these discussions  ranged from the very general description of the DOE method (noted  previously), to the very detailed discussions provided by DOT.  DOT  provides an on-line compendium that discusses the source and accuracy of  its data.  Furthermore, DOT\u2019s 2002 report also describes strategies being  undertaken to address the quality of its data.  The report states that a DOT  intermodal working group addressed data quality issues by developing  departmental statistical standards and by updating source and accuracy  statements for all of DOT\u2019s data programs.

The success of GPRA depends on the  commitment of top leadership within agencies, OMB, and Congress.   However, according to federal managers surveyed, top leadership  commitment to achieving results has not grown significantly since our 1997  survey.  Furthermore, although OMB has recently shown an increased  commitment to management issues, it significantly reduced its guidance to  agencies on GPRA implementation compared to prior years, and it is not  clear how the program goals developed through its PART initiative will  complement and integrate with the long-term, strategic focus of GPRA.   Obtaining leadership commitment to implement a strategic plan depends in  part on the usefulness and relevance of agency goals and strategies to  agency leaders, Congress, and OMB.  However, GPRA\u2019s requirement to  update agency strategic plans every 3 years is out of sync with presidential  and congressional terms and can result in updated plans that do not have  the support of top administration leadership and key congressional  stakeholders.", "As noted in chapter 2, more federal managers surveyed reported having  results-oriented performance measures for their programs and we would  expect to have seen similar increases in the use of this information for  program management.  However, we did not observe any growth in their  reported use of this information for key management activities, such as  adopting new program approaches or changing work processes.   Additionally, managers noted human capital-related challenges that impede  results-oriented management, including a lack of authority and training to  carry out GPRA requirements, as well as a lack of recognition for the  results achieved.", "Consistent with our previous work, federal managers in our focus groups  reported that significant challenges persist in setting outcome-oriented  goals, measuring performance, and collecting useful data.  However, our  survey data suggested that federal managers do not perceive issues, such  as \u201cdifficulty distinguishing between the results produced by the program  and results caused by other factors\u201d and \u201cdifficulty obtaining data in time to  be useful,\u201d to be substantial hindrances to measuring performance or using  performance information.", "Additionally, mission fragmentation and overlap contribute to difficulties in  addressing crosscutting issues, particularly when those issues require a  national focus, such as homeland security, drug control, and the  environment.  GAO has previously reported on a variety of barriers to  interagency cooperation, such as conflicting agency missions, jurisdiction  issues, and incompatible procedures, data, and processes.  We have also  reported that OMB could use the provision of GPRA that calls for OMB to  develop a governmentwide performance plan to integrate expected agency- level performance.  Unfortunately, this provision has not been fully  implemented and the federal government lacks a tool, such as a strategic  plan, that could provide a framework for a governmentwide reexamination  of existing programs, as well as proposals for new programs.  Finally,  federal managers in our focus groups and political appointees we  interviewed believed that Congress does not use performance information  to the fullest extent to conduct oversight and to inform appropriations  decisions.  While there is concern regarding Congress\u2019 use of performance  information, it is important to make sure that this information is initially  useful.  As a key user of performance information, Congress needs to be  considered a partner in shaping agency goals at the outset.

From our 1997 survey, we  estimated about 57 percent of managers overall reported such commitment  to a great or very great extent.  On our 2003 survey, 62 percent of managers  expressed a comparable view\u2014a higher but not statistically significant  increase.  (See fig. 10.)", "As shown in figure 11, however, we continued to see a significant  difference between the perceptions of SES and non-SES managers on this  issue.  That is, the percentage of SES managers reporting that top  leadership demonstrated strong commitment to a great or very great extent  in 2003 was 22 percent higher than for non-SES managers.", "We observed in our 1997 and 2000 reports on governmentwide  implementation of GPRA that we would expect to see managers\u2019 positive  perceptions on items, such as the extent to which top leadership is  committed to achieving results, become more prevalent and the gap  between SES and non-SES managers begin to narrow as GPRA and related  reforms are implemented; however, these changes do not appear to be  happening as expected.", "Demonstrating the willingness and ability to make decisions and manage  programs based on results and the ability to inspire others to embrace such  a model are important indicators of leadership commitment to results- oriented management.  However, in both our 1997 and 2000 surveys, only  about 16 percent of managers reported that changes by management above  their levels to the programs for which they were responsible were based on  results or outcome-oriented performance information to a great or very  great extent.  In our 2003 survey, this indicator increased to 23 percent, a  statistically significant increase from prior surveys.  Twenty-eight percent  of federal managers surveyed who expressed an opinion reported that the  lack of ongoing top executive commitment or support for using  performance information to make program/funding decisions hindered  measuring performance or using performance information to a great or  very great extent.", "Our interviews with 10 top political appointees from the Clinton and  current Bush administrations indicated a high level of support and  enthusiasm for effectively implementing the principles embodied in GPRA.   For example, one appointee noted that GPRA focused senior management  on a set of goals and objectives to allow the organization to understand  what is important and how to deal with accomplishment at a macro-level,  as well as provided a structure for problem solving.  Another political  appointee noted that GPRA has made it important to look at what you get  out of the budget, not just what you put into it, while another concluded  that GPRA brought about a fundamental rethinking of how they managed  their programs and processes.  Such indications of support for GPRA are  promising.  However, to support the transition to more results-oriented  agency cultures, top agency management will need to make a more  concerted effort to translate their enthusiasm for GPRA into actions that  communicate to employees that top management cares about performance  results and uses the information in its decision making.", "The need for strong, committed leadership extends to OMB as well.  OMB  has shown a commitment to improving the management of federal  programs, both through its leadership in reviewing agency program  performance using the PART tool as well as through the PMA, which calls  for improved financial performance, strategic human capital management,  competitive sourcing, expanded electronic government, and performance  budget integration.  Using the foundation of information generated by  agencies in their strategic plans, annual performance plans, and program  performance reports, OMB has used the PART tool to exercise oversight of  selected federal programs by assessing program purpose and design, the  quality of strategic planning, the quality of program management, and the  extent to which programs can demonstrate results.  PART provides OMB a  lens through which to view performance information for use in the budget  formulation process.  PART, and OMB\u2019s use of performance data in the  budget formulation process, potentially can complement GPRA\u2019s focus on  increasing the supply of credible performance information by promoting  the demand for this information in the budget formulation process.  As we  reported in chapter 2, more federal managers noted that OMB was paying  attention to their agencies\u2019 efforts under GPRA.  (See fig. 6.)  Additionally,  OMB convened a performance measurement workshop in April 2003 to  identify practical strategies for addressing common performance  measurement challenges.  As a result of this workshop, it produced a paper  in June 2003 that included basic performance measurement definitions and  concepts and common performance measurement problems that were  discussed at the workshop.  This was part of OMB\u2019s continuing efforts to  improve PART as an evaluation tool.", "However, there are areas where OMB could further enhance its leadership.   OMB has stated that the PART exercise presents an opportunity to inform  and improve on agency GPRA plans and reports and establish a  meaningful, systematic link between GPRA and the budget process.  OMB  has instructed agencies that, in lieu of a performance plan, they are to  submit a performance budget that includes information from the PART  assessments, including all performance goals used in the assessment of  program performance done under the PART process.  The result is that  program-specific performance measures developed through the PART  review are to substitute for other measures developed by the agency  through its strategic planning process.  GPRA is a broad legislative  framework that was designed to be consultative with Congress and other  stakeholders and address the needs of many users of performance  information\u2014Congress to provide oversight and inform funding decisions,  agency managers to manage programs and make internal resource  decisions, and the public to provide greater accountability.  Changing  agency plans and reports for use in the budget formulation process may not  satisfy the needs of these other users.  Users other than OMB are not likely  to find the information useful unless it is credible and valid for their  purposes.  PART\u2019s program-specific focus may fit with OMB\u2019s agency-by- agency budget reviews, but it is not well suited to achieving one of the key  purposes of strategic plans\u2014to convey agencywide, long-term goals and  objectives for all major functions and operations.  PART\u2019s focus on  program-specific measures does not substitute for the strategic, long-term  focus of GPRA on thematic goals and department- and governmentwide  crosscutting comparisons.", "To reach the full potential of performance management, agency planning  and reporting documents need to reflect the full array of uses of  performance information, which may extend beyond those needed for  formulating the President\u2019s Budget.  However, it is not yet clear whether the  results of those reviews, such as changes to agencies\u2019 program  performance measures, will complement and be integrated with the long- term, strategic goals and objectives agencies have established in  consultation with Congress and other stakeholders under GPRA.  OMB has  not yet clearly articulated how PART is to complement GPRA.  Focus group  participants suggested that the administration and OMB needed to  reinforce GPRA\u2019s usefulness as a management tool for agencies.  They also  emphasized the need for OMB to help agencies understand how to  integrate GPRA with other management initiatives, such as PART.", "As we noted in chapter 3, agencies\u2019 plans and reports still suffer from  persistent weaknesses and could improve in a number of areas, such as  attention to issues that cut across agency lines, and better information  about the quality of the data that underlie agency performance goals.   However, OMB\u2019s July 2003 guidance for the preparation and submission of  strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual performance reports  is significantly shorter and less detailed than its 2002 guidance.  For  example, OMB no longer provides detailed guidance to agencies for the  development of performance plan components.  OMB\u2019s 2002 guidance on  the preparation and submission of annual performance plans is  approximately 39 pages long; in its 2003 guidance, that discussion spans  only 2 pages.  The 2003 guidance in this area does not include entire  sections found in the 2002 guidance, such as principles for choosing  performance goals and indicators for inclusion in the annual plan, types of  performance goals, crosscutting programs, and requirements for verifying  and validating data.", "OMB needs to maintain and strengthen its leadership role in working with  agencies to help them produce the highest quality GPRA documents  through its formal guidance and reviews of strategic plan and report  submissions.  Focus group participants discussed the need for consistent  guidance on how to implement GPRA.  Furthermore, there is no evidence  that agencies have institutional knowledge of GPRA requirements that  would obviate the need for OMB\u2019s guidance.  New managers will need a  consistent resource that provides practical guidance on what agencies  need to include in their planning and reporting documents to comply with  GPRA and reflect best practices.  Consistent, explicit OMB guidance on  preparing GPRA documents can help ensure that gains in the quality of  GPRA documents are maintained and provide a resource for agencies to  make further improvements in those documents.  For example, guidance  on how to discuss coordination of crosscutting programs or improvements  to the credibility of performance data in agency performance plans goes  hand-in-hand with OMB\u2019s enhanced oversight of agency performance  through the PART exercise.", "The success of GPRA depends on the commitment of top leadership within  agencies, OMB, and Congress.  Obtaining such leadership commitment  depends in part on the usefulness and relevance of agency goals and  strategies to these parties.  GPRA requires an agency to develop a strategic  plan at least every 3 years to cover the following 5-year period.  Thus, there  have been two required updates of strategic plans since the initial strategic  plans were submitted for fiscal year 1997\u2014fiscal year 2000 and fiscal year  2003.  The fiscal year 2000 update occurred the year before a new  presidential term began.  According to our focus group participants\u2014both  the experts and federal managers\u2014it makes little sense to require an  update of a strategic plan shortly before a new administration is scheduled  to take office.  For example, changes in political leadership generally result  in a new agenda with new objectives.  Such changes force agencies to  revise their plans, management initiatives, and strategies, which translates  into additional GPRA-related work.  A strategic plan that does not reflect  the participation and buy-in of top administration leadership and key  congressional stakeholders is unlikely to be successfully implemented.   Therefore, GPRA\u2019s requirement to update agency strategic plans according  to a schedule that is out of sync with presidential and congressional terms  means that effort may be wasted on plans that lack the support of top  leadership."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Managers Report Mixed Results in Use of Performance Information", "paragraphs": ["GPRA\u2019s usefulness to agency leaders and managers as a tool for  management and accountability was cited as a key accomplishment  numerous times by focus group participants.

For example, one participant said  they did not believe GPRA has been used as a tool yet, while another  participant commented that only better managers take advantage of GPRA  as a management tool.  According to focus group participants, although  many federal managers understand and use results-oriented management  concepts in their day-to-day activities, such as strategic planning and  performance measurement, they do not always connect these concepts to  the requirements of GPRA.", "This view was strongly supported by our survey results.  Prior to  mentioning GPRA in our survey, we asked federal managers the extent to  which they consider their agency\u2019s strategic goals when engaging in key  management tasks such as setting program activities, allocating resources,  or considering changes in their programs.  A relatively high percentage of  managers\u2014ranging from 66 to 79 percent\u2014responded to a great or very  great extent.  However, when we asked similar questions about the extent  to which they considered their agency\u2019s annual performance goals as set  forth in the agency\u2019s GPRA annual performance plan for the same  activities, the comparable responses were considerably lower, ranging  from 22 to 27 percent.", "Because the benefit of collecting performance information is only fully  realized when this information is actually used by managers, we asked  them about the extent to which they used the information obtained from  measuring performance for various program management activities.  As  shown in figure 12, for seven of the nine activities we asked about, the  majority of managers who expressed an opinion reported using  performance information to a great or very great extent in 2003.  Across all  nine activities, the percentage of managers saying they used performance  information to a great or very great extent ranged from 41 percent for  developing and managing contracts to 60 percent for allocating resources,  setting individual job expectations, and rewarding staff.  While we had  observed a decline in the reported use of performance information to this  extent for many of these activities between 1997 and 2000, our 2003 results  increased to levels not significantly different from 1997 for all but one  category\u2014adopting new program approaches or changing work processes.   This category of use continued to be significantly lower at 56 percent in  2003 than it was in 1997 at 66 percent.  Although another category,  coordinating program efforts with other internal or external organizations,  shows a similar pattern of limited recovery, the difference between the  1997 and 2003 results is not statistically significant.", "We have reported that involving program managers in the development of  performance goals and measures is critical to increasing the relevance and  usefulness of this information to their day-to-day activities.  Yet, our survey  data indicate that participation in activities related to the development and  use of performance information has also been mixed.  In 2003, only 14  percent of managers believed to a great or very great extent that their  agencies considered their contributions to or comments on their agency\u2019s  GPRA plans or reports.

Our prior work  discussed best practices for addressing challenges to measuring the results  of regulatory programs.  In particular, to address the challenge of  discerning the impact of a federal program, when other factors also affect  results, we suggested agencies \u201cestablish a rationale of how the program  delivers results.\u201d  Establishing such a rationale involves three related  practices:  (1) taking a holistic or \u201csystems\u201d approach to the problem being  addressed, (2) building a program logic model that described how activities  translated to outcomes, and (3) expanding program assessments and  evaluations to validate the model linkages and rationale.", "We have also reported on the difficulties encountered in meeting GPRA  reporting requirements for intergovernmental grant programs.  Programs  that do not deliver a readily measurable product or service are likely to  have difficulty meeting GPRA performance measurement and reporting  requirements.  Intergovernmental grant programs, particularly those with  the flexibility inherent in classic block grant design, may be more likely to  have difficulty producing performance measures at the national level and  raise delicate issues of accountability.  Although most flexible grant  programs we reviewed reported simple activity or client counts, relatively  few of them collected uniform data on the outcomes of state or local  service activities.  Collecting such data requires conditions (such as  uniformity of activities, objectives, and measures) that do not exist under  many flexible program designs, and even where overall performance of a  state or local program can be measured, the amount attributable to federal  funding often cannot be separated out.", "Focus group participants also suggested that they faced challenges in  obtaining timely performance data from relevant partner organizations and  in identifying what the federal government\u2019s contribution has been to a  specific outcome.

Few of the plans  we reviewed attempted the more challenging task of discussing planned  strategies for coordination and establishing complementary performance  goals and complementary or common performance measures.  For  example, SSA\u2019s 2004 performance plan makes some mention of the agency\u2019s  efforts to coordinate with other agencies to preserve the integrity of the  Social Security number as a personal identifier, but there are very few  details about this important component of its mission.", "Previous GAO reports and agency managers identified several barriers to  interagency coordination.  First, missions may not be mutually reinforcing  or may even conflict, making reaching a consensus on strategies and  priorities difficult.  In 1998 and 1999, we found that mission fragmentation  and program overlap existed in 12 federal mission areas, ranging from  agriculture to natural resources and the environment.  Implementation of  federal crosscutting programs is often characterized by numerous  individual agency efforts that are implemented with little apparent regard  for the presence of related activities.

Finally,  incompatible procedures, processes, data, and computer systems pose  difficulties for agencies to work across agency boundaries.  For example,  we reported how the lack of consistent data on federal wetlands programs  implemented by different agencies prevented the government from  measuring progress toward achieving the governmentwide goal of no net  loss of the nation\u2019s wetlands.", "We have previously reported and testified that GPRA could provide OMB,  agencies, and Congress with a structured framework for addressing  crosscutting program efforts.  OMB, for example, could use the provision  of GPRA that calls for OMB to develop a governmentwide performance  plan to integrate expected agency-level performance.  Unfortunately, this  provision has not been fully implemented.  OMB issued the first and only  such plan in February 1998 for fiscal year 1999.  In our review of the plan,  we found that it included a broad range of governmentwide management  objectives and a mission-based presentation of key performance goals  based on agency performance plans and the plan\u2019s framework should  ultimately allow for a cohesive presentation of governmentwide  performance.  However, the specific contents of this initial plan did not  always deliver an integrated, consistent, and results-oriented picture of  fiscal year 1999 federal government performance goals.", "OMB officials we interviewed at the time stressed that developing the  governmentwide plan was viewed as an essential and integral component  of the President\u2019s budget and planning process.  From OMB\u2019s perspective,  both the plan and the budget submission were intended to serve as  communication tools for a range of possible users.  In their opinion, the  plan added value by reflecting a governmentwide perspective on policy  choices made throughout the budget formulation process.  OMB  acknowledged that the plan itself did not serve to change the process  through which decisions on government priorities were made, but  enhanced it by placing a greater emphasis on results.  As one official  described it, the governmentwide performance plan was a derivative  document, reflecting the budget and management decisions made  throughout the process of formulating the President\u2019s budget submission.   However, we found that focusing broadly on governmentwide outcomes  should be a central and distinguishing feature of the federal government  performance plan.  To be most effective and supportive of the purposes of  GPRA, the governmentwide plan must be more than a compilation of  agency-level plans; integration, rather than repetition, must be its guiding  principle.", "OMB has not issued a distinct governmentwide performance plan since  fiscal year 1999.  Most recently, the President\u2019s fiscal year 2004 budget  focused on describing agencies\u2019 progress in addressing the PMA and the  results of PART reviews of agency programs.  Although such information is  important and useful, it does not provide a broader and more integrated  perspective of planned performance on governmentwide outcomes.   Additionally, the fiscal year 2004 budget identified budget requests and  performance objectives by agency, such as the U.S. Department of Defense,  as opposed to crosscutting governmentwide themes.  From this  presentation, one could assume that the only activities the U.S. government  planned to carry out in support of national defense were those listed under  the chapter \u201cDepartment of Defense.\u201d  However, the chapter of the fiscal  year 2004 budget discussing \u201cthe Department of State and International  Assistance Programs,\u201d contains a heading titled, \u201cCountering the Threat  from Weapons of Mass Destruction.\u201d  And while OMB may have a technical  reason for not classifying this task as being related to national defense or  homeland security, it is unclear that a lay reader could make that  distinction.  The fiscal year 2005 budget also identified budget requests by  agency, not by crosscutting theme.  Without such a governmentwide focus,  OMB is missing an opportunity to assess and communicate the relationship  between individual agency goals and outcomes that cut across federal  agencies and more clearly relate and address the contributions of  alternative federal strategies.

In some  cases, managers in our focus groups noted that this lack of usage was a  significant disincentive to doing a good job in preparing GPRA plans and  reports.

The  31 percent of managers who viewed OMB as paying attention to a great or  very great extent in 2003 was significantly higher than the 22 percent  holding a comparable view of congressional committees.", "Although managers expressed these concerns about the use of this  information, a recent review by the CRS suggested that Congress uses  performance information to some extent, as evidenced by citations in  legislation and committee reports.  For example, in the 106th Congress  (1999-2000), 42 public laws contained statutory language relating to GPRA  and performance measures, and 118 legislative reports contained GPRA- associated passages.  As shown in figure 18, across all three of our surveys,  only a minority of federal managers governmentwide viewed the lack of  ongoing congressional commitment for using performance information as a  hindrance to a great or very great extent.", "While there is concern regarding Congress\u2019 use of performance  information, it is important to make sure that this information is initially  useful.  One of GPRA\u2019s purposes is to respond to a need for accurate,  reliable information for congressional decision making.  In 2000, we  reported that congressional staffs stated that they were looking for  recurring information on spending priorities within programs; the quality,  quantity, and efficiency of program operations; the populations served or  regulated; as well as programs\u2019 progress in meeting their objectives.  For  example, learning who benefits from a program can help in addressing  questions about how well services are targeted to those most in need.   Some of these recurring needs were met through formal agency  documents, such as annual performance plans.  However, some  information the agencies provided did not fully meet the congressional  staffs\u2019 needs because the presentation was not clear, directly relevant, or  sufficiently detailed.  For example, congressional staffs wanted to see more  direct linkages among the agencies\u2019 resources, strategies, and goals.  In  other cases, the information was not readily available to the congressional  staffs, either because it had not been requested or reported, or because  staff were not informed that it was available.", "As a key user of performance information, Congress also needs to be  considered a partner in shaping agency goals at the outset.  For example,  through the strategic planning requirement, GPRA requires federal  agencies to consult with Congress and key stakeholders to reassess their  missions and long-term goals as well as the strategies and resources they  will need to achieve their goals.  GPRA also provides a vehicle for Congress  to explicitly state its performance expectations in outcome-oriented terms  when establishing new programs or in exercising oversight of existing  programs that are not achieving desired results.  Congress could use  authorizing and appropriations hearings to determine if agency programs  have clear performance goals, measures, and data with which to track  progress and whether the programs are achieving their goals.  If goals and  objectives are unclear or not results oriented, Congress could use  legislation to articulate the program outcomes it expects agencies to  achieve.

For example, the information gathered and reported for  GPRA allows agencies to make better-informed decisions, which improves  their ability to achieve results.  In addition, GPRA has made the results of  federal programs more transparent to the public.  Other participants stated  that while certain aspects of GPRA-related work have been positive,  agencies\u2019 ability to deliver results and public awareness of their activities  cannot be exclusively attributed to GPRA.", "Second, GPRA has increased the connection between resources and results  by creating more formal linkages between agency performance goals and  objectives and the program activities in the budget.  Over the first 4 years of  agency efforts to implement GPRA, we observed that agencies continued to  tighten the required linkage between their performance plans and budget  requests.  However, much remains to be done in this area.  For example, we  have not observed notable increases in federal managers\u2019 perceptions  about their personal use of plans or performance information when  allocating resources, or about the use of performance information when  funding decisions are made about their programs.  However, it should be  noted that we estimate a majority have positive perceptions about the use  of performance information to allocate resources.", "Third, GPRA has provided a foundation for examining agency missions,  performance goals and objectives, and the results achieved.  We have seen  improvements in the quality of agency strategic plans, annual performance  plans, and performance reports since initial efforts.  However, few of the  six agencies we reviewed in this report produced GPRA planning and  reporting documents that met all of our criteria for the highest level of  quality.  Most of these agencies continued to miss opportunities to present  clear pictures of their intended and actual performance results in their  GPRA plans and reports and to show how resources are aligned with actual  performance results.  Furthermore, most of the agencies we reviewed did  not provide a full level of confidence in the credibility of their performance  data.", "Performance-based management, as envisioned by GPRA, requires  transforming organizational cultures to improve decision making,  maximize performance, and assure accountability.  This transformation is  not an easy one and requires investments of time and resources as well as  sustained leadership commitment and attention.  Challenges to successful  implementation of GPRA include inconsistent top leadership commitment  to creating a focus on results; an approach to setting goals and developing  strategies for achieving critical outcomes that creates individual agency  stovepipes rather than an integrated, holistic governmentwide approach;  getting federal managers to make greater use of performance information  to manage their programs and providing them authority to act that is  commensurate with their accountability for results; difficulty in  establishing meaningful measures of outcomes and assessing results of  federal programs that are carried out by nonfederal entities; and untimely  performance data.", "The challenges identified in this report are not new\u2014most have not  changed significantly since we first reported on governmentwide  implementation of GPRA.  However, we have frequently reported on  approaches that agencies, OMB, and Congress could use to address the  challenges.  These approaches include strengthening the commitment of  top leadership to creating and sustaining a focus on results; taking a  governmentwide approach to achieving outcomes that are crosscutting in  nature; improving the usefulness of performance information to managers,  Congress, and the public; and improving the quality of performance  measures and data.  Collectively, these approaches form the agenda that  federal agencies, OMB, and Congress will need to follow to bring about a  more sustainable, governmentwide focus on results."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Strengthening Top Leadership Commitment to Creating and Sustaining Results-Oriented Cultures", "paragraphs": ["Successfully addressing the challenges that federal agencies face requires  leaders who are committed to achieving results, who recognize the  importance of using results-oriented goals and quantifiable measures, and  who integrate performance-based management into the culture and day-to- day activities of their organizations.  Top leadership must play a critical  role in creating and sustaining high-performing organizations.  Without the  clear and demonstrated commitment of agency top leadership\u2014both  political and career\u2014organizational cultures will not be transformed, and  new visions and ways of doing business will not take root.", "To be positioned to address the array of challenges faced by our national  government, federal agencies will need to transform their organizational  cultures so that they are more results oriented, customer-focused, and  collaborative.  Leading public organizations here in the United States and  abroad have found that strategic human capital management must be the  centerpiece of any serious change management initiative and efforts to  transform the cultures of government agencies.  Performance management  systems are integral to strategic human capital management.  Such systems  can be key tools to maximizing performance by aligning institutional  performance measures with individual performance and creating a \u201cline of  sight\u201d between individual and organizational goals.  Leading organizations  use their performance management systems as a key tool for aligning  institutional, unit, and employee performance; achieving results;  accelerating change; managing the organization day to day; and facilitating  communication throughout the year so that discussions about individual  and organizational performance are integrated and ongoing.", "Furthermore, achieving this cultural transformation requires people to  have the knowledge and skills to develop and use performance information  to improve program performance.  Our survey data indicated a significant  relationship between those managers who reported they received training  on setting performance goals and those who used performance information  when setting or revising performance goals.  However, federal agencies  have not consistently showed a commitment to investing in needed training  and development opportunities to help ensure that managers and  employees have the requisite skills and competencies to achieve agency  goals.", "The commitment to focusing on and using performance information needs  to extend to OMB and Congress as well.  Through the administration\u2019s PMA  and PART initiatives, OMB has clearly placed greater emphasis on  management issues over the past several years.  However, the focus of such  oversight needs to extend beyond the emphasis on formulating the  President\u2019s Budget to include an examination of the many challenges  agencies face that may be contributing to poor performance.  In spite of the  persistent weaknesses we found in agencies\u2019 strategic plans and annual  performance plans and reports, OMB significantly reduced the scope of its  guidance to agencies on how to prepare these documents.  By emphasizing  a focus on resource allocation through its PART exercise and providing less  information on how to comply with GPRA, OMB may be sending a message  to agencies that compliance with GPRA is not important.  Without strong  leadership from OMB, the foundation of performance information that has  been built could deteriorate.", "OMB leadership is critical to addressing the continuing challenges  presented in GPRA implementation and the transformation of the federal  government to an increasingly results-oriented culture.  OMB, as the  primary focal point for overall management in the federal government, can  provide the needed impetus by providing guidance, fostering  communication among agencies, and forming intragovernmental councils  and work groups tasked with identifying potential approaches and  solutions to overcoming the persistent challenges to results-oriented  management.", "Congress can also play a decisive role in fostering results-oriented cultures  in the federal government by using information on agency goals and results  at confirmation, oversight, authorization, and appropriation hearings.   Consistent congressional interest in the status of an agency\u2019s GPRA efforts,  performance measures, and uses of performance information to make  decisions, will send an unmistakable message to agencies that Congress  expects GPRA to be thoroughly implemented.", "We also found that timing issues may affect the development of agency  strategic plans that are meaningful and useful to top leadership.  The  commitment of top leadership within agencies, OMB, and Congress is  critical to the success of strategic planning efforts.  A strategic plan should  reflect the policy priorities of an organization\u2019s leaders and the input of key  stakeholders if it is to be an effective management tool.  However, GPRA  specifies time frames for updating strategic plans that do not correspond to  presidential or congressional terms.  As a result, an agency may be required  to update its strategic plan a year before a presidential election and without  input from a new Congress.  If a new president is elected, the updated plan  is essentially moot and agencies must spend additional time and effort  revising it to reflect new priorities.  Our focus group participants, including  GPRA experts, strongly agreed that this timing issue should be addressed  by adjusting time frames to correspond better with presidential and  congressional terms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Addressing Governmentwide Needs", "paragraphs": ["Mission fragmentation and program overlap are widespread throughout the  federal government.  We have noted that interagency coordination is  important for ensuring that crosscutting program efforts are mutually  reinforcing and efficiently implemented.  Our review of six agencies\u2019  strategic and annual performance plans along with our previous work on  crosscutting issues has demonstrated that agencies\u2019 still present their goals  and strategies in a mostly stovepiped manner.  They have generally not  used their plans to communicate the nature of their coordination with  other agencies, in terms of the development of common or complementary  goals and objectives or strategies jointly undertaken to achieve those goals.", "We have also reported that GPRA could provide a tool to reexamine federal  government roles and structures governmentwide.  GPRA requires the  President to include in his annual budget submission a federal government  performance plan.  Congress intended that this plan provide a \u201csingle  cohesive picture of the annual performance goals for the fiscal year.\u201d  The  governmentwide performance plan could help Congress and the executive  branch address critical federal performance and management issues,  including redundancy and other inefficiencies in how we do business.  It  could also provide a framework for any restructuring efforts.   Unfortunately, this provision has not been fully implemented.  Instead,  OMB has used the President\u2019s Budget to present high-level information  about agencies and certain program performance issues.  The agency-by- agency focus of the budget does not provide the integrated perspective of  government performance envisioned by GPRA.", "If the governmentwide performance plan were fully implemented, it could  provide a framework for such congressional oversight.  For example, in  recent years, OMB has begun to develop common measures for similar  programs, such as job training.  By focusing on broad goals and objectives,  oversight could more effectively cut across organization, program, and  other traditional boundaries.  Such oversight might also cut across existing  committee boundaries, which suggests that Congress may benefit from  using specialized mechanisms to perform oversight (i.e., joint hearings and  special committees).", "A strategic plan for the federal government, supported by key national  indicators to assess the government\u2019s performance, position, and progress,  could provide an additional tool for governmentwide reexamination of  existing programs, as well as proposals for new programs.  If fully  developed, a governmentwide strategic plan can potentially provide a  cohesive perspective on the long-term goals of the federal government and  provide a much needed basis for fully integrating, rather than merely  coordinating, a wide array of federal activities.  Successful strategic  planning requires the involvement of key stakeholders.  Thus, it could serve  as a mechanism for building consensus.  Further, it could provide a vehicle  for the President to articulate long-term goals and a road map for achieving  them.  In addition, a strategic plan can provide a more comprehensive  framework for considering organizational changes and making resource  decisions.", "Developing a strategic plan for the federal government would be an  important first step in articulating the role, goals, and objectives of the  federal government.  It could help provide critical horizontal and vertical  linkages.  Horizontally, it could integrate and foster synergies among  components of the federal government as well as help to clarify the role of  the federal government vis-\u00e0-vis other sectors of our society.  Vertically, it  could provide a framework of federal missions and goals within which  individual federal agencies could align their own missions and goals that  would cascade down to individual employees.  The development of a set of  key national indicators could be used as a basis to inform the development  of governmentwide strategic and annual performance plans.

Once the performance gaps  are identified for different program areas, managers can determine where  to target their resources to improve overall mission accomplishment.   When managers are forced to reduce their resources, the same analysis can  help them target reductions to keep to a minimum the impact on their  organization\u2019s overall mission.", "Under GPRA, agencies produce a single strategic plan, annual performance  plan, and annual performance report.  However, there are many potential  consumers of agencies\u2019 performance information\u2014Congress, the public,  and the agency itself.  One size need not fit all.  Clearly, an agency will need  more detailed information on its programs for operational purposes than  would be suitable for external audiences.  Of the six agencies\u2019 performance  reports we reviewed, some of them provided useful summary tables or  information that provided overall snapshots of performance or highlighted  progress in achieving key goals.  Other reports that lacked such a summary  made it difficult to assess the progress achieved.", "To improve the prospect that agency performance information will be  useful to and used by these different users, agencies need to consider the  different information needs and how to best tailor their performance  information to meet those needs.  For example, we have reported that,  although many information needs were met, congressional staff also  identified gaps in meeting their information needs.  Key to addressing  these information gaps was improving communication between  congressional staff and agency officials to help ensure that congressional  information needs are understood, and that, where feasible, arrangements  are made to meet them.  Improved two-way communication might also  make clear what information is and is not available, as well as what is  needed and what is not needed.  This might entail the preparation of  simplified and streamlined plans and reports for Congress and other  external users.", "Another challenge that limits the usefulness of agency performance reports  is the lack of timely data on performance.  For the six performance reports  we reviewed we continued to observe a significant number of goals for  which performance data were unavailable.  Policy decisions made when  designing federal programs, particularly intergovernmental programs, may  make it difficult to collect timely and consistent national data.

Performance measurement under GPRA is the ongoing monitoring and  reporting of program accomplishments, particularly progress toward  preestablished goals.  It tends to focus on regularly collected data on the  level and type of program activities, the direct products and services  delivered by the programs, and the results of those activities.  For programs  that have readily observable results or outcomes, performance  measurement may provide sufficient information to demonstrate program  results.  In some programs, however, outcomes are not quickly achieved or  readily observed, or their relationship to the program is uncertain.  In such  cases, more in-depth program evaluations may be needed, in addition to  performance measurement, to examine the extent to which a program is  achieving its objectives.", "Given the difficult measurement challenges we have identified, it is all the  more important that agency strategic planning efforts include the  identification of the most critical evaluations that need to take place to  address those challenges.  However, our previous work has raised concerns  about the capacity of federal agencies to produce evaluations of program  effectiveness.  Few of the agencies we reviewed deployed the rigorous  research methods required to attribute changes underlying outcomes to  program activities.  Yet we have also seen how some agencies have  profitably drawn on systematic program evaluations to improve their  measurement of program performance or understanding of performance  and how it might be improved.  Our review of six agencies\u2019 strategic plans  and performance reports in this report revealed weaknesses in their  discussions of program evaluation.  Most of the strategic plans lacked  critical information required by GPRA, such as a discussion of how  evaluations were used to establish strategic goals or a schedule of future  evaluations.  Furthermore, two of the six performance reports did not  summarize the results of program evaluations completed that year, as  required.", "Our work has also identified substantial, long-standing limitations in  agencies\u2019 abilities to produce credible data and identify performance  improvement opportunities that will not be quickly or easily resolved.
