GAO identified $14.7 million in payments in fiscal year 2010 that appeared to be inconsistent with four national policies and therefore improper.

The weaknesses include incomplete analysis of vulnerabilities to improper payment that could be addressed by edits; lack of specific time frames for implementing edits and other corrective actions; flaws in the structure of some edits; lack of centralization in the implementation of some edits, which leads to inconsistencies; incomplete assessment of whether edits are working as intended; and lack of full documentation of the processes. For example, GAO found that Medicare paid $8.6 million in fiscal year 2010 for claims that exceeded CMS's limits on the quantity of certain services that can be provided to a beneficiary by the same provider on a single date of service. Although edits had been implemented to limit service quantities, a weakness in their structure caused them to miss instances in which quantity limits were exceeded.", "CMS informs MACs about vulnerabilities that could be addressed through prepayment edits, but the agency does not systematically compile and disseminate information about effective local edits to address such vulnerabilities.

In January 2011, CMS expanded its oversight activities and began requiring MACs to report on how they had addressed certain vulnerabilities to improper payment, some of which could be addressed through edits.

To identify the need for an  NCCI edit, CMS\u2019s NCCI contractor reviews information from a variety of  sources, including MAC medical directors, publications of national health  care organizations, new laws and regulations, and annual changes in  procedure codes. In general, the NCCI contractor staff told us that they  propose a code-pair edit whenever they identify a procedure or item  where proper payment could be enhanced, irrespective of the size of the  potential vulnerability. However, CMS guidance indicates that the  magnitude of potential program vulnerability is one possible rationale for  setting an MUE at a particular level.", "CMS has procedures for deciding whether to implement an NCCI edit,  consistent with our risk assessment standard that calls for deciding on  appropriate corrective actions. To help CMS determine whether an NCCI  edit might be appropriate, the NCCI contractor reviews CMS policy,  standards of medical and surgical practice, current coding practice, and  provider billing patterns. The contractor then presents information on  proposed edits in regular meetings with senior-level CMS staff assigned  to NCCI workgroups, who then decide whether to implement proposed  edits. CMS generally provides a review and comment period before  implementing edits to allow for input from representative national  organizations that may be affected by the edits. CMS considers the  comments when it makes its final decision about implementing an edit,  but does not necessarily decide against an edit because of adverse  comments.", "CMS implements NCCI edits on a regular timeline, consistent with our  monitoring standard that calls for taking action within established time  frames. The NCCI contractor provides a file of new and revised edits to  CMS on a quarterly basis. The contractors then download this file from  CMS\u2019s Data Mover to integrate it into the claims payment systems.  Representatives of MACs we contacted said they receive the edit files in  a timely manner.", "CMS has procedures in place to determine whether NCCI edits are  operating as intended before applying the edits in processing claims.  Prior to submitting the edit files to CMS, the NCCI contractor performs a  series of quality control checks to ensure that the edits are operating  correctly. Representatives of the MACs we contacted said they also test  these edits to ensure they are operating correctly within the shared  systems.", "However, the MUE edits are not working to enforce the MUE limits  because of how they are structured. Thus, this monitoring step does not  meet our standard that calls for agencies to assess whether internal  controls are functioning properly. As noted above, MUEs are structured to  identify each claim line in which units of service exceed the MUE limit,  and do not identify excess units billed across multiple claim lines. As a  result, we identified about $8.2 million in Medicare payments in fiscal year  2010 for quantities of services that exceeded published MUE limits but  were not identified by MUEs because the excess amounts were billed  across multiple claim lines. The NCCI contractor recognized this  weakness in the MUEs and recently recommended to CMS that MUEs be  restructured so that they are applied against all claims reported for a  single date of service rather than against each line of a claim.", "Finally, the process for developing NCCI edits is adequately documented,  consistent with our control activities standard that calls for agencies to  develop written policies and procedures for their activities. CMS has  documented its processes for NCCI edits in a policy manual that explains  the rationale for these edits and how edit decisions are made.

CMS can decide  to address these vulnerabilities with prepayment edits or with other types  of corrective actions.", "To identify risks associated with vulnerabilities to improper payments,  CMS has designed a process that calls for analyzing several sources of  information, an approach consistent with our risk assessment standard  that calls for comprehensively identifying risks. CMS staff analyze  available data\u2014such as CERT data and data on improper payments  identified by RACs and other CMS contractors\u2014in order to identify  potential vulnerabilities and determine whether they are actual  vulnerabilities. CMS staff then assess the risks posed by these  vulnerabilities and prioritize them for corrective action based on five  criteria: (1) the associated CERT error rate; (2) whether the vulnerability  has been identified by RACs as a \u201cmajor finding,\u201d meaning a vulnerability  for which more than $500,000 was identified for recoupment; (3) overall  financial effect; (4) geographic effect and scope; and (5) political and  media sensitivity.", "Although the application of criteria to prioritize vulnerabilities is a strength  of CMS\u2019s process, we found a weakness in how CMS analyzes RAC data  to identify vulnerabilities to prioritize for correction through edits or other  actions. When setting the threshold to determine whether a RAC- identified vulnerability should be considered a major finding, CMS  considers only the amount identified by each RAC and does not  aggregate the amounts across all RACs that have identified similar  vulnerabilities and may not consider thoroughly the potential national  scope of vulnerabilities that one or two RACs are pursuing. CMS officials  told us they do not routinely review information on RAC-identified  vulnerabilities under the $500,000 threshold. As a result, CMS can leave  vulnerabilities unaddressed, some of which could be addressed with  prepayment edits. For example, as of December 2011, the four RACs had  identified a total of about $503,000 in improper payments for claims for  the services of clinical social workers provided during inpatient stays.  Because this amount was not identified by a single RAC, this would not  meet the definition of a major finding. CMS also does not take into  account the period over which the RACs identified the improper  payments.", "CMS has designed procedures for determining what actions will be taken  to address vulnerabilities, including prepayment edits, which is consistent  with our risk assessment standard that calls for deciding on appropriate  corrective actions to address risks. The agency has assembled a  Corrective Action Development Team, which meets weekly to review  analyses on prioritized vulnerabilities and to propose corrective actions to  leadership in the CMS Provider Compliance Group, which is responsible  for vulnerability tracking. The Provider Compliance Group can develop  edits or take other corrective actions such as publishing provider  education articles, referring vulnerabilities to other CMS components, or referring vulnerabilities to the MACs to be addressed at the local level.CMS officials in the Provider Compliance Group told us they had  developed at least three edits as part of the Vulnerability Tracking  process to address identified vulnerabilities, and were in the process of  developing edits to address at least 10 other vulnerabilities identified by  the RACs.", "CMS has not specified time frames for implementing all corrective  actions, contrary to our monitoring standard that calls for taking corrective  action within established time frames. CMS officials explained that they  have not done so because the time involved can vary from a few days to  several months, depending on the work involved in determining and  implementing the appropriate action. For example, CMS officials told us  that staff may conduct research to determine whether local and national  edits have already been implemented to address the vulnerability in  question. But CMS has not established planned time frames for  addressing each vulnerability once the agency has determined the type of  corrective action needed.

With respect to other types of  corrective actions, CMS officials told us they gathered and analyzed data  to assess two corrective actions to see if the actions were having the  intended effects and have plans to conduct similar data analyses to  assess others 18 to 24 months after implementation, when their effects  will be more evident. However, CMS officials said they do not have the  resources to monitor the results of all edits or other corrective actions  themselves and that, depending on the risk to the program, the agency  may rely on information from other entities, such as reports from RACs,  the CERT contractor, or the HHS OIG. While information from these  entities can be useful, our standard on monitoring calls for routine  monitoring that assesses the effectiveness of control activities, which  CMS managers told us they are not doing.

However, for some edits, CMS has assigned responsibility to  MACs to independently program and integrate the edits into the shared  systems. CMS officials told us that they have sometimes assigned  responsibility to MACs because there is a queue for implementing system  changes at the national level, and in some cases MACs can implement  edits more quickly. CMS officials acknowledged that having multiple  MACs program some edits based on NCDs may have led to inconsistent  implementation of national coverage policy.

Other data CMS makes available include the Part B National  Summary Data file, which MACs can use to compare the utilization rates  of providers in their jurisdiction to national rates, to detect potentially  aberrant billing patterns.

CMS could do more to ensure that edits  based on NCDs are implemented consistently, such as centralizing the  process within the agency rather than leaving it up to MACs. Greater  attention to developing centralized NCD edits whenever possible could  reduce improper payments. CMS could also do more to ensure that its  edits are structured to enforce the national policies on which they are  based. Our findings show that CMS has paid for quantities of service in  excess of its policies for what would ordinarily be provided to a  beneficiary on a single day, because MUEs allow payment for excessive  quantities of services if those quantities are spread over multiple claim  lines or multiple claims, even if explanatory modifiers are not included.  Although CMS has made progress in cataloging and assessing  vulnerabilities in a structured way, it could do more to improve some of its  analysis and documentation. Specifically, the agency could improve how  it prioritizes vulnerabilities identified by RACs in their postpayment  reviews by compiling the information on these vulnerabilities differently\u2014 for example, by aggregating the overpayments identified by all the RACs  for a given vulnerability, rather than considering each RAC\u2019s findings in  isolation. CMS could further strengthen its Vulnerability Tracking process  and edits based on NCDs by developing written procedures for steps  where such documentation is currently lacking.

Currently, CMS lacks the information needed to assess  how effectively MACs are employing prepayment edits, even in  comparison with other MACs. The agency has taken steps to improve the  information it collects about edits by setting new reporting standards and  pursuing a possible replacement for the PIMR database. Until a new  database is in place, CMS could facilitate an information exchange about  edits among MACs through some of its usual channels. Each MAC would  need to consider local circumstances in deciding whether to implement  LCDs and related edits similar to those used by another MAC.  Nevertheless, systematic exchanges of information about policies and  edits that have proved particularly effective in some jurisdictions would  highlight for MACs additional ways to help ensure that Medicare pays  only for reasonable and necessary services. CMS has recently begun  encouraging MACs to address certain vulnerabilities by requiring them to  report on what actions, if any, they have taken. This has led to MACs  reporting on or implementing edits. CMS could also consider encouraging  MACs to implement prepayment edits by increasing the financial  incentives for them to do so.

We obtained PIMR data reports from CMS for fiscal year 2010 that  contained information about the savings associated with prepayment  edits for each claims administration contractor.

We selected components  of policies that could be implemented using automated edits because  automated edits are less costly for MACs to use than manual edits. For  national policies, we identified paid claims that appeared to be  inconsistent with the policy in all MAC jurisdictions. For local policies, we  identified paid claims that were inconsistent with the policy in all MAC  jurisdictions except the jurisdiction that implemented the coverage policy  and associated edit that we selected for analysis.", "We excluded MACs in jurisdictions where the contract was up for recompetition to avoid  including in our sample MACs that might lose their contracts before we completed data  collection.", "2009 and 2010 that generated the most savings to the Medicare program,  and to provide information about the savings generated by each of those  edits and about the LCDs or other local policies on which these edits  were based. We chose to analyze LCDs for monitored anesthesia care,  parathormone, and noninvasive cerebrovascular studies because (1) they  were feasible to analyze using data elements in the Carrier and  Outpatient SAFs, (2) fewer than half of the other A/B MACs operating at  the start of fiscal year 2010 had implemented a similar LCD, and (3) the  edits based on these LCDs had generated a relatively high amount of  overall savings. Our analysis of this selected sample of policies and  associated edits was intended to allow us to illustrate whether greater  savings to the Medicare program could be achieved if effective  prepayment edits\u2014and, in some cases, the underlying LCDs\u2014were  implemented more widely. Our sample is not an exhaustive list of every  policy that could be implemented more fully through additional edits.", "We took steps to confirm that we understood the policies and that our  analytic approach was appropriate. To confirm our understanding of  Medically Unlikely Edits (MUE), we discussed our analytic approach with  the contractor that creates MUEs and reviewed CMS documentation  about MUEs. To confirm our understanding of other national policies, we  discussed them with CMS. We discussed the selected LCDs with the  MACs that issued them to ensure that our interpretation of the LCDs was  accurate. To further test the validity of our analyses based on LCDs, we  compared the payments in the jurisdiction of the MAC that had  implemented the LCD to payments in other MAC jurisdictions. For each of  our analyses based on LCDs, we found the lowest amount of payments in  the jurisdiction of the MAC whose LCD we used as the basis for analysis,  which was consistent with our expectation.", "Because providers may appeal claims denials based on an LCD, some payments  inconsistent with the LCD could occur.", "MAC jurisdiction, and at the national level.

For our analysis of MUEs, we excluded claims that contained modifiers,  which are used by providers to indicate potentially legitimate reasons why  certain procedures were performed. For the MUE analysis, we also  excluded claims data that appeared multiple times in the SAF. We  identified these multiple entries by identifying claim lines that matched on  certain key variables\u2014including the same beneficiary identification  number, procedure, date of service, and provider.

We compared these process descriptions to our internal control standards  to assess whether CMS has designed adequate processes. We focused  our assessment primarily on the design of these processes and did not  attempt to fully assess whether the processes were operating as  intended.
