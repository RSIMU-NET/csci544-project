Bitcoin and similar virtual currency systems operate over the Internet and use computer protocols and encryption to conduct and verify transactions. While these virtual currency systems offer some benefits, they also pose risks. For example, they have been associated with illicit activity and security breaches, raising possible regulatory, law enforcement, and consumer protection issues.

Consequently, law enforcement agencies investigating and prosecuting crimes that involve virtual currencies may have to rely upon cooperation from international partners who may operate under different regulatory and legal regimes.", "The emergence of virtual currencies has raised a number of consumer and investor protection issues. These include the reported loss of consumer funds maintained by bitcoin exchanges, volatility in bitcoin prices, and the development of virtual-currency-based investment products. For example, in February 2014, a Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange called Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy after reporting that it had lost more than $460 million.", "Federal financial regulatory and law enforcement agencies have taken a number of actions regarding virtual currencies. In March 2013, the Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued guidance that clarified which participants in virtual currency systems are subject to anti-money-laundering requirements and required virtual currency exchanges to register with FinCEN. Additionally, financial regulators have taken some actions regarding anti-money-laundering compliance and investor protection. For example, in July 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged an individual and his company with defrauding investors through a bitcoin-based investment scheme. Further, law enforcement agencies have taken actions against parties alleged to have used virtual currencies to facilitate money laundering or other crimes. For example, in October 2013, multiple agencies worked together to shut down Silk Road, an online marketplace where users paid for illegal goods and services with bitcoins.", "Federal agencies also have begun to collaborate on virtual currency issues through informal discussions and interagency working groups primarily concerned with money laundering and other law enforcement matters. However, these working groups have not focused on emerging consumer protection issues, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)\u2014whose responsibilities include providing consumers with information to make responsible decisions about financial transactions\u2014has generally not participated in these groups. Therefore, interagency efforts related to virtual currencies may not be consistent with key practices that can benefit interagency collaboration, such as including all relevant participants to ensure they contribute to the outcomes of the effort.

While there is no statutory definition for  virtual currency, the term refers to a digital representation of value that is  not government-issued legal tender. Unlike U.S. dollars and other  government-issued currencies, virtual currencies do not necessarily have  a physical coin or bill associated with their circulation. While virtual  currencies can function as a unit of account, store of value, and medium  of exchange, they are not widely used or accepted. Some virtual  currencies can only be used within virtual economies (for example, within  online role-playing games) and may not be readily exchanged for  government-issued currencies such as U.S. dollars, euro, or yen. Other  virtual currencies may be used to purchase goods and services in the real  economy and can be converted into government-issued currencies  through virtual currency exchanges. In previous work, we described the  latter type of virtual currencies as \u201copen flow.\u201d Open-flow virtual  currencies have received considerable attention from federal financial  regulatory and law enforcement agencies, in part because these  currencies interact with the real economy and because depository  institutions (for example, banks and credit unions) may have business  relationships with companies that exchange virtual currencies for  government-issued currencies. Throughout the remainder of this report,  we use the term virtual currencies to mean open-flow virtual currencies,  unless otherwise stated.", "Virtual currency systems, which include protocols for conducting  transactions in addition to digital representations of value, can either be  centralized or decentralized. Centralized virtual currency systems have a  single administering authority that issues the currency and has the  authority to withdraw the currency from circulation. In addition, the  administrating authority issues rules for use of the currency and maintains  a central payment ledger. In contrast, decentralized virtual currency  systems have no central administering authority. Validation and  certification of transactions are performed by users of the system and  therefore do not require a third party to perform intermediation activities.", "A prominent example of a decentralized virtual currency system is bitcoin.  Bitcoin was developed in 2009 by an unidentified programmer or  programmers using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. According to industry  stakeholders, bitcoin is the most widely circulated decentralized virtual  currency. The bitcoin computer protocol permits the storage of unique  digital representations of value (bitcoins) and facilitates the assignment of  bitcoins from one user to another through a peer-to-peer, Internet-based  network. Each bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places, enabling their  use in any kind of transaction regardless of the value. Users\u2019 bitcoin  balances are associated with bitcoin addresses (long strings of numbers  and letters) that use principles of cryptography to help safeguard against  inappropriate tampering with bitcoin transactions and balances. When  users transfer bitcoins, the recipient provides their bitcoin address to the  sender, and the sender authorizes the transaction with their private key  (essentially a secret code that proves the sender\u2019s control over their  bitcoin address). Bitcoin transactions are irrevocable and do not require  the sender or receiver to disclose their identities to each other or a third  party. However, each transaction is registered in a public ledger called  the \u201cblockchain,\u201d which maintains the associated bitcoin addresses and  transaction dates, times, and amounts. Users can define how much  additional information they require of each other to conduct a transaction.", "According to industry observers, examples of technologies used to increase the privacy  of participants in virtual currency transactions include (1) anonymizing networks, which  use a distributed network of computers to conceal the real Internet address of users, such  as The Onion Router (TOR); (2) \u201ctumblers\u201d such as BitcoinBath and BitLaundry that  combine payments from multiple users to obstruct identification through the blockchain;  and (3) alternative virtual currencies such as Zerocoin and Anoncoin that aim to make  transactions fully anonymous. the identities of participants in bitcoin transactions. In addition,  researchers have developed methods to determine identities of parties  involved in some bitcoin transactions by analyzing clusters of transactions  between specific addresses.", "By design, there will be a maximum of 21 million bitcoins in circulation once all bitcoins  have been mined, which is projected to occur in the year 2140. Once all bitcoins have  been mined, miners will be rewarded for solving the math problems that verify the validity  of bitcoin transactions through fees rather than bitcoins. directly or use third-party payment processors that take payments in  bitcoins from buyers and provide businesses the payments in the form of  a traditional currency or a combination of bitcoins and traditional currency.

For example, dozens of decentralized virtual  currencies are based on the bitcoin protocol such as Litecoin, Auroracoin,  Peercoin, and Dogecoin. Similar to the bitcoin market, the size of the  market for these virtual currencies is unclear. However, as of March 31,  2014, the total reported value of each of these currencies was less than  $400 million (ranging from about $33 million for Dogecoin to about $346  million for Litecoin). Other virtual currencies that have been created are  not based on the bitcoin protocol. One of the more prominent examples is  XRP, which is used within a decentralized payment system called Ripple.  Ripple allows users to make peer-to-peer transfers in any currency. A key  function of XRP is to facilitate the conversion from one currency to  another. For example, if a direct conversion between Mexican pesos and  Thai baht is not available, the pesos can be exchanged for XRP, and then  the XRP for baht. As of March 31, 2014, the total value of XRP was $878  million.", "Virtual currencies have drawn attention from federal agencies with  responsibilities for protecting the U.S. financial system and its participants  and investigating financial crimes.

Because virtual currencies can be accessed anywhere over  the Internet, they are a potential way to provide basic financial  services to populations without access to traditional financial  institutions, such as rural populations in developing countries.However, the potential benefit hinges on access to the Internet, which  these populations may not have, and may be offset by the lack of  protections against losses noted previously.", "Federal agency officials have acknowledged the need to consider both  the risks and benefits of virtual currencies in carrying out their  responsibilities.

Similarly, the former Acting Assistant  Attorney General for DOJ\u2019s Criminal Division has testified that law  enforcement needs to be vigilant about the criminal misuse of virtual  currency systems while recognizing that there are many legitimate users  of those services.
