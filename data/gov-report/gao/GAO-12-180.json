In addition, DOD and the Coast Guard have established a working group to identify potential collaborative efforts to enhance U.S. Arctic capabilities. This working group is focused on identifying potential near-term investments but not longer-term needs, and it is currently expected to be dissolved in January 2012. Uncertainty involving the rate of Arctic climate change necessitates careful planning to ensure efficient use of resources in developing Arctic needs such as basing infrastructure and icebreakers, which require long lead times to develop and are expensive to build and maintain.

However,  DOD\u2019s response did not address how it would develop a risk-based  investment strategy. As stated in our report, DOD has considered some  elements of such a risk-based investment strategy by setting strategic  goals and objectives, determining constraints, and assessing risks (such  as Northern Command\u2019s inclusion of two Arctic-specific capability needs  in its fiscal years 2013 through 2017 integrated priority list). However,  DOD has not yet conducted the remaining three phases of a risk-based  investment strategy: evaluating alternatives for addressing these risks,  selecting the appropriate alternatives, and implementing the alternatives  and monitoring the progress made and results achieved. We believe that  considering potential alternative solutions, such as leveraging the  capabilities of interagency or international partners, could help minimize  DOD\u2019s investment in Arctic capabilities. DOD\u2019s Arctic Report also  emphasized the need for a risk-based investment strategy, noting that  \u201cthe long lead time associated with capability development, particularly  the procurement of space-based assets and ships, requires a deliberate  risk-based investment strategy\u201d and noted that \u201cadditional capability  analysis will be required.\u201d By developing a risk-based investment strategy  to prioritize near-term investment needs and a timeline for addressing  them, DOD can be better prepared in its planning and budgeting  decisions.", "With respect to our second recommendation, both DOD and DHS cited  the importance of collaboration to develop Arctic capabilities and  identified some existing forums that include Arctic issues, such as the  annual Navy and Coast Guard staff talks and the joint DOD-DHS  Capabilities Development Working Group.

Specifically, the report states that DOD reviewed national-level policy  guidance and concluded that the overarching strategic national security  objective for the Arctic is a stable and secure region where U.S. national  interests are safeguarded and the U.S. homeland is protected (see fig. 4  for descriptions of the policy guidance documents DOD reviewed). The  report further identifies two DOD strategic objectives to achieve the  desired end-state for the Arctic: (1) prevent and deter conflict and (2)  prepare to respond to a wide range of challenges and contingencies. In  addition, the report identifies and examines restrictions in the Arctic. For  example, the report states that uncertainty about the extent, impact, and  rate of climate change in the Arctic will make it challenging to plan for  possible future conditions in the region and to mobilize public or political  support for investments in U.S. Arctic capabilities or infrastructure.", "Related Findings from Previous GAO Reports  In 2010, we reported on the difficulties associated with developing  capabilities needed to understand the extent, rate, and impact of climate  change. Specifically, we found that while agencies have taken steps to plan  for some continued climate observations via satellite data in the near-term,  they lack a strategy for the long-term provision of such data. For example,  we reported that DOD has not established plans to restore the full set of  capabilities intended for the National Polar-orbiting Operational  Environmental Satellite System over the life of the program. We noted that  without a comprehensive long-term strategy for continuing environmental  measurements over the coming decades and a means for implementing it,  agencies will continue to independently pursue their immediate priorities on  an ad-hoc basis, the economic benefits of a coordinated approach to  investments in earth observation may be lost, and our nation\u2019s ability to  understand climate change may be limited."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Extent to which DOD\u2019s Arctic Report Addressed Specified Reporting Elements", "paragraphs": ["Reporting Requirement  H.

This report is  to include, among other things, an  assessment on mission capabilities  required to support the strategic  national security objectives and a  timeline to obtain such capabilities.", "Our Assessment:        Partially Addressed  Based on our assessment, we  determined that DOD partially  addressed this reporting element.", "Detailed Assessment of This Element  We determined that DOD partially addressed this element because the  Arctic Report includes a capability gap assessment in relation to Arctic  mission areas but does not provide a timeline to obtain such capabilities.  Specifically, the report identifies potential Arctic capability gaps over the  near- (2010-2020), mid- (2020-2030), and far-term (beyond 2030) that  may affect DOD\u2019s ability to accomplish four of nine mission areas in the  region, including maritime domain awareness, maritime security, search  and rescue, and sea control. The report notes that three capability gaps  in particular have the potential to hamper Arctic operations across all  time frames: (1) insufficient communications architecture, (2) degraded  Global Positioning System performance, and (3) extremely limited  domain awareness. Other key challenges identified include: shortfalls in  ice and weather reporting and forecasting; limitations in command,  control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and  reconnaissance; and limited shore-based infrastructure and inventory of  ice-capable vessels. Although DOD states in the report that capabilities  will need to be reassessed as conditions change and gaps addressed in  order to be prepared to operate in a more accessible Arctic, it does not  provide a timeline for addressing capability gaps or challenges identified.   Related Findings from Previous GAO Reports  We previously reported on the challenges DOD and Coast Guard face in  achieving maritime domain awareness, a capability gap identified in  DOD\u2019s Arctic Report. For example, in 2011 we found that DOD lacks a  strategic, risk-based approach to manage its maritime domain awareness  efforts and to address high priority capability gaps. To improve DOD\u2019s  ability to manage the implementation of maritime domain awareness  across DOD, we recommended that DOD develop and implement a  departmentwide strategy that: identifies objectives and roles and  responsibilities for achieving maritime domain awareness; aligns efforts  and objectives with DOD\u2019s process for determining requirements and  allocating resources; identifies capability resourcing responsibilities; and  includes performance measures. We also recommended that DOD, in  collaboration with other stakeholders such as the Coast Guard, perform a  comprehensive risk-based analysis to prioritize and address DOD\u2019s  critical maritime capability gaps and guide future investments. DOD  concurred with our recommendations and identified actions it is taking\u2014 or plans to take\u2014to address them. We also reported in 2010 that the  Coast Guard faces challenges in achieving Arctic domain awareness,  including inadequate Arctic Ocean and weather data, lack of  communication infrastructure, limited intelligence information, and lack of  a physical presence in the Arctic.minimal assets and infrastructure for Arctic missions and diminishing fleet  expertise for operating in Arctic-type conditions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Extent to which DOD\u2019s Arctic Report Addressed Specified Reporting Elements", "paragraphs": ["Reporting Requirement  H.

The April 2011 Unified Command  Plan shifted areas of responsibility boundaries in the Arctic region. As a  result of this realignment, responsibility for the Arctic region is now  shared between U.S. Northern and U.S. European Commands\u2014 previously, under the 2008 Unified Command Plan, the two commands  and U.S. Pacific Command shared responsibility for the region, as shown  in figure 5. In addition, the April 2011 Unified Command Plan assigned  Northern Command responsibility for advocating for Arctic capabilities.  The Arctic Report states that having two combatant commands  responsible for a portion of the Arctic Ocean aligned with adjacent land  boundaries is an arrangement best suited to achieve continuity of effort  with key regional partners and that aligning the entire Arctic Ocean under  a single combatant command would disrupt progress in theater security  cooperation achieved over decades of dialogue and confidence building  by Northern and European Commands with regional stakeholders. The  report also notes that although having multiple combatant commands  with responsibility in the Arctic Ocean makes coordination more  challenging, having too few would leave out key stakeholders, diminish  long-standing relationships, and potentially alienate important partners.", "Detailed Assessment of This Element  We determined that DOD addressed this element because the Arctic  Report assesses the existing Arctic infrastructure to be adequate to meet  near- (2010-2020) to mid-term (2020-2030) U.S. national security needs,  noting that DOD does not currently anticipate a need for the construction  of additional bases or a deep-draft port in Alaska before 2020.  Specifically, the Arctic Report examines the defense infrastructure such  as bases, ports, and airfields needed to support DOD strategic objectives  for the Arctic, and it discusses the environmental challenges and higher  costs associated with construction and maintenance of Arctic  infrastructure. It concludes that with the low potential for armed conflict in  the region, existing DOD posture is adequate to meet U.S. defense  needs through 2030. In addition, the report states that DOD does not  currently anticipate a need for the construction of a deep-draft port in  Alaska before 2020. The report does not address the basing  infrastructure required to support long-term U.S. national security needs.  The report notes that given the long lead times for construction of major  infrastructure in the region, DOD will periodically reevaluate this  assessment as activity in the region gradually increases and the  combatant commanders update their regional plans on a regular basis.  The report also states that one area for future assessment might be the  need for a co-located airport and port facility suitable for deployment of  undersea search and rescue assets but does not provide a timeline for  completing such an assessment.   Related Findings from Previous GAO Reports  Our prior work has identified the high costs associated with operating and  maintaining installations outside the contiguous United States. In  February 2011, we reported that DOD\u2019s posture-planning guidance does  not require the combatant commands to compile and report  comprehensive cost data associated with posture requirements or to  analyze the costs and benefits of posture alternatives when considering  changes to posture.posture-planning process will continue to lack critical information that  could be used by decision makers as they deliberate posture  requirements and potential opportunities to obtain greater cost  efficiencies may not be identified. We recommended that DOD revise its  posture-planning guidance to require combatant commands to include  the costs associated with initiatives that would alter future posture, and  that DOD provide guidance on how the combatant commands should  analyze the costs and benefits of alternative courses of action when  considering proposed changes to posture. DOD agreed with our  recommendations and identified corrective actions, but additional steps  are needed to fully address the recommendations. These findings  underscore the importance of DOD and Northern Command identifying  and analyzing the costs and benefits of alternative courses of action  associated with future defense posture in the Arctic."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Extent to which DOD\u2019s Arctic Report Addressed Specified Reporting Elements", "paragraphs": ["Reporting Requirement  H.
