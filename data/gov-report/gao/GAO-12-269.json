About 20,000 CBP officers play a central role in ensuring that CBP accomplishes its mission of securing the border while also facilitating the movement of millions of legitimate travelers and billions of dollars in international trade. GAO was asked to assess the extent to which CBP has (1) revised its training program for newly hired CBP officers in accordance with training standards and (2) identified and addressed the training needs of incumbent CBP officers. GAO analyzed data and documentation related to the agency\u0092s training efforts, such as its covert test program and its training records. GAO also interviewed CBP officials and CBP officers.

As a result, the new curriculum was designed to produce a professional law enforcement officer capable of protecting the homeland from terrorist, criminal, biological and agricultural threats. In addition, the curriculum stated that the CBP officer is to draw conclusions and take appropriate action to identify behavioral indicators displayed by criminals, effectively interview travelers to identify potential threats, identify fraudulent documents, and use technology in support of the inspection process.", "CBP has taken some steps to identify and address the training needs of its incumbent CBP officers, but could do more to ensure that these officers are fully trained. GAO examined CBP\u0092s results of covert tests conducted over more than 2 years and found significant weaknesses in the CBP inspection process at the ports of entry that were tested. In response to these tests, CBP developed a \u0093Back to Basics\u0094 course in March 2010 for incumbent officers but has no plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the training. Moreover, CBP has not conducted an analysis of all the possible causes or systemic issues that may be contributing to the test results. Further evaluation of the training and causes underlying covert test results could help inform CBP about whether the training is sufficient to address the weaknesses identified by the covert tests or if adjustments are needed. In addition, CBP offices are responsible for recording their employees\u0092 training records; however, CBP does not have a policy that assigns responsibility to port management to ensure that their staff enter data into its training records system completely and accurately. A policy outlining the roles and responsibilities of offices and positions for training could help clarify which offices and positions are responsible for identifying and addressing training needs and for holding these offices accountable for their responsibilities. Moreover, CBP currently does not have reliable training completion records to ensure CBP officers received required training or other training relevant to their assigned duties. Based on GAO\u0092s analysis of training records, more than 4,000 customs officers have not completed the immigration fundamentals, immigration law, and agricultural fundamentals courses, although they were required to complete them during a cross-training program. According to CBP, the training completion records are incomplete, and it is unlikely that the officers did not complete the required cross-training. Nevertheless, without reliable training records; CBP cannot provide reasonable assurance that all customs officers completed the required cross-training. Further, CBP has not conducted a needs assessment that would identify any gaps between identified critical skills and incumbent officers\u0092 current skills and competencies. A needs assessment could enhance CBP\u0092s ability to ensure its workforce is training to meet its mission."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To improve CBP training efforts, GAO recommends that the CBP Commissioner evaluate the \u0093Back to Basics\u0094 training course; analyze covert test results; establish a policy for training responsibilities, including oversight of training records; and, conduct a training needs assessment.

CBP officers, who number about 20,000, play a central role in carrying  out this responsibility. A highly trained CBP officer corps is critical to  ensure that CBP accomplishes its dual mission of securing the border by  refusing attempted illegal entry to the United States and facilitating the  cross-border movement of millions of legitimate travelers and billions of  dollars in international trade. Since the creation of the CBP officer position  in 2003 and the subsequent development of the original CBP officer basic  training curriculum, the role of the CBP officer has involved increased  emphasis on countering threats posed by terrorists and others attempting  to fraudulently enter the country with altered or genuine travel  documents. As a result, CBP has revised its training to reinforce the law  enforcement mindset within the CBP officer.", "In 2007, we reported on vulnerabilities and inefficiencies in traveler  inspections, including challenges ports of entry faced in delivering  required training to CBP officers.  Specifically, we reported that CBP did not know the extent to which legacy officers had received required cross- training and whether newly hired officers were fully proficient in their  required duties. Therefore, we recommended that the agency develop  data on cross-training to determine whether the officers received the  required training. We also recommended that the agency incorporate  specific tasks into the on-the-job training program for newly hired officers  and measure officer proficiency in performing those tasks. CBP generally  agreed with our recommendations and we discuss actions it has taken in  response to these recommendations later in this report.", "In this context, you asked us to assess the extent to which CBP has       (1) revised its training program for newly hired CBP officers in accordance  with its training standards since the launch of the curriculum in 2004 and  (2) identified and addressed the training needs among incumbent CBP  officers.", "This report is a public version of the prior sensitive report that we  provided to you.

We obtained  and reviewed relevant data from CBP\u2019s Training Records and Enrollment  Network (TRAEN) for the period 2004 through 2011, as well as  supplemental data from OTD. We assessed the reliability of the TRAEN  data by (1) interviewing knowledgeable officials about how training  completion is documented, and how the completions are entered in  TRAEN; (2) reviewing relevant documentation; and, (3) comparing  TRAEN records to training completion records we obtained directly from  select field offices. We determined the TRAEN data were not sufficiently  reliable to demonstrate CBP officer training completion and training  needs, as discussed later in this report. Further, we interviewed OFO and  OTD officials on CBP efforts to address any identified training needs and  compared these efforts with OTD training standards. To assess CBP  policies for tracking, overseeing, and evaluating incumbent officer  training, we interviewed officials at the OFO Training branch, the Office of  Field Programs, the Office of Passenger Admissibility, and Passenger  Programs, including the Fraudulent Document Analysis Unit (FDAU) and  the Enforcement Policy office.", "We also visited three ports of entry\u2014John F.

In the  primary inspection area, CBP officers are expected to rapidly analyze  passenger admissibility by sufficiently questioning the passenger,  examining the passenger\u2019s travel documents, and using appropriate  technology to identify those passengers that can be immediately admitted  into the United States or need to be referred to a secondary inspection  area for a more thorough inspection, if necessary. Specifically, CBP  officers in the primary inspection area are expected to first examine travel  documents by comparing the document to the passenger and then ask  questions to confirm the identity of the traveler. They also may inspect  travelers\u2019 luggage. CBP officers who serve in the secondary inspection  area conduct closer inspection of travel documents and possessions and  can use multiple law enforcement databases to verify the traveler\u2019s  identity, background, and purpose for entering the country. CBP officers  may also serve in specialized teams to support the inspection functions at  the ports of entry.

OTD, as well as other federal law  enforcement training standards, state that programs should first identify  the critical tasks that the individual is expected to perform in order to  determine what training is needed. Consistent with these standards, OTD  convened a team of subject matter experts (SMEs) to identify and rank  the tasks that new CBP officers are expected to perform. The team  identified a total of 138 critical tasks that newly hired CBP officers are  expected to perform within the first 2 years of employment. These  included conducting thorough and accurate research to support  inspections and investigations, and preparing thorough and accurate  reports covering significant incidents and intelligence. Once the tasks  were identified, the panel of SMEs compared the identified tasks to the  tasks addressed in the existing curriculum to identify any skill gaps. OTD  then developed specific courses with appropriate lessons and topics to  ensure that these tasks were addressed in the new curriculum. For  example, new modules on evidence preservation and secondary report  writing were incorporated in the revised curriculum to address identified  officer skill gaps in handling evidence and writing. Consistent with the  OTD standard that requires a test run of a complete and approved course  in a controlled environment by selected individuals representing the  course\u2019s learning audience, the new CBP officer curriculum was piloted to  test its content and delivery prior to its launch in February 2011. As a  result, the new officer training program course was expanded from about  15 to 18 weeks and approximately 30 to 35 percent of the new officer  curriculum is new or updated and expanded.

In addition, internal control standards state, in a good control  environment, areas of authority and responsibility are clearly defined and  appropriate lines of reporting are established. Internal control standards  also require that responsibilities be communicated within an organization.  According to OFO, the OFO Programs and Policy branch is responsible  for overseeing and coordinating the development of policy to govern  incumbent officer training, including policy that assigns roles and  responsibilities. According to the OFO officials, a policy would be useful  because it helps clearly define the responsibilities of all offices involved in  incumbent CBP officer training. Specifically, a policy outlining the roles  and responsibilities of offices and positions for training would help clarify  which offices and positions are responsible for ensuring incumbent officer  training needs are identified and addressed. However, the acting branch  chief of the OFO Programs and Policy branch stated staffing constraints  have limited the branch\u2019s ability to initiate the process of developing a  policy that clearly assigns responsibility for all offices involved in CBP  officer training. According to OFO officials, supervisors are responsible for  identifying officer training needs and requesting training to meet these  needs. For example, in June 2011, CBP instructed supervisors to identify  training needs and use the post academy modules to address those  needs.", "However, OFO could not provide a policy document outlining how  supervisors would identify training needs and coordinate training. Also,  according to the OFO officials, port management and field office directors  are responsible for ensuring that CBP officers complete mandatory and  other training related to their job duties. However, OFO officials in  headquarters and at the ports stated that no policy exists that assigns  these responsibilities to port management or field offices. In addition,  senior CBP officials stated that Field Training Officers help ensure that  CBP officers are receiving the training they need to perform their  assigned duties, and that internal measures are in place to assess  training needs and accomplishments nationwide. However, officials from  the OFO Training branch stated that Field Training Officers are assigned  to help deliver training to the ports but are not required to oversee the  completion of required training by CBP officers at their respective ports.  Further, OFO could not provide documentation confirming the roles and  responsibilities of the Field Training Officer. A policy outlining the roles  and responsibilities of offices and positions for training could help  eliminate such confusion and clarify which offices and positions are  responsible for identifying and addressing training needs and for holding  these offices and individuals accountable for their responsibilities.", "CBP currently lacks reliable training completion records to ensure CBP  officers received required training or other training relevant to their  assigned duties. According to OTD and OFO officials, the training  completion records maintained in TRAEN, CBP\u2019s official record of  training, are incomplete or contain inaccurate information, such as the  dates of training completion. As a result, officials from OTD\u2019s Office of  Operations, which plans and manages the annual National Training Plan  (NTP) budget, stated they developed their own records of training  completions that consist of TRAEN records supplemented with data they  gather from e-mail archives. Also, officials from two of the three ports we  visited stated they rely on locally developed databases or data sources  other than TRAEN to track CBP officers\u2019 training records.", "We found, based on our analysis of TRAEN records, more than 4,000  onboard legacy customs officers have not completed the immigration  fundamentals, immigration law, and agricultural fundamentals courses  although they were required to complete them during the cross-training  program. According to OFO officials, the training completion records  maintained in TRAEN are incomplete, and it is unlikely that legacy officers  did not complete required cross-training. Nevertheless, without reliable  training records, CBP cannot provide reasonable assurance that all  legacy customs officers completed required cross-training courses. OTD  stated that CBP offices are responsible for recording their employees\u2019  training records in TRAEN. However, CBP does not have a policy that  assigns the responsibility for entering records to its offices or that assigns  oversight responsibility to port management to ensure that their staff enter  data into TRAEN completely and accurately. CBP is currently in the  process of transferring the TRAEN system to the VLC and training CBP  officials on how to properly enter training records in the new system.  However, OFO and OTD officials stated that even trained employees  sometimes do not enter training records completely or in a timely manner.  Internal control standards state control activities\u2014such as policies,  procedures and management supervision\u2014help to ensure that all  transactions are completely and accurately recorded. Further, having  reliable data could enable agency managers to compare actual  performance to planned or expected results throughout the organization  and analyze differences. Moreover, having reliable data to measure the  degree to which CBP officers have completed required or recommended  training for their assigned positions would put CBP in a better position to  gauge the results of its cross-training program and other CBP officer  training and measure its progress towards achieving CBP officer training  goals."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CBP Has Not Fully Identified and Addressed Potential Incumbent Officer Training Needs", "paragraphs": ["CBP has taken steps to identify training needs among incumbent CBP  officers but has not conducted a comprehensive training needs  assessment to identify and address potential gaps in incumbent officers\u2019  current skills and competencies. Under executive order and federal  regulations, agencies are to review, not less than annually, programs to  identify training needs, establish priorities for training, and allocate  resources in accordance with those priorities.development standards state that a training needs assessment is needed  to identify knowledge or skill gaps and suggest material for new or follow- on training. Specifically, the analysis stage of training development  includes conducting a training needs assessment to identify skill or  knowledge gaps, conducting a job task analysis to identify critical  competencies required for the target audience, and analyzing the target  audience to develop appropriate training, among other steps.", "CBP has taken some steps to identify and analyze incumbent officer  training needs. In 2008, CBP initiated the first job task analysis for the  CBP officer position since 2003 by identifying nearly 300 job tasks and  about 100 competencies that all incumbent CBP officers are expected to  perform regardless of their currently assigned duties or port environment.  In 2011, CBP also completed a curriculum gap analysis, which compared  the newly revised basic academy curriculum with the previous basic  academy training to identify new skills or material that incumbent CBP  officers may not have learned in their basic academy training. For  example, the previous curriculum trained CBP officers to perform 75  critical tasks while the newly revised curriculum trains newly hired officers  to perform 138 critical tasks. According to OTD officials, the curriculum  gap analysis identified a shift in the training philosophy and delivery  methods and some changes in course content. For example, the revised  training for newly hired officers aims to instill a law enforcement mindset  by adding new courses in weapons training, evidence preservation, and  courtroom testimony, among others, and by expanding courses that are  designed to increase situational awareness and anti-terrorism vigilance  among the CBP officers. It also increases physical conditioning and the  number of hours of practical exercises related to conducting primary  inspections and examining documents as well as course content to reflect  new laws related to immigration processing and operating new  equipment. The revised curriculum also adds more training in skills that  CBP officers need to perform in secondary processing, including using  appropriate computer systems and following procedures to verify  passenger admittance.", "However, CBP has not conducted a training needs assessment or  analyzed the target audience to determine what training is needed. For  example, it has not evaluated potential gaps between the skills and  competencies of current incumbent officers to identify appropriate training  needs and possible gaps between (1) the nearly 300 job tasks and 100  competencies that all incumbent officers are expected to perform and     (2) any additional skills and knowledge that are currently taught in the  revised basic academy curriculum. In addition, CBP has not reviewed  incumbent CBP officers\u2019 previous training and experience, including  cross-training or any on-the-job training, to identify what training they may  have completed. OTD training standards state that it is important to  review the previous experience and training to better identify the training  needs for particular audiences. In 2007, we recommended that CBP  develop data on cross-training programs to determine whether officers  received required training so the agency may measure progress toward  achieving its training goals. As of September 2011, CBP has not  developed these data or measured the extent to which officers completed  required cross-training. In June 2011, CBP retired the cross-training  courses and replaced the courses with new postacademy modules that  contain updated content. However, CBP could review the previous  training records of its legacy and other incumbent officers to help identify  what training they have completed and to identify which postacademy  modules or other training they may need to take to perform their assigned  duties.", "Conducting a comprehensive training needs assessment could help CBP  analyze and identify potential skill gaps and training needs for incumbent  officers\u2014including legacy officers\u2014and better position it to develop  training to meet these needs, thus ensuring its officers are equipped to  meet the operational demands at the border. OTD criteria state that CBP  training managers may use a variety of techniques during a training  needs assessment to gather and analyze information about the  necessary training content for proposed training, including:  interviews with SMEs;  focus groups (moderated group interviews) involving SMEs and  representatives of the learning audience; observation of and interviews with those performing a particular job or  task in the field;  review of course critiques, test results, and performance evaluations;  instructional review, course audit, or content review of existing  training; and  review of field incident reports, critical factors identified, and lessons  learned.", "OFO officials stated that a training needs assessment would be useful,  but they have been unable to conduct one due to budget constraints and  may not be able to undertake a comprehensive training needs  assessment until fiscal year 2013, at the earliest. However, CBP could  begin the initial steps of planning for a training needs assessment for  incumbent officers in fiscal year 2012. Office of Personnel Management  (OPM) guidance states that a training needs assessment should include a  plan that sets goals or objectives for the training needs assessment;  evaluates the agency readiness and identifies key roles; evaluates prior  or other relevant needs assessments; prepares a project plan; and  clarifies success measures and program milestones. This plan could be  similar to the preparation of a project plan. Specifically, elements of a  project plan include (1) establishing clear and achievable training goals;  (2) balancing the competing demands for quality, scope, time, and cost;  (3) adapting the specifications, plans, and approach to the different  concerns and expectations of the various stakeholders involved in the  project; and (4) developing milestone dates to identify points throughout  the project to reassess efforts under way to determine whether project  changes are necessary. OFO officials stated that such a plan could be  helpful in initiating the process for conducting a training needs  assessment. Project management standards also call for assigning  responsibility and accountability for ensuring the results of program  activities are carried out. Developing a project plan could also help CBP  ensure that it is well-positioned to conduct a comprehensive training  needs assessment in 2013 for its incumbent officers\u2014while allowing for  monitoring and oversight of the staff efforts through the completion of  interim milestones to ensure progress in being made as intended."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["CBP has designed its training program for newly-hired CBP officers to  comply with its standards. Such compliance can contribute to ensuring  that newly-hired officers are prepared to accomplish CBP\u2019s mission of  securing the border and simultaneously facilitating the cross-border  movement of millions of legitimate travelers and billions of dollars in  international trade. However, CBP faces challenges in ensuring that the  training needs of its nearly 20,000 incumbent CBP officers are properly  identified and addressed. The results of its covert tests are not  generalizable to the entire CBP officer population. However, they reveal a  consistent pattern of weaknesses among the officers tested in their ability  to perform basic tasks and these weaknesses have not been corrected.  CBP has no plans for assessing the effectiveness of its \u201cBack to Basics\u201d  course and subsequent follow-on training developed in response to the  covert tests. Assessing the effectiveness in improving incumbent officer  performance could help CBP management know if the training is a  sufficient response to the weaknesses identified by the covert tests or if  additional adjustments are needed.", "In addition, CBP has not established policies and procedures to guide  OFO\u2019s implementation and oversight of incumbent officer training,  including entry of complete and accurate data into TRAEN. Having  policies and procedures to ensure that managers are fulfilling their  oversight responsibilities, including maintaining accurate and complete  training records, could help improve CBP\u2019s knowledge of whether  incumbent CBP officers have been properly trained.", "Given CBP\u2019s commitment to reinforcing the law enforcement mindset  among all CBP officers, evaluating the training needs of the current CBP  officers so that they can be addressed in a timely and cost-efficient  manner is important. In addition, given budget constraints on training  resources throughout the government, planning accordingly to ensure  that skill needs of the incumbent CBP officers are assessed could help  ensure that a road map is in place for conducting such an assessment  thereby ensuring that CBP\u2019s officer workforce is equipped to meet the  operational demands at the border."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve CBP training efforts, we recommend that the CBP  Commissioner take the following four actions:  (1) Conduct an evaluation of the effectiveness of the \u201cBack to Basics\u201d and  subsequent follow-on training,  (2) Conduct a comprehensive assessment of its covert test results to  identify the causes of and systemic issues underlying the results,  (3) Establish a policy that specifies roles and responsibilities for CBP  officer training implementation and related oversight, including oversight  responsibilities to ensure that training records are entered in TRAEN  completely and accurately and  (4) Develop a plan for conducting a training needs assessment to address  any skill gaps for incumbent CBP officers and then implement that plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of the sensitive version of this report to DHS for  comment.

Regarding the second  recommendation that CBP conduct a comprehensive assessment of its  covert test results, DHS agreed and stated that the Office of Internal  Affairs plans to conduct a comprehensive assessment of its covert test  results for fiscal year 2011 by December 30, 2011. DHS agreed with the  third recommendation that CBP establish a policy that specifies roles and  responsibilities for CBP officer training implementation and related  oversight, and stated that a policy will be developed by March 30, 2012,  to clarify the training roles and responsibilities at all national and local  levels to include the responsibility for maintaining accurate training  records. Regarding the fourth recommendation that CBP develop a plan  for conducting a training needs assessment to address any skill gaps for  incumbent CBP officers and then implement that plan, DHS stated that  OFO is coordinating with OTD to evaluate current training to identify any  existing training gaps, and plan to address any identified needs through  formal training by December 31, 2012. If effectively implemented, these  actions should address the intent of the recommendations.", "DHS raised an issue regarding the report\u2019s characterization of the DHS  covert test results. Specifically, DHS stated that the covert tests were  deliberately designed to test only a specific aspect of the overall primary  inspection process within the wide range of inspectional duties that CBP  officers perform and are not a valid measure of overall officers\u2019  performance and capabilities or reliability of the entire admissibility  process. The report noted that the test results are not generalizable to all  ports of entry. However, OFO officials emphasized that the tests are  informative in that they can help management identify possible  weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the inspection process and in the CBP  officer ability to perform basic tasks. Specifically, the tests are designed to  provide a snapshot of the level of a port\u2019s performance related to the  testing objectives. Further, according to the protocols, the tests are  designed to test and challenge CBP officers on their abilities, adherence  to policies and procedures, and use of technologies to detect and prevent  individuals attempting to enter the United States through the use of  document fraud. OFO also developed and mandated an annual  fraudulent document course based on the initial response to the covert  test results.
