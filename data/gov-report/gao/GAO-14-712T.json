These strategies are:", "Provider and Supplier Enrollment : The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) authorized, and CMS has implemented, actions to strengthen provider and supplier enrollment that address past weaknesses identified by GAO and HHS's Office of Inspector General. For example, CMS has hired contractors to determine whether providers and suppliers have valid licenses and are at legitimate locations. CMS could further strengthen enrollment screening by issuing a rule to require additional provider and supplier disclosures of information, such as any suspension of payments from a federal health care program, and establishing core elements for provider and supplier compliance programs, as authorized by PPACA.", "Prepayment and Postpayment Claims Review : Medicare uses prepayment review to deny claims that should not be paid and postpayment review to recover improperly paid claims. GAO has found that increased use of prepayment edits could help prevent improper Medicare payments. For example, prior GAO work identified millions of dollars of payments that appeared to be inconsistent with selected coverage and payment policies and therefore improper. Postpayment reviews are also critical to identifying and recouping overpayments. GAO recommended better oversight of both (1) the information systems analysts use to identify claims for postpayment review, in a 2011 report, and (2) the contractors responsible for these reviews, in a 2013 report. CMS has taken action or has actions under way to address these recommendations.", "Addressing Identified Vulnerabilities : Having mechanisms in place to resolve vulnerabilities that could lead to improper payments is critical to effective program management and could help address fraud. However, prior GAO work has shown weaknesses in CMS's processes to address such vulnerabilities. For example, GAO has made multiple recommendations to CMS to remove Social Security numbers from beneficiaries' Medicare cards to help prevent identity theft. HHS agreed with these recommendations, but reported that CMS could not proceed with the changes for a variety of reasons, including funding limitations, and therefore has not taken action.", "GAO work under way addressing these key strategies includes examining: (1) how well CMS's information system can prevent and detect the continued enrollment of ineligible or potentially fraudulent providers and suppliers in Medicare, (2) the potential use of electronic-card technologies to help reduce Medicare fraud, (3) CMS's oversight of program integrity efforts for prescription drugs, and (4) CMS's oversight of some of the contractors that conduct reviews of claims after payment.

Although there  have been convictions for multimillion-dollar schemes that defrauded the  Medicare program, the extent of the problem is unknown. There are no  reliable estimates of the extent of fraud in the Medicare program or for the  health care industry as a whole. By its very nature, fraud is difficult to  detect, as those involved are engaged in intentional deception. For  example, a provider submitting a fraudulent claim may include false  documentation to substantiate a service not provided, and thus the claim  may appear valid on its face. Fraud may also involve payments made to  beneficiaries to obtain their Medicare number for fraudulent billing  purposes. Although the full extent of the problem is unknown, it is clear  that, as one of the largest programs in the federal government, the  Medicare program is vulnerable to fraud, contributing to its fiscal  problems.", "In 2013, Medicare financed health care services for approximately   51 million individuals at a cost of about $604 billion and reported some of  the largest estimates of improper payments among federal programs\u2014 payments that either were made in an incorrect amount or should not  have been made at all. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS), the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS) that oversees Medicare, has estimated that improper payments in  the Medicare program were almost $50 billion in fiscal year 2013, about  $5 billion higher than in 2012. Improper payments may be a result of  fraud, waste, or abuse, but it is important to distinguish that the $50 billion  in estimated improper payments reported by CMS in fiscal year 2013 is  not an estimate of fraud in Medicare. Reported improper payment  estimates include many types of payments that should not have been  made or were made in an incorrect amount such as overpayments,  underpayments, and payments that were not adequately documented.", "Since its inception, Medicare has been administered largely by  contractors with federal oversight, and these contractors have a  responsibility to help ensure Medicare program integrity.

Specifically, to  strengthen the existing screening activities conducted by CMS  contractors, the agency added screenings of categories of provider and  supplier enrollment applications by risk level, contracted with new national  enrollment screening and site visit contractors, began imposing moratoria  on new enrollment of certain types of providers and suppliers, and issued  regulations requiring certain prescribers to enroll in Medicare."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Screening Provider and Supplier Enrollment Applications by Risk Level", "paragraphs": ["CMS and OIG issued a final rule in February 2011 to implement many of  the new screening procedures required by PPACA.

Providers and suppliers in the high-risk level are subject to the most  rigorous screening. (See table 2.) Based in part on our work and that of  OIG, CMS designated newly enrolling home health agencies and  suppliers of durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and  supplies (DMEPOS) as high risk, and designated other providers and  suppliers as lower risk levels. Providers and suppliers at all risk levels are  screened to verify that they meet specific requirements established by  Medicare, such as having current licenses or accreditation and valid  Social Security numbers. High- and moderate-risk providers and  suppliers are also subject to unannounced site visits. Further, depending  on the risks presented, PPACA authorizes CMS to require fingerprint- based criminal history checks. In March 2014, CMS awarded a contract  that is to enable the agency to access Federal Bureau of Investigation  information to help conduct those checks of high-risk providers and  suppliers.

Our prior work found that, while use of prepayment edits saved  Medicare at least $1.76 billion in fiscal year 2010, the savings could have  been greater had prepayment edits been used more widely. Based on  an analysis of a limited number of national policies and local coverage  determinations (LCD), we identified $14.7 million in payments in fiscal  year 2010 that appeared to be inconsistent with four national policies and  therefore improper. We also found more than $100 million in payments  that were inconsistent with three selected LCDs that could have been  identified using automated edits. Thus, we concluded that more  widespread implementation of effective automated edits developed by  individual MACs in other MAC jurisdictions could also result in savings to  Medicare.
