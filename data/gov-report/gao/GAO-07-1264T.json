That is, the department has ensured commitment from top leadership and established a governance structure to manage resources, both of which are critical success factors. However, the department continues to operate without a single, dedicated implementation team to manage the realignment; such a dedicated team is important to oversee the further implementation of the realignment, which is not expected to be complete until July 2008. Other challenges to the success of the realignment include delays in staffing and in implementing improved IT management processes that are to address long-standing weaknesses. The department has not kept pace with its schedule for implementing these processes, having missed its original scheduled time frames. Unless VA dedicates a team to oversee the further implementation of the realignment, including defining and establishing the processes that will enable the department to address its IT management weaknesses, it risks delaying or missing the potential benefits of the realignment. VA has begun or continued several major initiatives to strengthen information security practices and secure personally identifiable information within the department, but more remains to be done. These initiatives include continuing the department's efforts to reorganize its management structure; developing a remedial action plan; establishing an information protection program; improving its incident management capability; and establishing an office responsible for oversight and compliance of IT within the department. However, although these initiatives have led to progress, their implementation has shortcomings. For example, although the management structure for information security has changed under the realignment, improved security management processes have not yet been completely developed and implemented, and responsibility for the department's information security functions is divided between two organizations, with no documented process for the two offices to coordinate with each other. In addition, VA has made limited progress in implementing prior security recommendations made by GAO and the department's Inspector General, having yet to implement 22 of 26 recommendations. Until the department addresses shortcomings in its major security initiatives and implements prior recommendations, it will have limited assurance that it can protect its systems and information from the unauthorized disclosure, misuse, or loss of personally identifiable information."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for inviting us to participate in today\u2019s hearing on the  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) realignment of its information  technology management structure and actions toward strengthening  its information security program. In carrying out its mission of  serving our nation\u2019s veterans, the department relies heavily on  information technology (IT), for which it expends about $1 billion  annually. As you know, however, VA has encountered persistent  challenges in IT management, having experienced cost, schedule,  and performance problems in its information system initiatives, as  well as losses of sensitive information contained in its systems. We  have reported that a contributing factor to VA\u2019s challenges in  managing projects and improving security was the department\u2019s  management structure, which until recently was decentralized,  giving the administrations and headquarters offices control over a  majority of the department\u2019s IT budget.", "In October 2005, VA initiated a realignment of its IT program to  provide greater authority and accountability over its resources. In  undertaking this realignment (due for completion in July 2008), the  department\u2019s goals are to centralize IT management under the  department-level Chief Information Officer (CIO) and standardize  operations and the development of systems across the department  through the use of new management processes based on industry  best practices. This past June we reported on the department\u2019s  realignment initiative, noting progress as well as the need for  additional actions to be completed. Just last week, we also released  a report on VA information security, which included an assessment  of the realignment with regard to the department\u2019s information  security practices.", "At your request, my testimony today will summarize the  department\u2019s actions to realign IT management and our findings  regarding the department\u2019s information security program. In  developing this testimony, we reviewed our previous work on the  department\u2019s realignment and efforts to strengthen information  security. We also obtained and analyzed pertinent documentation  and supplemented our analysis with interviews of responsible VA  officials to determine the current status of the department\u2019s  realignment efforts.

Over time, the use of IT has become increasingly crucial  to the department\u2019s effort to provide benefits and services. VA relies  on its systems for medical information and records for veterans, as  well as for processing benefit claims, including compensation and  pension and education benefits.", "In reporting on VA\u2019s IT management over the past several years, we  have highlighted challenges the department has faced in enabling its  employees to help veterans obtain services and information more  quickly and effectively while also safeguarding personally  identifiable information. A major challenge was that the  department\u2019s information systems and services were highly  decentralized, giving the administrations a majority of the IT  budget. In addition, VA\u2019s policies and procedures for securing  sensitive information needed to be improved and implemented  consistently across the department.", "As we have previously pointed out, it is crucial for the department  CIO to ensure that well-established and integrated processes for  leading, managing, and controlling investments in information  systems and programs are followed throughout the department.  Similarly, a contractor\u2019s assessment of VA\u2019s IT organizational  alignment, issued in February 2005, noted the lack of control over  how and when money is spent. The assessment noted that the focus  of department-level management was only on reporting  expenditures to the Office of Management and Budget and  Congress, rather than on managing these expenditures within the  department.", "In response to the challenges that we and others have noted, the  department officially began its effort to provide the CIO with greater  authority over IT in October 2005. At that time, the Secretary issued  an executive decision memorandum granting approval for the  development of a new management structure for the department.  According to VA, its goals in moving to centralized management are  to enable the department to perform better oversight of the  standardization, compatibility, and interoperability of systems, as  well as to have better overall fiscal discipline for the budget.", "In February 2007, the Secretary approved the department\u2019s new  organizational structure, which includes the Assistant Secretary for  Information and Technology, who serves as VA\u2019s CIO. As shown in  figure 1, the CIO is supported by a principal deputy assistant  secretary and five deputy assistant secretaries\u2014new senior  leadership positions created to assist the CIO in overseeing  functions such as cyber security, IT portfolio management, systems  development, and IT operations.", "In addition, the Secretary approved an IT governance plan in April  2007 that is intended to enable the Office of Information and  Technology to centralize its decision making. The plan describes the  relationship between IT governance and departmental governance  and the approach the department intends to take to enhance IT  governance. The department also made permanent the transfer of its  entire IT workforce under the CIO, consisting of approximately  6,000 personnel from the administrations.

Consequently, the department is in  danger of not being able to meet its target of completing the  realignment in July 2008. In addition, although it has prioritized its  implementation of the new management processes, none has yet  been implemented. In our recent report, we made six  recommendations to ensure that VA\u2019s realignment is successfully  accomplished; the department generally concurred with our  recommendations and stated that it had actions planned to address  them."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "VA Has Not Fully Addressed All Critical Success Factors", "paragraphs": ["We have identified critical factors that organizations need to address  in order to successfully transform an organization to be more results  oriented, customer focused, and collaborative in nature. Large- scale change management initiatives are not simple endeavors and  require the concentrated efforts of both leadership and employees  to realize intended synergies and to accomplish new organizational  goals. There are a number of key practices that can serve as the  basis for federal agencies to transform their cultures in response to  governance challenges, such as those that an organization like VA  might face when transforming to a centralized IT management  structure.", "The department has fully addressed two of six critical success  factors that we identified (see table 1).", "Ensuring commitment from top leadership. The department has  fully addressed this success factor. As described earlier, the  Secretary of VA has fully supported the realignment. He approved  the department\u2019s new organizational structure and provided  resources for the realignment effort.", "However, the Secretary recently submitted his resignation,  indicating that he intended to depart by October 1, 2007. While it is  unclear what effect the Secretary\u2019s departure will have on the  realignment, the impending departure underscores the need for  consistent support from top leadership through the implementation  of the realignment, to ensure that its success is not at risk in the  future.", "Establishing a governance structure to manage resources. The  department has fully addressed this success factor. The department  has established three governance boards, which have begun  operation. The VA IT Governance Plan, approved April 2007, states  that the establishment and operation of these boards will assist in  providing the department with more cost-effective use of IT  resources and assets.", "The department also has plans to further enhance the governance  structure in response to operational experience. The department  found that the boards\u2019 responsibilities need to be more clearly  defined in the IT Governance Plan to avoid overlap. That is, one  board (the Business Needs and Investment Board) was involved in  the budget formulation for fiscal year 2009, but budget formulation  is also the responsibility of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for IT  Resource Management, who is not a member of this board.  According to the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for  Information and Technology, the department is planning to update  its IT Governance Plan within a year to include more specificity on  the role of the governance boards in VA\u2019s budget formulation  process. Such an update could further improve the structure\u2019s  effectiveness.", "Linking IT strategic plan to organization strategic plan. The  department has partially addressed this success factor. VA has  drafted an IT Strategic Plan that provides a course of action for the  Office of Information and Technology over 5 years and addresses  how IT will contribute to the department\u2019s strategic plan. According  to the Deputy Director of the Quality and Performance Office, the  draft IT strategic plan should be formally approved in October 2007.  Finalizing the plan is essential to helping ensure that leadership  understands the link between VA\u2019s organizational direction and how  IT is aligned to meet its goals.", "Using workforce strategic management to identify proper roles for  all employees. The department has partially addressed this success  factor. The department has begun to identify job requirements,  design career paths, and determine recommended training for the  staff that were transferred as part of the realignment. According to a  VA official, the department identified 21 specialized job activities,  such as applications software and end user support, and has defined  competency and proficiency targets for 6 of these activities. Also,  by November 2007, VA expects to have identified the career paths  for approximately 5,000 of the 6,000 staff that have been centralized  under the CIO. Along with the development of the competency and  proficiency targets, the department has identified recommended  training based on grade level. However, the department has not yet  established a knowledge and skills inventory to determine what  skills are available in order to match roles with qualifications for all  employees within the new organization. It is crucial that the  department take the remaining steps to fully address this critical  success factor, so that the staff transferred to the Office of  Information and Technology are placed in positions that best suit  their knowledge and skills, and the organization has the personnel  resources capable of developing and delivering the services  required.", "Communicating change to all stakeholders. The department has  partially addressed this success factor. The department began  publishing a bimonthly newsletter in June to better communicate  with all staff about Office of Information and Technology activities,  including the realignment. However, the department has not yet  fully staffed the Business Relationship Management Office or  identified its leadership. This office is to serve as the single point of  contact between the Office of Information and Technology and the  administrations; in this role, it provides the means for the Office of  Information and Technology to understand customer requirements,  promote services to customers, and monitor the quality of the  delivered services. A fully staffed and properly led Business  Relationship Management Office is important to ensure effective  communication between the Office of Information and Technology  and the administrations.", "Communicating the changed roles and responsibilities of the central  IT organization versus the administrations is one of the important  functions of the Business Relationship Management Office. These  changes are crucial to software development, among other things.  Before the centralization of the management structure, each of the  administrations was responsible for its own software development.  For example, the department\u2019s health information system\u2014the  Veterans Health Information System and Technology Architecture  (VistA)\u2014was developed in a decentralized environment. The  developers and the doctors, closely collaborating at local facilities,  developed and adapted this system for their own specific clinic  needs. The result of their efforts is an electronic medical record that  has been fully embraced by the physicians and nurses. However, the  decentralized approach has also resulted in each site running a  stand-alone version of VistA that is costly to maintain; in addition,  data at the sites are not standardized, which impedes the ability to  exchange computable information.", "Under the new organization structure, approval of development  changes for VistA will be centralized at the Veterans Health  Administration headquarters and then approved for development  and implementation by the Office of Information and Technology.  The communications role of the Business Relationship Management  Office is thus an important part of the processes needed to ensure  that users\u2019 requirements will be addressed in system development.", "Dedicating an implementation team to manage change. The  department has not addressed this success factor. A dedicated  implementation team that is responsible for the day-to-day  management of a major change initiative is critical to ensure that the  project receives the focused, full-time attention needed to be  sustained and successful. VA has not identified such an  implementation team to manage the realignment. Rather, the  department is currently managing the realignment through two  organizations: the Process Improvement Office under the Quality  and Performance Office (which will lead process improvements)  and the Organizational Management Office (which will advise and  assist the CIO during the final transformation to a centralized  structure). However, the Executive Director of the Organizational  Management Office has recently resigned his position, leaving one  of the two responsible offices without leadership.", "In our view, having a dedicated implementation team to manage  major change initiatives is crucial to successful implementation of  the realignment. An implementation team can assist in tracking  implementation goals and identifying performance shortfalls or  schedule slippages. The team could also provide continuity and  consistency in the face of any uncertainty that could potentially  result from the Secretary\u2019s resignation.", "Accordingly, in our recent report we recommended that the  department dedicate an implementation team to be responsible for  change management throughout the transformation and that it  establish a schedule for the implementation of the management  processes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Department Is behind Schedule in Implementing IT Management Processes", "paragraphs": ["As the foundation for its realignment, VA plans to implement 36  management processes in five key areas: enterprise management,  business management, business application management,  infrastructure, and service support. These processes, which address  all aspects of IT management, were recommended by the  department\u2019s realignment contractor and are based on industry best  practices. According to the contractor, they are a key component  of the realignment effort as the Office of Information and  Technology moves to a process-based organization. Additionally, the  contractor noted that with a system of defined processes, the Office  of Information and Technology could quickly and accurately change  the way IT supports the department.", "The department had planned to begin implementing the 36  management processes in March 2007; however, as of early May  2007, it had only begun pilot testing two of these processes. The  Deputy Director of the Quality and Performance Office reported that  the initial implementation of the first two processes will begin in the  second quarter of 2008.", "The Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Information and  Technology acknowledged that the department is behind schedule  for implementing the processes, but it has prioritized the processes  and plans to implement them in three groups, in order of priority  (see attachment 1 for a description of the processes and their  implementation priority). According to the Deputy Director of the  Quality and Performance Office, the approach and schedule for  process implementation is currently under review. Work on the 10  processes associated with the first group is under way, and  implementation plans and time frames are being revised. This  official told us that initial planning meetings have occurred and  primary points of contact have been designated for the financial  management and portfolio management processes, which are to be  implemented as part of the first group. The department also noted  that it will work to meet its target date of July 2008 for the  realignment, but that all of the processes may not be fully  implemented at that time.", "According to the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for  Information and Technology, the department has fallen behind  schedule with process implementation for two reasons:  \u25cf  The department underestimated the amount of work required to  redefine the 36 process areas. Process charters for each of the  processes were developed by a VA contractor and provide an  outline for operation under the new management structure. Based  on its initial review, the department found that the processes are  complicated and multilayered, involving multiple organizations. In  addition, the contractor provided process charters and descriptions  based on a commercial, for-profit business model, and so the  department must readjust them to reflect how VA conducts  business.   \u25cf  With the exception of IT operations, the Veterans Health  Administration operates in a decentralized manner. For example,  the budget and spending for the medical centers are under the  control of the medical center directors. In addition, the Office of  Information and Technology only has ownership over about 30  percent of all activities within the financial management process.  For example some elements within this process area (such as  tracking and reporting on expenditures) are the responsibility of the  department\u2019s Office of Management; this office is accountable for  VA\u2019s entire budget, including IT dollars. Thus, the Office of  Information and Technology has no authority to direct the Office of  Management to take particular actions to improve specific financial  management activities.", "The department faces the additional obstacle that it has not yet  staffed crucial leadership positions that are vital to the  implementation of the management processes. As part of the new  organizational structure, the department identified 25 offices whose  leaders will report to the five deputy assistant secretaries and are  responsible for carrying out the new management processes in daily  operations. However, as of early September, 7 of the leadership  positions for these 25 offices were vacant, and 4 were filled in an  acting capacity. According to the Principal Deputy Assistant  Secretary for Information and Technology, hiring personnel for  senior leadership positions has been more difficult than anticipated.  With these leadership positions remaining vacant, the department  will face increased difficulties in supporting and sustaining the  realignment through to its completion.", "Until the improved processes have been implemented, IT programs  and initiatives will continue to be managed under previously  established processes that have resulted in persistent management  challenges. Without the standardization that would result from the  implementation of the processes, the department risks cost  overruns and schedule slippages for current initiatives, such as  VistA modernization, for which about $682 million has been  expended through fiscal year 2006."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA Has Much Work Remaining to Resolve Long-Standing Security Weaknesses", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing the importance of securing federal systems and data,  Congress passed the Federal Information Security Management Act  (FISMA) in December 2002, which sets forth a comprehensive  framework for ensuring the effectiveness of information security  controls over information resources that support federal operations  and assets. Using a risk-based approach to information security  management, the act requires each agency to develop, document,  and implement an agencywide information security program for the  data and systems that support the operations and assets of the  agency. According to FISMA, the head of each agency has  responsibility for delegating to the agency CIO the authority to  ensure compliance with the security requirements in the act. To  carry out the CIO\u2019s responsibilities in the area, a senior agency  official is to be designated chief information security officer (CISO).", "The May 2006 theft from the home of a VA employee of a computer  and external hard drive (which contained personally identifiable  information on approximately 26.5 million veterans and U.S. military  personnel) prompted Congress to pass the Veterans Benefits, Health  Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006. Under the act, the  VA\u2019s CIO is responsible for establishing, maintaining, and  monitoring departmentwide information security policies,  procedures, control techniques, training, and inspection  requirements as elements of the departmental information security  program. The act also includes provisions to further protect  veterans and service members from the misuse of their sensitive  personally identifiable information. In the event of a security  incident involving personally identifiable information, VA is required  to conduct a risk analysis, and on the basis of the potential for  compromise of personally identifiable information, the department  may provide security incident notifications, fraud alerts, credit  monitoring services, and identity theft insurance. Congress is to be  informed regarding security incidents involving the loss of  personally identifiable information.", "In a report released last week, we stated that although VA has  made progress in addressing security weaknesses, it has not yet  fully implemented key recommendations to strengthen its  information security practices. It has not implemented two of our  four previous recommendations and 20 of 22 recommendations  made by the department\u2019s inspector general. Among the  recommendations not implemented are our recommendation that it  complete a comprehensive security management program and  inspector general recommendations to appropriately restrict access  to data, networks, and VA facilities; ensure that only authorized  changes are made to computer programs; and strengthen critical  infrastructure planning to ensure that information security  requirements are addressed. Because these recommendations have  not yet been implemented, unnecessary risk exists that personally  identifiable information of veterans and other individuals, such as  medical providers, will be exposed to data tampering, fraud, and  inappropriate disclosure.", "The need to fully implement GAO and IG recommendations to  strengthen information security practices is underscored by the  prevalence of security incidents involving the unauthorized  disclosure, misuse, or loss of personal information of veterans and  other individuals (see table 2). These incidents were partially due to  weaknesses in the department\u2019s security controls. In these  incidents, which include the May 2006 theft of computer equipment  from an employee\u2019s home (mentioned earlier) and the theft of  equipment from department facilities, millions of people had their  personal information compromised.", "While the increase in reported incidents in 2006 reflects a  heightened awareness on the part of VA employees of their  responsibility to report incidents involving loss of personal  information, it also indicates that vulnerabilities remain in security  controls designed to adequately safeguard information.", "Since the May 2006 security incident, VA has begun or has continued  several major initiatives to strengthen information security practices  and secure personally identifiable information within the  department. These initiatives include the realignment of its IT  management structure, as discussed earlier. Under the realignment,  the management structure for information security has changed. In  the new organization, the responsibility for managing the program  lies with the CISO/Director of Cyber Security (the CISO position has  been vacant since June 2006, with the CIO acting in this capacity),  while the responsibility for implementing the program lies with the  Director of Field Operations and Security. Thus, responsibility for  information security functions within the department is divided.", "VA officials indicated that the heads of the two organizations are  communicating about the department\u2019s implementation of security  policies and procedures, but this communication is not defined as a  role or responsibility for either position in the new management  organization book, nor is there a documented process in place to  coordinate the management and implementation of the security  program. Both of these activities are key security management  practices. Without a documented process, policies or procedures  could be inconsistently implemented throughout the department,  which could prevent the CISO from effectively ensuring  departmentwide compliance with FISMA. Until the process and  responsibilities for coordinating the management and  implementation of IT security policies and procedures throughout  the department are clearly documented, VA will have limited  assurance that the management and implementation of security  policies and procedures are effectively coordinated and  communicated. Developing and documenting these policies and  procedures are essential for achieving an improved and effective  security management process under the new centralized  management model.", "In addition to the realignment initiative, the department also has  others under way to address security weaknesses. These include  developing an action plan to correct identified weaknesses;  establishing an information protection program; improving its  incident management capability; and establishing an office to be  responsible for oversight of IT within the department. However,  implementation shortcomings limit the effectiveness of these  initiatives. For example:   \u25cf  VA\u2019s action plan has task owners assigned and is updated biweekly,  but department officials have not ensured that adequate progress  has been made to resolve items in the plan. Specifically, VA has  extended the completion date at least once for 38 percent of the  plan items, and it did not have a process in place to validate the  closure of the items. In addition, although numerous items in the  plan were to develop or revise a policy or procedure, 87 percent of  these items did not have a corresponding task with an established  timeframe for implementation.   \u25cf  VA installed encryption software on laptops at facilities  inconsistently; however, VA\u2019s directive on encryption did not  address the encryption of laptops that were categorized as medical  devices, which make up a significant portion of the population of  laptops at Veterans Health Administration facilities. In addition, the  department has not yet fully implemented the acquisition of  software tools across the department.  \u25cf  VA has improved its incident management capability since May 2006  by realigning and consolidating two incident management centers,  and made a notable improvement in its notification of major  security incidents to US-CERT (the U.S. Computer Emergency  Readiness Team), the Secretary, and Congress, but the time it took  to send notification letters to individuals was increased for some  incidents because VA did not have adequate procedures for  coordinating incident response and mitigation activities with other  agencies and obtaining up-to-date contact information.  \u25cf  VA established the Office of IT Oversight and Compliance to  conduct assessments of its facilities to determine the adequacy of  internal controls and investigate compliance with laws, policies, and  directives and ensure that proper safeguards are maintained;  however, the office lacked a process to ensure that its examination  of internal controls is consistent across VA facilities.", "Until the department addresses recommendations to resolve  identified weaknesses and implements the major initiatives it has  undertaken, it will have limited assurance that it can protect its  systems and information from the unauthorized use, disclosure,  disruption, or loss.", "In our report released last week, we made 17 recommendations to  assist the department in improving its ability to protect its  information and systems. These recommendations included that VA  document clearly define coordination responsibilities for the  Director of Field Operations and Security and the Director of Cyber  Security and develop and implement a process for these officials to  coordinate on the implementation of IT security policies and  procedures throughout the department. We also made  recommendations to improve the department\u2019s ability to protect its  information and systems, including the development of various  processes and procedures to ensure that tasks in the department\u2019s  security action plans have time frames for implementation.", "In summary, effectively instituting a realignment of the Office of  Information and Technology is essential to ensuring that VA\u2019s IT  programs achieve their objectives and that the department has a  solid and sustainable approach to managing its IT investments. VA  continues to work on improving such programs as information  security and systems development. Yet we continue to see  management weaknesses in these programs and initiatives (many of  a long-standing nature), which are the very weaknesses that VA aims  to alleviate with its reorganized management structure. Until the  department fully addresses the critical success factors that we  identified and carries out its plans to establish a comprehensive set  of improved management processes, the impact of this vital  undertaking will be diminished.
