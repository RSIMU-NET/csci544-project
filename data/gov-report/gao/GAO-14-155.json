However, USPS did not substantially conform to other practices such as evaluating alternative investments by considering whether an external entity could perform all or part of a function because USPS's investment policies do not require such evaluations. However, USPS is not precluded from conducting such evaluations. Modifying its policies to require such evaluations could place USPS in a better position to ensure the evaluations are completed and to identify the best option for reducing costs and increasing the quality of investments.", "For selecting capital investments, USPS substantially conformed to most of the leading practices, such as ranking and prioritizing, and linking its investments with budget considerations. However, consistent with its investment policy, USPS developed business cases for approval by project rather than following leading practices that call for using a portfolio approach of allocating resources based on overall organizational goals linked to the agency's mission. Modifying policies to require a comprehensive portfolio approach would better enable USPS to consider projects alongside those that have been funded to select the mix of investments that best meets its mission needs.", "For managing capital investments, USPS conformance with leading practices was mixed. For example, consistent with leading practices, USPS established oversight for its capital investments and tracks cost, schedule, and performance data for initiatives. USPS policy requires comparing the planned-investment timeline and performance metrics to actual results to reassess and determine whether to continue, amend, or terminate a project, consistent with leading practices. USPS managers, however, could only verify that such a reassessment occurred for one of the five projects GAO reviewed. Examining the extent to which managers regularly reassess projects to continue, amend, or stop a project would help to establish crucial accountability for limited resources.", "For evaluating capital investments, USPS conformance with leading practices was partial. USPS policy calls for a comparison of actual return-on-investment and performance data for completed projects against expected results, consistent with leading practices. However, four of the five projects GAO reviewed did not have comparable return-on-investment data, thereby limiting the ability of managers to assess the investment's impact, identify modifications to potentially improve performance, and revise the investment process.

The purpose was to reassess and  determine whether to continue, amend, or terminate a project.  USPS officials told us that they made an internal decision in  December 2011 to no longer require in-person briefings and instead  have executive leaders work more closely with program managers  and staff.

However, as noted in the  report, USPS did not provide us with documentation that it considered  outsourcing part or all of a mail-processing or delivery function. USPS  could better conform to this leading practice if it considered the potential  role of an external entity for all capital investments. This could place  USPS in a better position to identify the best option for reducing costs and  to increase the quality of its investments.", "With regard to selecting capital investments by using a portfolio approach  for developing business cases and finalizing and allocating resources,  USPS partially concurred and stated that it uses an organization-wide  portfolio approach for review during the capital-budget-planning process,  and that it will continue to clearly communicate the portfolio approach and  incorporate it into USPS\u2019s revised investment policy. However, we found  that USPS develops its business cases for approval and allocates  resources by project rather than portfolio. As noted in the report, selecting  investments on a project rather than portfolio approach may lead to  duplicative functions that do not integrate well to perform the desired  mission. Requiring a more comprehensive portfolio approach would  enable USPS to consider proposed projects alongside those that have  been funded to select the mix of investments that best meets its mission  needs. Thus, we continue to believe that the USPS should use a portfolio  approach for developing business cases to fully address the  recommendation.", "With regard to evaluating capital investments by seeking and leveraging  external oversight and review and requiring that best practices and  lessons learned be incorporated into the investment process, USPS  concurred. However, USPS responded that it has previously contracted  with highly respected external entities to review capital investment plans,  and that it will continue to evaluate the need to hire consultants when  necessary. While this is a positive practice, USPS can extend their  external oversight and review when evaluating capital investments in  addition to reviewing investment plans. In addition, external oversight and  review are leading practices for all investments that could help USPS  obtain data on which to make improvements in the process or to inform  future investment decisions. USPS also stated that it will ensure that  lessons learned and investment performance results are shared with its  management and will be available for review on USPS\u2019s internal website.  With further regard to lessons learned, USPS also stated that it will  ensure that each group is aware of the status of major investments and  the lessons learned for current and future projects. However, USPS did  not state that it would modify its investment policies to require that best  practices and lessons learned be incorporated into the review process.  We continue to believe that USPS should modify its investment polices as  recommended. The absence of consistent documents for all investments  limits opportunities to improve the process to benefit future investments.", "USPS concurred with our third recommendation that it regularly examine  the extent to which executives and program managers consistently follow  all leading practices particularly for: identifying problems and reassessing  risk while managing a project and evaluating the cost, schedule, and  performance results of completed projects. USPS stated that it would  require program sponsors to ensure that their presentations appropriately  address project cost, schedule, and performance information. This is a  positive step toward improving USPS\u2019s ability to gain feedback necessary  for improving future capital investments.", "As agreed with your office offices, unless you publicly announce the  contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days  from the report date.

We  identified leading practices for the four phases\u2014planning, selecting,  managing, and evaluating capital investments\u2014through analysis and  review of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Capital  Programming Guide supplement to Circular A-11, which identified leading  practices from government agencies and the private sector, and  examples of executive agency implementation of the Capital Planning  and Investment Control (CPIC) process. We identified leading practices  that are applicable to USPS\u2019s business model, which requires it to fulfill its  mission of providing prompt, reliable, and efficient universal service to the  public while remaining financially self-sustaining.  However, unlike a  private corporation, USPS is bound by legal and other restrictions that  limit its ability to make certain types of business decisions\u2014such as  eliminating particular lines of businesses, cutting back on services, and/or  altering its business model in ways that inhibit its universal service  provision. External and internal subject matter experts with experience in  both the public the private sectors reviewed the leading practices we  identified and found them to be reasonable for USPS capital investments  as applicable. These experts all provided comments that we incorporated  into our capital investment leading practices. We compared our identified  leading practices to USPS\u2019s capital investment process. To understand  USPS\u2019s capital investment process, we reviewed USPS policy,  documentation, and testimonial evidence on the capital investment  process. USPS officials reviewed our initial description and provided  feedback, which we incorporated into our work. We also met with USPS  officials responsible for the Delivering Results, Innovation, Value and  Efficiency (DRIVE) strategic initiatives to assess the extent to which  USPS conformed to the leading practice of linking its capital investments  to its strategic plans. We also met with and obtained documentation from  USPS\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG), to obtain an overall  assessment of USPS\u2019s capital investment process.", "To gather more detailed information about how USPS policies were  applied in specific cases, and to determine whether USPS policies were  consistently followed for a selection of high-cost capital investment  projects, we selected 5 of 28 projects that were approved for over $25  million and were approved for funding after USPS experienced net losses  in fiscal year 2007. From these 28 projects, we selected the four that had  a positive projected return on investment as determined by USPS, were  not specific to a particular geographical area, and were completed by  fiscal year 2012. We included a fifth project (that was fully deployed, but  not yet complete) due to USPS\u2019s significant investment in the project (see  table 3). We met with the program managers for each of the projects and  reviewed documentation to assess the process for managing and  evaluating these projects, and we conducted site visits to see four of the  five projects. The selected investments do not support generalizations  about the overall extent to which USPS followed leading practices for its  capital investments, but rather illustrate whether and how policies were  applied in specific cases. We also met with the USPS OIG to discuss  USPS\u2019s management and evaluation of the selected projects.", "Our analysis found that each investment phase\u2014planning, selecting,  managing, and evaluating\u2014should consist of a series of leading practices  that should be followed while the projects are within that phase. We used  two different rating scales to assess the leading practices and capital  investment phases. For each leading practice, we assessed USPS\u2019s level  of conformance, as follows:", "Substantial: USPS policy conformed to all or almost all elements.", "Partial: Either (1) USPS policy conformed to some elements; or (2)  USPS policy conformed substantially, but we identified instances in  the five projects we reviewed where the policies were not consistently  applied.", "Minimal/none: USPS policy conformed to few or no elements.", "Then, for each investment phase, we assessed USPS\u2019s level of  conformance, as follows:", "High: USPS substantially conformed to all or almost all of the leading  practices.", "Medium: USPS substantially conformed to multiple leading practices.", "Low: USPS substantially conformed to one or none of the leading  practices.", "To describe the effects of not substantially conforming to a leading  practice, we reviewed prior GAO work and the work of others including  the USPS OIG and the National Research Council, and OMB and CPIC  guides.", "To report on USPS expenditures on capital investments for the past 10  years and to identify the five projects that met our selection criteria, we  requested data from USPS. We assessed the reliability of these data  through review of related documents and interviews with knowledgeable  agency officials. We found the data sufficiently reliable for our purposes of  reporting on the amount spent on capital investments in the past 10 years  and for selecting the five high-cost capital investments we reviewed.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2013 to January 2014  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
