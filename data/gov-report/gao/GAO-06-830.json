The military services rely on industry to capitalize the required up-front investment, with the understanding that the contractors will amortize this investment by selling training services by the hour. GAO was asked to address (1) the factors that led the Air Force and Army to acquire simulator training as a service and whether the decision to use this approach was adequately supported; (2) whether implementation of the approach has resulted in the planned number of simulator training sites being activated; and (3) whether the Air Force and Army are effectively tracking the return on their expenditure of taxpayer dollars. GAO makes recommendations to the Secretary of Defense intended to improve management and oversight of these service contracts to help ensure that the best approach is used to provide the war-fighter with needed training. In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD concurred with all but one of the recommendations, only partially concurring with one pertaining to the Army's simulator utilization rates.

As a result, the simulators were becoming increasingly obsolete. Buying training as a service meant that operation and maintenance (O&M) funds could be used instead of procurement funds. Shifting the responsibility for simulator ownership, operation, and maintenance from the government to the contractor was thought to more quickly enable simulator upgrades to match the changing configurations of aircraft. However, the decision to take a service contract approach was not supported by a thorough analysis of the costs and benefits as compared to other alternatives, despite a Department of Defense directive that provided for such an analysis. While Air Force and Army officials told GAO the new simulators are significant improvements over the previous ones, the expected number of Air Force training sites have not been activated. For the Air Force, O&M funds have not been allocated at the anticipated levels, leading to schedule slippages. The F-16 simulator contractor cited the funding problems and subsequent schedule slippages as the basis for notifying the Air Force that its situation under the contract was no longer financially viable. The Air Force is in the process of re-competing the F-16 training contract, which will likely result in a training gap for pilots--possibly over 2 years--and additional costs to the Air Force. The start date of the Army's flight simulator training was rebaselined twice, but Army officials told us that adequate training was in place for the flight school participants. The return on expenditure of taxpayer dollars is not being effectively tracked in three key ways: Air Force utilization of simulator training frequently falls well below the hours for which the government is paying. The Army is not collecting data on utilization rates at all. The government has little insight into what it is paying for during the development period before training is activated, which can take more than a year. While invoices for preparatory efforts reflect only discrete tasks such as training capabilities assessments, the wide range of invoice amounts and GAO's discussions with contractor representatives suggest that the government is actually making milestone payments to the contractors for a portion of their up-front costs to acquire and develop the simulators. Most of the contracts contain award-term provisions, where the contractors can earn an extension of the contract period for good performance. GAO found that the award-term evaluation factors do not always measure key acquisition outcomes such as simulator availability and concurrency with aircraft upgrades."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In the late 1990s, the Air Force embarked upon an innovative strategy for  In the late 1990s, the Air Force embarked upon an innovative strategy for  acquiring flight simulator training for several of its aircraft platforms.  acquiring flight simulator training for several of its aircraft platforms.

A flight  simulator is a system that tries to realistically replicate, or simulate, the  experience of flying an aircraft. Flight simulators range from video games  to full-sized cockpit replicas mounted on hydraulic (or electromechanical)  actuators and controlled by state-of-the-art computer technology.  According to Air Force and Army officials, aircraft simulators are a cost- effective way of helping to develop and refine operational flight skills.  Simulators can facilitate training that might be impractical or unsafe if  done with actual systems and allow for concentrated pilot practice in  selected normal and emergency actions. Simulators also can train  operators and maintainers to diagnose and address possible equipment  faults, and enhance proficiency despite shortages of equipment, space,  ranges, or time.", "In the late 1990s, the Air Force and Army were faced with increasingly  obsolete simulators and the need to quickly acquire up-to-date pilot and  aircrew training. In 1997, the then-Commander of the Air Force\u2019s Air  Combat Command proposed an innovative approach of buying training as  a service, under which the contractors would own, operate, and maintain  the simulator hardware and software. The simulator service contracts are  one component of a much broader effort, now known as the DMO  program. The DMO goal is to provide state-of-the-art simulator training on- demand at the location of the trainee, with the ultimate vision of  networking different sites together to create more realistic flying  scenarios. Plans call for each fighter unit eventually to be equipped with  high-fidelity simulators. As of the fiscal year 2002 budget, the DMO  program was formalized in the Air Force budget with the assignment of a  program element line item that combined previous program elements for  the various simulator systems. For fiscal year 2006, over $200 million was  budgeted for the program.", "In the early 2000s, Army use of rotary-wing aviation simulation training  was limited because the simulators being used were grossly obsolete and  based on late 1970s\u2019 technology. To revamp its helicopter training, the  Army in late 2001 began the Flight School XXI program. Following the Air  Force\u2019s lead, the Army decided to acquire up-to-date simulator training  using a service contract.", "Congress and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) have recently  addressed the growing level of procurement of services. For example,  Congress included provisions in Section 801 of the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 designed to improve management  and oversight of procurement of services. To ensure that DOD acquires  services by means that are in its best interest and managed in compliance  with applicable statutes, regulations, directives, and other requirements,  the Act required DOD to establish a service acquisition management  structure, comparable to the management structure that applies to the  procurement of products. In September 2003, we reported that DOD and  the military services had a management structure in place for reviewing  individual services acquisitions valued at $500 million or more, but that  approach did not provide a departmentwide assessment of how spending  for services could be more effective. Also, OMB Circular A-11\u2019s Appendix  B, \u201cBudgetary Treatment of Lease-Purchases and Leases of Capital  Assets,\u201d was amended in 2005 to require agencies to submit to OMB for  review any service contracts that require the contractor to acquire or  construct assets valued over $50 million.

Additionally, each contract contains language  limiting the government\u2019s liability in the event the contract is terminated.  For example, the Air Force F-15C contract states that the government  reserves the right to terminate the contract for its sole convenience and  that such termination prior to the issuance of a funded task order shall  result in no payment to the contractor of any amount for any work  performed or costs incurred.

These Acts  encouraged agencies to use commercial acquisition procedures as a way  to streamline the acquisition process. Differences under commercial  versus non-commercial procedures pertain, for example, to the  contracting officer\u2019s determination of price reasonableness, the  government\u2019s right to inspect and test, and government rights to acquire  technical data. Appendix III outlines these and other key differences. The  Air Force contracts for simulator training are structured as commercial  acquisitions, but the Army\u2019s is not. Army officials told us they could not  justify calling the requirement \u201ccommercial\u201d because the simulators would  be configured to reflect combat helicopters, which do not exist in the  commercial market. In August 2005, a DOD Inspector General review of  the procurement procedures for the F-16 contract concluded that the  simulator service did not meet the definition or intent of a commercial  service and recommended that the Air Force not use commercial  procedures for the re-competed F-16 contract. The Air Force is using non- commercial procedures for the new contract.", "To allow for contractor recoupment of up-front investment, the strategy to  acquire simulator services envisioned longer duration contracts. This  coincided with practices in commercial industry, where long-term  relationships between buyer and seller were becoming common. The Air  Force and Army adopted this approach by including award-term incentives  in the contracts. This incentive can best be described as a variant of an  award-fee incentive, where the contractor is rewarded for excellent  performance with an extension of the contract period instead of additional  fee. Under the award-term concept, an assessment of the contractor\u2019s  performance is presented to the term determining official, who unilaterally  determines whether to award an extension or a reduction to the contract  ordering period. The potential total years of contract performance under  the simulator contracts range from 13 to 19.5 years. Appendix IV contains  the details of each contract.

The Army is not tracking the extent to which aviators are  using the contracted service for Flight School XXI simulators, even though  for simulators the Army owns, utilization rates are tracked. Program  officials told us that, because the Army is contracting for simulator  training to be available, there was no need to track the extent to which the  government is using this availability. Without data on utilization rates, the  Army has no basis for determining the extent to which it is using the  services it is buying.", "We found that Air Force installations are collecting information on  monthly utilization rates, as provided for in a May 1998 Air Force  instruction. However, rates at the locations we examined were often far  less than the hours the government purchased. For the three AWACS  mission training centers at Tinker AFB, for example, we found that, during  the 2-year period ending December 2005, monthly utilization rates were  frequently reported at less than 50 percent, as shown in figure 2.", "The Air Force Audit Agency has reported that installations had acquired  excess simulator capacity and unnecessarily consumed O&M funds that  could have been applied to other mission requirements. At Shaw AFB, for  example, the agency found that the Air Force had paid to use the simulator  10 hours a day, but only used it about 6 hours per day over a 4-month  period. The underutilization was attributed to missions being either not  scheduled or cancelled. Deployment requirements and range training were  identified as contributing factors. At Spangdahlem AB, the audit agency  reported that the Air Force had contracted for excess hours of simulator  availability to provide the maximum flexibility for pilot schedules. As a  result, the Air Force paid for enough simulator availability to hold 3,952  training events in fiscal year 2005, even though it needed only 1,982  training events to meet training requirements.", "Our analysis also found that monthly utilization rate calculations are  inconsistent among DMO system sites, even though an Air Force  instruction provides guidance on how to calculate and report utilization  data. We asked six installation quality assurance representatives how they  calculated utilization rates. Four of the six representatives were unaware  of the instruction, telling us that they had not received any guidance for  calculating simulator use. Several different calculation methods are being  used, as described in table 8.", "Air Combat Command officials told us the reported utilization rates are  used to determine whether or when to activate another training center at a  site. They also said they are using utilization rate information to determine  how many additional \u201clive\u201d flying hours can be moved to the simulators, in  particular to alleviate the burden of high fuel costs for aircraft. Because of  the very different methods being used to calculate the rates, however,  decisions are being made based on non-comparable information.", "In addition, we found that the Air Force\u2019s instruction for calculating  monthly simulator utilization rates could result in overstating the rates,  thus overstating the return on the expenditures made. The instruction  directs that utilization be reported when any or all devices at a given  location are used. Thus, the Air Force can pay to have four simulators  available at a site, use only one of the four during a training period, and  still report that simulator utilization was 100 percent as opposed to 25  percent of the paid availability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Payments for Tasks during Development Period Are Not Transparent", "paragraphs": ["Under the services approach, contractors commit to major investment at  the front end, with the return on their investment to come from hourly fees  received for providing simulator service. As an additional way to help the  contractor recoup its costs earlier, the government added \u201cpreparatory\u201d  tasks during the development period prior to the start of service. These  tasks are defined in the contracts as discrete events, such as site surveys  and training capability assessments, that are ordered and paid for prior to  the start of service. Payments for these tasks provide the contractor cash  flow between contract award and the planned service start dates and give  the government a contractual avenue for contract oversight prior to  receiving services. We found that the Air Force and Army have little  insight into what they are paying for under the preparatory tasks. Although  the invoices reflect only the discrete tasks, such as training capabilities  assessments, the wide range of invoice amounts\u2014from $91,000 to more  than $6.5 million for similar tasks\u2014and our discussions with contractor  officials suggest that the government is actually making milestone  payments to the contractors for a portion of their up-front costs to acquire  and develop the simulators.", "The original service contract concept for the F-15C, the first simulator  contract awarded, had no provision for the contractor to recoup any costs  during the development period, which usually lasts more than a year.  Figure 3 shows the development period before the start of simulator  services and the original hourly rate structure under the F-15C contract.", "This original approach, according to Air Force and contractor officials,  contributed to schedule and certification delays with the F-15C. Air Force  officials told us that they had no contractual avenue to obtain insight into  the contractor\u2019s performance during the development period and thus  were not aware that the contractor had encountered delays in obtaining  information from other programs and in determining the complexity of  some simulation elements. As a result, full service was not implemented  on schedule and certification of simulation service was delayed until after  the start of initial service. Further, according to the contractor, it suffered  an unrecoverable loss of income during the high-rate, initial service  period. Subsequently, based on feedback received from industry, the Air  Force changed its approach and incorporated preparatory services into  the F-15C contract and all subsequent DMO system contracts to obtain  more visibility into contractor activities during the development period.  The Army also paid for preparatory services during the development  period of the Flight School XXI contract.", "Our analysis of the Air Force\u2019s payments for preparatory services found  significantly disparate costs for site surveys and training assessments, as  reflected in tables 9 and 10, respectively.", "We asked Air Force and Army officials what was specifically included in  these preparatory services and how they determined what they received in  return for payments made. They told us that the contractors determine  what is included and needed for each service at each site.", "Three of the four contractors we spoke with agreed that funding for  preparatory tasks helped defray their development costs. They said that, in  effect, they bill for these tasks as milestone payments rather than for the  discrete tasks themselves. Thus, they are able to begin defraying hardware  and software development costs before the start of services. Officials from  the fourth contractor stated that site survey tasks are standard but that  there is some leeway in what is to be done for training capability  assessments and training capability requirements assessments.", "With the upcoming re-competition of the F-16 simulator training contract,  the Air Force may pay again for the preparatory service tasks in the new  contract\u2019s development period, having already spent nearly $42 million on  these tasks in the initial contract. Air Force officials told us they cannot  assume that potential offerors would make use of the preparatory work  the original contractor has performed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Award-term Evaluations Do Not Measure Key Acquisition Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["In an effort to measure performance and encourage the contractors to  perform in an efficient and effective manner, both the Air Force and Army  employ award-term incentives. However, while the award-term evaluation  areas include pilot and crew satisfaction, they do not always measure the  key acquisition outcomes of system availability and concurrency with  aircraft upgrades.", "While the Air Force does include system availability as an evaluation area,  it is assigned only 25 to 30 percent of the total score. Concurrency is not  included as a separate evaluation area. The Army\u2019s evaluation areas, on  the other hand, include concurrency but not system availability. While the  Army requires the tabulation and submission of such data as operational  availability and training service completion rate, these data are not  included in the award-term evaluations. In addition, several of the  evaluation areas include assessments of such things as responsiveness to  government requests for cost and pricing data for proposed work not in  the initial contract. We recently recommended that DOD move toward  more outcome-based award-fee criteria that would promote accountability  for acquisition outcomes, rather than include criteria such as  responsiveness to government customers or the quality of proposals  submitted.", "Table 11 compares the award-term evaluation areas and the weight given  to each area.", "The Air Force and Army both assign the largest weight to \u201cpilot/crew  satisfaction.\u201d However, this measure has limitations, particularly when it is  heavily relied on to inform award-term decisions. Air Force officials told  us that it is in the pilots\u2019 best interests to assign a high rating to this factor;  otherwise, they could be viewed as not having received adequate training  and could be asked to retake it. Additionally, pilots are frequently hurried  in completing their surveys and dash off check marks without much  consideration. Also, the distinction between the levels of satisfaction can  be blurry. For the Army, for example, if training and support are adversely  impacted for an \u201cextended period,\u201d user satisfaction is to be rated as  unsatisfactory. However, if the adverse impact occurs \u201cinfrequently or  temporarily,\u201d it is considered marginal. Because the terms are not defined,  the Army cannot be certain that pilots are providing consistent ratings.", "We also found that, under the Air Force\u2019s award-term plan, contractors  can earn an additional award-term year for only satisfactory performance  because awarded points are rolled over to the next evaluation period. A  contractor with only satisfactory performance in each of five rating areas  can receive up to 51 points each year; thus, within 2 years, it can  accumulate the 100 points needed for a 1-year contract extension. The   F-16 simulator training contractor, for example, which recently notified  the government that it could not continue to perform under the contract,  received overall award-term evaluations of \u201cvery good\u201d for the first two  rating periods (May 2002 through July 2003) and \u201csatisfactory\u201d in the third  and fourth periods (July 2003 through January 2005) and earned one  contract year extension. The Army has taken a different approach; under  its award-term plan it is very unlikely that the contractor can be awarded  contract extensions for \u201csatisfactory\u201d performance because rollover is  allowed only when more than 100 points are earned. Thus, the contractor  with only satisfactory performance cannot accumulate enough points for  an additional contract year.", "While service is not yet available, the F-15E simulator training contract,  awarded in August 2003, does not include an award-term incentive  because, according to the contracting officer, \u201cit doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Contractor  officials told us that the subjective nature of the criteria and the manner in  which they are applied negate the award term as a performance incentive.  Both the Air Force and Army indicated that they are moving away from  using award-term incentives on future contracts. The Air Force will not  include such an incentive in its re-competition for the F-16 simulator  training contract because, according to the DMO director, it has not been  found to be a significant motivator to the contractor; experience has  shown that withholding payment for poor service is a much more effective  tool to induce improved performance. In addition, since a recent statutory  provision limits future total contract periods of performance to 10 years,  an award-term provision can no longer be used to implement long-term  arrangements such as those in place for the existing simulator training  contracts.", "We recently reported that DOD has little evidence to support its belief that  award fees improve contractor performance and acquisition outcomes  and, in fact, frequently pays out most of the available award fee to  contractors regardless of their performance outcomes. We also found  that DOD contracts frequently included rollover provisions, where  unearned award fee from one evaluation period was shifted to a  subsequent evaluation period or periods, thus providing the contractor an  additional opportunity to earn previously unearned fee. We recommended  that DOD issue guidance on when rollover of award fee is appropriate. A  March 2006 guidance on award fee contracts states, among other things,  that use of rollover provisions should be the exception rather than the rule  and that the decision to use rollover provisions should be addressed in the  acquisition strategy, including a rationale as to why a rollover provision is  appropriate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Because simulator training had lost out in the internal competition for  procurement funds, the Air Force and Army turned to service contracts,  expecting that O&M funds would be made available to meet requirements.

In addition, although the Air  Force and Army plan to continue with the service contract approach for  simulator training, neither supported the decision with a thorough analysis  of the costs and benefits of alternative approaches to delivering the  training. Finally, the heightened risks associated with increased reliance  on contractors to deliver simulator training calls for careful attention to  contract management and oversight. Effective and well-managed  incentives for motivating performance are especially important. Better  government visibility into the contractors\u2019 activities, such as preparatory  tasks, during the development period is critical so that the government can  understand the basis for what are essentially milestone payments during  that phase.
