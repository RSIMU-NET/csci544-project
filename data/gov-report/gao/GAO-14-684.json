The USFHP is an association of six health care providers, referred to as designated providers, which took ownership and control of U.S. Public Health Service hospitals in 1982 when Congress enacted legislation that made these facilities part of DOD's health care system. During the implementation of TRICARE in the 1990s, Congress required the designated providers to offer the TRICARE Prime benefit to their enrollees. While the USFHP is a relatively small program\u2014approximately 134,000 enrollees\u2014there is significant overlap with the MCSCs in several key areas, including benefits, geographic service areas, and provider networks. For example, four of the six USFHP designated providers have more than 80 percent of their service area zip codes included in areas where the MCSCs offer TRICARE Prime. Furthermore, the USFHP remains a distinct statutory program that is not integrated with the rest of the MHS. This limits DOD's ability to increase efficiency by maximizing the use of its direct care system of military treatment facilities (MTF), which USFHP enrollees are generally precluded from using because the USFHP's payment structure is intended to cover all enrollees' health care costs. The role of the USFHP has not been reassessed since TRICARE was implemented in the 1990s. However, DOD officials told us that there is not a function that the USFHP designated providers serve that the MCSCs could not perform. Furthermore, officials from all three MCSCs\u2014which together serve over 4.5 million Prime enrollees\u2014said that they would likely have the capacity and capability to provide TRICARE coverage to all current USFHP enrollees, if needed.", "Because the USFHP's role of offering TRICARE Prime is duplicative of the role of the MCSCs, DOD has incurred added costs and inefficiencies. Although DOD would incur health care costs for the USFHP enrollees regardless of with whom they are enrolled, DOD pays administrative costs and profits to two different groups of contractors for providing the same TRICARE Prime benefit to the same population of eligible beneficiaries in many of the same areas. However, outside of the negotiated payment amounts, no one knows the designated providers' actual costs for administering the program since the USFHP contracts are characterized in statute as commercial item contracts. This means that the designated providers are exempt from sharing certified cost or pricing data with DOD, and they have been unwilling to share uncertified cost or pricing data when requested. As a result, DOD does not know how much of the approximately $1.1 billion it pays the USFHP designated providers annually actually goes toward their administrative costs and profit versus the cost of health care services. DOD also incurs other expenses for the USFHP through support contracts, including a $21 million data support contract, and through the management of various aspects of the program. Eliminating this statutorily required program would not only eliminate unnecessary costs and inefficiencies, but would also free up departmental resources that could be better used to manage other aspects of the TRICARE program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should terminate DOD's authority to contract with the USFHP designated providers in a manner consistent with a reasonable transition of affected USFHP enrollees into TRICARE's regional managed care program or other health care programs as appropriate.

For example,  MCSCs are to first assign Prime enrollees to a Primary Care Manager  located at an MTF until its enrollment capacity has been reached, at  which point, enrollees are assigned to a Primary Care Manager from the  civilian provider network. MCSCs are also required to give their region\u2019s  MTFs the right of first refusal for all specialty care referrals for Prime  enrollees to ensure that, if it has the capability and capacity to administer  the care, the MTF has the opportunity to do so prior to referring them to  the civilian network.

Given  the extent of overlap with the MCSCs\u2019 Prime Service Areas, which are  generally around MTFs, thousands of USFHP enrollees are precluded  from using the direct care system.

Although the USFHP designated providers do not bill DOD for these  discounts and services, it is not known how the designated providers  account for these discounts and services in developing their proposed  capitation payments.

MTFs rely on beneficiaries as a source of education and training  opportunities. MTF officials we spoke with expressed concerns that the  USFHP program detracts from the volume and complexity of cases  needed to maintain a robust graduate medical education and skills  training program. For example, a military service medical official noted  that medical facilities with Magnetic Resonance Imaging capabilities seek  to maximize the use of this equipment and strive to offer their providers  opportunities for related specialty care training while treating enrollees  needing this type of service. However, if the MTF is located near a  USFHP, this official noted that such training opportunities may be more  limited because any USFHP enrollees who need these services would not  obtain them from their local MTF.", "In addition, since the USFHP contracts are full-risk capitated  arrangements, the designated providers are not limited to the TRICARE  provider reimbursement rates, and thus have the flexibility to offer their  providers higher rates or other incentives.

The increased flexibility in setting reimbursement rates may provide the  USFHP designated providers a competitive advantage over the MCSCs  in recruiting providers to their networks. The USFHP designated providers  told us that they exceed the TRICARE provider reimbursement rates on  occasion, depending on their market areas, although some generally use  the TRICARE rates as guidelines. DOD officials told us of an example  where the USFHP designated provider recruited a primary care provider  group, which resulted in the group leaving the MCSC network, and these  officials were concerned that reimbursement rates may have been a  factor in this decision.

DOD also  reiterated our statement that if the USFHP were to be eliminated, it will be  important to make provisions to carefully transition USFHP enrollees to  other health care programs.", "In its response, DOD confirmed that our factual determinations about the  USFHP are correct. DOD also provided specific comments on many of  the program characteristics we identified, agreeing that they result in  unnecessary costs and other inefficiencies for the department. In  particular, DOD stated that the USFHP sole source contracts are an  exception to congressional and DOD policy favoring competition in  contracting. DOD also noted that the unnecessary duplication between  the USFHP and MCSCs creates costs for the department, as necessary  care is already provided through the MCSCs and the direct care system  and that DOD is required to expend considerable resources in its annual  negotiations with the designated providers to set capitation payment  rates. DOD also stated that the separate existence of the USFHP is an  exception to the general DOD policy of favoring an integrated MHS to  support readiness and cost-effectiveness. DOD further acknowledged  that the USFHP designated providers are allowed to offer their providers  higher reimbursements and other incentives that draw beneficiaries away  from the more cost effective MCSCs, which DOD characterized as an  exception to congressional and DOD policy favoring a uniform TRICARE  benefit.", "DOD\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix IV.
