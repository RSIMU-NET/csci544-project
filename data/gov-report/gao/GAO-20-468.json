The experts stated that to avoid delays in 5G deployment, the commercial sector needs access to more mid-band spectrum.", "These experts highlighted the need for mid-band spectrum for 5G due to mid-band's use internationally and because of its properties. Mid-band spectrum allows for higher data capacity than lower bands and can penetrate physical obstacles over long distances\u2014a property known as \u201cpropagation\u201d\u2014 better than higher bands (see fig. 2).", "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has some efforts under way to make additional mid-band spectrum available but so far has primarily made high-band spectrum available for 5G because it is more readily available. Making more mid-band spectrum available to the commercial sector will be challenging, as current mid-band spectrum users include federal government users that may not be able to readily transition to new or less favorable spectrum bands.", "FCC's planning document for 5G includes a section on making additional spectrum available but does not clearly identify specific and measurable performance goals or measures to manage the spectrum demands for 5G. Without such strategic planning efforts, FCC will be unable to determine the effectiveness of its spectrum management efforts, particularly related to the congested mid-band spectrum that is critical to 5G deployment.", "The experts GAO convened also stated that 5G deployment would likely exacerbate disparities in access to telecommunications services, known as the \u201cdigital divide.\u201d Specifically, experts as well as stakeholders GAO interviewed said that 5G using high-band spectrum\u2014which allows for high data capacity\u2014is likely to be first deployed in areas already equipped with much of the necessary infrastructure.", "Experts said the areas with existing infrastructure are generally urban, densely populated, high-income areas as opposed to rural or low-income areas.

We also interviewed FCC and NTIA  officials, as well as relevant stakeholders, including wireless carriers and  industry associations. Additionally, we issued a brief questionnaire to  approximately 150 GAO-identified stakeholders with knowledge of 5G  networks (e.g., representatives from the federal government, academia,  industry, and consumer groups) to identify challenges to deploying such  networks in the U.S. These stakeholders were identified by reviewing  previous GAO reports and through background research and were  selected to provide a range of perspectives on 5G deployment. We  reviewed and consolidated responses. We then convened a one-and-a- half day meeting of 17 experts from academia, industry, and consumer  groups to discuss the challenges identified through the questionnaire, as  well as potential actions the federal government could take to address  those challenges. We selected these experts with assistance from the  National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to obtain a  range of perspectives on 5G deployment. We also interviewed four  localities about their experiences with 5G deployment, which we selected  based on, among other things, cities where wireless carriers have  announced they will launch 5G services. The information we obtained  from these interviews is not meant to be generalizable to other cities\u2019  experiences but is meant to provide illustrative examples of actual 5G  deployment.

FCC is the federal agency responsible for allocating  spectrum for consumer and commercial purposes (as well as state and  local government uses), assigning spectrum licenses to those entities,  and making spectrum available for use by unlicensed devices. Licensing  assigns frequencies of spectrum, in a specific area, and\u2014generally  speaking, according to FCC officials\u2014to a specific entity, such as a  telecommunications company.

For example, one expert  noted that mid-band spectrum provides 5G network characteristics that  cannot be achieved using solely low- or high-band spectrum. Signals  using mid-band spectrum have better propagation (i.e., ability to  effectively penetrate or bend around physical obstacles and cover  distances) than signals using high-band spectrum (see fig. 3) and carry  more data than low-band spectrum.", "Global harmonization of spectrum, or the use of the same spectrum  bands among countries around the world, helps ensure that 5G devices  will work across countries. Countries that harmonize spectrum for 5G may  benefit by making international travel and communication more  convenient.

FCC also began an  auction of 3,400 MHz of spectrum in the upper 37, 39 and 47 GHz  bands in December 2019; bidding in this auction concluded on March  5, 2020.", "FCC officials told us that they are aware that mid-band spectrum will be  particularly important for 5G deployment despite congestion amongst  federal users in this spectrum range. FCC is taking steps to make some  additional mid-band spectrum available. For example, in February 2020,  FCC announced that it had adopted new rules to auction 280 MHz of mid- band spectrum, which can be used for 5G purposes. This spectrum, (3.7  to 3.98 GHz) is currently being used primarily by satellite operators. In  March 2020, FCC released a public notice seeking comment on  procedures to be used for the auction of this spectrum, which is currently  scheduled to begin on December 8, 2020. As another example, according  to FCC, in April 2020 FCC provided for expanded Wi-Fi use in 1,200 MHz  of spectrum in the 6 GHz band. Such advanced Wi-Fi networks, FCC told  us, will be capable of working hand-in-hand with commercial networks to  enable robust 5G device broadband connectivity and may be able to help  alleviate commercial wireless network congestion. Other activities,  according to FCC, include: (1) opening a proceeding in the 3.1 to 3.55  GHz band to consider potential shared use between federal operations  and flexible use commercial services; and (2) authorizing a private entity  to deploy a low-power terrestrial nationwide network in certain  frequencies that will make available additional spectrum for advanced  wireless services, including 5G.", "FCC and NTIA also developed a spectrum-sharing framework in the 3.5  GHz band that will increase the availability of this mid-band spectrum  targeted globally for 5G. This framework separates users into three  hierarchical \u201ctiers,\u201d giving differing priority access to the spectrum (3.55  GHz to 3.7 GHz, also known as the \u201cCitizens Broadband Radio Service\u201d)  depending on the user\u2019s tier. The first tier includes incumbents, such as  federal users (e.g., U.S. Navy radar systems) and a number of  commercial users. These users receive first priority and protection from  all other users. Tier two users\u2014referred to as \u201cPriority Access  Licensees\u201d\u2014are, according to FCC, wireless users that obtain licenses at  auction or, following the auction, via secondary markets. These users,  which can include wireless carriers, have access to the same mid-band  spectrum when a tier one user is not using the spectrum, but FCC  officials said these users will need to move to another frequency when a  nearby tier one user accesses the same frequency. Third tier users  access the band as available.", "FCC officials stated that this spectrum-sharing framework will allow for  increased spectral utilization of mid-band spectrum in a band like 3.5 GHz  and that individual users (e.g., the public using mobile devices) will not  notice any difference in their network connection. According to FCC  officials, the technology supporting this spectrum-sharing framework is  now authorized for full commercial deployment. They also said that FCC  certified administrators in January 2020 to coordinate this framework,  which will allow for full commercial operation, and that FCC has  scheduled to begin auctioning licenses for tier two users on July 23, 2020.", "Other federal agencies are also involved with managing spectrum in the  United States. For example, NTIA, which manages federal spectrum use,  is working with FCC on the technical design and implementation of the  spectrum-sharing framework discussed above. NTIA is also seeking to  identify additional spectrum for 5G, in conjunction with FCC. According to  FCC, some of the most useful portions of mid-band spectrum are already  occupied by a federal incumbent and FCC is limited in its ability to make  this spectrum available for commercial use. According to NTIA officials,  the agency is focused on meeting the spectrum requirements set forth in  the Making Opportunities for Broadband Investment and Limiting  Excessive and Needless Obstacles to Wireless Act (MOBILE NOW Act)  of 2018, which requires NTIA and FCC to prepare a report by 2022  identifying potential spectrum for future use. For example, NTIA is  currently studying the feasibility of spectrum sharing in the 3.45 to 3.55  GHz band.", "Overall, FCC\u2019s efforts, in conjunction with NTIA, to date have primarily  made more high-band spectrum available for 5G purposes. According to  the Department of Commerce\u2019s 2019 Annual Report on the Status of  Spectrum Repurposing, 84 percent (4,950 MHz out of 5,863 MHz) of the  spectrum made available by FCC and NTIA has been within high-band.  According to the report, 12 percent (709 MHz of 5,863 MHz) of the  spectrum FCC and NTIA have made available has been within mid-band.  NTIA officials said there has been more of a focus on repurposing high- band spectrum because there is a far greater amount of this spectrum  available for use and fewer incumbent users within this spectrum. Further,  NTIA officials stated that these amounts are a snapshot as of the time the  2019 report was issued and the ratios will change, as additional spectrum  is made available. Other recent FCC actions, including those described  above, may make more mid-band spectrum available in the future.

Leading practices, as identified  in our previous work, show that successful organizations base their  strategic planning, to a large extent, on the interests and expectations of  their stakeholders, which could include other federal agencies, Congress,  and others. Thus, involving stakeholders in the strategic planning  process helps ensure that the agency\u2019s efforts are targeted at the highest  priorities.", "According to FCC officials, it can be difficult to set goals for specific  amounts of spectrum to be made available because of, in part, the fast- changing nature of the telecommunications industry.

This effort is the starting point and foundation for  defining what the agency seeks to accomplish, identifying the strategies it  will use to achieve desired results and then determining how well it  succeeds in reaching results-oriented goals and achieving objectives.  Proactively developing performance goals, strategies and measures\u2014 with the involvement of relevant stakeholders\u2014to manage spectrum  demands associated with 5G deployment would help ensure that  sufficient amounts of spectrum in consecutive portions are made  available to avoid delaying the deployment and limiting the capabilities of  5G networks.

Additionally, the 5G FAST Plan identifies a number of current and future  strategies for FCC but does not include specific performance goals or  measures that would allow it to understand what those strategies are  intended to achieve and the effects those strategies are having on the  digital divide as 5G networks are deployed.", "These omissions are contrary to leading practices of results-oriented  organizations identified in previous GAO work. These leading practices  call for performance goals and related strategies and measures, as we  previously described. Such leading practices, as previously noted,  include identifying: (1) specific and measurable performance goals to  show progress toward broad strategic goals; (2) the activities (also known  as strategies) the agency will take to make progress toward its goals; and  (3) related performance measures to assess the results of the strategies  and actual progress made toward the performance goals.", "FCC officials said that they are focusing on reducing the digital divide and  have set high-level goals, but have not established goals specific to 5G.  However, by establishing specific and measurable performance goals for  5G with related strategies and measures, FCC will have greater  assurance that it has properly planned actions to effectively address the  likely adverse effects on the digital divide as 5G networks are deployed.  For example, specific goals for 5G will help FCC assess the effectiveness  of its recent decision to make $9 billion in Universal Service Fund support  available to carriers to deploy 5G services."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The High Cost of 5G Infrastructure May Affect 5G Deployment", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Experts Identified Economic Issues as a Key Challenge", "paragraphs": ["Experts told us that deploying 5G infrastructure will be very costly for  carriers. According to international standards established for 5G  networks, to support all the new capabilities of 5G, carriers will need to  replace their 4G core networks with new 5G equipment. These  standalone 5G networks will provide new capabilities such as ultra- reliable low latency communications that could enable the development of  new, more advanced use cases. In the meantime, carriers are currently  deploying hybrid 5G, which uses existing 4G network infrastructure, but  they still must make some upgrades to their 4G equipment and in some  instances, deploy additional cell sites, such as small cells, to provide  hybrid 5G service. These small cells can be installed on existing  structures, such as buildings or streetlights. See figure 4 for examples of  small cells.", "Some carriers are deploying 5G using low-band spectrum, which is much  less costly to deploy because carriers can use their existing 4G cell  towers. However, low-band spectrum does not enable the same data  speeds as other types of 5G. As discussed previously, the United States  has made a large amount of high-band spectrum available for 5G. The  use of such spectrum increases the cost of 5G infrastructure deployment  because it requires more small cell installations. Experts suggested that,  because of the increased costs, carriers may limit deployment of high- band 5G network equipment to high-density areas such as sections of  cities or stadiums. Moreover, a recent Defense Innovation Board report  referenced a preliminary study that indicated that carriers would have to  install approximately 13 million base stations, at a cost of approximately  $400 billion, to deliver 5G service using this high-band spectrum to 72  percent of the population.", "In addition to installing the actual cell site equipment, each small cell site  has costs associated with it:", "Fiber: Experts told us that fiber deployment is critical to the success  of 5G. They noted that getting enough fiber in place to support the  large increase in small cells will require a massive infrastructure  deployment. For example, experts stated that currently there is not  enough fiber in the ground in most places to support 5G. The fiber  network must also have the capacity to handle the increased traffic  from 5G. Experts told us that the new fiber needed for 5G will be  costly to install, both in urban and rural areas. For example, installing  fiber in urban areas can be costly due to local rules and difficulty  accessing the right-of-way. In rural areas, fiber deployment costs are  high because carriers must install fiber over longer distances to reach  customers.", "Power: In addition to fiber, new cell sites also require a power source.", "While some small cells are being installed on light poles that have an  existing power source, an expert noted that sometimes these are only  powered on at night. Another expert noted that carriers may need to  install back-up power sources, in case of a power outage.", "Permitting: When installing a new cell site, carriers generally must  seek approval from the federal, state, or local government that  controls the right-of-way or property where the cell site is to be  located. This may require carriers to pay permitting fees or meet  certain aesthetic requirements. Experts told us that the fact that  different cities have different permitting regimes drives up the cost to  build infrastructure. For example, experts told us that making sure  small cells meet different localities\u2019 requirements for design,  dimension, and other aesthetic requirements is difficult for carriers  and could slow deployment. However, other experts noted that these  local permitting processes enable local governments to ensure 5G is  being deployed in such a way that would benefit their citizens. For  example, according to a report by the National League of Cities, San  Jose, California created a tiered pricing structure to encourage  carriers to cover more of the city. The city plans to use some of the  revenues from this permitting process to help close the digital divide in  the city, for example by allowing people to check out devices at  libraries.", "Experts\u2019 Perspectives on Permitting Costs  \u201cThere are several thousand municipalities in the United States, each  of which has different paperwork, processes, and payment  mechanisms for siting small cells, which increases 5G deployment  cost and time and inhibits the rollout of the networks.\u201d \u201c5G deployment requires many more small cells than 4G required  macro cells, thereby increasing the reliance on public right-of-ways. As  a result, we have seen cities restricted from charging market rates for  permitting. However, cities play a really crucial role in ensuring that the  deployment of these technologies and the use of public right-of-ways  is coupled with public interest obligations.\u201d", "Carriers\u2019 current financial condition will also affect how they deploy 5G,  including where and what type of networks they deploy. Experts noted  that carriers in the United States may not currently have the capital  required to fund large-scale deployments of 5G due, in part, to the costs  of recent business decisions. Additionally, an expert mentioned that  carriers would likely only be able to afford to deploy high-band spectrum  in small sections of cities. Another expert predicted that carriers may not  replace existing 4G equipment until it becomes less reliable over time,  leading to a more comprehensive roll-out of 5G in 6 to 8 years. A  representative from a carrier said that while it did not anticipate any  additional revenue from 5G deployment, carriers still must deploy 5G  because to not do so would place their companies at extreme risk of  losing large numbers of customers, potentially eroding their revenue  base.", "Experts\u2019 Perspectives on Economic Challenges to 5G  Deployment  \u201cMost of the major carriers in the United States aren't in great financial  shape. They've leveraged up and have made acquisitions into new  spaces. \u2026The challenge for these carriers is do they have the billions  of dollars required for another large-scale capital program, or do they  just sort of put it out there because it\u2019s good PR.\u201d \u201cRight now, from an economic standpoint, there isn't a strong case for  making this enormous investment in 5G and it feels like it's more of a  defensive play by carriers.\u201d", "Experts also noted that consumers are not always willing to pay more for  5G service, which reduces carriers\u2019 ability to recoup their deployment  investments. For example, one expert questioned whether consumers in  the United States were willing to pay anything more for 5G, and another  noted that carriers are currently charging the same price for 5G and 4G  service. Additionally, experts told us that there is no clear use case  currently developed for 5G in the United States, besides enhanced mobile  broadband. The 5G use cases often cited, such as remote surgery or  autonomous vehicles, are unlikely to be developed in the near future.  Without such use cases, they said, carriers lack a strong business case  for deploying 5G. Other experts noted, however, that 4G use cases\u2014 such as social media or ride sharing apps\u2014did not exist when carriers  started to deploy 4G, but were developed after 4G was in place. Similarly,  experts predicted that 5G use cases would be developed after 5G  networks were available in the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FCC and Others Have Taken Some Steps to Reduce Deployment Costs", "paragraphs": ["To help reduce the cost of deploying 5G infrastructure, FCC has taken  steps to expedite the permitting and review of small cells. For example,  FCC issued a Programmatic Agreement for the Collocation of Wireless  Antennas, which reduces the regulatory approval process for collocating  small cells that are on existing infrastructure, such as utility poles. In  addition, FCC adopted an order and declaratory ruling regarding state  and local government reviews of small cell applications, which set  parameters for fees and time frames for these reviews. This Order went  into effect in January of 2019; however, it is currently being challenged in  federal court.", "FCC also adopted an order that, among other things, exempted the  construction of small cells from compliance with federal historic  preservation and environmental review that were applied to large macro  towers. A recent federal court decision, overturned the exemption and  the FCC repealed the section of the order.", "In addition to the steps FCC has taken to limit regulatory and permitting  costs, experts suggested that carriers could consider sharing their  network infrastructure to reduce their capital expenditure for deploying  5G. Through infrastructure sharing agreements, two or more carriers  share infrastructure such as radio antennas or fiber to deliver service to  users. This sharing reduces deployment costs for carriers and allows  them to deploy in areas where the costs would normally be prohibitive,  such as rural areas. Such sharing agreements can increase choices for  consumers, as more carriers can afford to operate in areas they would  not normally be able to. FCC officials said that industry is already moving  toward greater shared infrastructure and FCC\u2019s efforts are designed to  promote it. However, such sharing agreements may have the potential to  decrease competition, if not well monitored. In addition, a carrier may not  be willing to share infrastructure with other carriers for fear of losing its  competitive advantage. For example, according to a report by the Body of  European Regulators, a carrier that is the only one offering service in a  certain area could lose competitive advantage and not be rewarded for its  investments in the area under a sharing agreement.", "Infrastructure sharing is common in other countries; the same report by  the Body of European Regulators found that carriers in 14 European  countries had active sharing agreements with joint deployment in place.  For example, in Spain, some carriers share their mobile networks in areas  with fewer than 175,000 inhabitants. According to the report, 5G will  further incentivize network sharing, as carriers need to deploy more small  cells and fiber. Experts told us, however, that such sharing agreements  were uncommon in the United States. Instead, carriers typically install  their own network infrastructure, leading to overlapping networks and  higher overall deployment costs. FCC officials said they recognize the  benefits of infrastructure sharing, especially for 5G, but said that the  decision about whether to share infrastructure is ultimately up to each  carrier. Officials noted that carriers will use their own economic and  engineering analysis in determining how to deploy 5G."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["5G networks could create significant economic benefits for the United  States, as companies develop products and technologies to access 5G\u2019s  new capabilities. Carriers currently face challenges to deploying 5G,  however, which could delay or even limit the United States\u2019 opportunity to  realize those benefits. FCC has taken a number of actions regarding 5G  deployment, but it has not clearly developed specific and measurable  performance goals and related measures\u2013with the involvement of  relevant stakeholders, including NTIA\u2013to manage the spectrum demands  associated with 5G deployment. This makes FCC unable to demonstrate  whether the progress being made in freeing up spectrum is achieving any  specific goals, particularly as it relates to congested mid-band spectrum.  Additionally, without having established specific and measurable  performance goals with related strategies and measures for mitigating  5G\u2019s potential effects on the digital divide, FCC will not be able to assess  the extent to which its actions are addressing the digital divide or what  actions would best help all Americans obtain access to wireless networks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following two recommendations to FCC:  The Chairman of FCC should develop, in coordination with NTIA and  other relevant stakeholders, specific and measurable performance  goals\u2014with related strategies and measures\u2014to manage spectrum  demands associated with 5G deployment.

However, as we describe in our report, FCC still has not engaged in this  strategic planning effort. Our past work has found that there is no more  important element in results-oriented management than an agency\u2019s  strategic planning effort.

These stakeholders included officials from the federal government, as  well as representatives from academia, industry, and consumer groups.  Stakeholders were identified by reviewing previous GAO reports and  through background research and were selected to provide a range of  perspectives on 5G deployment.

We conducted a content analysis to categorize the responses  into a final set of 13 challenges. See table 1 for a list of the challenges.  Because content analysis relies on the judgment of coders to determine  whether qualitative data reflects particular categories, we took several  steps to ensure that this judgment remained objective, accurate, and  consistent.

Staff from NASEM assisted us  in identifying experts for the meeting. To identify the experts appropriate  for this meeting, NASEM relied on staff experience and professional  judgment drawn from its Computer Science and Telecommunications  Board.

We  selected these stakeholders based on our prior telecommunications work,  other 5G literature, and recommendations from stakeholders we  interviewed to provide a range of perspectives on 5G deployment.  Stakeholders were from two universities, four industry associations, five  wireless carriers, as well as five local governments and organizations. To  identify these local governments, we selected a group of cities to include  those where wireless carriers have announced they will launch 5G  services, and selected a mix of cities where there was local opposition to  5G, as well as cities with state or local laws regarding small cell  permitting. We then selected lower-population density cities in the same  states as those cities, using U.S. Census data. To select these cities, we  identified the county with the median population density of the state, and  then selected the city which holds the county seat. We attempted to  contact all the selected cities and were able to schedule and hold  interviews with representatives from Los Angeles, California; Jacksonville,  Florida; Greenville, Illinois; and Naples, Florida.
