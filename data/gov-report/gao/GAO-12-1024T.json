GAO reported in May 2010 that (1) TSA deployed SPOT before first determining whether there was a scientifically valid basis for using behavior and appearance indicators to reliably identify passengers who may pose a risk; and (2) it is unknown if the SPOT program has ever resulted in the arrest of anyone who is a terrorist, or who was planning to engage in terrorist related activity, although there is other evidence that terrorists have transited through SPOT airports. GAO recommended in May 2010 that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) convene an independent panel of experts to review the methodology of the ongoing validation study on the SPOT program to determine whether it is sufficiently comprehensive to validate the program. DHS concurred and subsequently revised its validation study to include an independent expert review. DHS's study, completed in April 2011, found that SPOT was more effective than random screening to varying degrees; however, DHS noted limitations to the study, such as that it was not designed to comprehensively validate whether SPOT can be used to reliably identify individuals who pose a security risk. GAO is currently reviewing the program and will issue our report next year. TSA has taken actions to enhance the security of cargo on inbound aircraft, but challenges remain. For example, TSA issued new screening requirements aimed at enhancing the security of cargo on aircraft, such as prohibiting the transport of air cargo on passenger aircraft from Yemen. In June 2010, GAO recommended that TSA develop a mechanism to verify the accuracy of all screening data. TSA concurred in part and required air carriers to report inbound cargo screening data, but has not yet fully addressed the recommendation. In June 2012, TSA required air carriers to screen 100 percent of inbound air cargo transported on passenger aircraft by December 3, 2012. However, air carriers and TSA face challenges in implementing this requirement and in providing reasonable assurance that screening is being conducted at reported levels. DHS and TSA have experienced difficulties establishing acquisition program baselines, schedules, and cost estimates for the Electronic Baggage Screening Program (EBSP). For example, GAO reported in July 2011 that TSA had established a schedule for the acquisition of the explosives detection systems (EDS) TSA deploys to screen checked baggage, but it did not fully comply with leading practices. GAO recommended that DHS develop and maintain a schedule for the EBSP in accordance with leading practices. DHS concurred. GAO reported in July 2012 that TSA has worked to enhance general aviation security, such as though issuing regulations, but there are weaknesses in its process for vetting foreign flight school student applicants, and in DHS's process for identifying flight school students who may be in the country illegally. For example, TSA's program to help determine whether flight school students pose a security threat does not determine whether they entered the country legally. GAO recommended actions that DHS and TSA could take to address these concerns, with which DHS and TSA have concurred, and are starting to take actions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making any new recommendations.

At the more than  450 TSA-regulated airports in the United States, prior to boarding an  aircraft, all passengers, their accessible property, and their checked  baggage are screened pursuant to TSA-established procedures. TSA  relies upon multiple layers of security to deter, detect, and disrupt persons  posing a potential risk to aviation security. These layers include behavior  detection officers (BDOs), who examine passenger behaviors and  appearances to identify passengers who might pose a potential security  risk at TSA-regulated airports; travel document checkers, who examine  tickets, passports, and other forms of identification; transportation security  officers (TSO), who are responsible for screening passengers and their  carry-on baggage at passenger checkpoints using x-ray equipment,  magnetometers, Advanced Imaging Technology, and other devices, as  well as for screening checked baggage; random employee screening; and  checked baggage screening systems. The Implementing  Recommendations of 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 further mandates that  the Secretary of Homeland Security establish a system to screen 100  percent of cargo transported on passenger aircraft, and defines screening  for purposes of meeting this mandate, in general, as a physical  examination or the use of nonintrusive methods to assess whether cargo  poses a threat to transportation security. Such cargo ranges in size from  1 pound to several tons and ranges in type from perishable commodities  to machinery.  In 2011, all-cargo carriers transported approximately 66  percent (6.9 billion pounds) of the total cargo (10.4 billion pounds)  transported to the United States. Additionally, TSA has responsibilities  for general aviation security, and developed the Alien Flight Student  Program (AFSP) to help determine whether foreign students enrolling at  flight schools pose a security threat. U.S. government threat  assessments have discussed plans by terrorists to use general aviation  aircraft to conduct attacks. Further, analysis conducted on behalf of TSA  has indicated that larger general aviation aircraft may be able to cause  significant damage to buildings and other structures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Has Taken Actions to Validate the Science Underlying Its Behavior Detection Program, but More Work Remains", "paragraphs": ["We reported in May 2010 that TSA deployed SPOT nationwide before  first determining whether there was a scientifically valid basis for using  behavior and appearance indicators as a means for reliably identifying  passengers who may pose a risk to the U.S. aviation system.", "According to TSA, SPOT was deployed before a scientific validation of  the program was completed to help address potential threats to the  aviation system, such as those posed by suicide bombers. TSA also  stated that the program was based upon scientific research available at  the time regarding human behaviors. We reported in May 2010 that  approximately 14,000 passengers were referred to law enforcement  officers under SPOT from May 2004 through August 2008. Of these  passengers, 1,083 were arrested for various reasons, including being  illegal aliens (39 percent), having outstanding warrants (19 percent), and  possessing fraudulent documents (15 percent). The remaining 27 percent  were arrested for other reasons such as intoxication, unruly behavior,  theft, domestic violence, and possession of prohibited items. As noted in  our May 2010 report, SPOT officials told us that it is not known if the  SPOT program has ever resulted in the arrest of anyone who is a  terrorist, or who was planning to engage in terrorist-related activity. More  recent TSA data covering the period from November 1, 2010, to April 18,  2012, indicates that SPOT referred 60,717 passengers for additional  screening, which resulted in 3,803 referrals to law enforcement officers  and 353 arrests. Of these 353 arrests, 23 percent were related to  immigration status, 23 percent were drug-related, 9 percent were related  to fraudulent documents, 22 percent were related to outstanding  warrants, and 28 percent were for other offenses.", "A 2008 report issued by the National Research Council of the National  Academy of Sciences stated that the scientific evidence for behavioral  monitoring is preliminary in nature. The report also noted that an  information-based program, such as a behavior detection program,  should first determine if a scientific foundation exists and use scientifically  valid criteria to evaluate its effectiveness before deployment. The report  added that such programs should have a sound experimental basis and  that the documentation on the program\u2019s effectiveness should be  reviewed by an independent entity capable of evaluating the supporting  scientific evidence.", "As we reported in May 2010, an independent panel of experts could help  DHS determine if the SPOT program is based on valid scientific principles  that can be effectively applied in an airport environment for  counterterrorism purposes.

However, DHS noted that the identification of  high-risk passengers was rare in both the SPOT and random tests. DHS\u2019s  study also noted that the assessment was an initial validation step, and  was not designed to fully validate whether behavior detection can be used  to reliably identify individuals in an airport environment who pose a  security risk. According to DHS, further research will be needed to  comprehensively validate the program.", "In addition, DHS determined that the base rate, or frequency, of SPOT  behavioral indicators observed by TSA to detect suspicious passengers  was very low and that these observed indicators were highly varied  across the traveling public. Although details about DHS\u2019s findings related  to these indicators are sensitive security information, the low base rate  and high variability of traveler behaviors highlights the challenge that TSA  faces in effectively implementing a standardized list of SPOT behavioral  indicators. In addition, DHS outlined several limitations to the study. For  example, the study noted that BDOs were aware of whether individuals  they were screening were selected as the result of identified SPOT  indicators or random selection. DHS stated that this had the potential to  introduce bias into the assessment. DHS also noted that SPOT data from  January 2006 through October 2010 were used in its analysis of  behavioral indicators even though questions about the reliability of the  data exist.", "The study made recommendations related to SPOT in three areas: (1) future validation  efforts, (2) comparing SPOT with other screening programs, and (3) broader program  evaluation issues.

In March 2011, we reported  that Congress may wish to consider the study\u2019s results in making future  funding decisions regarding the program. TSA is reviewing the study\u2019s  findings and assessing the steps needed to address DHS\u2019s  recommendations. If TSA decides to implement the recommendations in  the April 2011 DHS validation study, it may be years away from knowing  whether there is a scientifically valid basis for using behavior detection  techniques to help secure the aviation system against terrorist threats  given that the initial study took about 4 years to complete.

Passenger  air carriers expressed concerns about being able to meet the 100 percent  screening mandate as it applies to inbound cargo stating that it would  cause significant disruptions in the air cargo supply chain, among other  issues. In response to these concerns, TSA officials stated that they  revised the proposed requirements and issued new passenger security  requirements in June 2012.

TSA relies on data submitted by  passenger carriers to determine the amount of air cargo screened on  inbound passenger aircraft but there is no requirement for all-cargo  carriers to report comparable screening data to TSA, even though most of  the cargo shipped from abroad into the United States is shipped on all- cargo carriers. Thus, TSA does not know the extent to which all-cargo  carriers are screening cargo or meeting the enhanced screening  requirements introduced after the October 2010 incident in Yemen.  Officials from two global all-cargo carriers said that submitting such  information to TSA would be feasible because they are already collecting  this data internally, but officials from two other all-cargo carriers stated  that reporting screening data to TSA would be challenging because of  staffing limitations or because such data may not be available. TSA  officials said that TSA does not require that all-cargo carriers submit  screening data because it has focused its efforts on collecting data from  passenger air carriers in support of meeting the 100 percent mandate.  TSA officials stated that TSA may consider opportunities to capture  additional inbound air cargo information, but has not yet weighed the  costs and benefits of doing so because it has focused its efforts on  establishing the ACAS pilot program, which DHS established to more  readily indentify high-risk cargo. The pilot program is a key effort to  identify high-risk cargo prior to aircraft departing from foreign airports, but  is not intended to provide TSA with screening data, which if collected and  verified, could provide additional assurance that all-cargo carriers are  complying with TSA\u2019s enhanced screening requirements. To help TSA  better determine what actions are needed, if any, to ensure that all-cargo  carriers are complying with the agency\u2019s enhanced screening  requirements, we recommended in May 2012 that DHS assess the costs  and benefits of requiring all-cargo carriers to report data on screening  conducted.actions to address it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS and TSA Have Experienced Difficulties Establishing Acquisition Program Baselines, Schedules, and Cost Estimates for Checked Baggage Screening Systems", "paragraphs": ["TSA\u2019s Electronic Baggage Screening Program (EBSP) reports that 76  percent of the airports (337 of 446) the agency regulates for security have  a mix of in-line and stand-alone baggage screening configurations that  best meet airport needs (i.e., optimal systems).

We recommended two actions that DHS and  TSA could take to address these concerns, with which DHS concurred.", "Vetting foreign flight student applicants. Under AFSP, foreign  nationals seeking flight training in the United States undergo a TSA  security threat assessment before receiving flight training to determine  whether each applicant is a security threat to the United States.  According to TSA officials, when a foreign national applies to AFSP to  obtain flight training, TSA uses information submitted by the foreign  national\u2014such as name, date of birth, and passport information\u2014to  conduct a criminal history records check, a review of the Terrorist  Screening Database, and a review of the Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s TECS system. According to TSA officials, most foreign  nationals taking training from a U.S. flight training provider will apply for a  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airman certificate (pilot\u2019s license)  once their flight training is completed. Information obtained by FAA as  part of this application for certification is placed in the airmen registry.  From January 2006 through September 2011, 25,599 foreign nationals  had applied for FAA airman certificates, indicating they had completed  flight training. However, TSA computerized matching of FAA data  determined that some known number of foreign nationals did not match  with those in TSA\u2019s database, raising questions as to whether they had  been vetted.", "Since 2009, TSA has vetted all new and existing FAA airman certificate  holders against the Terrorist Screening Database on an ongoing basis,  which would include the foreign nationals identified through TSA\u2019s  analysis. However, this vetting does not occur until after the foreign  national has obtained flight training. Thus, foreign nationals obtaining  flight training with the intent to do harm\u2014such as three of the pilots and  leaders of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks\u2014could have already  obtained the training needed to operate an aircraft before they received  any type of vetting. We recommended that TSA take steps to identify  any instances where foreign nationals receive FAA airman certificates  without first undergoing a TSA security threat assessment and examine  those instances so that TSA can identify the reasons for these  occurrences and strengthen controls to prevent future occurrences. DHS  concurred with this recommendation and stated that TSA signed a  memorandum of understanding with FAA in February 2012 to help  address this issue. The memorandum outlines a process for FAA to  provide certain data from its airmen registry on a monthly basis and  authorizes TSA to use the data to ensure flight training providers are  providing TSA with information to conduct background checks prior to  flight instruction. This is an important step toward addressing the first part  of our recommendation, provided that TSA uses the data to identify  instances where foreign nationals receive FAA airman certificates without  first undergoing a TSA security threat assessment, identifies reasons for  these occurrences, and strengthens controls to prevent future  occurrences, as we recommended.", "Identifying flight students entering the country illegally. We also  reported that AFSP is not designed to determine whether a foreign flight  student entered the country legally; thus, a foreign national can be  approved for training through AFSP after entering the country illegally. A  March 2010 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)  investigation of a flight school led to the arrest of six such foreign  nationals, including one who had a commercial pilot\u2019s license. As a result,  TSA and ICE jointly worked on vetting names of foreign students against  immigration databases, but had not specified desired outcomes and time  frames, or assigned individuals with responsibility for fully instituting the  program as of July 2012. Thus, this weakness still exists today. Having a  road map, with steps and time frames, and assigning individuals the  responsibility for fully instituting a pilot program could help TSA and ICE  better identify and prevent potential risk. We recommended that TSA and  ICE develop a plan, with time frames, and assign individuals with  responsibility and accountability for assessing the results of their pilot  program to check TSA AFSP data against information DHS has on  applicants\u2019 admissibility status to help detect and identify violations by  foreign flight students, and institute that pilot program if it is found to be  effective. DHS concurred and stated that TSA will prepare a plan by  December 2012 to assess the results of the pilot program with ICE to  determine the lawful status of the active AFSP population.
